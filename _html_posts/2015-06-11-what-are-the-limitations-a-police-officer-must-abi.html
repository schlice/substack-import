<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Not all departments use the same terminology, so not<br>everyone will know what a \"5150 hold\" is. You\'re asking about a<br>\"psych hold,\" or what we commonly call \"emergency hospitalization for<br>evaluation\" (EHE).\<br>\<br>Every state is different, and has different standards. The police in<br>that state know the rules for that state. [[Here\'s a<br>breakdown](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ec1b8f&url=http://treatmentadvocacycenter.org/storage/documents/Emergency_Hospitalization_for_Evaluation.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="treatmentadvocacycenter.org"}]{.qlink_container} of the<br>rules by state.\<br>\<br>Basically, in most states, if a police officer or other \"intervening<br>official\" sees someone whom he reasonably believes has a mental defect<br>or deficiency, and that person is deemed to be a potential threat to<br>himself/herself or to others, the intervening official can place the<br>person into custody or cause the person to be placed into custody, and<br>have that person treated by a mental health professional for (usually)<br>72 hours.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
