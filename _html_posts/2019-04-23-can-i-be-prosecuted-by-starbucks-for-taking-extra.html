If you're taking more<br>condiments then you can reasonably use in your current visit to a<br>restaurant, that's theft. There's no equivocating, there's no<br>excuses, it's theft.<br><br>But we lie to ourselves, don't we? I know what you're thinking, it's<br>only condiments, right? They cost next to nothing, and if the restaurant<br>didn't want us to take them, they wouldn't put them out, right?<br><br>Except those are just the lies we tell ourselves to justify our theft.<br><br>While each individual sugar packet is cheap, they're not free. And<br>custom sugar like sugar-in-the-raw is more expensive per packet than<br>regular white table sugar (where white sugar might be less than a penny<br>a packet (\$0.006/packet at last calculation), sugar-in-the-raw will run<br>about \$0.02/packet). Again, while this doesn't seem like much, it's<br>still 1% of your \$2 coffee. What if someone told you they were going to<br>take 1% of your pay? Yes, it's only a little bit, but you'd still be<br>upset. And considering that when you steal extra packets, the additional<br>cost is passed on to customers, or usually taken out of employee's pay.<br>And you can guess which employees will see their pay reduced because of<br>increased overhead. Certainly not the managers or the executives.<br><br>Restaurants expect people to use as many condiments as they like, but<br>just for that visit. The condiments are there for you to use during that<br>visit only, not to use during that visit *and* re-stock your sugar bowl<br>at home. Will they prosecute you? Probably not. The worst that would<br>likely happen to you is, assuming you're caught, the store would ask you<br>to leave and not come back. Continued violation of that particular rule<br>(coming back when you were asked not to) would be treated as trespassing<br>and the police would be contacted.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
