<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In most cases, a crime can be prevented with a handgun ***without anyone<br>firing a single shot.* Just the mere presence** of a handgun is<br>oftentimes enough to stop a crime before it occurs.<br><br>A bulletproof vest only works if you're wearing it, and if someone<br>shoots at you. Therefore, the mere presence of a bulletproof vest does<br>not routinely prevent a crime from happening.<br><br>Therefore, the two items being compared (a bulletproof vest and a<br>handgun) are not equal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
