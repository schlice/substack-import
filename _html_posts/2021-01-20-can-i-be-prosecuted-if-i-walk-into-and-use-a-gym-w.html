<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can I be prosecuted if I walk into (and use) a gym where I'm not a<br>member, if the staff don't notice what I'm doing?**<br><br>You qualified your crime with "if the staff don't notice what I'm<br>doing." So you're trying to say *it's only a crime if you get caught,*<br>right?<br><br>Well technically, that's not true. It's a crime, whether or not you get<br>caught.<br><br>The crimes include trespassing and theft of service. Trespassing would<br>be for being present on private property without permission, and theft<br>of service would be using the gym for which you did not pay the<br>appropriate fee to use.<br><br>You did ask if you can be prosecuted if the staff didn't notice what you<br>were doing. So you're trying to claim that if you do get caught, you<br>can't be prosecuted because the staff didn't detect your presence or<br>your theft. However, the definition of the crime does not include<br>detection by the staff.<br><br>In other words, it's still a crime, even if the staff doesn't see you.<br>If evidence is produced that you did what you were accused of doing, you<br>can still be prosecuted, even if the staff didn't notice what you were<br>doing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
