<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Does the Fourth Amendment apply to technology<br><br>Absolutely.<br><br>**\W\ould the government be able to track us without the Fourth<br>Amendment?**<br><br>Much more easily than they can now. Without the 4th Amendment, they<br>could surreptitiously attach a GPS tracker to your car and find out<br>everywhere you went and how long you were there. They could potentially<br>hack your phone and install spyware to listen in on your calls or<br>monitor your social media, just waiting for you to break a law.<br><br>The 4th Amendment flips that entire narrative on its head:<br><br>> *The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,<br>> papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall<br>> not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,<br>> supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the<br>> place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.*<br><br>Now, the police have to have probable cause that a crime has been, or<br>will be, committed, and then they can get a warrant to do a specific<br>search, which may involve technology.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
