<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is the FBI being allowed to interview anyone for the Kavanaugh<br>investigation or is Trump and/or the Senate putting limits on it?**<br><br>The answer is yes and no.<br><br>When the original announcement was made regarding the new investigation,<br>the announcement simply said that it was going to be a "supplemental<br>background investigation, limited in scope and duration." We were told<br>that it was limited to this issue (not his entire childhood or all of<br>the other things that are reviewed during a background investigation)<br>and that the FBI would have a maximum of one week to accomplish it.<br><br>Beyond that, no other limits have been placed on the FBI. They can<br>feel free to question *anyone* in relation to this issue, but they are<br>limited to this sexual assault issue in this high school timeframe. So<br>if an interviewee says, "I don't know of Brett ever assaulting a woman<br>or attending a party with Dr. Ford, but boy was he a binge drinker and<br>he was the Beer Pong National Champion," they will most likely not<br>follow the path of "binge drinker," since is is only tangentially<br>related to the issue they are investigating. On the other hand, if an<br>interviewee says, under oath, "Brett got so drunk that I saw him fall<br>all over this one girl, but then the next day he couldn't even remember<br>that happening," they may start to proceed down that line of questioning<br>with others (i.e. he would get so drunk that he would assault women and<br>have no recollection of it), as it is directly related to allegations of<br>sexual assault.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
