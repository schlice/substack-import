<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>That one verse is part of a larger work: a letter, a psalm, a recorded<br>series of events. Bible scholars and theologians would look at the work<br>as a whole and prayerfully determine whether or not it was divinely<br>inspired.<br><br>If they found that the work was divinely inspired, it is reasonable to<br>infer that all of the verses in that particular work are all inspired.<br>It doesn't make logical sense that parts of a particular letter were<br>inspired and other parts were not. If the author was inspired by the<br>Holy Spirit, then the entire work was inspired.<br><br>Remember, the Bible is made up of 66 different books, written by about<br>40 different authors, in three languages, on three different continents,<br>across the span of 1500 years. But yet, they all contain the same<br>message, they never contradict each other, and they contain no errors of<br>historical fact. Human effort simply cannot produce such precision; only<br>the supernatural can do that.<br><br>So if *you* want to determine if a verse in the Bible is inspired, you<br>can look to see if there is agreement with what that verse says across<br>the Bible. What did other authors in other parts of the Bible say about<br>that verse? Does the verse also quote history, because if it does, it<br>must be historically accurate. And finally, does the theme of the verse<br>comport with the message of the Bible?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
