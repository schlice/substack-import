<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: yes.<br><br>Longer answer: Benign MS is characterized by a single symptom or a group<br>of symptoms followed by a very long period of no disease activity<br>whatsoever. You can't really say that you have benign MS unless you've<br>gone at least fifteen years with virtually no visible symptoms, and<br>little to no disability.<br><br>Bear in mind:<br><br>- A diagnosis of benign MS does not mean that you will always be<br>  symptom-free. A *history* of no disease activity does not guarantee a<br>  *future* of no disease activity.<br>- MRIs can still show that the disease is actually progressing but not<br>  producing any visible symptoms.<br>- You can still have some issues like MS Lassitude (fatigue) or memory<br>  issues even if you don't have any motor function-related symptoms<br>  (weakness, balance, bowel/bladder, etc).<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it possible for a person to have benign multiple sclerosis for 27<br>years with no change to their walking?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
