<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [To be inclusive (since each state can change the rules and<br>add them into their statutes), I\'ll give you the LEOBOR from the<br>Fraternal Order of Police:\<br>]<br><br>- Law enforcement officers, except when on duty or acting in an official<br>  capacity, have the right to engage in political activity or run for<br>  elective office.<br>- Law enforcement officers shall, if disciplinary action is expected, be<br>  notified of the investigation, the nature of the alleged violation,<br>  and be notified of the outcome of the investigation and the<br>  recommendations made to superiors by the investigators.<br>- Questioning of a law enforcement officer should be conducted for a<br>  reasonable length of time and preferably while the officer is on duty<br>  unless exigent circumstances apply.<br>- Questioning of the law enforcement officer should take place at the<br>  offices of those conducting the investigation or at the place where<br>  the officer reports to work, unless the officer consents to another<br>  location.<br>- Law enforcement officers will be questioned by a single investigator,<br>  and he or she shall be informed of the name, rank, and command of the<br>  officer conducting the investigation.<br>- Law enforcement officers under investigation are entitled to have<br>  counsel or any other individual of their choice present at the<br>  interrogation.<br>- Law enforcement officers cannot be threatened, harassed, or promised<br>  rewards to induce the answering of any question.<br>- Law enforcement officers are entitled to a hearing, with notification<br>  in advance of the date, access to transcripts, and other relevant<br>  documents and evidence generated by the hearing and to representation<br>  by counsel or another non-attorney representative at the hearing.<br>- Law enforcement officers shall have the opportunity to comment in<br>  writing on any adverse materials placed in his or her personnel file.<br><br>These rules came about because of two Supreme Court cases: *Garrity v.<br>New Jersey* (1967) and *Gardner v. Broderick* (1968). In both of these<br>cases, officers were threatened with losing their jobs if they did not<br>self-incriminate. In *Garrity*, the officer was properly Mirandized<br>(meaning they had the right to remain silent), but was then told that if<br>he did not cooperate, he would be fired. He did self-incriminate and was<br>then charged. In *Gardner*, the officer refused to self-incriminate, and<br>was fired. The court in *Garrity* ruled that \"\\...\ policemen, like<br>teachers and lawyers, are not relegated to a watered-down version of<br>constitutional rights.\"\<br>\<br>Can you explain why you think that \"questioning an officer for a<br>reasonable length of time, preferably while on duty\" and \"being able<br>to request that negative information be removed from their personnel<br>files after two years\" are disingenuous?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
