<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Does Professor Pollard believe this of the flu vaccine also?<br><br>We already do this for influenza; it doesn't seem like a big stretch to<br>add COVID-19 to the same protocol. An annual COVID shot, right alongside<br>your annual flu shot. We try to catch as many of the seasonal strains as<br>we can, otherwise we get sick.<br><br>As a person who was fully vaccinated and still got COVID and recovered,<br>that's exactly what it's going to look like. You'll either get the shot<br>or not, and if you were exposed to the strain for which you got the<br>shot, you won't get sick that year. Or you'll get sick, you'll be off<br>your feet for a week, and then you'll be back to normal, like most other<br>healthy people.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Prof. Andrew Pollard said that it\'s not sustainable or affordable to<br>keep rolling out boosters and vaccines. What will we do to stay safe<br>when the booster wares off?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
