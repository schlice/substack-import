<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's be clear: **The law does not protect firearms manufacturers from<br>product liability lawsuits.** That statement is patently false.<br><br>As most of the other answers here have stated, anti-gun groups attempted<br>to sue firearms manufacturers during *the exact opposite* of product<br>liability cases. They attempted to sue firearms manufacturers when their<br>product worked *exactly as designed*. The firearm worked properly and<br>did not injure the user. Yet people still sought to sue firearms<br>manufacturers when their products killed people, as if that was not the<br>intention of the person using the firearm.<br><br>Could you see the shooter in such a circumstance? "Wha? I thought this<br>was a lighter!"<br><br>The idea behind the anti-gun groups' logic was that if we can't change<br>the Constitution, we'll just sue gun manufacturers every time their<br>product is used to kill someone, even if the lawsuit has no merit. You<br>may not know this, but it costs *a lot of money* to defend yourself<br>against a lawsuit, even if the suit has no merit. If they do it enough,<br>they can bankrupt a company.<br><br>To combat this predatory practice of lawsuits, Congress passed the<br>*Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act* (PLCAA). This law<br>protects gun manufacturers from unlawful, predatory lawsuits designed to<br>bankrupt companies out of existence, even when there is no product<br>liability. Gun manufacturers can still be sued for product liability, if<br>their product malfunctions and injures the user.<br><br>But let's be clear here. Guns are designed to kill. Suing the<br>manufacturer when a product works as designed is not a proper use of the<br>legal system.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
