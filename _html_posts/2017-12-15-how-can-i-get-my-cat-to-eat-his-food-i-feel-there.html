<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Cats are either very private eaters, or they will only eat with you<br>around.<br><br>*Wait, what?*<br><br>Cats, on the whole, will eat on their own schedule. They don't eat like<br>dogs normally do (drop the bowl of food and before you have the chance<br>to look away, it's gone and she's licking the bowl). Cats are usually<br>very self-regulating when it comes to food. Put their food down, and it<br>may take them a day to eat it, especially if it's dry food. Cats will<br>routinely *graze* on their dry food throughout the day (and night ---<br>don't ever leave your cat with no food at night or they tend to wake you<br>up in the absolute middle of the night to refill it). I have heard of<br>some cats who eat their food like dogs do (they'd eat the whole bag of<br>food in one shot if you let them), but on the whole, most cats will<br>self-regulate when it comes to dry food.<br><br>That said, I've never seen a cat try to self-regulate with wet food.<br>That moist stuff usually disappears pretty quickly. Although they tend<br>to eat somewhat slower than dogs, cats generally eat all of their wet<br>food right away.<br><br>Also, some cats will only eat when they are completely by themselves, or<br>they will only eat with you around. It was a feral cat thing to do to<br>have one cat eating and the others standing guard. So if the cat<br>considers you his (or hers), he may only eat when you're there to watch<br>out for him. This is usually only an issue if there are multiple animals<br>in the household. Usually, solo cats (when they are the only pet) don't<br>exhibit this trait in the home.<br><br>(By the way, if you've ever noticed that your cat only uses the litter<br>box while you're cleaning it, the reasoning is exactly the same. Be<br>proud, your cat trusts you enough to protect him while he poops!)<br><br>So if you're worried about your cat not eating, try feeding wet food<br>instead of dry. You can usually find a variety of wet food that is<br>exactly the same food you are currently feeding, so there should be<br>little digestive upset in introducing the wet variety of the same food.<br>Note I said "little," in some cats there can be some sensitivity even<br>when switching between the same dry and wet foods.<br><br>On the dry food, as long as the cat eats the dry food on his or her<br>schedule and isn't losing weight, you shouldn't need to worry.<br><br>However, if your cat stops eating altogether (even if you give wet food<br>or things the cat would eat right away like boiled chicken or fish, or<br>even cat treats), this may be a cause for concern. Contact your vet if<br>you believe your cat may have stopped eating. It may be as simple as a<br>mouth issue making it painful to eat, but it may be something more<br>severe. If your cat is continually losing weight, contact your vet right<br>away.<br><br>By the way, easy way to weigh your cat at home: pick up your cat and get<br>on your bathroom scale. Once you get a reading, get off the scale, drop<br>your cat and get right back on. Subtract the two numbers and you've got<br>your cat's weight.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
