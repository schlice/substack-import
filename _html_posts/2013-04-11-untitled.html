<br/><br/>Answer Comment<br/><br/><br/>Content: [You would have higher-pressure air in your lungs compared<br/>to the air pressure outside your lungs. When the plane depressurizes,<br/>you make a grunting sound, kinda like getting hit in the gut with a<br/>basketball but without the pain. You exhale without exhaling. Remember<br/>that your lungs work like balloons and they draw in air when your<br/>diaphragm moves down increasing the size of the chest cavity, causing a<br/>negative pressure in the lungs and causing air to enter and inflate the<br/>lungs. So the ability to breathe is very dependent on the ambient air<br/>pressure and an equalization of pressure between the air in your lungs<br/>and the air outside of your body.\<br/>\<br/>If you rapidly decrease the pressure of the surrounding air, your lungs<br/>now contain higher pressure air than your surroundings, and will be<br/>wanting to escape, involuntarily if necessary. You\'d have to hold your<br/>breath and grab your nose in order to keep that air in, and you\'d then<br/>risk other injury, such as a ruptured eardrum.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Answer:<br/>https://www.quora.com/If-I-am-flying-in-a-plane-with-a-baby-on-my-lap-not-on-a-seat-and-the-plane-depressurizes-will-the-baby-have-an-oxygen-mask-for-himself-or-will-I-have-to-share-mine/answer/Bill-Stein<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
