<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are medications available which work with progressive forms of the<br>disease.<br><br>But these medicines are more useful in controlling progression of the<br>disease. They don't restore functionality. For people with SPMS who are<br>still having relapses, medication may help. But if your SPMS just gets<br>progressively worse, the approved medications probably won't help.<br><br>For someone like you who is immobile (assuming you don't have relapses),<br>you might think about trying something that's not yet approved in the<br>US: HSCT.<br><br>Let's start with the disclaimer: HSCT is NOT APPROVED by the FDA to<br>treat MS, but the drugs and the procedures used in HSCT are already<br>approved for other diseases. You must be aware that HSCT a DANGEROUS<br>treatment, and it is EXPENSIVE. The reason why it is not yet approved is<br>because we don't yet have the results from well-controlled clinical<br>studies. However, some are ongoing.<br><br>Essentially, HSCT (Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant) attempts to<br>"reboot" the immune system by destroying it and then rebuilding it from<br>scratch. In HSCT, hematopoietic (blood cell-producing) stem cells are<br>collected and stored prior to treatment. Then, chemotherapy drugs are<br>used to destroy nearly all of the bone marrow in your bones, essentially<br>depleting the entire immune system. Then the stem cells are<br>re-introduced into the body and make their way into the bone marrow and,<br>over time, rebuild the immune system.<br><br>As I mentioned, trials are ongoing. They are happening now across the<br>US, Canada, Europe, and elsewhere. As an example:<br><br>> • A multicenter phase 3 clinical trial of HSCT ("BEAT-MS") began in<br>> 2020 in Cleveland, Seattle and up to 19 sites across the country. This<br>> study is now recruiting participants nationwide. The Society has been<br>> engaged with the team conducting the trial and is helping with<br>> recruitment.

The trial is testing treatment with<br>> HSCT compared with alemtuzumab in people with active<br>> relapsing-remitting MS.

According to<br>> Northwestern, Dr. Burt will be going on a planned research sabbatical<br>> at the end of 2019.\[1\](#nsHqA){#cite-nsHqA .citation_link}<br><br>You may be able to get yourself enrolled in a trial, or find HSCT<br>treatment outside of the US. Just Google "hsct secondary progressive ms"<br>and you'll get some good results.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-nsHqA){.citation_index} [[Bone Marrow Stem Cell Transplant<br>--<br>HSCT](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=118598&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Research/Research-News-Progress/Stem-Cells-in-MS/Bone-Marrow-Stem-Cell-Transplant-%25E2%2580%2593-HSCT){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
