<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [This article says so.\<br>\<br>[[Hate Parking Tickets? Fixed Fights Them In Court For<br>You](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3f6fef&url=http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/15/fight-parking-ticket-fixed){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="techcrunch.com"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>\<br>According to this article, Fixed is a company that will fight tickets<br>for you. It\'s a San-Francisco startup, and apparently they are using<br>the \"logic\" that says that parking rules are so convoluted that you<br>can very easily be issued an erroneous ticket.\<br>\<br>The article also says that it\'s entirely possible that the city council<br>could kill a business like Fixed by simply saying that only you or your<br>lawyer can appeal your parking ticket.\<br>\<br>Since parking tickets in big cities are handled by a parking authority<br>and not the courts, unless you fail to pay your tickets, your case<br>doesn\'t go in front of a judge. Your request for appeal goes in front<br>of a parking authority employee.\<br>\<br>Most locations don\'t have big-city issues like San Francisco where<br>parking is handled by a parking authority. Smaller towns have parking<br>handled by the local police, and they\'re not going to be as lenient as<br>a clerk at the parking authority.\<br>\<br>Additionally, you can really only get away with saying \"I didn\'t know<br>I couldn\'t park there\" only once. After that, they\'re going to stop<br>granting your requests for dismissal of your ticket.\<br>\<br>[[Appealing a parking ticket carries a 50-50<br>shot](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bf8c33&url=http://www.thehour.com/news/norwalk/appealing-a-parking-ticket-carries-a---shot/article_d5592ba0-b79b-5623-98d4-4aac7263fb3d.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="thehour.com"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>\<br>I don\'t see the business taking off. It has a very self-limiting<br>market, and repeat customers won\'t get their tickets expunged so the<br>company will get nothing for all its effort. Business model doesn\'t<br>work, IMHO. If I was in VC, I\'d walk away from this<br>one.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
