<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Yes, TDoS can be considered a crime under a US law called<br>the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 USC ยง 1030).\<br>\<br>This specific issue (overloading a telephone system causing denial of<br>service) was raised in the 6th Circuit in 2011 in the case [[*Pulte<br>Homes, Inc. v. Laborers' International Union of North<br>America*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c969ed&url=http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/11a0200p-06.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="uscourts.gov"}]{.qlink_container}, 648 F.3d 295 (6th Cir.<br>2011). In it, representatives from LIUNA reportedly\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> clogged access to Pulte's voicemail system, prevented its customers<br>> from reaching its sales offices and representatives, and even forced<br>> one Pulte employee to turn off her business cell phone. The e-mails<br>> wreaked more havoc: they overloaded Pulte's system, which limits the<br>> number of e-mails in inbox; and this, in turn, stalled normal business<br>> operations because Pulte's employees could not access business-related<br>> e-mails or send e-mails to customers and vendors.\<br><br>\<br>But, you say, CFAA is targeted at \"computer systems,\" and was<br>originally written to combat DDoS attacks against websites. Making it<br>qualify against phone systems is a stretch, right? Well, as you probably<br>already know, circuit courts are very flexible, and they do make the<br>stretch:\<br>\<br><br>> Under the CFAA, "any impairment to the integrity or availability of<br>> data, a program, a system, or information" qualifies as "damage."<br>> Because the statute includes no definition of three key<br>> terms--"impairment," "integrity," and "availability"--we look to the<br>> ordinary meaning of these words. "Impairment" means a "deterioration"<br>> or an "injurious lessening or weakening." The definition of<br>> "integrity" includes an "uncorrupted condition," an "original perfect<br>> state," and "soundness." And "availability" is the "capability of<br>> being employed or made use of." **Applying these ordinary usages, we<br>> conclude that a transmission that weakens a sound computer system--or,<br>> similarly, one that diminishes a Plaintiff's ability to use data or a<br>> system--causes damage.**"<br><br>\<br>They don\'t call it a phone system, they call it a \"sound computer<br>system.\" So once you re-classify a telephony system as a \"sound<br>computer system,\" it qualifies under CFAA.\<br>\<br>Therefore, under Federal law, TDoS is a crime under CFAA.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
