<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think that there are two ways to look at this question: purely<br>physiologically, and in the context of modern United States society. I<br>think what you're hinting at with your question is that it's normal to<br>find an underage teenage girl sexually desirable. "Normalcy," however,<br>is not determined purely by physiological responses, but must be placed<br>into context of "normal" society. Normal society places age restrictions<br>on mating because below a specific age, it is generally recognized that<br>the decision-making centers in the brain are not mature enough to fully<br>understand a subject as fraught with nuance and potential circumstances<br>such as intercourse. Therefore, trying to "divest" the two and say that<br>it's perfectly "normal" to feel that an underage woman is sexually<br>desirable is not a valid question, since normalcy is determined by<br>societal norms, not just pure physiology.<br><br>So let's go back to the beginning of my answer and do exactly what I was<br>just saying you can't do: separate the physiological response, and the<br>societal norms of modern society. To address the question from the<br>purely physiological standpoint, attraction is a physiological function<br>which draws us to mate with women who can produce children. Visually, we<br>are drawn to fully-formed proportionally-correct females so that we can<br>ensure when we mate, we have the highest chance of producing a baby:<br>full hips, fully-formed breasts, normal adult height, normal adult<br>physique, normal adult weight, etc. When a woman meets those criteria,<br>she is more-than-likely able to create children. In fact, these days,<br>women are more likely to be able to create children *before* they<br>reach full adult physiological maturity, but the maturity creates the<br>attraction to ensure that when the physical maturity is present, the<br>woman is able to reproduce.<br><br>Now, we must add the norms of society. We recognized *long* ago that<br>the urge to procreate does not take mental factors into account.<br>*Physical* maturity does not indicate *mental* maturity. Mental maturity<br>often follows physical maturity by a number of years. And mental<br>maturity is variable; one person may be psychologically ready to handle<br>the responsibility of sexuality and child rearing, while others of that<br>age are not. Society, therefore, ever concerned with concrete numbers,<br>set a threshold age at which most people (men and women) should be<br>sufficiently mature enough to handle adult relationships and child<br>rearing.<br><br>Therefore, as a society, considering we are *smarter* than our<br>Neanderthal ancestors, we recognize our physical urgings for what they<br>are, and we don't follow our urgings further.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
