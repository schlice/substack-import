<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I answered a similar question already:<br><br>[[Bill Stein\'s answer to Can one get arrested for being nude in one's<br>backyard?](https://www.quora.com//Can-one-get-arrested-for-being-nude-in-one-s-backyard/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>In short, it depends on what state you're in. And in most cases, it's<br>not related to where you physically are (in your backyard, or in your<br>house in front of an open window), but it's more related to the laws on<br>indecent exposure, which vary from state to state.<br><br>In some states, like New Jersey, you can be cited for indecent exposure<br>if you are in an area which can reasonably be seen by someone who didn't<br>consent to look at what they are seeing. In others, like Colorado, the<br>exposure must be sexually-related in order to be charged with indecent<br>exposure. You either have to be having sex, or exposing yourself in a<br>sexually explicit manner (i.e. touching yourself explicitly). Simply<br>"being naked" where you can be seen by someone else does not constitute<br>indecent exposure there.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it legal in the USA to be nude in your home or backyard & openly<br>visible to anyone outside (blinds open, bright lights, sliding glass<br>doors, etc.)?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
