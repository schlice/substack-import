<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you're wondering whether it's time, you probably are out of time.<br><br>In nearly every jurisdiction, there is a *statute of limitations* to<br>bring a legal action against a government official. In other words,<br>regardless of your claim, you have a limited amount of time to bring an<br>action against a public official for civil rights violations. So that<br>time has probably already expired.<br><br>But even if it hasn't, the police are protected by ***qualified<br>immunity*** for official actions they take as part of their duties. The<br>Sheriff is an elected official and has state-mandated duties that he<br>must perform. He cannot be sued for taking part in those activities.<br><br>And even if he is successfully sued, the result is a fine, not prison<br>time. You would have to accuse him of committing a crime, and to do<br>that, you need the help of a lawyer. And if you're asking people on<br>Quora for advice, it's unlikely you have an attorney.<br><br>So the chance that the Sheriff in Knoxville (the Knox County Sheriff)<br>will be arrested and put in prison lies somewhere between slim and none.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
