<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm going to focus my answer on the US. What other countries do is up to<br>them.<br><br>There's a lot of mistrust, as well as outright sheep-like devotion, to<br>what the top scientists in public policy are saying. There are<br>scientists all over the debate: some think the vaccines are useless, and<br>others think the vaccines work like vaccines.<br><br>The point is, we don't really know. But the facts so far are telling us<br>that the vaccines work like vaccines, and for the ***vast majority of<br>the population***, if you're vaccinated, it's unlikely you'll contract<br>the disease.<br><br>Putting the science aside for the moment, look at what is happening, and<br>what those actions are telling us. The government is pushing a massive<br>ad campaign to get people vaccinated. There has to be a reason that they<br>are doing this. At the same time, policymakers are relaxing mask<br>mandates across the country.<br><br>So, we are pushing a massive vaccine campaign, and relaxing mask<br>mandates. The only reason that these two facts can co-exist is because<br>the government believes (as I do) that vaccines work.<br><br>So why are vaccinated people so hesitant to remove their masks? Why are<br>they so fearful? The virus is not as deadly as the media makes it out to<br>be. Hospitalizations for COVID infections are 2.6 per 100,000 for adults<br>as of this writing. That is a shockingly low number. COVID cases among<br>adolescents are down by 84% and hospitalizations are down 69% since<br>January.<br><br>Why is that? Vaccinations of adults.<br><br>The grand takeaway: Vaccines work.<br><br>So, here's the money shot, the \$64,000 question: **If vaccines work,<br>why do we still have mask mandates? If masks work, why don't they? If<br>vaccines work, why don't they?** Because *if a fully vaccinated person<br>can transmit a disease to another fully vaccinated person, then vaccines<br>don't work.*<br><br>Besides, "transmitting a virus" when neither person gets the virus means<br>NOTHING. That virus will not be able to multiply or infect the host,<br>so it dies. Period. That's science.<br><br>The only people at risk are the unvaccinated.<br><br>However, here's the kicker: that's on them.<br><br>It's not as if there is a massive shortage of vaccines. Heck, [[the US<br>government is buying vaccines to give away to other<br>countries.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=933212&url=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/09/us-is-in-discussions-with-moderna-on-buying-covid-vaccine-doses-for-other-nations.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cnbc.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>In nearly all cases, the vaccine is free. It's available everywhere, and<br>it's available to everyone.<br><br>So if you don't get it, that decision is on you.<br><br>Now, the next point can't fail to come off as heartless or uncaring, but<br>I'm going to say it anyway: that's not my problem.<br><br>Don't put your refusal to get the vaccine on me. Don't make your refusal<br>to get the vaccine into my problem. You have no right to do that. Your<br>refusal to get the vaccine is on you. You assume the risk of<br>participating in society without the vaccine.<br><br>Look, I get it. Some people can't get the vaccine. Those people should<br>either remain double-masked, or stay home. That's the reality of some<br>peoples' conditions that doesn't allow them to be vaccinated. Hopefully<br>they have good support systems to help them, and there is a fully formed<br>supply chain that can get them everything they may need delivered to<br>their door.<br><br>**But if you choose to not get the vaccine for whatever reason, you also<br>choose to take on the consequences of that choice.** One of the<br>consequences may be contracting COVID-19.<br><br>The bottom line: if you choose to participate in society, you choose to<br>accept certain risks. One of those risks is that you may contract any<br>number of diseases from exposure to carriers who may be asymptomatic.<br>Not just with COVID, but with any number of other diseases. There is no<br>malice here. That's not anyone's fault. Viruses are indiscriminate; they<br>will spread everywhere and infect wherever they have the ability. Just a<br>few years ago, we had a smallpox outbreak in the US because a group of<br>people chose to participate in society without being vaccinated against<br>smallpox. Vaccines work if you let them.<br><br>I'm fully vaccinated, but could I still contract COVID-19? I guess it's<br>possible, even though the risk is vastly reduced. And if I do, then<br>that's on me. It's no one else's fault that I was infected. It's not my<br>fault either. Viruses don't care who they infect. There is no blame,<br>there is no fault. It just is. I choose to participate in society; I<br>accept the risk. I accept the risk that someone will play themselves off<br>as being fully vaccinated and will be shedding virus around me. I accept<br>the risk that a fully masked person may also shed virus and I could<br>inhale some. I probably already have at some point. But I personally<br>accept that risk because I personally choose to participate in society<br>at large.<br><br>What I steadfastly refuse to do is accept the blame for *someone<br>else's choices*. In other words, I don't wear a mask to reduce *your*<br>risk. I wear a mask to reduce *my* risk. If you refuse to get<br>vaccinated, I don't have to change my life to accommodate your choices.<br>It's up to you to change your life to accommodate your choices. It's not<br>up to me to change my life to accommodate them.<br><br>I accept my risk, you accept yours.<br><br>That's the very nature of a free society.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**What is your opinion of the CDC relaxed facemask rule of fully<br>vaccinated people don\'t have to wear masks indoors and outdoors? Do you<br>trust people to follow the guidelines or will you still wear a mask?**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
