<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It sounds like you're asking whether or not it's okay if you missed the<br>light but then slowed down as soon as you noticed the light. Perhaps<br>you're asking whether or not it's okay to *start* slowing down after you<br>pass the light.<br><br>In either case, according to most vehicle and traffic laws in the United<br>States, you are required to slow down *before* you enter the school<br>zone. Once you enter the school zone, you should already be at the<br>prescribed speed (usually 20 mph).<br><br>Whether or not you will be ticketed is up to the officer stopping you.<br>If he saw that you were slowing down, he might give you a warning, but<br>school zones are the number one area where "children vs car" accidents<br>occur, and cracking down on speeding in those areas is a top priority<br>for law enforcement. I personally wouldn't expect much leniency, even if<br>you did finally notice and start slowing down.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
