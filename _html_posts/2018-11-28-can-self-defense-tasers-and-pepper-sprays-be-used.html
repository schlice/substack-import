<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can self-defense tasers and pepper sprays be used against in a<br>non-lethal but physical threat? What about the defensive display of a<br>firearm or a warning shot?**<br><br>I'll go through each of these, in order. This applies to the vast<br>majority of US states, but not all. It would be challenging to go<br>through each state's laws, so I am providing a general summary for the<br>US. In other words, your mileage may vary, check your states laws, this<br>is not a law brief, and I am not your lawyer.<br><br>Non-lethal but physical threat: In most states, this is not a thing.<br>A threat is not classified by its lethality. It is classified based on<br>*your perception* as to whether or not the threat poses a risk to your<br>life, or is a risk that could cause you grave bodily injury. This is<br>injury that could result in the permanent loss of a bodily function or<br>use of an appendage. For example, if you get hit so hard in the face<br>that your orbital socket is broken, you risk losing your eyesight in<br>that eye. This would be considered "grave bodily injury."<br><br>Threats of death or grave bodily injury almost universally can be met<br>with any level of force you choose, up to and including lethal force.<br><br>But we're talking about non-lethal force and whether or not it can be<br>used. Again, whether or not you can carry and/or use any of these tools<br>is entirely up to the state you are in. As I said before, check your<br>local and state laws before you carry a pepper spray, a civilian Taser,<br>or a firearm.<br><br>Pepper spray: In the vast majority of states, pepper spray can be<br>carried and used against any kind of physical threat. Remember that it<br>is a *defensive* tool and cannot be used *offensively*. It cannot be<br>used as a "preemptive first strike" tool, either. It is a defensive tool<br>only.<br><br>Tasers: In the majority of states (but not all), Tasers are not<br>considered lethal weapons and do not require permits to carry. The law<br>is much more fuzzy on the carry of Tasers than it is on the carry of<br>pepper spray. Taser International has a [[great<br>chart](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=188a95&url=https://buy.taser.com/pages/state-requirements){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="taser.com"}]{.qlink_container} on their website which shows<br>the state of carry laws for Tasers across the country.<br><br>The Taser is *extremely effective* against physical threats. In many<br>cases, you can set the Taser to continuously cycle so that you can put<br>it down, let it keep doing its thing, and you can get away. The idea<br>here is that you would deploy the Taser, set it for continuous cycling,<br>put it down, and proceed immediately to the nearest police station. You<br>should also know that if you file a police report indicating you did<br>this, and you send a copy of the report to Taser, they will send you a<br>replacement unit (assuming you bought the original unit from Taser).<br><br>Firearms: As you are probably aware, carry laws and concealment laws<br>are much tighter for firearms than they are for Tasers or pepper spray.<br>In almost all states, you need a permit to conceal a firearm. In many<br>states, you need a permit to openly carry a firearm, and in some states,<br>you cannot do either. This is an area where you *must* check your local<br>laws before proceeding. A quick stop at your local firearms store will<br>net you all the information you need on carry laws and what you need to<br>do in order to stay legal.<br><br>- Defensive Display: Defensive display of a firearm occurs many<br>  times a year in the United States, and thwarts most criminal activity<br>  without a shot ever being fired. Accurate statistics about how often<br>  this occurs are not available, as in most cases, the crime was stopped<br>  before it started, so the police were not contacted. You should also<br>  know that there is a fine line between "defensive display" and<br>  "brandishing a firearm." Most states do not have "defensive display"<br>  or "defensive draw" laws, and in most cases, displaying your firearm<br>  in this way in most states constitutes *you* committing an assault.<br>  However, if you were in fear for your life, or in fear of grave bodily<br>  harm (as the question states), it's highly unlikely that you would be<br>  charged for your assault, as it was in self-defense, and it probably<br>  wouldn't be a "criminal assault." Especially if you simply gripped<br>  your firearm, displayed your grip, but it remained in the holster. In<br>  many states, this would obviate a "brandishing" charge, but not the<br>  assault. Depending on the state, you could be charged with criminal<br>  menacing, but again, you have a defense.<br>- Warning shots: *NEVER, NEVER, NEVER DO THIS.* When you take<br>  firearms classes, you'll learn that you only actually fire your weapon<br>  to neutralize a threat. You don't fire your weapon to "send a signal"<br>  unless you're lost in the wilderness and you're calling for help. The<br>  mere mention of warning shots tells me that you need some firearms<br>  training before you even think about carrying a firearm in public. If<br>  "defensive display" can get you in a world of trouble, imagine just<br>  how much more trouble you can get into for firing your weapon at<br>  something that was *not* your intended target.\<br>  \<br>  Just scrub that idea from your mind right now. No warning shots. No,<br>  no, no, no.<br><br>This was not an exhaustive list, and it is not applicable across all<br>states. All states vary in their laws, and your mileage may vary, check<br>your state laws before proceeding, and please be safe.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer**:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
