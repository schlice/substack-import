<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(Note that labor laws are different in every state, so some things here<br>may vary by state. Only a labor lawyer in your area will know for sure<br>what laws cover you.)*<br><br>In an "at-will" employment situation, your employer can fire you at any<br>time, and you can quit at any time.<br><br>That said, your employer cannot fire you for a prohibited reason (i.e.<br>you failed to break the law).<br><br>Additionally, hourly employees cannot work off the clock. If you are<br>ever forced to work off the clock, you can file a complaint with the US<br>Department of Labor and receive up to three years in back pay for time<br>you were required to work after you have clocked out. Employers<br>sometimes (mistakenly) say things like "this isn't work, it's pre-work"<br>or "post-work". This is an error on your employer's part. All work an<br>hourly employee does must be on the clock or you can receive it in back<br>pay. You can hire an attorney to help you file for back pay.<br><br>Your employer cannot force you to work off the clock, and they<br>cannot legally fire you for failing to do so.<br><br>The trick is that when they fire you, they don't have to give you a<br>reason in "at-will" employment. They can simply say that your employment<br>is no longer needed. If they don't tell you that they fired you because<br>you wouldn't work for free, you don't have much leg to stand on.<br><br>If they tell you that you're fired because you wouldn't work for free,<br>this is what would be considered "unlawful termination." Of course, even<br>if they did, your only recourse is to hire an attorney and to sue them.<br>But you just got fired, so how are you going to afford an attorney? Neat<br>Catch-22, isn't it?<br><br>By the way, employers know this. They know that the odds you're going to<br>sue them for unlawful termination are slim, so they take the chance.<br><br>*(EDIT) I had an incorrect understanding of voluntarily working for free<br>and the Fair Labor Standards Act.
