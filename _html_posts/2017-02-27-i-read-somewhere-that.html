<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No.<br><br>Rights are exactly that. They are the opposite of privileges in that<br>they do not require action of any kind in order to gain them.<br><br>Rights are granted based on membership in a group. Human rights are<br>granted because of membership in a particular group: the human race.<br>Therefore, human rights are universal to all humans simply by *being<br>human*.<br><br>Privileges, on the other hand, are *granted* by an entity, be that a<br>government or a company (i.e. the privilege to drive granted by the<br>state, or the privilege to enter a club based on membership). You<br>absolutely can be required to pay something or own something in order to<br>be granted a privilege.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
