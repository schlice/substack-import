<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>(US answer only)<br><br>Not really, but as this is a legal question, the answer really is "it<br>depends."<br><br>The statement "you are an asshole" is an *opinion*. Opinions cannot be<br>construed as fact, so you cannot legally be lying about someone by<br>calling them an asshole. You certainly can't be found guilty of slander<br>or libel.<br><br>What you *can* potentially be charged with would be *harassment* if you<br>call someone an asshole so many times that the behavior is considered to<br>be<br><br>- Targeting someone<br>- With behavior meant to alarm, annoy, torment, or terrorize, *and*<br>- Creating reasonable fear in the victim for their safety or the safety<br>  of their family or property<br><br>Otherwise, just telling someone they're an asshole is just an opinion.<br>You can't be sued for expressing your opinion.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can you be sued and found guilty of anything, if you tell someone \"You<br>are an ass hole\" in an email context?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
