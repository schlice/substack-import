<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, it's extremely expensive and difficult to own assault<br>rifles. The Army classifies an "assault rifle" as one which is<br>select-fire, which means it can fire one shot at a time, or multiple<br>shots with one trigger pull. The last time I used one of those, I was<br>Active Duty. Civilians have to have a special Federal permit, pay a lot<br>of money (since no "new" assault rifles can be registered to civilians),<br>and then follow oppressive state regulations on top of that. So we<br>already do have a *de facto* ban on assault rifles.<br><br>I think what you are trying to do is ban "assault weapons," which is a<br>made-up category of firearm classified by its cosmetic features. We had<br>an assault weapons ban for ten years until it expired. And we did fight<br>back: we proved that the ban did nothing to stop crime, and we allowed<br>the ban to expire.<br><br>So here's a fun exercise: which one of these weapons is an assault<br>weapon?<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-881c344769bf051b33e8683a9f3b365d){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-881c344769bf051b33e8683a9f3b365d" master_w="498"<br>master_h="270"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>If you said B, according to the law, you'd be right. B is a weapon which<br>would have been classified as illegal under the Assault Weapons Ban.<br><br>But you want to know a little secret? They're the same weapon. This<br>is a Ruger 10/22. They both shoot 22LR, they both have a 10 round<br>capacity, they are both semi-automatic (which means one pull, one shot).<br>The difference? Cosmetic. One has a wood stock, the other has a black<br>composite stock. One has a vicious pistol grip and a vertical foregrip,<br>which makes bullets move faster I guess. One has a collapsible stock,<br>which makes everything so much more dangerous.<br><br>So wanna ban assault weapons like this again? Sure, fine, go ahead.<br>Certainly won't hurt me. I'll just use A instead of B, and I won't be<br>deterred in the slightest. Certainly won't stop any mass shootings. You<br>can just use A instead of B.<br><br>See, Democrats like to pass laws that feel good. Doesn't it feel<br>good to get those *evil-looking assault weapons* off of the streets?<br>Sure it does, but it doesn't actually help the situation you were trying<br>to help. Republicans are more concerned with passing laws that actually<br>do good. Pass *meaningful* laws, instead of passing laws for the<br>sake of passing laws.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
