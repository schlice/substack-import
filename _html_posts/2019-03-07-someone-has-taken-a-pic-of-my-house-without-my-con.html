<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it illegal to take pictures of someone's house?<br><br>*(US-specific answer)*<br><br>The answer very greatly depends on local laws in place for that area.<br>You may be in compliance with Federal law and be violating a state law<br>or a city ordinance where you are, so please take this answer with a<br>good pinch of salt. Always check the laws where you are before you find<br>yourself on the wrong side of one.<br><br>In the United States, in general, the rule of thumb is **if you can see<br>it, you can snap it**.<br><br>This rule does not apply in all areas and in all buildings (especially<br>federal buildings and military installations), so for now, I'll just<br>focus on residences.<br><br>This is always a good rule of thumb for residences: if you can stand on<br>the sidewalk and see the residence, in general you can take a picture of<br>it. If you can't see the residence from a public access way (such as a<br>sidewalk or a street), you can't breach barriers on someone's property<br>in order to take pictures. For example, if there is a row of tall hedges<br>blocking the view from the street or the sidewalk, you can't push your<br>way through the hedges and take a picture.<br><br>However, drones change all that. From the street, if drone flying is<br>allowed in that area, you can fly a drone straight up and look over<br>hedges to get a picture. You cannot fly over the person's property to<br>get a picture, but you can fly over the street or the sidewalk, straight<br>up, and get a picture.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
