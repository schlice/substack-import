<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the best place on the body to shoot a gunman, attempting a<br>home invasion, to simply disable him without creating a life-threatening<br>wound?**<br><br>Herein lies the problem.<br><br>You want to use deadly force and attempt to use it in a<br>predictably less-than-lethal capacity.<br><br>In most cases, this is not possible. Guns do not cause death every time<br>they are used, but they *can*. A shot in the leg can hit the femoral<br>artery and the person can bleed out before an ambulance can arrive. Any<br>wound with a firearm can be deadly. There is no place you can shoot<br>someone which is guaranteed to not cause death.<br><br>If you employ deadly force, it is because you have the right to do so.<br>You are in a situation which calls for deadly force (i.e. you are in<br>fear for your life or the life of someone else).<br><br>*Employing deadly force implies that someone may die.*<br><br>If you are not prepared to accept that fact, do not carry an implement<br>of deadly force on your person, and do not employ one.<br><br>There is also a legal complication: attempting to use deadly force in a<br>situation which did not call for the application of deadly force may<br>imply that you *did not* have the legal right to use deadly force, in<br>which case you become the aggressor employing more force than you<br>were allowed to employ, in which case you get arrested.<br><br>Let me say it again: ***employing deadly force implies that someone may<br>die.*** If you are not prepared for that (and you are not in a situation<br>which warrants the application of deadly force), do not carry deadly<br>force.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
