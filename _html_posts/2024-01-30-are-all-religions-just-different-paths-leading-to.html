<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's certainly a common belief, one that appeals very strongly to the<br>broadly tolerant American mind.<br><br>Many people say it is unreasonable to believe that only one religion<br>could be exclusively true. If one religion were really true, it would<br>mean that billions of religious people from every other religious faith<br>are wrong today and have been wrong throughout the centuries. And that's<br>a big problem if Christianity is true because Christianity seems to<br>teach that non-Christians are going to hell. There's also the not<br>unfounded fear that those who think they have the truth will be<br>intolerant of those who won't accept it.<br><br>Easygoing Americans are more apt to believe that no religion is *the*<br>truth. This sentiment is often illustrated by the favorite parable of<br>many university professors: the parable of the six blind men and the<br>elephant. This is where each blind man feels a different part of the<br>elephant and therefore reaches a different conclusion about the object<br>in front of him. One grabs the tusk and says, "This is a spear!" Another<br>feels the trunk and says, "This is a snake!" The one hugging the leg<br>claims, "This is a tree!" The blind man holding the tail thinks, "I have<br>a rope!" The one feeling the ear believes, "This is a fan!" And the one<br>leaning on the elephant's side is certain, "This is a wall!" These blind<br>men are said to represent world religions because they each come to a<br>different conclusion about what they are sensing. Like each blind man,<br>we are told, no one religion has *the* truth. Religions are simply<br>different paths up the same mountain.<br><br>This kind of thinking is, simply put, untrue.<br><br>Primarily because truth exists, and that which is contrary to truth<br>is false. So if religions teach contrary things, then they can't both be<br>true. While most religions have some beliefs that are true, not all<br>religious beliefs can be true because they are mutually exclusive---they<br>teach opposites. In other words, some religious beliefs must be wrong.<br>But you're not supposed to say that in America today. You're supposed to<br>be "tolerant" of all religious beliefs. And in our culture today,<br>tolerance no longer means to put up with something you believe to be<br>false (after all, you don't tolerate things you agree with). Tolerance<br>now means that you're supposed to accept every belief as true! In a<br>religious context, this is known as religious pluralism---the belief<br>that all religions are true.<br><br>\<br><br>There are a number of problems with this new definition of tolerance.<br><br>First, we should be thankful that we have religious freedom in this<br>country. We are well aware of the dangers of religious intolerance and<br>believe that we should accept and respect people who have different<br>religious beliefs. But that doesn't mean that personally we ought to<br>embrace the impossible notion that all religious beliefs are true. Since<br>mutually exclusive religious beliefs cannot be true, it makes no sense<br>to pretend that they are. In fact, on an individual level it can be<br>dangerous to do so. If Christianity is true, then it's dangerous to your<br>eternal destiny not to be a Christian. Likewise, if Islam is true, then<br>it's dangerous to your eternal destiny not to be a Muslim.<br><br>Second, the claim that "you ought not question someone's religious<br>beliefs" is itself a religious belief for pluralists. But this belief is<br>just as exclusive and "intolerant" as any religious belief of a<br>Christian or Muslim. In other words, pluralists think all non-pluralist<br>beliefs are wrong. So pluralists are just as dogmatic and closed-minded<br>as anyone else making truth claims in the public square. And they want<br>everyone who disagrees with them to see things their way.<br><br>Third, the prohibition against questioning religious beliefs is also an<br>absolute moral position. Why shouldn't we question religious beliefs?<br>Would it be immoral to do so? And if so, by whose standard? Do<br>pluralists have any good reasons supporting their belief that we ought<br>not question religious beliefs, or is it just their own personal opinion<br>that they want to impose on the rest of us? Unless they can give us good<br>reasons for such a moral standard, why should we allow them to impose it<br>on us? And why are pluralists trying to impose that moral position on us<br>anyway? That's not very "tolerant" of them.<br><br>Fourth, the Bible commands Christians to question religious beliefs<br>(e.g., Deut. 13:1-5; 1 John 4:1; Gal. 1:8; 2 Cor. 11:13; etc.). Since<br>Christians have a religious belief that they ought to question religious<br>beliefs, then pluralists---according to their own standard---should<br>accept this Christian belief as well. But of course they do not.<br>Ironically, pluralists---advocates of the new tolerance---are not really<br>tolerant at all. They only "tolerate" those who already agree with them,<br>which by anyone's definition is not tolerance.<br><br>Fifth, the pluralist's claim that we ought not question religious<br>beliefs is a derivative of the false cultural prohibition against making<br>judgments. The prohibition against judging is false because it fails to<br>meet its own standard: "you ought not judge" is itself a judgment!<br>Pluralists also misinterpret Jesus' comments on judging (Matt. 7:1-5).<br>Jesus did not prohibit judging as such, only judging hypocritically.<br>Indeed, everyone---the pluralist, the Christian, the atheist, the<br>agnostic---makes judgments. So the issue isn't whether or not we make<br>judgments, but whether or not we make the *right* judgments.<br><br>Finally, are pluralists ready to accept as true the religious beliefs of<br>Muslim terrorists---especially when those beliefs say that all<br>non-Muslims (including pluralists) should be killed? Are they ready to<br>accept as true the religious beliefs of those who believe in child<br>sacrifice or other heinous acts?<br><br>\<br><br>While we should respect the rights of others to believe what they want,<br>we are foolish, and maybe even *unloving*, to tacitly accept every<br>religious belief as true. Why is this unloving? Because if Christianity<br>is true, then it would be unloving to suggest to anyone that their<br>opposing religious beliefs are true as well. Affirming such error might<br>keep them on the road to damnation. Instead, if Christianity is true, we<br>ought to kindly tell them the truth because only the truth can set them<br>free.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
