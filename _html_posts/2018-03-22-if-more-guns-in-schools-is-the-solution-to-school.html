<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If more guns in schools is the solution to school shootings, why<br>didn\'t the armed officer at the school in MD deter the shooter or even<br>stop him? The shooter knew there was an armed office there and he still<br>brought in a gun and shot two people.**<br><br>I know this is higher-level thinking, but perhaps the security guard was<br>not charged with "checking everyone's bags for weapons."<br><br>This case illustrates one piece of "defense in depth." The armed officer<br>turned this incident from another mass shooting into a single crazy guy<br>in a school who injured two people and then died. The difference? The<br>armed officer. The armed officer ended this situation.<br><br>But it sounds like you're asking why this was a situation at all.<br><br>Because the rest of the defense in depth strategy was not implemented.<br><br>- How many entrances were there that students could enter the school<br>  unchecked?<br>- Where were the magnetometers (metal detectors)?<br>- Where were the X-ray machines to check bags for weapons?<br>- Has a security plan been developed?<br>- Has the school practiced lockdown drills? (note: most have by now)<br>- Has the school practiced active shooter drills with the local police?<br><br>We can effectively keep guns out of courthouses, government buildings,<br>and airports. It's therefore easy and well known how to keep guns out of<br>schools. If "stopping school shootings" is a priority, then this is how<br>you do it.<br><br>So clearly, they implemented one piece (the armed guard) but they were<br>not interested in completely stopping school shootings, or they didn't<br>have the money yet for the magnetometer and the X-ray machine. There's a<br>piece of legislation moving through Congress that will provide money to<br>schools to increase security. Hopefully, schools will implement some of<br>this security.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
