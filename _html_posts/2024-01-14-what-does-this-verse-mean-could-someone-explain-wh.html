<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I want to key you in to a really great reference. It's a website by the<br>makers of<br>[GotQuestions.org(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e4ff7d&url=http://GotQuestions.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container} called<br>[BibleRef.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=167de6&url=https://www.bibleref.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}. You put in a verse and it<br>gives you a synopsis of that verse.<br><br>For example, when you enter [[Psalm<br>8:4](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=18e1ce&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/8/Psalm-8-4.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}, it says:<br><br>> When David scanned the night sky, he felt insignificant and wondered<br>> why such a magnificent Creator would care about man. The Hebrew for<br>> \"man\" in this verse is actually the term *enos*, subtly different<br>> from the term *ā\'dām* typically used to refer to mankind. *Enos*<br>> signifies the individual person, while \"the son of man\" refers to<br>> people in general. The emphasis here is on the individual human as a<br>> \"weak, mortal man.\"<br>><br>> God has shown His care of humans in several ways. He created our first<br>> parents only after He had created a world that was ready for them. The<br>> sun, moon, and stars provided light for them, the plants were a food<br>> source, the climate was ideal for sustaining life, and Adam and Eve<br>> enjoyed their life together on a paradise. In addition to providing a<br>> suitable environment for humans, God showed His love and care by<br>> giving His Son as our Redeemer. [[John<br>> 3:16](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=645b3b&url=https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container} emphasizes the extent of<br>> God\'s love for us by giving His only begotten Son so we would receive<br>> everlasting life by believing on Him.<br>><br>> Also, God shows His care of us by providing our daily needs and by<br>> inviting us to talk to Him about all our concerns ([[Matthew<br>> 6:33](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=dc8321&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/6/Matthew-6-33.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}; [[Hebrews<br>> 4:14--16](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1d22d2&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-14.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br><br>And when you hit the right-arrow to move to [[Psalm<br>8:5](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e30a3e&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/8/Psalm-8-5.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}, it says:<br><br>> In this verse David reflects on God\'s creation of man. He views man<br>> as having been created a little lower than the heavenly beings, the<br>> angels. [[Hebrews<br>> 2:9](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=99c8c2&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-9.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container} applies [[Psalm<br>> 8:5](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e30a3e&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/8/Psalm-8-5.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container} to Jesus. Although He<br>> created the heavenly beings, Jesus chose to become a man in order to<br>> die in the place of sinful man. None of the angels could serve as our<br>> substitute and die in our place. Angels do not experience humanity,<br>> but Jesus did. Angels are not human, but Jesus lived as a man. Only by<br>> becoming human could He serve as a sacrifice for humanity ([[Hebrews<br>> 2:11](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a16b74&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-11.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br>><br>> By willingly terminating His life on the cross Jesus paid the penalty<br>> for the sins of all who put their faith in Him, past, present, and<br>> future. On the cross, Jesus cried out, \"It is finished\" ([[John<br>> 19:30](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8e8d05&url=https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-30.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}). The Greek for this<br>> expression is *tetelestai*, meaning, \"it stands finished,\" or \"it<br>> is paid.\" Jesus\' substitutionary death was sufficient payment for<br>> all time for the sins of humanity. Our salvation could not be<br>> purchased for anything less than Jesus\' blood, and nothing more than<br>> His blood is required ([[1 Peter<br>> 1:18--19](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=be8e18&url=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Peter/1/1-Peter-1-18.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br><br>What an excellent exegetical resource for believers to use to reference!<br>I can't recommend it highly enough.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
