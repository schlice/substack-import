<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What do you think about California eliminating cash bail or cash<br>bonds? Should this be enacted all over the country?**<br><br>This is what happens when social justice takes over for common sense.<br><br>This initiative was done to promote "fairness" between the rich and the<br>poor. Instead of "bail reform," they opted for "bail removal" instead.<br>Now, instead of assigning bail, a defendant is assigned a "Low,"<br>"Medium," or "High" risk for flight, and incarceration before trial is<br>determined.<br><br>So now, instead of a wide range of bail amounts which could be set<br>depending on the defendant's ability to pay, you've been reduced to<br>three categories, and your incarceration is entirely dependent on that.<br><br>So on the plus side, it's not unfair any more. If you're rich or if<br>you're poor, no one will get bail. So that's fair.<br><br>On the minus side, the entire pre-trial incarceration process is now<br>100% paid for by California's taxpayers, a burden they don't need to be<br>taking on right now.<br><br>Additionally, since it is now up to a judge to determine whether or not<br>someone will be incarcerated pre-trial, it opens the door for *more*<br>abuse by judges who impart their own biases into the proceedings.<br><br>It will lead to increasing amounts of incarceration of people who<br>previously would have posted bail, overcrowding jails even further.<br><br>So California has traded a toothache for a headache. But hey, if the<br>SJWs are happy, California is happy.<br><br>Whether or not any other states should do this is up to each state. I<br>think the voters in each state will certainly decide for themselves.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
