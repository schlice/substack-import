<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer is no.<br><br>If there is no report to the police, the District Attorney has not made<br>a case against the person. If there is no case, the judge has no basis<br>to issue a bench warrant against which the person should appear in his<br>courtroom. If there is no reason for the person to be summoned to the<br>court, there is no reason for the judge to issue a warrant.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
