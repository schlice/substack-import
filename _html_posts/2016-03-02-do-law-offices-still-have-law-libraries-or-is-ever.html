<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When we enter the academy, we are given a paper copy of the Colorado<br>Revised Statutes. Attached to the inside of the back cover is a CD that<br>allows you to read all the statutes on a PC.<br><br>So I went to Lexis-Nexis and bought an electronic copy of the Colorado<br>Revised Statutes in PDF format, which sits on my iPad. Very rarely do I<br>open the book any more.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
