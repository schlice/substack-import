<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Constitution doesn\'t make law. The Constitution binds the<br>government, and keeps them in their lane.<br><br>That said, the Bill of Rights lists some common rights that the<br>government might abridge. So you may be asking if it violates any of<br>your rights for a restaurant to only serve you if you have a vaccine<br>card.<br><br>The answer in the US is no, it does not violate your rights.<br><br>Restaurants, although it is commonly misconstrued, are not public<br>establishments. They are private establishments which are open to the<br>public. There is a distinct difference.<br><br>A private establishment open to the public can set whatever rules it<br>wants to for those who would come in. There are some obvious things that<br>a restaurant cannot discriminate by, and those would be things that are<br>specified in the Equal Rights Act. These are things like race, color,<br>gender, religion, or country of origin.<br><br>But if a restaurant wanted to discriminate based on vaccine card, as<br>long as they applied that restriction equally to every patron, they are<br>certainly allowed to do that.<br><br>Similarly, states and cities (like New York City) can set their own<br>rules for how restaurants in their state or city operate, so setting the<br>rule that restaurants must only admit patrons who are vaccinated is also<br>legal and not unconstitutional.<br><br>(EDIT) In the same way, states can set rules for their businesses which<br>require them to *not* deny patrons based on vaccination status. In fact,<br>Florida has done just this: no business in the state of Florida can deny<br>entry to a patron based on vaccination status. In fact, the state has<br>begun the process of fining businesses \$5000 each for doing this:<br><br>[https://www.theepochtimes.com/mk\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=41d636&url=https://www.theepochtimes.com/mkt_breakingnews/florida-to-start-fining-businesses-5000-for-violations-of-vaccine-passport-ban_3980029.html?utm_source%3Dnewsnoe%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dbreaking-2021-09-03-1%26mktids%3De32ebb2fa993559f4080f94f1955a74b%26est%3DnCMflwEfSAi88M%252Fa96LhuYkFjBGL7372U6%252BWJpgPKU5%252BSzVdfLoIwImrkURzL9w1NHeV6MDm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="theepochtimes.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Note that this doesn't apply to healthcare facilities, and it also<br>doesn't apply to businesses which may impose vaccine mandates on their<br>employees.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it against the constitution to require restaurants to only serve<br>people with a vaccine passport in the United States?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
