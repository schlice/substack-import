<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Close.<br><br>At Jesus' death, we were *redeemed*. We had already been forgiven. God<br>forgives unconditionally. He forgives and He forgets. Jeremiah 31:34<br>says, "I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no<br>more.". This verse is echoed in Hebrews 8:12 because Jesus fulfills this<br>promise.<br><br>The problem with people is that they withhold forgiveness. God never<br>withholds forgiveness. God forgives and forgets. Jesus death and<br>resurrection redeems us, but we were already forgiven.<br><br>If we would forgive half as fast as God forgives us, the world would be<br>a much better place.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
