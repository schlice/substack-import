<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Extremely unlikely.<br><br>There aren't any states attempting to challenge the precedent set by<br>*Obergefell.* What we do see is that states have strengthened their<br>religious and conscience rights, and have made it so that the individual<br>cannot be *compelled* to marry a same-sex couple.<br><br>This could come to a head if someone is forced, in violation of their<br>conscience or religion, to perform a same-sex marriage ceremony (so<br>either a religious organization or, more likely, a government official<br>like a county clerk). The former is an easy 1st Amendment issue, so is<br>unlikely to make it back up to the SCOTUS. The latter, however, in terms<br>of conscience protections, would likely see states doing even more to<br>either protect the conscience of the individual, or to protect the<br>rights of the same-sex couple.<br><br>But *Obergefell* was not like *Roe* in that it was not decided on the<br>basis of poor jurisprudence. *Roe* was decided on a right which does not<br>exist in the Constitution, which left it ripe for overturn. *Obergefell*<br>suffers no such poor basis: it was decided based on the Due Process<br>clause and the Equal Protection clause of the 14th Amendment, not based<br>on a vapid "right to privacy" like *Roe*. It is a solid legal precedent<br>and is unlikely to be overturned any time soon.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How likely is Obergefell v.
