Please keep it in the original bottle with<br>the prescription label on it. Some specialty medication (like pre-filled<br>syringes) comes with a prescription card. In any case, keep it all<br>together.<br><br>Please try to keep over-the-counter medications you wish to carry on<br>board in its original packaging if at all possible (i.e. in its original<br>bottle or box). Medications in baggies could be questionable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
