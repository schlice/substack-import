<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What's the difference between an executive order and a national<br>emergency?**<br><br>They are overlapping insofar as a national emergency is declared by<br>using an Executive Order.<br><br>An Executive Order (EO) is an order written by the President directing<br>operations of a Federal agency. He can change policy, create new<br>policies, rescind policies, and direct other activities of Federal<br>agencies, as long as those changes are consistent with Federal law and<br>the limits imposed on the President by the Constitution. Basically, the<br>President is the CEO of the Executive Branch Company, and he can make<br>new rules for his departments to follow whenever he chooses.<br><br>A "national emergency" is a function spelled out by the [[National<br>Emergencies<br>Act](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eaf2df&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Emergencies_Act){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}<br>]{.qlink_container}which was passed by Congress in 1976. It clearly<br>defines the powers the President is allowed to invoke by declaring a<br>national emergency, provides structure and procedure around what he has<br>to do when doing so, and provides a framework for Federal law to define<br>what those powers are. To date, there are approximately 470 different<br>provisions of Federal law that a President may invoke by declaring a<br>national emergency. It is declared through an Executive Order.<br><br>There are currently 28 national emergencies which are ongoing. The<br>longest was declared by President Carter in 1978 and is still ongoing<br>today.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
