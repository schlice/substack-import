<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [In 2011, 8583 murders were committed in the United States.<br>That is indeed a sad fact. But over 15,000 people die from alcoholic<br>liver disease in our country every year. The number for "alcohol-induced<br>deaths, excluding accidents and homicides" is over 25,000. According to<br>the Council on Alcoholism & Drug Abuse, almost 16,000 people a year are<br>killed by drunk drivers.\<br>\<br>Let\'s not stop there. A considerable amount of all crime in the United<br>States, not just murders, are a direct result of alcohol abuse. And how<br>many cases of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse occur each year<br>because of alcohol? Would you say that maybe half of the gun crimes in<br>this country potentially involved alcohol?\<br>\<br>Why do you campaign so hard to remove guns from society, yet you ignore<br>the utter blight inflicted on society by alcohol?\<br>\<br>The health benefits of wine were reported in an epidemiological study<br>that showed nothing more than correlation, and as you know, correlation<br>does not equal causation. There was never any causation that showed that<br>drinking wine reduced heart disease or increased overall health in any<br>meaningful way. And because your body has the ability to remove toxins<br>does not make it \"perfectly safe\" to \"intoxicate\" yourself (which<br>literally means to introduce toxins).\<br>\<br>What I\'m trying to say here is that plain reason should show that any<br>attempt to ban firearms should logically be preceeded by a ban on<br>alcohol. Alcohol is far more destructive to people, families, and<br>communities than guns can ever be, and any perceived benefits of alcohol<br>pale in comparison to the massive destruction to society that it has<br>caused. And any objection to such a position can only reasonably come<br>down to, \"but I like alcohol and I hate guns.\"\<br>\<br>My right to own a gun can at least defend me from others who own guns.<br>Can my right to own whiskey do anything to prevent me getting killed by<br>a drunk driver?\<br>\<br>I\'m not trying to deflect. I\'m just trying to show you that your<br>various political viewpoints are contradictory.\<br>\<br>So let me ask again: if you\'re going to ban one of two items, wouldn\'t<br>you ban the one that is more dangerous? Especially when the<br>less-dangerous item is protected by the Constitution?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-are-common-logical-fallacies-in-gun-control-arguments/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
