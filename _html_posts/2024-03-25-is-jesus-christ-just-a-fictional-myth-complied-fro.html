<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What evidence would you accept?<br><br>In order to determine what evidence you will accept, I will ask you your<br>question, but will change one thing. Here you go:<br><br>> ***Is Alexander the Great just a fictional myth complied from others<br>> and the surroundings? Provide evidence!***<br><br>So how would *you* answer that question? What evidence would you provide<br>that *you* would be satisfied with? I'm certain you will be able to<br>produce satisfactory evidence proving Alexander the Great actually<br>existed.<br><br>Now ask yourself: ***Why is that same evidence insufficient for Jesus<br>but it is sufficient for historical figures like Tiberius Caesar, Julius<br>Caesar, and Alexander the Great?***<br><br>I would also submit to you that *the amount of evidence which proves the<br>existence of Jesus of Nazareth is* *greater* *than the amount of<br>evidence we have proving the existence of Tiberius Caesar and Alexander<br>the Great.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
