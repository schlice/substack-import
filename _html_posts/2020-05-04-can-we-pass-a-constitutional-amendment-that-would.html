<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can we pass a constitutional amendment that would allow states to<br>leave the United States of America?**<br><br>People love to throw around the term "Constitutional crisis" like it's<br>confetti. However, this is exactly the type of action that would, in<br>actuality, create a Constitutional crisis.<br><br>While it is possible to craft and ratify an Amendment to the<br>Constitution which would permit a State to secede from the Union,<br>depending on what the requirements for secession look like, the<br>Amendment could cause another Civil War should a state attempt to secede<br>under the authority of that Amendment.<br><br>In the United States, the Supreme Court ruled in *Texas v. White* that<br>unilateral secession is unconstitutional, but that an "indissoluble"<br>union *could be dissolved* by one of two methods: revolution, or<br>*consent of the states*.<br><br>Therefore, an Amendment is really not necessary. A state can secede from<br>the Union if it receives the consent of all of the states. If even<br>one state says no, then the seceding state may not leave.<br><br>The reason?<br><br>When a state became part of the Union, it was clearly stated that this<br>action would be perpetual and indissoluble. The state gained all of the<br>rights of the group, and shouldered all of the responsibilities of being<br>a member of the group. When it comes to decisions related to the group,<br>the whole of the group must now be in agreement.<br><br>For that reason, a state can declare its intent to secede from the<br>Union, but it can only actually do so with the full consent of all of<br>the member states, since they all belong to the same Union. They all<br>joined with the same admonition, and under the same rules. They didn't<br>become separate states part of a loose coalition, but instead became<br>part of an indissoluble union. They all expected that. Each member state<br>has to agree to "lose" the seceding state. They must be unanimous.<br><br>And there are logistical problems. What happens to Federal territories<br>within the state? Do they become foreign embassies? How does the nation<br>get compensated for the loss of National Parks? Or all the Federal<br>dollars we provided in assistance to the state? The tendrils of<br>interconnection between the state and all of the others would be<br>difficult to sort.<br><br>TL;DR: At best, an Amendment could say that a state can declare its<br>intention to leave, but then *all of this* would be up to every other<br>state to approve before it could be completed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
