<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Salvation is instantaneous. To be saved, you have to repent and<br>believe. The Bible tells us how:<br><br>> If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe<br>> in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, **you will be<br>> saved.** For with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and<br>> with the mouth there is confession unto salvation. (Romans 10:9--10)<br><br>The passage shows us how to be saved: repent and believe.<br>Repenting means confessing our sins, and turning away from sin and<br>turning to God. Believing means we must believe in Jesus as our Savior.<br>He died in our place, and shed his blood to obtain forgiveness for our<br>sins.<br><br>Once you do that, the Bible says, you will be saved.<br><br>Okay, cool. You did that, congratulations. *So what's next?* **What do<br>you do once you are saved?**<br><br>The process of *salvation* is instantaneous. But the process of<br>*sanctification* takes a long time, perhaps the rest of your life. How<br>do you do that? What does that sort of life look like? How do you live<br>as a person who has been saved?<br><br>You keep in mind their confession and their turn from sin. You live in a<br>way which makes people question what makes you so happy. I want people<br>to look at me and wonder why I smile all the time. Someday, I'd love for<br>someone to ask me.<br><br>In other words, *if you were put on trial today and accused of being a<br>Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?*<br><br>Also, **learn more about God, learn more about Jesus, and learn more<br>about his life.** Jesus lived a perfect, sinless life, the only person<br>in history to do so. Learning how he did it, and patterning your life<br>after his, should be everyone's goal.<br><br>Finally, serve God by serving others. To serve God is to serve<br>others. It is the greatest form of charity. A person who has been saved<br>should model the life of Christ by serving others.<br><br>> A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so<br>> you must love one another. (John 13:34 NIV)<br><br>Serve your family. Volunteer in your community. Serve your church.<br>Donate clothing. Serve children in need in your community. Or just be a<br>friend to a person in need. There is so much hate and misunderstanding<br>in our communities these days, and there are countless ways you can<br>serve others. Be a light in the darkness (Matthew 5:14).<br><br>Where am I headed now that I have been saved? *Home*, when he is ready<br>to call me home. Until then, I've got a lot to do here.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Where are you headed, now that you got saved?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
