I know their search sucks, but try.<br><br>First, should you be worried? It depends on how revealing the revealing<br>photos are.<br><br>Child pornography is defined as "visual images of sexually explicit<br>conduct involving a minor (someone under 18)." The legal definition of<br>"sexually explicit conduct" does not require that an image depict a<br>child engaging in sexual activity. A picture of a naked child may<br>constitute illegal child pornography if it is sufficiently sexually<br>suggestive. Additionally, the age of consent for sexual activity in a<br>given state is irrelevant; any depiction of a minor under 18 years of<br>age engaging in sexually explicit conduct is illegal.<br><br>In short, if the revealing photos involve nudity, she could face charges<br>for distribution of child pornography, a Federal crime if someone in<br>another state gets hold of the pictures. You're talking [[15 to 30 in<br>Federal<br>prison](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2dbd77&url=https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ceos/citizens-guide-us-federal-law-child-pornography){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="justice.gov"}]{.qlink_container} for a child pornography<br>charge. If she's interested in spending the prime of her life in prison,<br>this is a good way to get there.<br><br>Even if the images are just underwear pictures, or "side-boob" pictures,<br>or other "toeing the line" kind of pictures, and they technically won't<br>land you in jail, once you post a picture on the Internet, it will stay<br>there forever. Future employers do scan social media profiles and do<br>reject applicants who they determine don't meet their standards. Eerily<br>creepy or not, that's what they do. It will be an interesting<br>conversation with her own children why these pictures exist on the<br>Internet.<br><br>I know this all sounds very "doom and gloom," but as a parent, this is<br>the one thing I absolutely took a hard line on with my kids. They would<br>have instantly lost all access to electronics or the Internet had they<br>done any of that. They knew my rule: no dick pics, period. No "send<br>nudes," period. If they wanted to pay for their own devices and risk the<br>jail time, that's on them, but on my devices that I pay for, that stuff<br>does not happen, period. That kind of thing just didn't become a<br>priority for them, because I restricted it. Don't worry, they found<br>plenty of other things to get them in trouble. Just not this.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
