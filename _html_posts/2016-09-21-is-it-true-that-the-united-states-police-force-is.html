<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, as the other commenters have mentioned, "serve and protect" is a<br>motto, it is not a listing of required duties.<br><br>Second, the police provide for the safety of the general public; they do<br>not have any legal obligation to protect any one person, unless a<br>"special relationship" exists, such as when you are in custody, or when<br>prior arrangements have been made.<br><br>Remember that the 14th Amendment prevents the government from depriving<br>a person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. That<br>clause does not place an affirmative duty on the government to protect<br>or defend the life, liberty, or property of private citizens from<br>anyone. In general, the Due Process clause does not provide an<br>affirmative right to government assistance, even in a situation in which<br>the government itself may not deprive the individual of that right.<br>Also, there have been several cases which highlight the fact that police<br>have a general duty to protect, but no specific duty to protect one<br>private person from another.<br><br>There is an exception under which the police may develop a duty to<br>protect, and may be held liable if they fail to do so. The theory is<br>called the "state-created danger" theory. This is related to whether or<br>not the police left an individual in a situation that was more dangerous<br>than the one in which they found him, by creating a danger which did not<br>exist before, or by making a situation more dangerous. At least three<br>circuit courts have established tests to see if the state-created danger<br>theory passes muster. For example, the Third Circuit requires the<br>plaintiff to show that (1) the harm ultimately caused was foreseeable<br>and fairly direct, (2) the police or other state actor willfully<br>disregarded the plaintiff\'s safety, (3) there existed some relationship<br>between the state and the plaintiff, and (4) the police or other state<br>actors used their authority to create an opportunity that otherwise<br>would not have existed for the third party\'s crime to occur. The Sixth<br>Circuit requires the plaintiff to show that (1) the state acted<br>affirmatively to create or increase the risk that the plaintiff would be<br>harmed by a third party, (2) the state\'s actions placed the plaintiff,<br>not the general public, at risk, and (3) the state knew or should have<br>known that its actions specifically endangered the plaintiff. The Tenth<br>Circuit\'s test requires a plaintiff to demonstrate that (1) the state<br>actor created the danger or increased the plaintiff\'s vulnerability to<br>the danger in some way, (2) the plaintiff was a member of a limited and<br>specifically definable group, (3) police or other state actors' conduct<br>put plaintiff at substantial risk of serious, immediate, and proximate<br>harm, (4) the risk was obvious or known, (5) defendant acted recklessly<br>in conscious disregard of that risk, and (6) such conduct, when viewed<br>in total, shocks the conscience.<br><br>(EDIT) I'm not sure that simply citing the relevant law completely<br>answers your question.<br><br>*Can a police officer refuse to do his duty? Is he compelled by law to<br>act?*<br><br>The short answer to that question is that there is no law which compels<br>a police officer to act or to not act. We know that there is no<br>affirmative duty under the law for the police to protect any one person,<br>and unless the police created or increased the danger (see the<br>"state-created danger" test above), the police are not legally required<br>to protect one person from another. Ultimately, the police are part of<br>"law enforcement." Law enforcement is not "law breaking prevention." By<br>definition, law enforcement occurs *after* a law is broken, not before.<br>That doesn't mean if police are present and observing a situation that<br>they cannot step in and prevent a crime from taking place, but that's<br>not their job. They collect evidence, detain suspects, and bring them to<br>the district attorney for formal charges and a trip through the court<br>system.<br><br>Officers also have some flexibility regarding who gets arrested and<br>charged and when those actions take place.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
