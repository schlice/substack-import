<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Now that weed is legal in many states, are people in law enforcement<br>jobs still expected to not have smoked in the last seven years?**<br><br>Absolutely yes.<br><br>First, not all agencies have the same requirements for employment. Seven<br>years since you have last smoked could be the rule for one agency, but<br>not another. There's no "universal" rule surrounding marijuana. Unless<br>you're applying for a *federal* law enforcement position, which is<br>required to follow *federal* law, in which case marijuana is still<br>illegal.<br><br>Second, we need to define our terms a little here. We like to<br>"colloquially" say that "marijuana is legal," but it's actually not. As<br>I just mentioned, it's still illegal at the federal level, and no state<br>law can make it legal. *But, but, it's legal in Colorado! It's legal in<br>Washington state!* Well, it's actually not.<br><br>Would you believe me if I told you that it's actually still illegal in<br>those states?<br><br>*But\...but...but...*<br><br>Now, before you have a brain aneurysm over this, because a state can't<br>make something legal that the federal government has made illegal, what<br>the states *can* do is to remove any penalties for violating the law.<br>States have *decriminalized* possession and use of marijuana. Some<br>states have made it a misdemeanor, and other states (Colorado included)<br>have removed all penalties for possession and/or use of marijuana. There<br>are still laws surrounding it, but the laws for possession or use of<br>marijuana have had all of their penalties removed. State Constitutional<br>amendments have done this, so they're unlikely to change any time soon.<br><br>And just because it's not a punishable crime doesn't mean that an agency<br>can't regulate its use. There is still a lot we don't know about the<br>long-term effects of smoking. We don't know how it affects the brain, or<br>memory, or reflexes, or anything else, over the long term. And for<br>something for which we have such a dearth of actual, scientific<br>knowledge, it's right to still have rules around whether or not you've<br>used it, or possibly used it recently.<br><br>This is even more true for law enforcement officers. Because we have so<br>little precedent on the use of this drug, the scenario could be raised<br>by defense attorneys in court cases that an officer was adversely<br>affected by previous marijuana use and no one would be able to contest<br>that with actual scientific data. Departments are loathe to take those<br>kinds of risks, and that reality is reflected in their hiring practices.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
