<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What do you do if you get fired because they believe you have COVID?<br><br>1.  Get a rapid COVID test.<br>2.  If you are negative, give the company one opportunity to re-hire<br>    you.<br>3.  If they fail to do so, consult with an employment attorney in your<br>    area.<br><br>The company can certainly have you tested, but firing you because they<br>believe you have a virus is not a valid reason to fire someone.<br><br>Despite the "at will" employment status that companies may enjoy, during<br>the pandemic, the Federal government (as well as nearly every state<br>government) has provided protections for employees who may become<br>infected with COVID-19. At worst, the employee would be eligible for<br>emergency FMLA leave (Family and Medical Leave Act) which provides for<br>unpaid leave from work and protects your position.<br><br>Simply firing someone because the employer "believes you have COVID" may<br>place the company at odds with federal labor laws. At worst, you would<br>have been eligible for unpaid leave if you were actually positive.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
