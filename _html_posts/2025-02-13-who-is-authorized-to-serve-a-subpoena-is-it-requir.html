<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with any legal question, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>In most states, the Sheriff or a Sheriff's Deputy can serve subpoenas.<br>Some states include the Coroner as someone who can serve subpoenas<br>(interestingly, as a side note, usually it's only the Coroner who can<br>arrest the Sheriff). And also usually, anyone who is 18 years old or<br>older who is not a party to the case can serve the subpoena. This person<br>is called a process server. Some states require process servers to<br>be licensed or registered with the state or county.<br><br>Many people choose to hire professional process servers, who are<br>experienced in serving legal documents and are knowledgeable about local<br>regulations. While not always mandatory, some states may require process<br>servers to complete a training program or obtain certification.<br><br>- A process server should not have a criminal record, especially<br>  felonies, that could raise questions about their credibility and<br>  integrity.<br>- Some states may require process servers to hold a surety bond or<br>  liability insurance to protect clients and themselves from potential<br>  legal claims.<br>- Beyond that, most states do not require any specific training to be<br>  registered as a process server.<br><br>Here in North Carolina, civil service of process is restricted to the<br>Sheriff, a Sheriff's Deputy, or the County Coroner. However, if the<br>Sheriff's Office returns the process unexecuted, then anyone 21 years or<br>older and not a party to the case, nor related by blood or marriage to<br>any party in the case, can serve the documents.<br><br>Be sure to check with a licensed attorney in your jurisdiction, or check<br>with the clerk of the court where your case is being heard, in order to<br>determine the proper procedure to have documents served.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
