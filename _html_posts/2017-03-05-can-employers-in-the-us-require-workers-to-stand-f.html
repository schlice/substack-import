<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If it was well known at the time of hiring that all employees must stand<br>during the National Anthem, refusing to do so, for whatever reason,<br>could be seen as violating the terms of employment, and be grounds for<br>termination.<br><br>It could be argued, however, that not standing for the National Anthem<br>is a protected form of free speech, also called *free expression.* That<br>may be true, but while you are an employee, on company time, being paid<br>for your work, not following company standards clearly enumerated during<br>the hiring process does not sound like the appropriate time to exercise<br>your rights, especially when that action is contrary to business<br>standards.<br><br>The employer would have more of a leg to stand on (no pun intended) if<br>standing for the Anthem was either part of the corporate culture, or<br>part of the requirements of doing whatever job you do (for example,<br>maybe you work at a baseball stadium, and everyone has always stood for<br>the Anthem, and it\'s clearly written in the employee manual that you<br>will stand for the Anthem), but simply enumerating it as part of the<br>requirements of the job should be enough.<br><br>**TL;DR: if it is in the employee manual, clearly identified during<br>hiring, or part of the job, AND it is not illegal for an employer to<br>make you do it, employers can make whatever standards of conduct they<br>choose for their businesses, and can fire you if you fail to follow<br>those standards.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
