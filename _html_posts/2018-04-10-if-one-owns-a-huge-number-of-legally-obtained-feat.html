<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If I own a huge number of legally obtained feature films (ex,. Disney,<br>classics, foreign films, etc.) on DVD, could I legally create my own<br>streaming service and then charge people to view them? Kind of like a<br>competitor to Netflix. Is this legal?**<br><br>No, this is not legal.<br><br>When you buy a movie, you actually buy the license to watch the movie.<br>The costs of the media you buy are not really relevant, as most media<br>today is distributed in multiple medium (Blu-Ray, digital download,<br>etc).<br><br>You are licensed (when you buy a DVD) for *personal use only*. What you<br>are describing is called *commercial use*, and that is not covered by<br>your license agreement. You may not rebroadcast, retransmit, charge<br>admission for, or otherwise make money from, that movie.<br><br>(EDIT) So how does Netflix work? You may not rebroadcast, retransmit,<br>etc., without a *license* to do so. In order to get a license, you must<br>enter into contract with the license holder. This usually involves<br>paying them *royalties* when their movies are shown. That means they get<br>some remuneration every time the movie is shown, or perhaps they make a<br>fixed amount per month depending on how many users you have on the<br>system. Whatever the contract states, once you have a commercial<br>rebroadcast license, *then* you can start showing the movies from that<br>licensor.<br><br>So if you have a full collection of Disney movies, you'd have to go to<br>Disney and work out a rebroadcaster's license agreement with them, and<br>then you could broadcast Disney's movies. However, it's not likely that<br>they'll grant it, as it would compete with their own service (which they<br>run in conjunction with Fox, Sony, Universal and Warner Brothers),<br>[[Movies<br>Anywhere](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=740740&url=https://moviesanywhere.com/welcome){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="moviesanywhere.com"}]{.qlink_container}. You'd have to make<br>it financially acceptable to them, which will likely be financially<br>unacceptable to you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
