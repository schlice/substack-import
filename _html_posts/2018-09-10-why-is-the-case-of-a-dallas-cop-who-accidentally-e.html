<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is the case of a Dallas cop who accidentally entered a neighbor's<br>house and killed him being presented to a grand jury?**<br><br>For Federal cases, the Fifth Amendment reads, \"No person shall be held<br>to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a<br>presentment or indictment of a grand jury\.\\" At the federal level, a<br>grand jury indictment is required.<br><br>Many states still require a grand jury before a prosecution can move<br>forward. Some states allow filing by information in addition to a grand<br>jury, and still other states have done away with the grand jury<br>altogether. In the past, the grand jury served to screen out malicious<br>or incompetent prosecutions, but ever since we have had official public<br>attorneys acting as prosecutors for the State, the grand jury has been<br>largely irrelevant.<br><br>Texas requires the use of the grand jury.<br><br>Can a district attorney overrule a grand jury's decision?<br><br>It depends on the jurisdiction. In states where grand juries are<br>required, if the grand jury rules "ignoramus" or "not a true bill," the<br>prosecution cannot proceed, and if the grand jury rules "true bill," the<br>case automatically proceeds to trial.<br><br>In Texas, if the grand jury rules "true bill," the case will<br>automatically proceed to trial. The District Attorney cannot override<br>the will of the grand jury.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
