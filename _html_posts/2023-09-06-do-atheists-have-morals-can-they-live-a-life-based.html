<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This seems to be something that trips people up all the time.<br><br>Yes, atheists have morals. Virtually everyone has morals. Our morals are<br>usually developed during our formative years.<br><br>The difference is *the source of our morals*.<br><br>Most people would agree that thieves, murderers, and other criminals are<br>lacking morals. But that's not necessarily true. They certainly have a<br>set of morals, but it is not based on **generally accepted customs of<br>right living in a society.** Usually, it is based on a "natural<br>selection" model: I can do whatever I find acceptable in order to<br>survive, put food in my belly or money in my pocket.<br><br>Atheists would say that their morals are those standards of right and<br>wrong based on **generally accepted customs of right living in a<br>society.**<br><br>Theists would say that their morals are those standards of right and<br>wrong based on **God's rules for our conduct as delivered in the<br>Bible.**<br><br>The difference is that the atheist's morals are derived from the whole<br>of society (which may include theists and their moral code) but the<br>theist derives his morals from God.<br><br>In essence, therefore, *the atheist must borrow from the theist in order<br>to have a moral code. Because out of the whole of society, only theists<br>have a moral code which transcends the whims of humanity.* Only theists<br>have a rock-solid, immovable, unchanging external standard of morality<br>upon which they can have a firm foundation for their morals. It's like<br>building your house on solid rock.<br><br>Without that base, humanity is self-referential, and that's no<br>better than building your house on sand.<br><br>The flow works this way:<br><br>- The theist's moral code is in line with God's rules for us. The theist<br>  alters his or her moral code to fit God's commands for us.<br>- Society's accepted customs of right living are (mostly) in line with<br>  the theist's morals, at least for the big things. This is evidenced by<br>  the fact that you see theists able to live peacefully in society<br>  (currently) without claiming that societal norms are so far outside of<br>  their moral code that they cannot live as members of society.ยน<br>- The atheist *adopts* society's accepted customs of right living as<br>  their morals.<br><br>So clearly, atheists, just like theists, can indeed have a moral code,<br>and they can live a right life by it. The only difference between the<br>two is the ability to ground their morals in some immovable, unchanging<br>standard. They willfully discount the source of their morals because<br>they do not believe in its existence, yet they claim that society's<br>morals are unchanging (which is clearly untrue).<br><br>\<br><br>ยน This is not to say that all of society's "generally accepted customs<br>of right living" are in line with theist's morals. In general, the<br>things which theists find immoral are not things that theists are<br>required to do to live peacefully in ordered society.<br><br>Also. the truth is that *society adopted theist's morals*, but we don't<br>really need to get into that right now<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
