<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I need to make a speech to my mom about how I think that God does not<br>exist. Can you help me by providing evidence to support this claim?**<br><br>No, because you cannot prove the non-existence of something.<br><br>For example, I can tell you that purple eagles exist, and you can tell<br>me that they don\'t. For me to prove they do, I just have to find some<br>evidence that points to the fact that they do or did exist at some time.<br>For you to prove that they don\'t, or never did, you literally have to<br>be able to visit all places at all times to show that there were no<br>purple eagles there. Clearly, it is impossible to prove that something<br>never existed or does not exist.<br><br>Your best bet is to take another angle. Show that he doesn\'t exist by<br>trying to argue that the description of God doesn\'t match reality. For<br>example, if God is infinitely merciful, then why does he allow<br>suffering? If God is all-powerful, why did he have to send his son to<br>Earth as a man? Why doesn\'t he simply reveal himself to the world now,<br>instead of having us suffer through all these false religions and<br>atheists if they are all wrong?<br><br>(By the way, there are excellent answers to all of these questions<br>already; I\'m just giving you the best options you can to try to make<br>your case)<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
