<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should law enforcement be able to issue speeding tickets based on<br>mobile or car GPS data?**<br><br>Issuing speeding tickets based on vehicle GPS data would require a lot<br>of things we don't currently have:<br><br>- All cars would have to record GPS speed all the time. The driver would<br>  have to be unable to turn it off.<br>- The data would have to be proven to be accurate, or at least as<br>  accurate as current speed recording devices like RADAR and LIDAR.<br>- It would have to be proven that the data can't be *altered* by the<br>  operator, and even if it could, such a practice would have to be made<br>  illegal (like the difficulty and illegality in changing your car's<br>  odometer)<br>- The speed history of the vehicle would need to be instantly accessible<br>  wirelessly to any officer at any time, when they stop a vehicle they<br>  think is speeding.<br>- After I typed the last bullet, I was thinking about how an officer<br>  would establish reasonable suspicion to stop a vehicle if the vehicle<br>  has the speed and not the officer. To that end, the vehicle would have<br>  to continually broadcast its GPS data to every nearby officer,<br>  probably using some form of network uplink. And similar to altering<br>  the GPS data, it would be illegal to disable the wireless broadcast of<br>  the vehicle's speed. The officer would see a map on his screen, with<br>  all of the nearby vehicles plotted on it, along with their speeds. I<br>  mean, if you have the GPS data, you can plot the car on the map. This<br>  presents a *huge* privacy challenge. Even though the vehicle isn't<br>  identified by its GPS data, it is at least theoretically possible to<br>  track *one* car.<br><br>This last bullet is probably going to be the biggest sticking point to<br>implementing a system that allows officers to give you tickets using GPS<br>speed data. It's just too *Big Brother* to be something that society<br>will accept. I think sticking with the current process of having the<br>*officer* determine your speed, rather than your *car* ratting you out<br>to the cops, is the best bet.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
