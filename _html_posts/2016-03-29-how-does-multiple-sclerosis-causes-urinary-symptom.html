<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>Rather than me trying to bumble my way through explaining this, let me<br>give you the answer from the [[National MS<br>Society](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3aaba5&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms/Bladder-Dysfunction){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}:<br><br>> Urine is made in the kidneys, and travels down two tubes called<br>> ureters to the bladder: an elastic sac that stores urine. When the<br>> urinary system is working properly, urine collects slowly in the<br>> bladder, causing it to expand. When four to eight ounces of fluid have<br>> accumulated, nerve endings in the bladder transmit nerve signals to<br>> the spinal cord which, in turn, sends nerve signals to the brain that<br>> the bladder needs to be emptied. As the person prepares to urinate,<br>> the brain sends a return signal to the spinal cord that triggers the<br>> voiding reflex, which causes two things to happen at the same time:<br>><br>> - The bladder muscle (detrusor) contracts to push the urine out of the<br>>   bladder; and<br>> - The external sphincter --- which normally remains closed --- opens<br>>   to allow the urine to leave the body.<br>><br>> Bladder dysfunction, which occurs in at least 80 percent of people<br>> with MS, happens when MS lesions block or delay transmission of nerve<br>> signals in areas of the central nervous system (CNS) that control the<br>> bladder \muscle\ and urinary sphincters. A spastic (overactive)<br>> bladder that is unable to hold the normal amount of urine, or a<br>> bladder that does not empty properly and retains some urine in it can<br>> cause symptoms including:<br>><br>> - Frequency and/or urgency of urination<br>> - Hesitancy in starting urination<br>> - Frequent nighttime urination (nocturia)<br>> - Incontinence (the inability to hold in urine)<br>> - Inability to empty the bladder completely<br><br>Nearly 80% of people with MS will have some form of bladder dysfunction.<br>That\'s a pretty high number, considering that the most common symptom<br>of MS (fatigue, or MS Lassitude) occurs in (actually) 80% of people with<br>the disease. So bladder dysfunction is nearly as common in MS patients<br>as fatigue.<br><br>Thankfully, bladder dysfunction is one of the more treatable conditions<br>that arises from MS, with lifestyle modifications, medications, physical<br>therapy, and some nerve stimulation procedures providing some benefit<br>for nearly everyone.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
