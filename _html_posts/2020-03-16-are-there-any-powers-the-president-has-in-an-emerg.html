<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Are there any powers the president has in an emergency to extend the<br>time until election or cancel it all together? Could this happen if the<br>Corona virus gets worse?**<br><br>There are literally *hundreds* of powers granted to the Executive during<br>times of declared national emergencies, and those powers are all written<br>into individual laws. Congress writes those powers into laws as they<br>create them.<br><br>However, elections are not held at the Federal level. There is no one<br>election for president. There are 51 elections for president, controlled<br>by each individual state. This, and the operation of the Electoral<br>College is why we say **the people elect Congress, but the states elect<br>the President.** To that end, a national emergency cannot modify what a<br>sovereign state does with its election process.<br><br>Additionally, there is no provision to modify the date of the election<br>of a President in the Constitution. In order to allow for some entity to<br>modify a Presidential election, a Constitutional amendment would be<br>required.<br><br>In the case of COVID-19, it would be up to the states to ensure that<br>elections can be safely completed. For example (and it has been done in<br>some states already), the state can switch to all mail-in ballots, no<br>on-site elections at all. Colorado has been operating in this mode for<br>several years now and it has been wildly successful.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
