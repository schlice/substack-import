<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What do I do when my 4-year-old threatens to call the cops because I<br>punished him with a timeout?**<br><br>First of all, time outs are not punishment, and if you're using them as<br>such, you are probably misusing them. But that's a discussion for<br>another question.<br><br>Secondly, you should never use the police as a crutch for parenting, and<br>you should not allow your child to think that police are the answer to a<br>parenting style with which they disagree. Where did he get the idea to<br>call the police when he didn't like your parenting style? Have you ever<br>said to the child, "You'd better listen to me or that police man over<br>there is going to take you to jail." I certainly hope not. Police are<br>not surrogate parents, and they are not there to be your parental<br>enforcers. This only teaches children that police are to be feared. What<br>if the child is lost and you call the police? If he fears the police,<br>he'll hide from them when they try to find him, because he would feel as<br>if he would get "in trouble" for being lost. Probably not the wisest<br>thing to teach him.<br><br>Finally, at some time in the future, you should take your child on a<br>field trip to the police station. He needs a lesson on what police do.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
