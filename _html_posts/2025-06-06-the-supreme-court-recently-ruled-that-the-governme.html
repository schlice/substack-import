<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The implications are very simple. And this decision was a no-brainer for<br>the High Court, which is why it went unanimously (9--0).<br><br>The case, *Catholic Charities Bureau Inc. v. Wisconsin Labor and<br>Industry Review Commission*, questioned whether faith-based nonprofits<br>that provide public services are \"religious enough\" to receive the<br>same benefits as churches or houses of worship. Catholic Charities<br>Bureau (CCB), affiliated with the Diocese of Superior, Wisconsin,<br>provides critical care services for people with disabilities and mental<br>health needs. Wisconsin argued those acts were not \"primarily<br>religious.\"<br><br>Basically, Wisconsin was judging "how religious" CCB was. And Wisconsin<br>decided that CCB was not a religious institution because they did not<br>proselytize or serve people of their own faith. Basically, Wisconsin was<br>deciding if CCB was "Catholic enough" to be considered a religious<br>organization for tax purposes.<br><br>The Supreme Court said clearly that states have no authority to assess<br>or rank the religious nature of charitable work.<br><br>This is a big win for religious groups, because it's not just happening<br>in Wisconsin. All over the country, religious groups are being judged<br>based on their primary work and are being told that it's not "religious"<br>enough. For example, a religious group which runs a homeless shelter in<br>Ohio was told that their primary function is not "religious." Other<br>groups in Colorado and Arizona have faced similar arguments from local<br>governments, which question whether providing food, clothing or shelter<br>to those in need is inherently religious.<br><br>This is a huge win, which affirms that the government cannot tell a<br>religious non-profit what activities they can and can't do in order to<br>receive a government benefit. It's a big win for the First Amendment,<br>but hopefully it spurs more religious groups into charitable work, and<br>that has a twofold benefit: it directly impacts the people receiving<br>those services, and it tangentially spreads the Gospel message to those<br>who most desperately need to hear it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
