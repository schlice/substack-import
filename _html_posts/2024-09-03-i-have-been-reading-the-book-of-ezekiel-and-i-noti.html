<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So your assertion that neither happened is slightly incorrect. When the<br>prophecy said that Tyre and Egypt would be destoryed and "would never<br>return," we believe that meant that they would never regain their former<br>glory. They would never have the power, wealth, and influence that they<br>once had. And in that view, the prophecy was indeed fulfilled.<br><br>Tyre was besieged by Nebuchadnezzar, but only coastal Tyre (585-573 BC),<br>and the city on the mainland fell. However, Babylon was unable to<br>conquer insular Tyre, and so Ezekiel's prophecy was only *partially*<br>fulfilled. It was Greece under Alexander the Great who finally took<br>insular Tyre, and the rest of Ezekiel's prophecy was fulfilled through<br>him. The city was destroyed, and Alexander used the rubble from the city<br>to create a causeway from coastal Tyre to insular Tyre, effectively<br>turning it from an island to a peninsula. This part of the prophecy was<br>*directly* fulfilled:<br><br>> They will plunder your riches and loot your merchandise. They will<br>> break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses. Your stones<br>> and timber and soil they will cast into the midst of the waters. \--<br>> Ezekiel 26:12 ESV<br><br>They literally tossed the stones and timber and soil into the water to<br>make a land bridge.<br><br>Tyre never regained its prominence, so God's promise to Tyre came true:<br>"You will never be rebuilt." This means that Tyre will never regain its<br>former glory, and this much is indeed true.<br><br>As for the prophecy about Egypt, Nebuchadnezzar did indeed take Egypt. A<br>tremendous number of historical statements from Manetho, Herodotus,<br>Flavius Josephus, and archaeological data show us that that the<br>Babylonian Army decimated Egypt in 564 B.C. In 525 B.C. Egypt began to<br>return, and the Egyptian exile ended.<br><br>The rule of pharaohs ended with the Babylonian conquest in 564 B.C. When<br>pharaohs returned in 525, pharaohs ruled only under the control of<br>foreign powers. So it is absolutely true that the Egypt which once<br>existed was indeed destroyed by the King of Babylon.<br><br>No one ever said that either Tyre or Egypt would no longer ever exist.<br>But the Tyre and Egypt which existed before would never exist again, and<br>in that view, the prophecy was absolutely fulfilled.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
