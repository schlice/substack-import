<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are some very limited reports of people with cancer in remission<br>receiving a vaccine and then seeing increased cancer activity. However,<br>there is not enough evidence to indicate that the vaccine causes<br>relapses. Remember: correlation does not equal causation.<br><br>The vaccine may indeed cause enlarged axillary lymph nodes, which can be<br>mistaken for a cancer flare. And of course, the warning about taking the<br>vaccine while immunocompromised still exists.<br><br>However, there doesn't appear to be a causal link between taking the<br>vaccine and a relapse in a cancer in remission.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Did cancer that had been in remission for some people suddenly come back<br>after getting the covid shot?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
