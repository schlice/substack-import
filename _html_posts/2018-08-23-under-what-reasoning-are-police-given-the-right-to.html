<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Under what reasoning are police given the right to lie to the public<br>and in a court of law? Why aren\'t they held accountable for it?**<br><br>Your question is only half correct.<br><br>Police are allowed to lie to the public. This is true. Police<br>officers can lie to people (usually suspects), in exactly the same way<br>that people can lie to police. They're literally on the same footing.<br>There is no law that requires the police to always tell the truth, or<br>even to sometimes tell the truth in some situations.<br><br>You next stated that police have the right to lie in a court of law.<br>This is false. No one has the right to lie under oath. That is<br>called perjury, and anyone on the stand is subject to it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
