<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'m not pinning anything on anyone. I\'m telling you case<br>law states this very principle. And since it\'s been upheld for hundreds<br>of years (the principle was first seen in court in 1855), it\'s not very<br>thin at all.\<br>\<br>I\'ll give you just a few examples, though there are many:\<br>\<br>-In *Daubenspeck, et al. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,* the court<br>ruled that state troopers had no special relationship with, and thus<br>owed no duty to, automobile accident victims who were injured at an icy<br>roadway on an interstate highway, even though the troopers allegedly<br>knew of the hazard and failed to control or direct traffic around the<br>icy spot and failed to reduce the risk and danger to traveling<br>motorists. The court held that "\i<br> general, the police have a common<br>law duty to protect the public when carrying out their duties, and the<br>failure to act generally is not considered a harm to an individual.\"\<br>\<br>- In *Kromer v. County of Onondaga*, the father of a woman who was<br>murdered by her estranged husband sued the police for failing to protect<br>her. As the executor of her estate, he alleged that defendant county<br>police officers acted recklessly and negligently in failing to protect<br>his daughter after she had reported that, two weeks before the murder,<br>her husband assaulted and raped her. On appeal, the court affirmed the<br>trial order granting defendants' motion for summary judgment dismissing<br>the complaint. The court ruled that the plaintiff failed to produce<br>evidence showing that there was a special relationship between the<br>daughter and the police that is necessary to impose liability.\<br>\<br>The police officer defendants established that the decedent did not<br>contact them during the two-week period between the alleged assault/rape<br>and the murder, and thus the plaintiff could not produce evidence to<br>show whether any acts of the defendants lulled her "into a false sense<br>of security, induced \her\ to either relax \her\ own vigilance or<br>forego other viable avenues of protection, and thereby placed<br>\decedent\ in a worse position than \she\ would have been in had<br>defendants never assumed the underlying duty."\<br>\<br>- In *Schoenfield v. Navarre*, Wendy Schoenfield sued the City of<br>Toledo's police chief and eight police officers, alleging that they were<br>negligent in failing to prevent her husband's suicide. The owner of a<br>firearms store had called the police after Eric Schoenfield attempted to<br>purchase a gun because he was acting strangely during his interactions<br>with the salesperson. The police questioned Schoenfield, who was calm<br>and denied that he had any suicidal intentions. Nevertheless, the police<br>detained Schoenfield when his wife expressed her concerns that her<br>husband might commit suicide, but he was released before she arrived to<br>pick him up. Eric Schoenfield checked into a motel, purchased a gun from<br>K-Mart, and shot himself. Wendy Schoenfield sued the police, claiming<br>that because they failed to keep her husband in custody, they had<br>breached a duty to protect him and thus had caused his death. The state<br>court determined that "any common law duty imposed upon employees of a<br>political subdivision" must be evaluated under the state statute<br>governing sovereign immunity. The court ruled that the police were<br>immune from suit because there was no evidence that they "failed to act<br>appropriately under the circumstances\\...\or that they intentionally<br>violated any known duty" to Mr. Schoenfield.\<br>\<br>(References from *Police Chief* Magazine, May, 2007)\<br>\<br>These lawsuits are generally unsuccessful because there is a general<br>duty to the public, not a specific duty to the individual. Unless there<br>was some special relationship (i.e. custodial) or the officers created a<br>harmful situation, the public duty doctrine stands.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/U-S-Constitution-Does-the-US-need-a-police-force-given-that-US-citizens-have-the-right-to-bear-arms/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
