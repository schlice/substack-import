<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The media loves to glom on to anything that makes them<br>money. \"If it bleeds, it leads\" is the motto for the 6 o\'clock news.<br>There has been a lot of attention paid to police brutality after<br>Ferguson.\<br>\<br>Let\'s also clarify: if scrutiny is needed, I\'m all for it. Let\'s air<br>our dirty laundry, and let\'s find and address our problems.\<br>\<br>However, I will tell you this: the vast majority of police officers will<br>go their entire careers and never fire their weapon outside of the<br>range. That\'s the reality. The reality is that we have over 500,000<br>sworn police officers in the United States, and we\'ll have roughly 500<br>officer-related shootings each year. So on average, your chance as a<br>police officer of needing to shoot someone on duty is about 1000 to 1.<br>Same number said a different way, only .1% of police encounters end with<br>someone killed by police.\<br>\<br>The media will show you every last second of every one of those 500<br>encounters, and extrapolate that over 500,000 police officers are out to<br>kill you. Does that sound fair to you?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
