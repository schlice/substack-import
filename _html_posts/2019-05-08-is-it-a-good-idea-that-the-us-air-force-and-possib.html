<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it a good idea that the US Air Force and possibly other service<br>branches are looking to change or revolutionize how they train pilots?**<br><br>It's always a good idea that the services continually review their<br>training programs and update, modernize, or phase them out depending on<br>the needs of the service.<br><br>We also have to consider that the air mission will continue to evolve.<br>UAVs will continue to gain prominence, and we will need a different<br>breed of pilot to run them. We simply cannot effectively train pilots<br>the "same old way" when the platforms and the mission are changing<br>underneath them.<br><br>We are actually actively investigating new preliminary flight training<br>programs right now. These new programs incorporate VR headsets, allowing<br>student pilots to "chair fly" far more effectively. The Air Force<br>estimates that we can reduce about 60% of preliminary flight training<br>hours by using the headsets to replace that introductory instruction.<br>That's money saved on aircraft costs, better utilization of instructors,<br>and more fulfilling and relevant instruction for students.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
