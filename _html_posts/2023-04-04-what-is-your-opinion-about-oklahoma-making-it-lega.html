<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So this is a bit old, as Oklahoma did this two years ago. I have a<br>feeling that your tool which is auto-generating questions may have an<br>issue.<br><br>Anyway, this legislation came during a time when the nation was<br>struggling with racial bias, abusive policing, and the right to protest.<br>Oklahoma wanted to remind protesters that they have a right to protest,<br>but they do not have a right to disrupt lawful commerce and block<br>roadways to do so. Protesters can protest, but they must also recognize<br>that the state has the right to control the time, place, and manner of<br>their protest without limiting the right to protest. Protesters feel<br>that their message is not as impactful when people are not<br>inconvenienced by it, but this is flawed thinking.<br><br>The provision regarding "running over protesters" reiterates the fact<br>that people should not be forced to remain in fear for their lives<br>simply because someone is protesting in a street. You don't have the<br>right to be free from consequences if you are unlawfully protesting. And<br>if you threaten someone inside of their vehicle, and they have a<br>"reasonable belief" that they are in danger, they are now free from<br>criminal or civil liability in Oklahoma if they injure or kill you with<br>their vehicle while they are "fleeing from a riot."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
