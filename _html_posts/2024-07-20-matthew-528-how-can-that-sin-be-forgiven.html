<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.'<br>> But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful<br>> intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. \--<br>> Matthew 5:27--28 ESV*<br><br>Jesus really made a big challenge here. Previously, people were under<br>the Ten Commandments which said you shall not commit adultery. But then<br>Jesus comes along and says "Now you're under the new law, and if you<br>even *look* at a woman lustfully, you have already committed adultery<br>with her in your heart."<br><br>WOW. That's nuts, right? I can't control my mind! It's going to think<br>what it wants to think! How is this even possible to do?<br><br>And that's the point.<br><br>Jesus is telling everyone that **on your own, it is impossible to be<br>good enough.** Merely following the law is not enough. No one is<br>righteous, not one (Romans 3:11). No one is "good enough" on their own<br>to merit salvation.<br><br>But with God, all things are possible.<br><br>> *But Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but<br>> with God all things are possible." \-- Matthew 19:26 ESV*<br><br>It is only Jesus who can save you. You can do nothing on your own to<br>earn salvation. Only through repentance and faith can you be saved.<br><br>Therefore, that sin, along with every other sin, can be washed away by<br>the blood of Christ. His death gives us life. His sacrifice redeems us.<br>He alone is worthy.<br><br>TL;DR: How can that sin be forgiven? Repentance and faith. ***This<br>is the way.***<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
