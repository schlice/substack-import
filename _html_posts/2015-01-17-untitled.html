<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Your comment was downvoted not because we want to see it<br>suppressed, but because it is wrong.\<br>\<br>The study called 5,000 people and then used the results to extrapolate<br>over 2 million defensive gun uses. This hardly constitutes a valid<br>study. Basing your opinion on that study is simply wrong. Assuming that<br>defensive gun uses are rare based on the results of that study is also<br>wrong.\<br>\<br>There are over 1 million defensive gun uses annually in the U.S. Most<br>will go unreported. Most will conclude without a single shot being<br>fired. Simply the presence of a gun will stop many crimes before they<br>happen.\<br>\<br>Beyond guns, many crimes are less violent and less deadly simply because<br>a civilian decided to act and not just cower in a corner and wait for<br>the cops to show up (I\'ll post that study later, I\'m not at my<br>PC).]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/In-the-United-States-how-valid-is-the-assertion-that-there-is-a-myth-behind-defensive-gun-ownership/answers/9238834<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
