Indeed, a<br>Circuit Court judge can issue a temporary injunction to delay the<br>implementation of the EO until appeals have been exhausted.<br><br>Secondly, Judge Coughenour is part of the Ninth Circus\...er\...Circuit,<br>which has traditionally held very progressive views not necessarily in<br>keeping with a more originalist Constitutional interpretation.<br><br>Now, on to the EO.<br><br>Many people have claimed that the EO is unconstitutional. I challenge<br>any one of those people to show me where "birthright citizenship" is<br>found in the 14th Amendment.<br><br>No case law which has come since has actually ruled on this issue.<br><br>Trump's EO did not actually "overrule" the 14th Amendment. It simply<br>codified the appropriate interpretation of the phrase "and subject to<br>the jurisdiction thereof". It stated that illegal immigrants are not<br>subject to the jurisdiction of the United States when it comes to<br>citizenship, and therefore their children are not automatically granted<br>US citizenship.<br><br>And as I predicted years ago, it was the 9th Circus that immediately<br>passed the temporary injunction on the EO. Therefore, (by design), the<br>Supreme Court will have the opportunity to rule on the 14th Amendment's<br>applicability to illegal immigrants.<br><br>**I believe that the 14th Amendment was never intended to grant<br>citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants.** Here's part of how<br>I came to this conclusion.<br><br>The people who wrote the 14th Amendment intended it to apply to recently<br>freed slaves, and they used it as part of the way to reverse some of the<br>injustices of the *Dred Scot* ruling. They never intended to imply that<br>anyone born on American soil immediately becomes an American citizen. At<br>the time of the writing of the Reconstruction Amendments, *the US<br>literally had no concept of "illegal immigration."*<br><br>The original authors recognized that citizens of foreign governments<br>were not "subject to the jurisdiction" of the United States, or at least<br>in the way that mattered to them. This is evident in the fact that they<br>presumed the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment was similar to<br>what we had in the Civil Rights Act of 1866, that it excludes American<br>Indians who maintain their tribal ties and \"persons born in the United<br>States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of<br>ambassadors or foreign ministers". They all agreed that children of<br>ambassadors were not citizens, but children who were born in the United<br>States to legal immigrants (even if they were not citizens) were.<br><br>Senator Jacob Howard worked closely with Abraham Lincoln in drafting and<br>passing the 13th Amendment (which abolished slavery). He also served on<br>the Senate Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which drafted the 14th<br>Amendment. In 1866, Senator Howard clearly spelled out the intent of the<br>14th Amendment by writing (emphasis mine):<br><br>> Every person born within the limits of the United States, and subject<br>> to their jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and national law a<br>> citizen of the United States. **This will not, of course, include<br>> persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who<br>> belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited<br>> to the Government of the United States**, but will include every other<br>> class of persons. It settles the great question of citizenship and<br>> removes all doubt as to what persons are or are not citizens of the<br>> United States. This has long been a great desideratum in the<br>> jurisprudence and legislation of this country.<br><br>To me, from the plain wording of the writers of the 14th Amendment, it<br>was never intended to grant citizenship to children of illegals. For<br>one, how can a person be "born in the United States who \is a\<br>foreigner, \or an\ alien" if the 14th Amendment grants citizenship to<br>*anyone* born on US soil? Those people would not exist if the current<br>understanding of the 14th Amendment stands. So by that reading, clearly<br>there were people who could be born on US soil who would not<br>automatically become US citizens. Perhaps we're using the wrong<br>interpretation of the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof."<br>There would be no need to add "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" to<br>the Amendment if it was meant to apply to every person born on US soil<br>regardless of whether they were legally permitted to be there or not.<br>Therefore, the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" must mean<br>that there are additional qualifications to simply being "born" in the<br>United States.<br><br>In actuality, [[according to Ilya Shapiro of the CATO<br>Institute](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0372f5&url=https://www.cato.org/blog/birthright-citizenship-constitutionally-required){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cato.org"}]{.qlink_container}, that phrase was originally<br>written to exclude the children of Native American tribes from American<br>citizenship, since those children were "subject to the jurisdiction of"<br>Native American tribal government, and were citizens of their tribe, not<br>of the United States. If we apply the same reasoning to illegal<br>immigrants, the children born to parents who are subject to the<br>jurisdiction of *another* government are not US citizens. This is<br>why Howard expanded "foreigners" and "aliens" into the understanding of<br>those who would not be granted citizenship, because they were not<br>subject to the complete authority of the United States, as they had<br>allegiance to another government.<br><br>Additionally, there is no reason for Howard to say "foreigners, aliens,<br>who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers" if<br>"foreigners, aliens" only referred to babies "who belong to the families<br>of ambassadors or foreign ministers." If that was the case, then<br>"foreigners, aliens" would be superfluous. I believe that "foreigners,<br>aliens" intended to *expand* the set of people to whom citizenship<br>would not be granted. Indeed, I believe Howard meant that children of<br>"foreigners" and "aliens" should not get citizenship as we do today. So<br>I believe that the complete set of people to whom automatic citizenship<br>did not extend includes:<br><br>- foreigners<br>- aliens<br>- \babies\ who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign<br>  ministers accredited to the Government of the United States<br><br>While the original authors agreed that children of legal immigrants<br>would gain citizenship, that same concurrence in opinion does not<br>address the children of illegal immigrants. Indeed, the *Wong Kim<br>Ark* case only addressed the birth of children to people lawfully<br>present in the United States. Edward Erler argued that since the *Wong<br>Kim Ark* case dealt with someone whose parents were lawful permanent<br>residents (green card holders), there is no valid basis under the 14th<br>Amendment for the practice of granting citizenship to U.S.-born children<br>of illegal immigrants. He writes, \"Even if the logic is that Wong Kim<br>Ark became a citizen by birth with the permission of the United States<br>when it admitted his parents to the country, no such permission has been<br>given to those who enter illegally." According to law professor Lino<br>Graglia of the University of Texas, even if *Wong Kim Ark* settled the<br>status of children of legal residents, it did not do so for children of<br>illegal residents; [[Graglia<br>asserts](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=710ceb&url=https://law.utexas.edu/faculty/publications/2009-Birthright-Citizenship-for-Children-of-Illegal-Aliens-An-Irrational-Public-Policy/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="utexas.edu"}]{.qlink_container} that the case weighs against<br>automatic birthright for illegal immigrants because the Court denied<br>such citizenship for an analogous group, namely \"children of alien<br>enemies, born during and within their hostile occupation\".<br><br>Therefore, because the Amendment does not address the question of<br>whether legal citizenship is granted to children of illegal immigrants,<br>it has been handled exclusively by *immigration policy.* If that is<br>true, and Congress has granted sole authority to the President to<br>administer immigration policy (which it has), the Executive Branch<br>implementation of that policy can be overridden with a simple Executive<br>Order. However, the broader Constitutional question of whether the 14th<br>Amendment conveys birthright citizenship to the children of illegal<br>immigrants has never been decided. SCOTUS now has an opportunity to take<br>a swing at that question.<br><br>The OAS agrees with this interpretation, despite the fact that nearly<br>every nation in the OAS recognizes birthright citizenship.
