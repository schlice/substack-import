<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [It\'s funny, you started out by saying that most of my<br>positions were wrong, but then you went on to agree with me on most of<br>my positions.\<br>\<br>What leads you to believe that it is okay to tell law abiding citizens<br>that they can\'t defend themselves with an equal level of force with<br>which they are being presented? Or at least close? The bad guys will<br>have semiautos at least. You\'re going to leave the good guys with<br>nothing but bolt action rifles? I can get 5 shots off in the time you<br>can cycle the bolt. Seems kinda unfair, don\'t you<br>think?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Do-gun-control-advocates-want-to-disarm-Americans-so-they-will-be-easier-to-control/answer/Stephanie-V-91<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
