<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I don\'t understand the logic.\<br>\<br>In the state of Colorado, \"open carry\" is legal. So an ordinary<br>citizen can strap on a weapon with no training or licensing, but a<br>highly-trained community-minded peace officer cannot?\<br>\<br>The only logical conclusion that I could find is that police would be<br>essentially \"neutered,\" only able to counter the deadly force they<br>face daily with non-lethal alternatives, such as batons, TASERs, and<br>pepper spray.\<br>\<br>I would also see the use of other non-lethal tools increase, such as<br>\"bean-bag\" guns or rubber bullets.\<br>\<br>Consequently, I think you\'d see police brutality increase, as officers<br>would have to over-compensate for the fact that they do not carry lethal<br>force while everyone they encounter can.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
