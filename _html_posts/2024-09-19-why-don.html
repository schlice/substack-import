<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So there's a bit to this question, let's break it down.<br><br>> **Why don\'t all Christians teach non-violence and non-resistance with<br>> no exceptions? It is what Jesus clearly taught, and what Christians<br>> believed until Constantine came along.**<br><br>This is a question and a statement.<br><br>- **Why don\'t all Christians teach non-violence and non-resistance with<br>  no exceptions?**<br><br>Because the Bible doesn't say that at all. And the assertion that<br>follows it, "It is what Jesus clearly taught, and what Christians<br>believed until Constantine came along" is simply untrue. The Bible<br>shows Jesus actually using violence when it was appropriate:<br><br>> *The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.<br>> In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and<br>> pigeons, and the money-changers sitting there. And making a whip of<br>> cords, he drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and oxen.<br>> And he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their<br>> tables. And he told those who sold the pigeons, "Take these things<br>> away; do not make my Father's house a house of trade." \-- John<br>> 2:13--16 ESV*<br><br>Yes, you read that right. Jesus fashioned himself a "whip of cords" and<br>drove the money changers out of the temple with it. Presumably, He<br>didn't just show it to them. Presumably, He used it. He then took all<br>their money and dumped it out on the floor, and overturned their tables:<br><br>::: {.ui_qtext_gif_noclick_wrapper background-url="images/qimg-baee5c8ad8cd0dc9503f9bbec5621c2b" gif-embedded="images/qimg-baee5c8ad8cd0dc9503f9bbec5621c2b" is-playing="true" interactive="true"}<br>!(images/qimg-baee5c8ad8cd0dc9503f9bbec5621c2b){.qtext_image<br>style="max-width: 100%;"}<br>:::<br><br>Yep, that's right. If anyone ever asks you, "What would Jesus do?"<br>remember that flipping tables and chasing people around with whips are<br>within the realm of possibility.<br><br>But Jesus also taught non-violence, right?<br><br>> *"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for<br>> a tooth.' But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if<br>> anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And<br>> if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak<br>> as well. And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two<br>> miles. Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one<br>> who would borrow from you. \-- Matthew 5:38--42 ESV*<br><br>So what does all of this tell us?<br><br>The nonviolence that Jesus preached was *in response to what was done to<br>us.* We should never repay violence for violence. We should never<br>respond with violence just because someone was violent to us. In other<br>words, the nonviolence of which Jesus taught was **how to respond to<br>violence done to us.**<br><br>The proper use of violence *in self-defense* has to do with<br>wisdom, understanding, and tact. In Luke 22:36, Jesus tells His<br>remaining disciples the following:<br><br>> *He said to them, "But now let the one who has a moneybag take it, and<br>> likewise a knapsack.* ***And let the one who has no sword sell his<br>> cloak and buy one." \-- Luke 22:36 ESV*<br><br>Jesus knew that the time had come when His followers would be<br>threatened, and He upheld their right to self-defense. However, just a<br>short time later, Jesus is arrested, and Peter takes a sword and cuts<br>off someone's ear. Jesus rebukes Peter for that act, after just<br>previously telling them that they should have the right to take up<br>swords in self-defense (verses 49--51). Why? In his zeal to defend the<br>Lord, Peter was standing in the way of God's will. Jesus had told His<br>disciples multiple times that He must be arrested, put on trial, and die<br>(e.g., Matthew 17:22--23). In other words, Peter acted unwisely in that<br>situation. We must have wisdom regarding when to fight and when not to.<br><br>> **Have we in the western world, become so attached to our earthly<br>> possessions, that are afraid to leave them behind, and so distort our<br>> savior\'s message to justify our materialistic idolatry?**<br><br>Yes.<br><br>> *For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through<br>> this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced<br>> themselves with many pangs. \-- 1 Tim 6:10 ESV*<br><br>Remember, it is the love of money that is the root of all kinds of evil,<br>not money itself. Placing the love of money above the love of God<br>creates an *idol*, and we are warned of false idols continuously<br>throughout the Bible.<br><br>So yes, this has been a problem not just in the western world, but all<br>across the world, throughout all time. The love of money causes men to<br>worship money, and the accumulation of it, as an idol that overtakes<br>their lives.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
