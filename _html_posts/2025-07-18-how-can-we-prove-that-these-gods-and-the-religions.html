<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Look, this is a really good question, and it deserves a fair bit of<br>analysis.<br><br>I think to really address this question, we need to start by<br>understanding what we mean by *proof*. And the first question I would<br>ask is: *Can we ever really prove anything?*<br><br>Sherlock Holmes worked in the realm of deduction. Deduction is the<br>process of lining up premises in an argument and arriving at a valid<br>conclusion.<br><br>For example, here is an example of deduction:<br><br>> P1. All men are four-legged reptiles.\<br>> P2. Zach is a man.<br>><br>> C1. Therefore, Zach is a four-legged reptile.<br><br>As you can see, we lined up the premises and came up with a conclusion.<br>That's a valid deduction.<br><br>But it still produced incorrect information. Why? Because deduction<br>doesn't tell us if the individual premises themselves are true. *That*<br>is a process called induction. Induction is the process of taking<br>specific observations and arriving at a general conclusion. For example,<br>we can look at P1 and we can say, "Our observation and repetition proves<br>that all men are two-legged mammals, and therefore P1 is false." That<br>statement is an example of induction: we use our observation and<br>repetition to come up with a general principle: *All men are two-legged<br>mammals*.<br><br>Most things we know today we know through induction. But here's the<br>trick: *is induction ever 100% proven? Can we say that any conclusion we<br>reach through induction is ever 100% true?* With one minor exception¹,<br>no, we can not say that induction is 100% true, only *highly likely*.<br>Why? Well, in the case of the two-legged mammal, it's possible that a<br>man has been born with four legs, or it may be possible in the future<br>that a man may be born with four legs. Clearly, such an outcome is<br>*highly unlikely*, but based on what we know through observation and<br>repetition, it's highly unlikely. There may be a 0.01% chance that we're<br>wrong, but that's a pretty low possibility.<br><br>So we can't really *prove* anything is 100% true, but we can prove it<br>beyond a reasonable doubt (but not beyond *all* doubt).<br><br>\<br><br>Next, we have to tackle the problem of the existence of *any* god. Does<br>a creator god exist? This is a problem that we can't tackle with<br>science, because science only deals with things within our universe, and<br>if a god exists, it would naturally exist outside of our universe. If a<br>god exists at all, then it needed to exist outside of the universe in<br>order to create the universe, so it can't be part of the universe. So<br>science is not the right tool to determine if god exists. It's like<br>using an X-ray machine to find a plastic cup.<br><br>The correct tools, or proofs, are logical proofs found in the discipline<br>of philosophy. Philosophy deals with life\'s most significant issues,<br>including morality, meaning, and the existence of God. Philosophy<br>enables us to investigate realities that cannot be perceived through our<br>senses. Therefore, philosophy offers an excellent method to explore<br>evidence for the existence of God.<br><br>In philosophy, evidence is often presented in the form of arguments.<br>Over the years, thinkers have identified at least twenty arguments for<br>the existence of God, which vary in complexity. Some of these arguments<br>are based on the universe or history, while others are based on the<br>existence of reason and beauty.<br><br>We can approach the God question from many angles, and there is no one<br>best way. But I think there is one argument that is not only clear and<br>convincing, but easy enough to understand.<br><br>If terms like \"arguments\" or \"evidence\" bother you, you might<br>consider these arguments as \"clues\" that converge and point to a<br>common conclusion, similar to how road signs guide you to a specific<br>destination. The existence of these signposts do not, in and of<br>themselves, prove the existence of the destination; they merely point<br>towards it. Let\'s consider one signpost that presents a simple yet<br>powerful argument for God's existence.<br><br>The Kalam argument dates back to the Middle Ages but has been made<br>popular today by William Lane Craig, an evangelical Christian<br>philosopher. The argument is very simple; in fact, it is probably the<br>easiest of all the arguments to understand, having two premises and one<br>conclusion:<br><br>- P1: Everything which has a beginning has a cause.<br>- P2: The universe had a beginning.<br>- C1: Therefore, the universe has a cause.<br><br>So let's dig in to these two premises and one conclusion:<br><br>Premise 1: this statement forms the basis of the law of causality.<br>This statement says everything that has a beginning has a cause. It's<br>very important that we get this right. Some atheists try to refute this<br>premise of this statement by responding, "But if everything that exists<br>has a cause, and God exists, then what caused God?" But the premise does<br>not claim, "Everything that *exists* has a cause." It says, "Everything<br>that *begins to exist* has a cause." Since God, by definition, and<br>whether you believe in Him or not, is eternal and never began to exist,<br>this first premise does not apply to Him. Therefore, the rhetorical<br>question "What caused God?" is like asking, "To whom is the bachelor<br>married?" or "What is the sound of one hand clapping?" Regardless of<br>whether bachelors or hands exist, these questions do not make sense.<br>They are literally nonsense because they confuse the meaning of terms.<br><br>Now that we have cleared away that misunderstanding, let us turn back to<br>the first premise. Does induction tell us that it is true? Does<br>everything that begins to exist have a cause? For most people, the<br>answer is yes; it is common sense. Almost nobody denies it. The<br>statement simply means that nothing just springs into existence,<br>randomly and without a cause. For if things did come into being this<br>way, then our world would be a wild spree of things apparently popping<br>into existence like sleight of hand magic. Only it would be worse, since<br>with sleight of hand you at least have a magician who pulls rabbits out<br>of a hat. However, in a world that violates this first premise, rabbits<br>would pop in and out of being even without magicians or hats. Few sane<br>people believe the world works this way. Even the great atheist David<br>Hume said, "I never asserted so absurd a proposition as that something<br>should arise without a cause." So, through observation and repetition,<br>most people, even most honest atheists, agree that everything that<br>begins to exist has a cause.<br><br>Premise 2: This claim is slightly more controversial than the first<br>one. In fact, no less a thinker than St. Thomas Aquinas says that the<br>truth that the world had a beginning of its duration is only<br>conclusively known by faith and not by reason. Nevertheless, a host of<br>the greatest minds throughout history, including St. Bonaventure in the<br>Middle Ages and Drs William Lane Craig and Steven Meyer today, offer<br>arguments that purport to defend this truth. An example of one of these<br>arguments goes as follows:<br><br>- If the world has always existed, then there would be an infinite<br>  number of past days.<br>- However, if there were an infinite number of past days, we never would<br>  have been able to arrive at the present day because an infinite<br>  series, by definition, cannot be traversed.<br>- We have arrived at today (and today is the end date of history)<br>- Therefore, there must have been a beginning of time (a beginning<br>  date).<br><br>Modern physics also seems to give weight to this position. Despite<br>cosmological models continually being advanced by some physicists in<br>recent years, since the advent of the big bang theory in the twentieth<br>century, the scientific consensus is that the universe did have a<br>beginning roughly fourteen billion years ago. Alexander Vilenkin, a<br>leading non-Christian cosmologist, was invited to speak at a colloquium<br>for Stephen Hawking's seventieth birthday. There, in front of the<br>greatest scientists in the world, Vilenkin said, "All the evidence we<br>have says that the universe had a beginning." It is rare for scientists<br>to speak with this measure of conclusiveness, but Vilenkin stated his<br>opinion that it is not just that *some* of the evidence points to a<br>beginning of the universe, or even the *majority* of evidence, but that<br>*all* of the evidence points that way today.<br><br>Conclusion: The two premises are widely accepted today: everything<br>that begins to exist has a cause, and the universe began to exist. If<br>that is the case, then the third statement, the conclusion of the<br>argument, logically follows. We cannot avoid the fact that if everything<br>that begins to exist has a cause, and the universe began to exist, then<br>the universe must have had a cause.<br><br>This logical conclusion leads us to wonder: if the universe had a cause,<br>*what* is that cause? The cause certainly could not have been anything<br>*within* the universe or even *the universe itself* (as we've already<br>touched on), since things can't cause themselves to come into existence.<br>This idea defies logic. Thus, the cause of the universe must be<br>something *beyond* the universe, something beyond all matter, energy,<br>space, and time. In other words, it must be transcendent (beyond the<br>universe), it must be immaterial (beyond matter and space), it must be<br>eternal (beyond time), and if it has created something so massively<br>complex as the universe, it must be tremendously powerful and<br>intelligent. Well, a transcendent, immaterial, eternal, supremely<br>powerful, and intelligent cause of the universe---what does that sound<br>like to you? St.Thomas Aquinas said it best: "This is what most people<br>mean by 'God.'"<br><br>\<br><br>So logic and philosophy tells us that an intelligent creator exists. But<br>which one? Which creator god exists?<br><br>Can we infer things about Him from what He created? In other words, can<br>we understand the cause by its effects? The answer to this is yes, we<br>can. Go back to Premise 1 above, the law of causality. One other feature<br>of the law of causality is this: *an effect must resemble its cause.* In<br>general, a specific type of effect is nominally expected to be produced<br>by a similar specific type of cause. To that end, we can look at<br>creation and assume the following characteristics of its creator:<br><br>- He must be supernatural in nature (as He created time and space).<br>- He must be powerful (incredibly).<br>- He must be eternal (self-existent).<br>- He must be necessary (the maker must be self-explanatory).<br>- He must be omnipresent (He created space and is not limited by it).<br>- He must be timeless and changeless (He created time).<br>- He must be immaterial (He transcends space/physical)<br>- He must be personal (the impersonal cannot create personality).<br>- He must be infinite and singular (you cannot have two infinite beings)<br>- He must be diverse yet have unity (unity and diversity exist<br>  simultaneously in nature)<br>- He must be intelligent (supremely, as only cognitive being can produce<br>  cognitive being).<br>- He must be purposeful (He deliberately created everything)<br>- He must be moral (no moral law can be had without a giver).<br>- He must be caring (or no moral laws would have been given).<br><br>These things being true, we can now ask if any religion in the world<br>describes such a creator. The answer to this is yes: the "Abrahamic God"<br>of the Bible fits this profile perfectly. He is<br><br>- supernatural (Genesis 1:1),<br>- powerful (Jeremiah 32:17),<br>- eternal (Psalm 90:2),<br>- necessary (Exodus 3:14)<br>- omnipresent (Psalm 139:7),<br>- timeless/changeless (Malachi 3:6),<br>- immaterial (John 5:24),<br>- personal (Genesis 3:9),<br>- necessary (Colossians 1:17),<br>- infinite/singular (Jeremiah 23:24, Deuteronomy 6:4),<br>- diverse yet with unity (Matthew 28:19),<br>- intelligent (Psalm 147:4-5),<br>- purposeful (Jeremiah 29:11, Psalm 19:1-4),<br>- moral (Daniel 9:14), and<br>- caring (1 Peter 5:6-7).<br><br>\<br><br>So while we can never prove 100% that a god or gods exist, we can prove<br>*beyond a reasonable doubt* that they do.<br><br>\<br><br>¹ The one exception is what we call the "perfect induction," when all of<br>the particulars are known. For example, if I said "all of the words in<br>\Book X\ are printed in black ink." Since we have a copy of \Book X\<br>in front of us, we can clearly see that all of the words are indeed<br>printed in black ink. So when you have personal knowledge of all of<br>the particulars, you can make a 100% true induction.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
