<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, the New Testament says nothing about whether a believer in Jesus<br>can get tattoos. So while we can't say that getting a tattoo is a sin,<br>there are some passages in the New Testament which apply, and a<br>Christian can reference them to understand whether or not getting that<br>tattoo might be sinful.<br><br>In other words, the tattoo itself may not be a sin, but the *motivation*<br>behind getting the tattoo may be.<br><br>> Do not let your adorning be external---the braiding of hair and the<br>> putting on of gold jewelry, or the clothing you wear--- but let your<br>> adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable<br>> beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very<br>> precious. --- 1 Peter 3:3--4 ESV<br><br>Peter talks about "external adorning." If it is done to draw attention<br>to oneself, that person may have a vain self-focus which is sinful.<br><br>> So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory<br>> of God. --- 1 Corinthians 10:31 ESV<br><br>Again, if the motivation behind getting your tattoo is not to glorify<br>God (i.e. the motivation is to *stand out*, or to *fit in*), then that<br>motivation might be sinful.<br><br>> Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal<br>> through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.<br>> --- 2 Corinthians 5:20 ESV<br><br>As "amabssadors of Christ," delivering the Gospel to the world, what<br>message does your tattoo deliver? Your tattoo should not deliver a<br>message that is contrary to the Gospel message you personally are<br>delivering.<br><br>> Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit<br>> within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were<br>> bought with a price. So glorify God in your body. --- 1 Corinthians<br>> 6:19--20 ESV<br><br>You've probably heard the "your body is a temple" quote before, but how<br>much of that temple should be altered? Is there a dividing line between<br>art and sinful mutilation when a person has a large number of tattoos on<br>their body? That answer is found when the believer engages in prayerful<br>consideration before adding that next tat.<br><br>\<br><br>Now, let's discuss Leviticus. 19:28 says:<br><br>> "Do not cut your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on<br>> yourselves. I am the Lord."<br><br>The rest of the passage does not talk about why we shouldn't tattoo<br>ourselves, but it is probably related to the pagan practice of tattoing<br>marks on themselves, sometimes with the name of their false god or some<br>idol. The fact that the verse says "I am the Lord" in relation to it<br>leads us to believe that this is what God is talking about. In saying "I<br>am the Lord," he is reminding them that they should not tattoo the names<br>of idols or false gods on their bodies, because only He deserves<br>worship.<br><br>While Christians are not bound by Levitical law, we can still take godly<br>principles from the ideas in the law, in that our tattoos should never<br>be to promote superstition or worldly idols.<br><br>So while getting a tattoo is not in itself a sin, a Christian should<br>fully understand the motivations behind the tattoo before getting one.<br>Christians should engage in prayerful consideration, thinking about all<br>the things we discussed, and ensuring that the motivation is right<br>before getting a tattoo.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
