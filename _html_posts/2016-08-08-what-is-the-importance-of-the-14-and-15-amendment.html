<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>At the risk of doing someone's Con Law homework, I'll answer the<br>question.<br><br>The 14th Amendment was one of the most important amendments to the<br>Constitution following the Bill of Rights and the 13th Amendment (which<br>abolished slavery). The 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments were the<br>"Reconstruction Amendments" passed following the Civil War. The 14th is<br>sometimes known as the "second Constitution" because of its major role<br>in future interpretation of the Constitution. This amendment has been<br>cited more times than any other amendment because of how greatly it<br>expanded civil rights. It was the first amendment to directly address<br>the states as well. There are five sections in the 14th Amendment, but<br>the one with the most influence is Section 1:<br><br>> SECTION 1<br>><br>> All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to<br>> the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the<br>> State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law<br>> which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the<br>> United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life,<br>> liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any<br>> person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.<br><br>There are three provisions in here which are important:<br><br>*The Citizenship Clause* states that if you are born here, you are a<br>citizen. This has created the issue of [[**anchor<br>babies**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=415a07&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_baby){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>*The Due Process Clause* says that no person may be deprived of life,<br>liberty, or property without due process of law.<br><br>*The Equal Protection Clause* says that the law must be applied equally<br>to all citizens.<br><br>The other provisions in the 14th Amendment include assurances that all<br>citizens are counted equally when it comes to representation in Congress<br>and other provisions.<br><br>The 15th Amendment, the last of the Reconstruction Amendments,<br>provided voting rights to former black slaves. The text reads, "The<br>right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or<br>abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color,<br>or previous condition of servitude."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
