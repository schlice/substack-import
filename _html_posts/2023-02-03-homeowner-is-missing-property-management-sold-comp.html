<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, don't spend the rent money! Once you work out the<br>issue of who owns the property and who will be accepting your rent<br>checks, they're going to want all that back rent (and they are owed it).<br>Don't screw yourself over by spending the rent money and then realize<br>you owe back rent.<br><br>If you want to investigate this yourself, go to your county's tax<br>assessor website. The real owner of every property is listed. Find the<br>real owner of the property and figure out who will be accepting the<br>rent. Keep all records of your transactions.<br><br>If you are unable to get answers through the county website, contact a<br>real estate attorney in your local area to help you.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
