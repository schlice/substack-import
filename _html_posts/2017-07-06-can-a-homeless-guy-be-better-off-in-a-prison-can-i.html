<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>About 25 years ago, I met a guy in our medium-security prison. He told<br>us that prison was his retirement plan.<br><br>He had it all mapped out: the crime he was going to commit, the age at<br>which he was going to commit the crime, the location, etc. He was going<br>to allow himself to get caught so that he could be arrested and charged<br>and sent back to medium security, to spend the rest of his days on the<br>state's dime. Apparently, he thought life in medium security was better<br>than life on the outside.<br><br>I don't know if it all worked out for him, to be honest.<br><br>But I can say that I know at least one person who planned on doing just<br>that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
