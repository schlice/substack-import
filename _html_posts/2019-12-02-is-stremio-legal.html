<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is Stremio legal?<br><br>It appears so.<br><br>From their site:<br><br>> Stremio is a one-stop hub for video content aggregation. Discover,<br>> organize and watch video from all kind of sources on any device that<br>> you own.<br><br>Stremio is a content aggregator It is not a content provider. It<br>only aggregates content *for which you already have legal access*. It is<br>not providing access you do not already have.<br><br>Where Stremio needs to be careful is serving content you already have<br>access to in a way which violates that site's agreement. But that's just<br>a future watchout for them; they need to ensure they know the content<br>delivery policies of the sites they aggregate, and respect those<br>policies when their end user uses Stremio.<br><br>But assuming they do that, yeah from a first blush, it looks legit.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
