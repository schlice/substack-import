<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The simple fact is that, as of yet, no one has produced any amount of<br>credible, actionable evidence that Donald Trump has done anything<br>illegal. "Collusion" is not illegal. It may be unethical, but it's not<br>illegal, and it doesn't rise to the level of "high crimes and<br>misdemeanors" required to start impeachment proceedings.<br><br>As for the other things being bandied about regarding both parties:<br><br>- Former FBI Director James Comey<br>  [detailed(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=03e17f&url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/437479/fbi-rewrites-federal-law-let-hillary-hook){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="nationalreview.com"}]{.qlink_container} Hillary Clinton's<br>  illegal actions as related to her use of an unclassified email server<br>  to transmit classified data in violation of the Espionage Act (18 USC<br>  section 793(f)). This, of course, was while she was at the State<br>  Department, before she ran for president. Interestingly, the FBI<br>  decided to rewrite the Espionage Act on the fly, inserting an intent<br>  clause where there was none. This violation of law has yet to be taken<br>  up by the Justice Department. It is currently unknown whether or not<br>  they will ever look at it.<br>- The DNC is also accused of "rigging" the primary in favor of Hillary<br>  Clinton and against Bernie Sanders. While this is also a violation of<br>  our public trust and possibly what we would call "collusion," again,<br>  it is not illegal.<br>- In a highly-publicized meeting, Donald Trump, Jr. met with a Russian<br>  attorney, who had ties directly to Vladimir Putin, in order to receive<br>  what he was told was "opposition research" against Hillary Clinton.<br>  While that "collusion" word comes up again, it is still not illegal.<br>  By the way, no opposition research was actually received during that<br>  meeting, and no money changed hands.<br>- Hillary's campaign also paid for "opposition research" against Donald<br>  Trump. Hillary's team paid an attorney who paid an opposition research<br>  firm, Fusion GPS, to produce a "dossier" on Trump which, as it turns<br>  out, was mostly false. Again, opposition research is not illegal, but<br>  the payment from Hillary's campaign to Fusion GPS through their<br>  lawyers may have been a violation of campaign finance laws. A<br>  complaint was filed last week with the Federal Election Commission by<br>  the Campaign Legal Center, accusing the DNC and Clinton's campaign<br>  committee of breaking campaign finance law by failing to accurately<br>  disclose the money spent on the dossier.<br><br>> \...T\he political consulting firm Fusion GPS was retained last year<br>> by Marc E. Elias, an attorney representing the DNC and the Clinton<br>> campaign. The firm then hired former British intelligence officer<br>> Christopher Steele to write the now-infamous<br>> dossier.\[1\](#mZzdY){#cite-mZzdY .citation_link}<br><br>*(NOTE: Please don't bother trying to tell me how bad you think Trump or<br>Clinton is, or what you think they did wrong.
