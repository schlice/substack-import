<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Which is it? I thought the CARES Act covers anyone who wants an<br>antibodies test to see if they had covid-19 at some point, but my<br>doctor\'s office said insurance won\'t pay unless people meet certain<br>criteria!**<br><br>The problem is your misunderstanding of the CARES Act and what it<br>actually provides. The Act does not provide free testing to anyone<br>who wants it. It does provide [[reimbursement to health care<br>providers and testing<br>facilities](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=aa330f&url=https://www.hrsa.gov/CovidUninsuredClaim){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="hrsa.gov"}]{.qlink_container} for testing and treatment of<br>those who have no health insurance.<br><br>In addition, through Executive Order, the Centers for Medicare and<br>Medicaid Services (CMS), along with the Departments of Labor and<br>Treasury, modified coverage rules for private insurance. Specifically,<br>group health plans and group and individual health insurance must cover<br>both diagnostic testing and certain related items and services provided<br>during a medical visit with no cost sharing. This includes urgent care<br>visits, emergency room visits, and in-person or telehealth visits to the<br>doctor's office that result in an order for or administration of a<br>COVID-19 test. There are some costs that are exceptions to this rule,<br>and your employer can cover those if they choose.<br><br>Ultimately, this means that if you go to your doctor because you think<br>you have COVID-19, and if your doctor agrees that you should be<br>tested and they order a test for you, you can get a blood test, and<br>they can't charge you a copay for it.<br><br>As of today, there is no universal free testing for COVID-19 or its<br>antibodies. Even the drive-up testing sites require you to have a lab<br>slip from your doctor. So even though the test may be free once your<br>doctor orders it, your doctor still has to order it. And in order for<br>them to order a test for you, you have to be someone who might actually<br>have COVID-19. You can't just go to your doctor's office and say you<br>want an antibody test.<br><br>*HOWEVER*, all hope is not lost! We found a workaround for most<br>people who just want an antibody test.<br><br>Give blood.<br><br>Turns out, if you give blood with the Red Cross, they will test your<br>blood for the COVID-19 antibody. You'll get results back on the<br>[OneBlood(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1a459c&url=http://oneblood.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="oneblood.org"}]{.qlink_container} portal within like 3 days<br>or something. Check OneBlood to see where and if you can donate blood.<br>You'll be helping your community and helping yourself at the same time.<br><br>Even better, if you already had COVID-19 and you recovered, you can<br>donate plasma and potentially help someone else who gets it to get<br>better.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
