They will *try* to accommodate your request, but<br>the needs of higher-priority calls will always take precedence.<br><br>If you need to have police at a specific location at a specific time for<br>a specific period of time, you can hire them. Please try to do this as<br>far in advance as you can, so that they can schedule resources.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
