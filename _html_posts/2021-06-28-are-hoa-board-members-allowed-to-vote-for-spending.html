<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm not sure what you mean by "contradicts the CC&Rs" unless you're<br>claiming that there is a line item which specifically forbids them from<br>spending the money in the way that they voted to spend it.<br><br>Otherwise, if in the name of maintaining the property for which they do<br>have control, they vote to spend money to do that, it sounds like it<br>could be considered a reasonable expenditure.<br><br>And if the tree removal stops them from spending money in the future,<br>isn't that a good thing?<br><br>So unless there is a specific line item which says they cannot spend<br>money in the way in which they are spending money, they can probably<br>spend the money.<br><br>But if you think they are wrong and you've already addressed the issue<br>with them, maybe you and a few of your neighbors can get together and<br>hire an attorney to address their violation of the CC&Rs and demand an<br>immediate cease and desist in their violation.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Are HOA board members allowed to vote for spending that contradicts the<br>CC&Rs? Every year they approve \$1500 to a condo owner to trim her<br>backyard trees in her private non-common area yard. Now they want to pay<br>thousands to remove it free for her.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
