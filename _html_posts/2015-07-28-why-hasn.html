<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The United States is one of the last industrialized<br>nations which has not passed universal workplace bullying laws. This is<br>because laws surrounding \"workplace bullying\" are generally seen as<br>opening up the possibility of frivolous lawsuits. Can you legislate<br>civility? Should you have to?\<br>\<br>The fear is that when you write workplace bullying statutes, you open<br>the door to all sorts of frivolous lawsuits. Essentially, every<br>disgruntled employee becomes a potential plaintiff. Companies will spend<br>their time mediating disputes to avoid lawsuits, and they\'re going to<br>hear all sorts of \"he was mean to me\" disputes.\<br>\<br>The fact of the matter is that most employers know that legislating<br>against workplace bullying is not the answer. Most employers know that<br>when you foster a culture of kindness and respect in your workplace,<br>your employees are more productive, and thus make you more money.<br>Employers must create respectful workplaces themselves, and it must come<br>from the inside out.\<br>\<br>It is true that laws will force employers to create company-wide<br>guidelines, but if an employer is drafting guidelines because he has to<br>comply with a new law, the guidelines will be the absolute minimum to<br>comply with the letter of that law. If you really want to address<br>workplace bullying, employers have to take the reins themselves and<br>create top-down, inside-out climates of respect for all employees. In<br>some companies, this will represent wholesale change; for others, it\'s<br>business as usual.\<br>\<br>Since 2003, half of the states in the US have introduced workplace<br>bullying legislation that would allow employees to sue for harrassment<br>without having to show discrimination. Some state laws are better than<br>others. Take Massachusetts\' law which was passed in 2013. It says that<br>an abusive workplace environment is one where \"an employer or one or<br>more of its employees, acting with intent to cause pain or distress to<br>an employee, subjects that employee to abusive conduct that causes<br>physical harm, psychological harm or both.\" Massachusetts was<br>surprisingly smart in implementing this legislation, as they wisely<br>included an intent clause which should help to weed out a lot of the<br>frivolous nonsense that such laws can create.\<br>\<br>As an aside, my employer is based in Massachusetts, but we have had HR<br>guidelines since I joined 15 years ago which aim to foster a respectful<br>workplace. We are already compliant with the new law, without having to<br>change a single thing.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
