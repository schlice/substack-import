  because different proteins are active in the CNS than the PNS?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: yes and no. Yes because the immune system is attacking the<br>specific protein signature in myelin; no because of the difference<br>between the myelination of nerve cells between the Peripheral Nervous<br>System (PNS) and the Central Nervous System (CNS).<br><br>PNS cells are myelinated using Schwann cells. These cells can<br>regenerate, and Schwann cells can re-wrap newly formed PNS cells. If<br>there was damage to the PNS, it can regenerate, and the nerve cells can<br>re-grow.<br><br>In the CNS, this same process does not occur. The CNS does not possess<br>the same cell regeneration process in adults. When myelin is damaged by<br>the immune system in the autoimmune action of the disease, the myelin is<br>not replaced. What is left in its wake is a plaque or scar through which<br>nerve signals are decreased. This causes the symptoms of MS. It also is<br>where the name "multiple sclerosis" comes from: many scars.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
