<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Are there any benefits to HOA\'s?<br><br>1.  The primary goal of an HOA is to maintain home prices as high as you<br>    can get them. How? A neat neighborhood (trash picked up, lawns<br>    mowed, cars not littering the streets) sells houses. Ask any<br>    realtor. A prospective homeowner is buying the house from the minute<br>    they enter the neighborhood. It may be a great house, but if it's in<br>    a crappy neighborhood, they're going to pass. And when your<br>    neighbor's house is well-kept, you get max dollar for your house.<br>    That is the true goal of an HOA.<br>2.  The goal of the HOA is not to control what you do in order to keep<br>    your home value high. The goal of the HOA is to control what *your<br>    neighbors* do to keep your home value high. What you do to the<br>    inside of your house is your business. But what you do to the<br>    outside of your house affects your neighbors. That's where the HOA<br>    steps in.<br>3.  The HOA can negotiate group discounts on services such as trash<br>    removal and recycling. For example, it costs roughly \$20 per month<br>    for trash service to a single family home here in Colorado Springs.<br>    Through bulk purchasing, we were able to negotiate the exact same<br>    service for \$8/home, and we rolled it into the HOA dues, ***without<br>    increasing dues.*** We now provide trash service to the entire<br>    neighborhood. This is also great for traffic control. In the middle<br>    of winter, with cars getting to work and kids getting to school and<br>    school buses and snowy roads, the last thing we need is trash trucks<br>    trying to fight their way through, clogging the streets every day of<br>    the week because every trash company collects on a different day.<br>    Similarly, we don't allow homeowners to park their cars on the<br>    street. Less traffic clogging up the small streets is as much of a<br>    safety issue as it is a beautification issue.<br>4.  The HOA has more pull with the City. If there is a city issue<br>    affecting the neighborhood (such as street paving, drainage, street<br>    lights, etc), the HOA, as a representative of X number of homeowners<br>    and a relatively large community, can negotiate with city leaders to<br>    correct those issues.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
