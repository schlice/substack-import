<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You can claim whatever you want at whatever time you want.<br>The question is, does your case have any legs? Is there any merit to<br>what you\'re asking?\<br>\<br>And to determine that, you first have to show some harm.\<br>\<br>If there is some demonstrable harm caused by the adopted person learning<br>the identity of his/her biological parents, and it was a fact that was<br>supposed to remain private, you may have a case for pain and suffering.\<br>\<br>I think a better tack may be to look at privacy laws surrounding<br>adoptions. Revelation of birth parents is tightly controlled, and is<br>only ever allowed if both parties separately agree through a neutral<br>third party (usually the adoption agency). So there may be some breach<br>of privacy laws you may be able to use. The damages for pain and<br>suffering can be tacked on to the privacy case, and you won\'t have to<br>show harm for cause at that point.\<br>\<br>I would have the adopted person consult with an attorney in his/her<br>local area to find out whether or not there is a case to<br>pursue.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
