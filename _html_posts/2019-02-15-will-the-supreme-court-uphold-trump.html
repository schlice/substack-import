How long will it take for this case to reach the<br>Supreme Court?**<br><br>The Supreme Court cannot uphold or overturn the President's declaration<br>of a national emergency, because it is not a legal question.<br><br>The National Emergencies Act authorizes the President to declare<br>national emergencies and unlock the provisions of Federal law designated<br>for such emergencies. That's not a legal question. The law allows the<br>President to do this already. Congress already gave this authorization.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
