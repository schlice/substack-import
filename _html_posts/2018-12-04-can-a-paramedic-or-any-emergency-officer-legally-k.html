If you insist on<br>entering, a paramedic does not have the legal authority to stop you.<br><br>Police, on the other hand, must preserve a crime scene. They absolutely<br>can keep you out of your home until that scene has been processed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
