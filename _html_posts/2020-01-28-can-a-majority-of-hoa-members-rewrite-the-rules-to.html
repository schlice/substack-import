<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can a majority of HOA members rewrite the rules to require a<br>supermajority for changes? Originally a majority vote was enough. Or<br>would the supermajority need to agree to be bound by the more<br>restrictive term?**<br><br>How rules are changed are written into the Bylaws.<br><br>The Bylaws describe the functioning of the Association as a business<br>unit, which includes how it is staffed, and how votes are held. Remember<br>that the Association is generally (in most places around the country) a<br>501(c)(4) nonprofit corporation. This means that all the rules which<br>govern how this corporation runs are contained within the corporate<br>Bylaws.<br><br>Included in the Bylaws are rules about how the Bylaws can be changed.<br>Some Bylaws require a majority of homeowners to change them, some<br>require unanimous consent of the homeowners. Your Bylaws may specify one<br>of these, or it may specify something else.<br><br>You can change the Bylaws in whatever way you choose, but the change<br>must be conducted in the manner specified in the Bylaws. In other words,<br>to change the Bylaws, you have to follow the Bylaws. You will likely<br>have to get signatures from the registered homeowners for whatever<br>percentage of homeowners is required to change the Bylaws to whatever<br>you choose.<br><br>Note then that the updated Bylaws must be filed with the municipality<br>wherein the corporation operates (either city or county charter,<br>depending on where your HOA is). There will be attorney's fees and<br>filing fees which must be paid by the HOA.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
