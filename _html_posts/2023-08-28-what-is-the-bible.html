<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, it's important to understand the difference between global<br>warming and climate change. Climate change includes global warming, but<br>encompasses a whole host of changes to the planet.<br><br>According to NASA, climate change, "encompasses global warming, but<br>refers to the broader range of changes that are happening to our planet,<br>including rising sea levels; shrinking mountain glaciers; accelerating<br>ice melt in Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic; and shifts in<br>flower/plant blooming times." Also according to NASA, global warming is<br>"the long-term heating of the Earth's climate system observed since the<br>pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities,<br>primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse<br>gas levels in the Earth's atmosphere."\[1\](#LkFIf){#cite-LkFIf<br>.citation_link}<br><br>From this definition, it is mankind's fault that we are experiencing<br>global warming. It is important to note that not everyone agrees on<br>whether it is mankind's fault, or if it is, to what degree, that we are<br>experiencing global warming. Many people deny we are experiencing global<br>warming at all.<br><br>While the Bible does not specifically address global warming or climate<br>change, it is important for people to take care of the environment,<br>since God has given us dominion over the earth (Genesis 1:26-28). Since<br>God has given us this great responsibility and privilege, we do need to<br>care about the way we treat the environment. All mankind is to be good<br>stewards of God's creation as the entire world is His, "The earth is the<br>Lord's, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it;" (Psalm<br>24:1). It is important that we do our part to help protect the earth.<br>Activities such as recycling and smart usage of fossil fuels are small<br>ways to help take care of the environment. But everyone taking small<br>steps in their own spheres will eventually have a big impact.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-LkFIf){.citation_index} [[What Is Climate<br>Change?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=28d942&url=https://climate.nasa.gov/resources/global-warming-vs-climate-change/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nasa.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
