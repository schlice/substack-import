<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Serotonin is synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan. Many foods<br>contain tryptophan, so the common belief is that by eating foods high in<br>tryptophan, you can boost your serotonin levels. But is this true?<br><br>Serotonin isn't found in foods, but tryptophan is. Foods high in<br>protein, iron, riboflavin, and vitamin B6 all tend to contain large<br>amounts of the amino acid. Unfortunately, though, boosting your<br>serotonin levels isn't as simple as eating a "high tryptophan diet."<br><br>The tryptophan you find in food has to compete with other amino acids to<br>be absorbed into the brain, so it's unlikely to have much of an effect<br>on your serotonin levels. This differs from tryptophan supplements,<br>which contain purified tryptophan and do have an effect on serotonin<br>levels.<br><br>There's a reason why foods like mac and cheese and mashed potatoes are<br>considered "comfort foods," especially when the weather is dreary. While<br>high-tryptophan foods won't boost serotonin on their own, there is one<br>possible cheat to this system: carbs. *It's possible that eating<br>foods high in tryptophan with a healthy serving of carbohydrates can<br>have an effect on your serotonin levels.*<br><br>When you eat carbs, more insulin is released into your system. Insulin<br>promotes the absorption of amino acids into the heart, muscles, and<br>organs. The tryptophan left behind now makes up a larger portion of the<br>blood's amino acid "pool," meaning that it's more likely that it will be<br>absorbed through the brain barrier.<br><br>While they can't compete with supplements --- which you should not be<br>taking without approval from your doctor --- certain foods contain high<br>amounts of tryptophan. **Your best chance at achieving a serotonin boost<br>without using supplements is to eat them often, with a serving of<br>healthy carbohydrates, like rice, oatmeal, or whole-grain<br>bread**.\[1\](#iSRAO){#cite-iSRAO .citation_link}<br><br>Foods like eggs, cheese, nuts and seeds, pineapples, tofu, turkey, and<br>salmon are all high in tryptophan. With a serving of healthy carbs, you<br>can naturally boost your serotonin level.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-iSRAO){.citation_index} [[7 Foods That Could Boost Your<br>Serotonin](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3d18ea&url=http://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sleep/foods-that-could-boost-your-serotonin){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="healthline.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
