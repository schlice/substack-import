<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can I be arrested for lying to the police if no other issues were<br>found?**<br><br>No, with caveats.<br><br>Lying to the police is not illegal. You cannot be arrested for lying to<br>the police. If the police can lie to you, you can lie to them. Some<br>people lie because they are embarrassed about what they did. Some don't<br>want the truth about what they did to come out. And some are trying to<br>conceal their own illegal actions. But the actual lie is not illegal.<br><br>For example, if you stole a bicycle, and the police ask you about it and<br>you say no, you wouldn't be arrested for lying to the police. If they<br>found evidence to show that you were the bike thief, you'd be arrested<br>for stealing the bike. Your testimony would be used in court if it was<br>admissible.<br><br>The exception is when you are lying *specifically to aid a criminal and<br>to misdirect the police.* If you do this, you are committing a crime<br>called being an *accessory after the fact*. You could also be cited for<br>*aiding and abetting,* or *filing a false statement,* depending on the<br>circumstances.<br><br>Finally, Federal investigators are protected by a different law, and<br>providing materially false information to a Federal investigator is, in<br>fact, a crime. Just ask Mike Flynn.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
