<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Apologies for some of the incorrect answers, but this question is<br>frequently misunderstood.<br><br>If your Governing Documents say that you cannot park on the public<br>street within the HOA's area of responsibility, you cannot park on the<br>street. If the HOA catches you, they can issue warning letters and fines<br>according to the procedures spelled out in their Governing Documents, in<br>just the same way that they address any violation of the rules. They can<br>proceed with additional enforcement actions if you refuse to pay your<br>fines.<br><br>What they cannot do is tow or boot cars which are parked in<br>violation of their Governing Documents.<br><br>Every neighborhood I lived in had such a rule.<br><br>In my neighborhood in Colorado, it was strictly enforced. Of course, we<br>knew who owned what cars, so it was easy to enforce. The majority of the<br>homeowners wanted the rule, as it kept the neighborhood not only safe<br>but neat and tidy.<br><br>My Florida neighborhood had much more narrow streets, but they also had<br>County-placed "No Parking" signs on one side of the street, because of<br>how narrow the streets were. So while we had the rule in our Governing<br>Documents, we never enforced it. Despite some people's confusion<br>over "selective enforcement," not enforcing a rule is not selective<br>enforcement. Selective enforcement is when I apply a rule to one person<br>but not apply the same rule to someone else for the same infraction. If<br>we as a Board decide to not enforce a rule in our Governing Documents,<br>we have that authority. If the voters don't like it, they can elect<br>someone else who will enforce that rule, but we never had an issue. We<br>allowed single side of the street parking, referred any parking issues<br>on the No Parking side of the street to the County sheriff's office, and<br>everything worked out well.<br><br>\<br><br>It's important to note the difference between public streets in a HOA,<br>and *private* streets inside of a gated HOA. When you have a gated<br>HOA, the streets are owned by the HOA. The HOA can ticket drivers, they<br>can issue fines, and they can tow and/or boot cars which are parked in<br>violation of the rules.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
