<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Donald Trump says it's his call to reopen the country. Does the<br>constitution say otherwise?**<br><br>Well yes, but not in the way you might think.<br><br>The Constitution tells the various branches of government what they are<br>allowed to do. This is a very limited set of things. The Constitution<br>isn't very long. For hundreds of years, government has tried to grow<br>outside of that boundary, but it finds itself constrained by the<br>Constitution.<br><br>So it's not that the Constitution "says otherwise." It's more that the<br>Constitution doesn't say so. And if the Constitution doesn't grant the<br>authority to any branch of Federal government, the authority belongs to<br>the states.<br><br>Trump is using that specific language not because he thinks he actually<br>is king of the US, but because he is trying to put a very fine point on<br>the fact that he wants to be the one to influence the states when they<br>should start allowing businesses to re-open. He and his science team<br>have set themselves in the position to provide the bulk of the technical<br>understanding of the virus and its current impact. He also wants to be<br>the one to say that it's time to start letting people get back to work,<br>but he knows that the authority to allow businesses to re-open and<br>people to go back to work lies in the states.<br><br>But he also knows that **the people carry great sway in influencing<br>their state governments**. And if the people start to hear that Trump<br>says we should go back to work but state governors are not allowing<br>businesses to re-open, people will riot.<br><br>So ultimately, while Trump only holds advisory authority over the<br>states, not actual Constitutional directional authority, he holds great<br>sway over the minds of the people, and he will wield that to force the<br>states to comply lest they face backlash, not only now, but in November.<br>And you can rest assured that any challenger to an incumbent in November<br>will use any failure to re-open their economy as a hammer come election<br>time.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
