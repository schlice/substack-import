<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why have you not discussed this with her? You need to be having this<br>discussion with her, not with us.<br><br>You need to be telling her that you don\'t appreciate the position she<br>has put you in. It is important to understand the needs and wants of our<br>partners. But it\'s also important for our partners to understand and<br>respect our needs and wants.<br><br>It appears you two are at an impasse when it comes to this particular<br>form of role-play. Perhaps she can pick a different fetish, or frame it<br>in a different way. But one way or another, you two will have to work it<br>out.<br><br>It\'s clear that you know what she likes and dislikes, but it\'s not<br>clear that she knows what you like and dislike. And it\'s up to you to<br>continue the dialog.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
