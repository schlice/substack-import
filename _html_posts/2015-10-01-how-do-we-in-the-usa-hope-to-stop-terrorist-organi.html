<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [*Original question:* ***How do we in the USA hope to stop<br>terrorist organizations like ISIS when we can\'t even stop the mass<br>shootings by single SOB\'s with automatic weapons, such as happend in<br>Oregon today. When is it going to stop?***\<br>\<br>*First, let me clarify a few things. It appears that there was only one<br>shooter. We also know that he had \"three pistols and one rifle\" and<br>none of these appear to be automatic.*\<br>\<br>This is an example of an invalid logical comparison, or in more<br>colloquial terms, an \"apples to oranges\" comparison.\<br>\<br>ISIS is an international terrorist organization with ties to radical<br>Islam. ISIS is being handled by military and political action. As you<br>know, the military operates outside of the United States. Despite any<br>desire to the contrary, we can\'t just fly over Iran and Syria and nuke<br>them into sheets of glass, the only sure way to stop ISIS. We have to<br>proceed cautiously and diplomatically, and with the aid of international<br>allies (lest we be perceived as the \"lone wolf\" again). The ISIS issue<br>will take some time to sort out, and yes, more lives will be lost before<br>we come up with a cogent strategy to deal with them.\<br>\<br>Conversely, and as has been well documented on Quora, the majority of<br>active shooter incidents within the borders of the United States occur<br>because of mental illness and/or perceived injustices. We have a dismal<br>record of helping people with mental illness. We do a better job of<br>stigmatizing and marginalizing these people than actually helping them.<br>Deinstitutionalization did more to harm them than to help them, as the<br>people who truly need help find it harder and harder to get inpatient<br>care. We have stigmatized mental illness to such a degree that people<br>who do believe they need help won\'t get it because they know they will<br>become social outcasts, treated no better than felons.\<br>\<br>So with nowhere to turn for treatment, feeling more and more isolated,<br>they slip further and further into illness, until they truly believe<br>they can fix their social issues and any perceived injustices by taking<br>the lives of others. Once they do, they feel \"free,\" as if they have<br>been avenged, and usually take their own lives. *I suspect the shooter<br>here took his own life as well, but we don\'t know this with any<br>certainty at this point.*\<br>\<br>When is it going to stop? When we do a better job of treating the<br>severely mentally ill in this country. Ignoring the problem and saying<br>that a few simple drugs can handle mental illness does a great<br>disservice to the severely mentally ill. And shootings like this one<br>will continue until we address the issue.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
