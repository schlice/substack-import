Jean Carroll accusing Donald Trump of<br>sexual assault saying: "Trump attacked me in the dressing room of<br>Bergdorf Goodman."?**<br><br>I understandably question anyone who has not reported an assault to the<br>police, the very agency which is supposed to bring criminals to justice.<br><br>Instead, she wrote about it in her book.<br><br>So what exactly is her motivation? Why come out now? Why not come out<br>when the *Access Hollywood* tape was released? With information like<br>that, she could have assisted in derailing his presidential bid.<br><br>Instead, she reveals today, in her new book.<br><br>It seems her motivation is not to tell the truth, but to sell books.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
