<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There was an interesting thought question that was running around a few<br>years ago. We can use it to answer your question.<br><br>Assume that Hitler, on his deathbed, truly, honestly, and openly<br>confessed his sins, truly repented, and accepted Christ as his savior. I<br>mean truly, in his heart, believed what he did was wrong, confessed his<br>sins, and accepted Christ.<br><br>Would he be in heaven now?<br><br>The answer, maybe surprisingly, is yes.<br><br>And if a truly repentant Hitler could be saved and live eternally with<br>God, so can we.<br><br>Our past sins are in the past. Our past sins are covered. Being saved<br>means we *repent* of (which means turn away from) our past sinful life.<br>We *reject* that life. We *reject* those ways of thinking. Instead of<br>focusing our thoughts on those old ways, we focus our minds and our<br>hearts on God.<br><br>Will we stumble? Sure. We're still human. We still make mistakes. But we<br>don't make the same old mistakes. We don't live in our sin. We live<br>*better* than our sin.<br><br>TL;DR: Repent and believe, and you will be saved.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Will God forgive me if I\'ve rejected him for years and broke at least<br>half of his commandments? Even if he does, will he still allow me to go<br>to heaven?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
