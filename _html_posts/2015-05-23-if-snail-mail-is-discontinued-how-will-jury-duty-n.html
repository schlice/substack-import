<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Guaranteed delivery doesn\'t exist in email. But there are<br>other methods.\<br>\<br>If snail mail is discontinued, mail delivery to your home will be picked<br>up by a private company like FedEx. They will have to re-tool some, but<br>they can do it.\<br>\<br>You can send an email/text message asking the prospective juror to visit<br>a website to confirm the jury duty. You may not get mail at your<br>physical address, but everyone has a phone, and the vast majority of<br>them can receive SMS messages.\<br>\<br>You can be directed to call a number to verify your jury duty.\<br>\<br>The clerk\'s office may call you and leave you a message.\<br>\<br>There are lots of creative ways to work around the<br>problem.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
