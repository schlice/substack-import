<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What was the US Air force programme in the 1950\'s that allowed<br>applicants with two years of college enter flight school and become<br>officers if they graduated flight school, or become enlisted men if they<br>failed?**<br><br>I think you'll find this page at Wikipedia illuminating. It was more<br>than just the 50s; in fact, it ended in the 60s. But it was training<br>pilots starting in 1907:<br><br>> *The* *Flying / Aviation Cadet Pilot Training Program* *was<br>> originally created by the U.S. Army to train its pilots. Originally<br>> created in 1907 by the U.S. Army Signal Corps, it expanded as the<br>> Army\'s air assets increased. Candidates originally had to be between<br>> the ages of 19 and 25, athletic, and honest. Two years of college or<br>> three years of a scientific or technical education were required.<br>> Cadets were supposed to be unmarried and pledged not to marry during<br>> training. From 1907 to 1920, pilot officers were considered part of<br>> the Signal Corps or the Signal Officer Reserve Corps. After 1920, they<br>> were considered part of their own separate organization, the U.S. Army<br>> Air Service (1918--1926).*<br>><br>> *The U.S. Army Air Corps Training Center (USAACTC) was at Duncan<br>> Field, San Antonio, Texas from 1926 to 1931 and Randolph Field from<br>> 1931 to 1939. Two more centers were activated on 8 July 1940: the West<br>> Coast Army Air Corps Training Center (WCAACTC) in Sunnyvale,<br>> California and the Southeast Army Air Corps Training Center (SAACTC)<br>> in Montgomery, Alabama. The SAACTC was later renamed the Gulf Coast<br>> Army Air Corps Center (GCAACTC). In 1942, the Army moved the WCAACTC<br>> from Moffett Field to Santa Ana Army Air Base (SAAAB), located on West<br>> 8th Street in Santa Ana, California.*<br>><br>> *On January 23, 1942 the USAAF created the separate Air Corps Flying<br>> Training Command and the Air Corps Technical Training Command to<br>> control all aspects of technical and aviation training. Originally<br>> formed in Washington, D.C., they moved to facilities at Fort Worth,<br>> Texas in July. They were renamed the Army Air Forces Flight Training<br>> Command and Army Air Forces Technical Training Command respectively in<br>> March, 1942. They were later unified as the Army Air Forces Training<br>> Command (July, 1943 - June, 1946)*<br>><br>> *In September 1947, the U.S. Army Air Forces became a separate and<br>> independent service, renamed the United States Air Force (USAF). At<br>> the time, the newly created Air Force had no service academy of its<br>> own yet (the USMA and USNA had options for their cadets and<br>> midshipmen, respectively, to become USAF officers). Separate Air Force<br>> ROTC and Officer Candidate School (later retitled Officer Training<br>> School) programs were still being established. The Aviation Cadet<br>> Training Program continued to remain as a principal source of the Air<br>> Force\'s pilots and navigators and they wore the same basic uniform as<br>> Air Force officers.*\[1\](#MRyIS){#cite-MRyIS .citation_link}<br><br>The program was modified several times during its existence, but it was<br>eventually phased out in 1960, a year after the Air Force Academy<br>started graduating Air Force officers. The Air Force introduced<br>Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) to replace the Aviation Cadet<br>Training Program, and USAFA, OTS, and AFROTC would supply all of the<br>students.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-MRyIS){.citation_index} [[Aviation Cadet Training Program<br>(USAAF) -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9a6b39&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_Cadet_Training_Program_(USAAF)){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
