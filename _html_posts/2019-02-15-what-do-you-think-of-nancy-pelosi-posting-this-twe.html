<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What do you think of Nancy Pelosi posting this tweet after Donald<br>Trump announced that he is going to declare a national emergency:<br>"Another demonstration of his naked contempt for the rule of law."?**<br><br>She's on the right track, but barking up the wrong tree.<br><br>The President does have the legal authority to declare a national<br>emergency. She should know. It's her organization that *gave* him the<br>authority to do so. Congress wrote the National Emergencies Act in 1976,<br>giving the President the authority to declare a national emergency.<br>Congress even wrote 470 different provisions into Federal laws that the<br>President can invoke by declaring a national emergency.<br><br>Congress gave the President the authority, by law, to declare national<br>emergencies. **So she is 100% wrong when she declares that the President<br>is acting in contempt of the law.**<br><br>However, the President *may* be doing something else: he may be<br>abusing his authority under the National Emergencies Act in order to<br>bypass the provisions of the Constitution in Article I. *This* is<br>the tree up which she should be barking. She should be organizing her<br>compatriots in order to file Articles of Impeachment against the<br>President for abuse of power. They will rightly be able to claim that<br>the President is using the national emergency authority (which he<br>legally has) in order to bypass Article I of the Constitution and seek<br>funding for his border wall. This would be a valid cause for<br>impeachment. Russia collusion be damned, even if the courts find the<br>President's actions legal under the law, if the President is abusing the<br>national emergency power just to bypass Congress and get more funding<br>for the wall, this would be an act worthy of Articles of Impeachment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
