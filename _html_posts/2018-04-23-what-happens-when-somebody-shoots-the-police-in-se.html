<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What happens when somebody shoots the police in self-defence?<br><br>You can only defend yourself against someone who is *unlawfully*<br>using force against you.<br><br>In the United States, when a police officer is acting "under color of<br>law," which means a police officer is functioning as a law enforcement<br>officer and carrying out his duties under the law, he is not acting<br>unlawfully.<br><br>Using force against a police officer (including deadly force) who is<br>lawfully performing his duties is a crime. It is called **resisting<br>arrest. Some jurisdictions also have a crime called failure to<br>follow lawful order or directive.**<br><br>If you shoot a police officer and you believe your action was<br>permissible because you were acting in self-defense, you would have to<br>prove that the police officer was not acting under color of law, or the<br>police officer's actions put him outside of the law. That is the only<br>way your actions would be considered self-defense. Very rarely in this<br>country is this ever found to be the case.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
