<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you have to provide identification to a law enforcement officer if<br>you\'re on a public sidewalk?**<br><br>Physical identification. There is no requirement to carry<br>identification unless you are participating in some licensed activity<br>(driving a car, selling food from a food cart, etc).<br><br>Positively identifying yourself. There is a difference between<br>"providing identification" and "providing your real name and address,"<br>even though the latter is still "providing identification." Whether or<br>not you have to do the latter depends on what state you live in, and the<br>circumstances surrounding your conversation with the police.<br><br>Under regular circumstances, if you're just chatting with a police<br>officer, you are having a *consensual conversation* (which is totally<br>acceptable and normal, like what human beings do). In such a scenario,<br>you aren't required to tell him or her anything at all in particular.<br>You can say nothing at all, but that just makes you look weird.<br><br>On the other hand, the police could be conducting what is known as a<br>*Terry stop* (named after the Supreme Court decision which created it,<br>*Terry v. Ohio*). In that case, you are not having a casual<br>conversation. You are experiencing *custodial interrogation*, because<br>you are essentially barred from leaving until the *Terry* stop is<br>concluded. In this case, whether or not you are required by law to<br>positively identify yourself and not lie about it differs among the<br>states. Twenty five states (as of this writing) have a "stop and<br>identify" law requiring you to provide your real name and address in the<br>event of a *Terry* stop. In these states, if you are under custodial<br>interrogation, when you are asked, you are required to provide your real<br>name and address, and you can be arrested for failing to do this all by<br>itself. For any other questions, you can exercise your Miranda rights<br>and remain silent until you've had the chance to talk to a lawyer (just<br>say "I would like to remain silent" or "I do not want to answer any<br>questions"). If your state does not have a "stop and identify" law, you<br>do not have to give your real name or address. This doesn't mean you<br>won't be arrested, it just means you don't have to say anything at all<br>(including your real name) until you've talked to your lawyer. If you're<br>not sure whether or not the police are conducting a *Terry* stop, ask if<br>you are free to leave. If the police say no, then you are being<br>temporarily detained, and whether or not you must provide your real name<br>and address is a matter of law in your state. Be sure you know it.<br><br>[[States with "stop and identify"<br>laws](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d154ad&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_and_identify_statutes%23Obligation_to_identify){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
