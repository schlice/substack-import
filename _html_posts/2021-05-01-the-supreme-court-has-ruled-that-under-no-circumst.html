<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The devil is in the details, as they say.<br><br>SCOTUS decisions have indeed said that the police are not obligated to<br>help you. What this means in practice is that if you are injured by<br>something or someone the police failed to stop, you cannot sue them for<br>that failure. For example, if the police release a suspect from custody<br>and that suspect gets a weapon and kills your family member, you cannot<br>sue the police for releasing that person from custody, even if they knew<br>the person was dangerous and could have been a threat.<br><br>Police are required to provide general protection to the public at<br>large, but they have no specific duty to keep you free from harm.<br><br>So why do we need them if they're not here to protect us? We need them<br>to perform their actual job: law enforcement. That means that when<br>someone refuses to follow the law, the police bring them to see a judge.<br>That's about the extent of their jobs. They are not your personal<br>bodyguards. They are not designed, nor could they ever be, to keep you<br>free from harm.<br><br>According to the Constitution, that's your job.<br><br>(EDIT) Let's address your "hunt" comment. Why, pray tell, would the<br>police be hunting you? Perhaps because they are doing their job? You<br>know, that pesky "law enforcement" job? Where they go after the people<br>who broke the law?<br><br>**People don't like the police because the police remind us that there<br>are consequences for our actions.**<br><br>Instead of looking askance at the police for doing the jobs we asked<br>them to do, maybe instead you should look at yourself and see if there<br>is any reason that they are coming for you.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**The Supreme Court has ruled that under no circumstances are the police<br>obligated to help you. So why do we need police officers if they are<br>only here to hunt us?**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
