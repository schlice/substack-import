<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Whether or not the officer was justified in beating you is<br>a matter of fact to be determined by a court. The officer would have to<br>show you were resisting arrest, and all attempts to get you to comply<br>were failing. Whether or not you were legally justified in fighting back<br>is also a matter of fact that is to be determined in a court.<br>Self-defense is an affirmative defense under the law to the charge of<br>assault.\<br>\<br>As a matter of *law*, there are no laws that I know of that allow you to<br>legally assault a police officer, regardless of the reason. In fact,<br>assaulting a police officer is usually considered *aggravated* assault.\<br>\<br>What this means is that you can attempt to defend yourself if you<br>believe you are complying with the officer\'s directions and the officer<br>will not stop. Be aware of a few things, though:\<br>]<br><br>1.  If the officer sees your attempt at self-defense as continued<br>    resistance to arrest, your actions will only cause him to continue<br>    attempting to cause you to no longer resist. In other words, if he<br>    was beating you, seeing you attempt to defend yourself will probably<br>    just make him keep going.<br>2.  Then, after you\'re done being beaten, you will be arrested and<br>    charged with whatever you were going to be originally charged with,<br>    *and* you will also be charged with aggravated assault. You will not<br>    only have to defend yourself against the charge of whatever it was<br>    that the officer was arresting you for in the first place, you would<br>    also have to defend yourself against an aggravated assault charge.<br><br>Best bet: cover up in the fetal position until the beating stops. If the<br>officers try to move you, grab your hands and cuff you, go limp: let<br>them move you. It\'s not likely you will be beaten while others are<br>trying to cuff you, as their attempts to beat you would likely intersect<br>with the officers trying to cuff you, so they\'d be hurting each other.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
