<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you think professionals (doctors, police officers, teachers) should<br>be held accountable after being convicted of a crime, including paying<br>restitution to their victims?**<br><br>Of course they should; that's what the civil court system is for. The<br>criminal courts find people guilty of crimes and send them to jail; the<br>civil courts find people responsible for actions and pay restitution to<br>their victims. The only penalty in a civil court is money to a victim.<br>The penalty in a criminal court is jail time (but also fines), a<br>punishment owed to the state (or the people in general).<br><br>Whether or not someone is convicted of a crime, they can be sued in<br>civil court and can be forced to pay restitution to their victims (or<br>their victim's estate). The most famous recent example of this is OJ<br>Simpson. He was found not guilty for the murder of his ex-wife and her<br>friend, but he was sued and was found to be responsible for her death<br>and the remainder of his fortune was paid out to the estates of the<br>victims.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
