<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can someone get in trouble for lying about military service?<br><br>As with all things legal, the answer is "it depends." What it depends on<br>is *whether or not you get financial gain from your lie.*<br><br>- If you do, this is a crime. At the state level, this is called<br>  theft of service. At the Federal level, this is prohibited under<br>  the Stolen Valor Act.<br>- If you do not, then it is technically not illegal to lie about<br>  being a military veteran, or being active duty, or being a retiree.<br>  It's protected by the 1st Amendment, and case law has held the same<br>  thing. There are Federal laws which prohibit non-military personnel<br>  from wearing military uniforms, but they are largely unenforceable<br>  because of 1A protections.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
