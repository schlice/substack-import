<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No.<br><br>If you're facing termination without the option of receiving<br>unemployment benefits, then you are being terminated *for cause*.<br>This means you have done something seriously wrong, something which<br>violated the terms of your employment agreement. Stealing, misconduct,<br>poor performance, or some other violation of company policy are all<br>examples of terminations for cause.<br><br>Termination without cause means that you didn't do anything wrong, but<br>you were terminated anyway. Company restructuring which also eliminated<br>your position, company downsizing, or an economic downturn can all<br>result in termination without cause.<br><br>Termination for cause generally makes you ineligible for unemployment<br>benefits. Similarly, quitting generally makes you ineligible for<br>unemployment benefits. Generally, you can only receive unemployment<br>benefits if you are terminated without cause.<br><br>With all this in mind, if you quit in lieu of being fired, it's not<br>unethical. You're being fired anyway because of something you did wrong.<br>Quitting in lieu of being fired doesn't change the ethical calculation<br>at all, other than to publicly admit that you knew you did something<br>wrong and you quit before the company could get around to firing you.<br>You will still be listed as quitting in lieu of termination for cause,<br>if anyone asks your former employer whether or not you left on "good<br>terms."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
