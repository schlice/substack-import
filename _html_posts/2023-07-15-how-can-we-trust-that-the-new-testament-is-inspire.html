<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ah, very good question! We often lump the New Testament in with the<br>whole Bible and say it's all God-breathed (which it is), but that does<br>not a logical proof make.<br><br>So what can we say specifically about the Bible that would convince us<br>that it (all of it, including the New Testament) is the inspired word of<br>God?<br><br>We know the Bible is inspired by God because Jesus said it is, and Jesus<br>is God.<br><br>And how do we know that Jesus is who He said He is?<br><br>We know Jesus is who He said He is because of three main reasons:<br><br>1.  He fulfilled many prophecies which were written about Himself<br>    thousands of years before He was born<br>2.  He lived a sinless life and performed miracles in the sight of many<br>    eyewitnesses, and we know that miracles can be used to confirm a<br>    message from God (acts of God confirm a word from God)<br>3.  He predicted, and then accomplished, his resurrection.<br><br>Therefore, since Jesus (who is God) taught that the Bible is the word of<br>God, it is true that the Bible (all of it) is the divinely inspired word<br>of God.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
