<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you do want to have sex with him, his current relationship status<br>is his business. It might make living where you do a little more<br>uncomfortable, as the live-in girlfriend may not be happy with you, but<br>that's really his problem, not yours. You don't know, they may have an<br>open relationship. If the girlfriend has a problem with it, make sure<br>you tell her that he came on to you, not the other way around. It's<br>not your job to turn him away simply because he's already in a<br>relationship. His relationship status and his willingness to step<br>outside of it is a reflection on him, not on you. So long as you aren't<br>interested in a relationship with him (considering that he's so willing<br>to step out on a girl he's in a relationship with; he'd do the same with<br>you), then go for it. Have fun. Don't expect anything more from him. If<br>you do it, make sure you're not expecting something more. Clearly,<br>you'll only end up hurt.<br><br>If you don't want to have sex with him, tell him so. Break his<br>little heart if you must. But you control when you have sex, not him.<br>Don't give him wiggle room here, because you will only invite him to<br>keep pressuring you. Be very assertive with him, and tell him you don't<br>want to have sex, period.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**What can you do to avoid having sex when you know you shouldn\'t?<br>Background: my neighbor has been coming on to me for years and I\'ve<br>done everything I can to resist him because he has a girlfriend (that he<br>lives with).**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
