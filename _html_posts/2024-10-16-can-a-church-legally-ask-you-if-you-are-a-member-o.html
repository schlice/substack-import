<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The First Amendment prohibits the government from creating laws<br>governing the free exercise of religion.<br><br>Therefore, there are no laws surrounding how a church may operate, or<br>how it may run its membership.<br><br>Additionally, some churches require *transfer of membership*, which is a<br>valid reason to know if you have a membership at another church. When I<br>was a member of the United Methodist Church (a long time before its<br>schism), you could become a member by *transfer of membership*. In that<br>case, they'd need to know where you were previously a member so they<br>could transfer your membership. It allowed you to skip a lot of the<br>formalities of becoming a member in a new church.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
