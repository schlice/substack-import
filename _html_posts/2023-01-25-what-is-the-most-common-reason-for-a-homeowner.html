<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Time and obstinance.<br><br>Any problem faced by a Homeowner's Association can be solved given<br>enough time and a homeowner who is willing to work with the HOA. No fine<br>should ever turn into a lien and a subsequent foreclosure if those two<br>things are present.<br><br>HOAs foreclose on homeowners when too much time has passed, and the<br>homeowner is not being reasonable.<br><br>Dues, late fees, and fines can accumulate if left unattended. Once those<br>amounts reach a certain threshold (it's \$1000 in the state of Florida),<br>the account can be transferred to the HOA's attorney to begin lien<br>proceedings. We have found that obstinate homeowners loosen up their<br>obstinance when they learn that their house is getting a lien recorded<br>against it.<br><br>But if they still steadfastly refuse to pay and refuse to even negotiate<br>in good faith, and enough time has passed, the attorney (with the<br>consent of the Board) can foreclose on that lien to collect the money<br>they are due (plus attorney's fees), which by the way was still<br>accumulating during all of that time of obstinance.<br><br>If receiving notice of a lien being filed against your property isn't<br>enough to wake you up, then perhaps receiving a notice that a lienholder<br>is moving to foreclose on that lien is. And from my experience, it<br>usually is. Homeowners suddenly get really communicative when they get a<br>letter from a lawyer saying that their lien is going to be foreclosed.<br><br>But it should never come to that. It only goes that far when homeowners<br>won't communicate with the HOA (and eventually with the HOA's attorney).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
