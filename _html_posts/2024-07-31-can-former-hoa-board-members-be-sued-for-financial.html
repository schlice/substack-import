<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You will find that in the United States, anyone can be sued for<br>anything. Very few lawsuits are *prohibited*.<br><br>But what you will also find in most HOAs is that Board members are<br>covered by insurance. It is commonly referred to as D&O insurance<br>(Director and Officer insurance).<br><br>D&O insurance reimburses the defense costs incurred by board members,<br>managers, and employees in defending against claims made by homeowners<br>or other third parties for alleged wrongdoing. D&O insurance also covers<br>**monetary damages, settlements, and awards resulting from such<br>claims**.<br><br>So while you can sue and potentially end up with a settlement, it won't<br>affect the former Board member financially. Their D&O insurance still<br>covers them after they leave the Board, so long as they were covered<br>during the period of time when the mismanagement was alleged to have<br>occurred. This is important because many lawsuits are filed long after<br>the Board member has left the Board.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
