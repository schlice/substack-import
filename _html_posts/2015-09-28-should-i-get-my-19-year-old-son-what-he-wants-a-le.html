<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Depends on your parenting style.\<br>\<br>I know some people that make their kids buy their own cars. Some will<br>buy their kids a used but reasonable car. And others will buy their kids<br>better cars than they themselves own.\<br>\<br>I can\'t tell you what\'s right for you. What\'s right for you is up to<br>you as a parent. I can only tell you what I\'d do. What I\'d do is<br>almost certainly different than what you\'d do, which is why it\'s tough<br>to answer this question.\<br>\<br>I think from a practical perspective (not a parenting perspective),<br>buying your kids a luxury car costs more overall than buying your kids a<br>non-luxury car. Besides the cost of the car, the cost of maintenance,<br>the cost of insurance, and other incidental costs will all be higher. So<br>practically speaking, the luxury car will cost you *more* in the long<br>run than a cheaper car.\<br>\<br>What car he has will make no difference in his life whatsoever. He has<br>the freedom afforded by a car, and I can tell you from my own<br>perspective that kids will be thrilled with whatever car they have, and<br>they will baby the heck out of it (wash/wax, vacuumed floors, it will<br>look better than his room).\<br>\<br>I would probably add though that buying a luxury item brings with it a<br>whole host of associated worries. I had a friend who actually has a<br>\$8,000 watch (it was an inherited piece). He hated wearing it. Every<br>time his arm brushed up against something, he immediately thought, \"Oh<br>no, is the watch okay?\" He was totally self-conscious every time he<br>wore it. So he got a nice display case for it and bought a \$10 watch to<br>wear daily. Who knows, maybe he\'ll wear it on special occasions. Maybe<br>not. But he worries much less now.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
