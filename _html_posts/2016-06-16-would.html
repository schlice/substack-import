<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Please expound on "safer." Safer for whom?<br><br>If you're referring to the intended target, a gun is designed to kill.<br>Are you trying to make the gun do something it's not designed to do?<br>Make it less death-y? I don't see that happening any time soon.<br><br>Are you asking about making the gun safer for the user? The gun is<br>already very safe to use. Almost anyone can successfully deploy a gun<br>with almost no risk of physical injury to themselves. They do have to be<br>careful to wear eye and ear protection, but beyond that, it's very safe<br>to use.<br><br>If the guns captured its spent casings, or were built with suppressors,<br>it would be a great thing, because they would indeed make guns safer,<br>but suppressors are restricted under the National Firearms Act (thanks,<br>Hollywood).<br><br>(EDIT) Details were added, so I'll address those now.<br><br>> *What if we/would it be possible to a gun buyback program and instead<br>> distribute government-approved guns with a fingerprint verification<br>> feature so that only approved users can actually operate the gun?<br>> Would it even be possible to make such a gun?*<br><br>This question has also been asked and answered a million times on Quora.<br><br>A gun is a simple mechanical device. The thing that makes a gun an ideal<br>tool in a life-or-death scenario is its simplicity. You're proposing to<br>take a simple mechanical device and convert it into an electromechanical<br>device that is now four times more complex, and ten times more<br>expensive, as well as multiple times less reliable. Now I have to worry<br>about batteries, and the system recognizing my fingerprint. What if the<br>battery is dead? What if the fingerprint reader fails? How easy would it<br>be to disable the fingerprint reader system and revert the gun to a<br>simple mechanical device? And as we've said over and over, who will own<br>these guns? Law-abiding citizens. Who will own traditional guns?<br>Criminals. Will traditional guns fail to exist once this "smart gun" is<br>introduced? Hardly. Did the Australian gun buy-back get them 100% of the<br>guns in Australia? Not even close. And most of the guns that were turned<br>in were rusty old pieces of junk from the back of someone's basement.<br><br>I glossed over the cost, but there are 300 million guns in America. So<br>considering you're making the gun ten times more expensive, where<br>exactly are we going to come up with the 30 BILLION dollars to fund<br>this initiative? And the technology doesn't even exist yet! We can't<br>even figure out how to do healthcare; you think you're going to get a<br>majority of Americans to agree to swap out their trustworthy handguns<br>and rifles for this untested, unproven, unreliable electromechanical<br>crap that anyone with a mechanical degree of any kind can retrofit in<br>minutes?<br><br>In short, I think not.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
