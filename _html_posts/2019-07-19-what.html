<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What\'s your reaction to the U.S. Air Force telling the Washington<br>Post that the\"Facebook Storm Area 51\", cannot happen and that\" any<br>attempt to illegally access military installations is dangerous\"?**<br><br>The Air Force was telling the truth. You cannot storm Area 51.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-29a5605faaf97cece06f4f206e4d3695){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-29a5605faaf97cece06f4f206e4d3695"<br>master_w="1280" master_h="960"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>This is a sign from the outer border of Area 51. The little inset sign<br>on the big one has little red words on the bottom which read: "Use of<br>deadly force is authorized." It's true. I used to work at another<br>Priority 1 non-nuclear facility: NORAD. We had the same signs. I carried<br>the guns.<br><br>The difference at Area 51 is that the actual facility is surrounded by<br>*thousands of acres of desert terrain,* which is all owned by the<br>government. Anyone even hanging around the outer border not in a common<br>public area will incur a visit by the local sheriff. Anyone entering the<br>outer border will be arrested.<br><br>But what about the base, you say? The closest you can get to the base on<br>public land is Tikaboo Peak, which is still 26 miles from the facility.<br>You'll have a long way to Naruto run before you even make it to the<br>fence. Same distance as a marathon, basically, but through the desert.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
