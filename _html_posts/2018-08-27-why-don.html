<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why don't cops give out tickets for tailgating? If holding a phone is<br>against the law, then why not enforce tailgating rules? Isn't that just<br>as dangerous?**<br><br>They do, just not when you expect.<br><br>The violation is not called "tailgating," it's called "following too<br>closely." Our local police issue that ticket many times a day. But<br>usually it's in conjunction with a rear-end collision.<br><br>When you are involved in a rear-end collision in Colorado, *the driver<br>at the rear is always at fault.* The only time that would be at issue is<br>if there was some kind of brake check going on, and the rear driver<br>would have to prove that (hope he has cameras on his car). That rear<br>driver is ticketed for causing the accident. What's the law violated?<br>Yep, you guessed it: following too closely.<br><br>In most other cases, it's really difficult for a police officer to see<br>tailgating while its ongoing. It happens quickly, and resolves just as<br>quickly. When the tailgating causes an accident, however, the officers<br>universally cite the driver for that violation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
