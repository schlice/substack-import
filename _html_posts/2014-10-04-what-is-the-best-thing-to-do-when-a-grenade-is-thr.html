<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Assuming that you\'re in some sort of combat scenario.\<br>\<br>1. Grab it and throw it back.\<br>\<br>2. If you can\'t do that, grab your bucket (helmet), and dive on top of<br>it, placing your bucket on top of the grenade, and your body on top of<br>the bucket. Your feet and lower legs will probably get some shrapnel,<br>but better that than everyone else in your squad dying.\<br>\<br>Remember what Spock said: \"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of<br>the one.\"]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
