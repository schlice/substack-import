<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Be wary of the logical fallacy called "hasty generalization." You're<br>taking what *some* Christian parents do and you are generalizing and<br>assuming that *all* Christian parents do this, when you have no evidence<br>of this.<br><br>I will absolutely agree with you that *some* Christian parents do this,<br>because they themselves never question the Bible.<br><br>There is an entire discipline within religion called *apologetics.*<br>Apologetics is the practice of defending religious beliefs through<br>discourse and systematic argumentation. It\'s also a branch of Christian<br>theology that studies and defends Christianity (commonly referred to as<br>Christian Apologetics, for obvious reasons). Apologetics involves using<br>historical, evidential, and reasonable facts to defend Christian<br>theology. For example, apologetics might consider if the Bible is<br>trustworthy, if God exists, and how to know if Jesus died. In my own<br>apologetics studies, I have examined each of these topics.<br><br>Not every Christian studies apologetics, because **doing so is not<br>necessary for salvation.** Perhaps you think it to be intellectually<br>lazy, and you are entitled to that opinion. However, the truth that<br>apologetics are not required for salvation doesn't change based on your<br>opinion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
