<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So there's a statement and a question here. Let's take them one at a<br>time.<br><br>> If you don't sin then Jesus died for nothing.<br><br>Jesus made it quite clear that no one "can't sin."<br><br>> "You have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not<br>> murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.' But I say to<br>> you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to<br>> judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council;<br>> and whoever says, 'You fool!' will be liable to the hell of fire. So<br>> if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that<br>> your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before<br>> the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come<br>> and offer your gift. Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you<br>> are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the<br>> judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison. Truly, I<br>> say to you, you will never get out until you have paid the last penny.<br>><br>> "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But<br>> I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent<br>> has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right<br>> eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better<br>> that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown<br>> into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and<br>> throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than<br>> that your whole body go into hell."<br><br>I mean, whoa, this is pretty heavy, no? Jesus just said that if I'm<br>angry with my brother I'm going to hell? Jesus says that if I look at<br>another woman with lustful intent I'm an adulterer? Are you serious? I<br>can't control my own mind! My brain goes where it wants to go! I can't<br>stop that! And yeah, I've been angry with my brother for the last 15<br>years, so I'm automatically going to hell?<br><br>Jesus' point here was that without Him, it's impossible to please God.<br>We will *never* be good enough on our own. We can never wash enough to<br>be clean enough to meet God's standards. Without Him, we have nothing.<br><br>TL;DR: We can never not sin. Jesus' death, therefore, was salvific for<br>everyone, for all time.<br><br>> What will you do to make Jesus proud today?<br><br>Honor that gift. Respect that gift. Thank Jesus every day for giving you<br>that gift. And pattern your life as someone who has been given such a<br>gift.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
