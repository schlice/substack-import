<br><br><p>and in true Democrat fashion, they waited until President Trump was out of the country before stabbing him in the back. Democrats get a job?"<br>date: "May 15, 2025 01:47 PM PDT"<br>tags: "policy-analysis"</p><br><hr /><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Look, I love to dog on Democrats every day and twice on Sunday, but you<br>got suckered by fake news.<br><br>Yes, there was a lone Democrat (Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Mich.) pushing for<br>Articles of Impeachment, and two days ago, he was about to introduce a<br>measure which would have *forced* the House to vote on his articles.<br><br>House Democrat leadership took him into a room and beat him squarely<br>about the head and shoulders, after which he reconsidered his notion to<br>force a vote on his articles.<br><br>He came out of said room and made a glowing pronouncement that he's not<br>pursuing his motion to force the vote because, he says, Trump committed<br>*even more impeachable offenses* since he penned his seven Articles<br>of Impeachment.<br><br>> "In the fifteen days since I filed seven articles of impeachment<br>> against President Trump, he has committed more impeachable offenses,<br>> most dangerously, accepting a \$400 million private jet from Qatar,<br>> which even Republican Members of Congress have called wrong," Thanedar<br>> wrote on the social platform X.<br>><br>> "So, after talking with many colleagues, I have decided not to force a<br>> vote on impeachment today," he continued. "Instead, I will add to my<br>> articles of impeachment and continue to rally the support of both<br>> Democrats and Republicans to defend the Constitution with<br>> me."\[1\](#dCeoP){#cite-dCeoP .citation_link}<br><br>In reality, top Democrat leaders told him that pushing this now is a<br>distraction, will only fuel the Republican narrative against them, and<br>it will force Democrats to be on the record about some things which they<br>already walked back in their districts. So they made him back off.<br><br>The whole "plane" thing just cracks me up. I just love how when any<br>Republican thinks that accepting a plane from Qatar is "smelly" (Sen.<br>Rand Paul), then suddenly all Republicans believe that accepting the<br>plane is "wrong." First, it's only wrong if Congress doesn't approve the<br>gift. Second, it's not a Constitutional violation because it's not<br>enriching Trump. The plane is going to the Air Force, and then to the<br>Trump Library, hardly an emolument. Next, the plane was not a condition<br>of any deal; it was a free gift from Qatar; no strings were attached to<br>it, and no future consideration will be given for it. And finally, it<br>still doesn't count as an impeachable offense just because you think<br>it's wrong. Impeachment isn't to be used to justify your opinion on<br>someone's behavior. That's what the ballot box is for.<br><br>I expect that if the deal is to go through (nothing is done yet on the<br>plane, BTW), Congress will have the opportunity to approve the gift.<br><br>From a security standpoint, I certainly wouldn't use the plane as Air<br>Force One without a substantial refit, but if they do such a refit, it<br>would be a substantially cheaper way to get an updated AF1 into the<br>inventory assuming Congress accepts the gift.<br><br>Regardless, Articles of Impeachment just prove that Democrats believe<br>that you can basically impeach anyone for anything you don't like, even<br>though impeachment was Constitutionally reserved for "high crimes and<br>misdemeanors," not Constitutionally-approved processes which haven't<br>even concluded yet.<br><br>But whatever, radical progressives have taken over the Democrat party,<br>and they show no sign of retreating in their far-left nuttiness.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-dCeoP){.citation_index}<br>[https://thehill.com/homenews/hou\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=be389a&url=https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5300940-house-drops-vote-trump-impeachment/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="thehill.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
