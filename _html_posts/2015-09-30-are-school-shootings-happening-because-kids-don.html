<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Kids not respecting firearms is indeed a travesty, and<br>parents should be held responsible when their children<br>approach/touch/use firearms inappropriately, indicating that they have<br>not been taught a healthy respect for the firearm. The NRA did a kid\'s<br>public service video a number of years ago called \"Gun Safety with<br>Eddie Eagle.\" (You know it was a number of years ago because it was<br>hosted by [[Jason<br>Priestley](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e18f9c&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Priestley){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}). It had a catchy little<br>tune and taught this key lesson to kids who see firearms without an<br>adult present:\<br>]<br><br>- Stop<br>- Don\'t Touch<br>- Leave the Area<br>- Tell an Adult<br><br>Clearly, it never caught on because the people that truly need it look<br>at it and say, \"Eww, the NRA made this\...\"\<br>\<br>However (and I\'m aware), I\'m off-topic.\<br>\<br>*THIS IS NOT WHY SCHOOL SHOOTINGS OCCUR!*\<br>\<br>Invariably, school shootings occur because of several factors, but<br>primarily they are mental illness and/or perceived injustices. The<br>mental illness allows the invalid thought that says that I can solve my<br>perceived injustice problems by killing others.\<br>\<br>Active shooters, almost to a person, know that their shooting is going<br>to be the last big hurrah, and they are going to go down and want to<br>take as many others with them as they can.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
