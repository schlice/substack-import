Statutory rape is illegal because the<br>states have decided that persons under the age of consent simply do not<br>have the mental capacity to make the decision as to whether or not they<br>should engage in sexual activity, and do not have the capacity to resist<br>coercion.<br><br>Whether or not statutory rape is immoral is between you and your morals.<br>Laws do not define morality. Laws define a base set of rules we must<br>follow in society in order to get along together and allow for peaceful<br>co-existence. Morality is defined by your upbringing, your values, and<br>your religion (if you are religious). Sometimes, societal norms act as a<br>substitute for morals, but usually people form their morals while they<br>are children and young adults.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
