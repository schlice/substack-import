<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Remember, there is a difference between someone who calls themselves<br>Christian, who goes to church every week, reads the bible, helps the<br>poor, *but is not saved*, and someone who calls themselves Christian<br>*because they are saved.* When I say that someone is "Christian," it is<br>because they are *saved*.<br><br>When someone becomes Christian (i.e. they accept Christ as their Savior<br>and commit their lives to Him), it is because God has already called<br>them to belief, and He has changed their heart from their old "hearts of<br>stone" and has given them hearts which can only love Him.<br><br>> I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will<br>> cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols. I will<br>> give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from<br>> you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put<br>> my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to<br>> keep my laws. Then you will live in the land I gave your ancestors;<br>> you will be my people, and I will be your God. --- Ezekiel 36:25--28<br>> NIV<br><br>This idea is echoed by Jesus:<br><br>> "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give<br>> them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch<br>> them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater<br>> than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand.<br>> I and the Father are one." (John 10:27-30)<br><br>This process is what we called "being born again," or the more correct<br>terminology is *regeneration.* This new "heart of flesh" we receive<br>is only capable of loving God. Notice that it says that God will put His<br>Spirit in us which will move us to "follow His decrees and keep His<br>laws."<br><br>If God has done this, then you will love Him.<br><br>It's also another principle: "Once saved, always saved." These passages,<br>among others, indicate that once a person is saved, they are always<br>saved. They can never "lose" their salvation.<br><br>Therefore, logically speaking, if you "stop" loving Him, you did not<br>have His Spirit in you, because His Spirit is incapable of not loving<br>Him, and therefore you too would be incapable of not loving Him.<br><br>So for someone to say they are an "ex-Christian," it is perfectly<br>reasonable for Christians to question whether or not that person was<br>ever truly saved in the first place.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
