<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can delete apps from the home screen, but they will always show up<br>in the \"Apps Drawer\" or the \"Apps List,\" depending on what launcher<br>you use. Additionally, they will always be visible in your \"Installed<br>Applications\" list in your Settings.<br><br>If you have a *rooted* phone, you can use an app called AppHider<br>which is available in the Google Play store. Again, this app only works<br>when you have a rooted phone. You dial a sequence into the Phone dialer<br>and your apps become unhidden. AppHider can even be set to notify you to<br>re-hide your apps once you\'re done using them. They will be gone from<br>both the apps list and the \"Installed Applications\" list in your<br>Settings.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
