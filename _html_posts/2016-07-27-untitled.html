<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I see where you're going here. Just know that Quora is not a debate<br>site. I'm not here to debate you about the US invasion of Iraq. If you<br>want to ask about the legality of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, then<br>ask that specific question. I will delete any further attempts to<br>quibble with my answer, but because I'm feeling rather litigious today,<br>I'll give you an answer.<br><br>The legality of the war was questioned from day 1. Any healthy democracy<br>should question the motives of its leaders. Ultimately though, under<br>national law, we approved the war. Congress authorized the war under the<br>[[Iraq<br>Resolution](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0af21a&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Resolution_to_Authorize_the_Use_of_United_States_Armed_Forces_Against_Iraq){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, otherwise known as the<br>"Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces<br>Against Iraq." This authorized the war under United States law.<br><br>Under international law, the case is far more fuzzy. The US and other<br>member states used the argument that Iraq was in violation of UN<br>Resolutions 660 and 678 when they invaded Kuwait in 1990. The US also<br>used Resolution 1441 as a legal standard to invade Iraq, when they<br>failed to fully submit to weapons inspections and failed to fully comply<br>with UN weapons inspection protocols. While Resolution 1441 did not<br>legally allow individual member states to act without Security Council<br>authorization, Resolution 678 allowed individual member states to work<br>with the government of Kuwait to enforce Resolution 660 with regard to<br>Kuwaiti sovereignty. So while it's sketchy, the legal justification is<br>there.<br><br>Let me give you a related example here in the US. When Obamacare was<br>found to be legal, the Supreme Court said that you have to make all<br>reasonable attempts to verify that a law is constitutional. The law's<br>authors said that Obamacare imposed a "fee" if you didn't comply; they<br>said very plainly it was not a tax. The Supreme Court said, basically,<br>it is levied by Congress, it is collected by the IRS, it is collected as<br>part of your taxes, so it's a tax, and since Congress is authorized to<br>raise taxes, it's legal. Regardless of what they said (it's a fee, not a<br>tax), it's a tax, and that makes it legal.<br><br>Using that same justification, while the wording of the invasion may<br>have been incorrect, and the primary reason for invasion may have been<br>the incorrect primary reason, if there is justification at all under<br>international law, we must therefore submit that the invasion is legal<br>and authorized.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Could-war-be-made-illegal-1/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
