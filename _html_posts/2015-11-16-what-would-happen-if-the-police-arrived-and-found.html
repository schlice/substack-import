They<br>arrive, announce their presence, and what *should* happen is the \"good<br>guys\" should stop shooting, immediately drop their weapons, and get on<br>the ground in a position of disadvantage. Anyone still standing with a<br>gun becomes not a *good guy*, not a *bad guy,* but a<br>target.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
