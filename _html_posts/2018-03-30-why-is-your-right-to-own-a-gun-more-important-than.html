<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why is your right to own a gun more important than my right to life?<br><br>False dichotomy, or the logical fallacy of the excluded middle. The<br>question makes an either/or argument (either you have a right to own a<br>gun, or I have a right to life) and focuses only on the extremes. There<br>is a vast continuum between my right to own a gun and your right to<br>life.<br><br>In a comparison, in order for one to be more important than the other,<br>one must impact the other in some meaningful way. And as most of the<br>answers here have shown, my right to own a gun does not impact your<br>right to life. At. All.<br><br>The only time where the two rights might come into conflict is if<br>you use your right to life to attempt to remove my right to life, in<br>which case your right to life is forfeit. Then my right to own a gun may<br>be used to defend my life against your attempt to deprive me of my life.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
