<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [[[René<br>Jørgensen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ren%C3%A9-J%C3%B8rgensen)]{.qlink_container}<br>is correct. Age is generally not a factor; level of threat is a factor.<br>If an 80-year old woman was running around downtown wielding a machete<br>hacking people up, my first thought would not be \"Gee, I hope she\'s<br>not too old for me to deploy the TASER against,\" it would be \"I hope<br>the TASER stops her or I\'m going to have to shoot her.\" Because of her<br>advanced age, it\'s possible that the TASER could have unintended side<br>effects such as exacerbating a pre-existing heart condition, but we<br>either stop her from hacking people up, or we worry about whether or not<br>the TASER is going to hurt her more or less than a bullet. I vote for<br>stopping her. The same would hold true if it was a 10-year old boy<br>hacking up a mall with a samurai sword.\<br>\<br>Now, if an 80-year old or a 10-year old were simply being belligerent<br>and resistant, would the TASER be appropriate? Probably not, and we<br>would, as always, start at the lowest level of the force scale and work<br>our way up as required. Pepper spray might be a better option here than<br>a TASER. But each situation is different and has to be judged on its own<br>merits.\<br>\<br>When employing any method of force, as I just alluded to, we have<br>what\'s called a *continuum of force* which includes hand-to-hand,<br>pepper spray, baton, TASER, and finally ends with a firearm. We have<br>lots of options here, and we have to use the lowest level of force that<br>will safely stop the aggressor, regardless of age.\<br>\<br>The TASER is only shown to be harmful against people with pre-existing<br>medical conditions, such as heart conditions or asthma. However, since<br>we can\'t know someone\'s pre-existing medical conditions before<br>deploying the TASER, we don\'t judge whether or not we will employ a<br>particular level of force based on the age or relative health of the<br>aggressor, we judge what force is used based on the threat the person<br>poses.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
