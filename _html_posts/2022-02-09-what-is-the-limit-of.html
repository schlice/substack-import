<br><br><h2>Space Submission</h2><br><div><br><br>Space name: Jon's political corner II<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>None of our rights are absolute. Especially in the case where the free<br>exercise of one right intersects with someone else freely exercising<br>another right. This is where the law comes in. The law helps to define<br>the limits to the right, and what actions move from protected rights to<br>unlawful actions.<br><br>In the case of free speech, there are indeed some limitations.<br><br>- Obscenity. While this continues to be a moving target, obscenity is<br>  generally disallowed. What is considered obscene tends to change over<br>  time. This is more of an issue with print than with actual speech.<br>- Lying. Both in speech (slander) and in print (libel), lying is not<br>  legally permitted when the lie causes damage to a person or entity.<br>  You also cannot lie in court (perjury). However, political speech is<br>  subject to a different standard, and politicians can generally not be<br>  prosecuted for slander or libel in political speech. People also have<br>  pretty much free rein to criticize the government, even if their<br>  thoughts are wrong.<br>- Violence. You cannot incite violence by your speech. There is a very<br>  clear line between making a generalized speech and inciting violence.<br>  Many people presumed that President Trump's remarks on January 6 were<br>  an incitement of violence. While they were political speech and<br>  subject to a much higher level of scrutiny in general (see lying),<br>  they also did not directly incite violence. For example, if I say "We<br>  should kill all cops!" that would be acceptable to say, even if a<br>  crowd was whipped into a frenzy and killed a cop. But if I said, "We<br>  should all kill that cop right there!" and I pointed one out, and the<br>  crowd was whipped into a frenzy and killed the cop, I could be charged<br>  with inciting violence. The courts have stated that generalized<br>  statements cannot be incitements of violence because that incitement<br>  must be immediate and targeted. I also can say, "We should kill the<br>  President someday" and this would not be an incitement of violence<br>  because it is not specific. It talks about some nebulous time in the<br>  future<br>- Offense. Remember that the First Amendment applies to *government*,<br>  not to private citizens. You don't have the right to say whatever you<br>  want in someone else's home or other private space. You can be removed<br>  from that space for doing so. Also, if you are at work, your employer<br>  can control your speech. You can get fired for speaking in a manner in<br>  which your employer has directed you not to speak.<br>- Protest. While you are free to say whatever you want, you are not free<br>  to say whatever you want *wherever* or *whenever* you want.<br>  The government, while they cannot limit what you say, can limit the<br>  time, place, and manner of your speech. If you want to run a<br>  counter-protest at a political rally, the government can restrict you<br>  to a "free-speech zone" and it does not have to be in full view of the<br>  venue where the rally is taking place. You are not free to disrupt the<br>  rally simply because you wish to exercise your rights.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is there any limit to freedom of speech?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
