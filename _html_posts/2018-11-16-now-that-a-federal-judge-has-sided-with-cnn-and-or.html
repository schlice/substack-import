<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Now that a federal judge has sided with CNN and ordered the White<br>House to reinstate Jim Acosta\'s press pass, how will President Trump<br>retaliate?**<br><br>First of all, it's a temporary restraining order. The case hasn't been<br>heard yet.<br><br>Second, it's a restraining order on *5th Amendment* grounds, not 1st<br>Amendment grounds. Basically, the judge said that Acosta has a 5th<br>Amendment right to to due process when his hard pass is to be revoked,<br>and the White House didn't give it to him, so for now, he can have his<br>hard pass back.<br><br>Finally, how will Trump respond? Hopefully it's simply by not calling on<br>Acosta in the press room until after his actual hearing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
