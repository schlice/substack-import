<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The primary consideration in designing an airline seat is<br>your safety. However, we have to recognize that people fly in these<br>seats, and they do so voluntarily. If you want to understand the<br>difference, look at military aircraft and their seating.\<br>\<br>If you\'re not sitting in a jumpseat (an aluminum frame with webbed<br>straps over it), you\'re sitting in a passenger seat\...facing backwards<br>(towards the rear of the aircraft). Why? It\'s far safer to sit facing<br>backwards than forwards. In a forward-facing seat, you have to brace for<br>impact, either with your head in your arms on the seat in front of you,<br>or in your lap. Bracing for impact on a military transport means sitting<br>up straight in your seat and keeping your head still against the<br>backrest. The seat absorbs the impact, and the force of the impact is<br>spread throughout the entire seat, not just the seatbelt as in a<br>traditional airline seat.\<br>\<br>If it\'s so safe that way, why aren\'t all aircraft seats facing the<br>back of the plane? Because, as I mentioned in the beginning, people fly<br>voluntarily in these seats, and Mr. John Q. Public doesn\'t want to sit<br>facing backwards for the whole flight.\<br>\<br>So we have to recognize that airline seats are trying to do the same job<br>of keeping you safe while facing you in a less-safe direction. Doing<br>this without increasing the weight of the seat or decreasing the comfort<br>of the seat is a tricky balancing act. There is an entire discipline<br>(and a college major) devoted to this practice called Human Factors<br>Engineering. It\'s an extremely complex science, but the idea is to find<br>that balance between safety and comfort.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
