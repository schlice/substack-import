<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Your question contains faulty logic. You are employing a logical fault<br>called *generalization*.<br><br>Basically, you have a perception that a subset of a group behaves in a<br>certain way, and the logical fault of generalization allows you to<br>generalize and say that *all* of that group behaves in that way.<br><br>Is every one of our cops an evil bully? We will never know, since no one<br>person can know every one of our cops. There are simply too many of<br>them.<br><br>But I know (at least) one cop who is not an evil bully.<br><br>Therefore, your logic is simply flawed.<br><br>I suspect you are a victim of *media bias*. Your source for the<br>subset of the group is the media (television, probably). You see<br>examples of bad cops on the news, and you never see examples of good<br>cops on the news. Therefore, you assume, all cops are bad. Or perhaps<br>you have had interactions with X cops in your local area, and you<br>perceive all of those interactions were bad. Therefore, you assume all<br>cops are bad.<br><br>All of these errors are logically unsound. They are flawed thinking on<br>your part, not a problem with \"every one of our cops.\"<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
