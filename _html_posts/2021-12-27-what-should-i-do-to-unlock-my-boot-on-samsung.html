<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It all depends on the model of your device. There are different<br>unlocking methods employed on each device. Some devices don't need to be<br>unlocked at all. It all depends on the model of the device you wish to<br>unlock.<br><br>Also note that unlocking and modifying your bootloader will cause your<br>eFuse to trip. ONCE THIS TRIPS, IT CAN NOT BE RESET. This means that<br>certain Samsung features (like Knox) **will never work again on that<br>device**. Knox is used to secure the encrypted vault on the device, so<br>features like Samsung Pay and Secure Folders will no longer function.<br>However, if you're unlocking the bootloader, chances are you are going<br>to replace the software with non-Samsung software (which is fine), just<br>be aware of the eFuse before you make that permanent.<br><br>(EDIT) While I was conversing with [[Vickers<br>Carter](https://www.quora.com/profile/Vickers-Carter)]{.qlink_container}<br>in the comments, I also realized that I failed to mention that doing<br>this and tripping your eFuse voids your factory warranty. So if you are<br>still within the window of your factory warranty, and you want to still<br>be able to make a warranty claim with Samsung, don't do this.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What should I do to unlock my boot on Samsung?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
