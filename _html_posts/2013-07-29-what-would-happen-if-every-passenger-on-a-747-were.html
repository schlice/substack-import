<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [As long as people are not moving forwards and backwards<br/>too much changing the center of gravity on the plane, everyone standing<br/>up and dancing shouldn\'t have much impact at all. Assuming that the<br/>plane is at altitude and cruising with autopilot engaged, changes in all<br/>three axes of rotation should be dampened and corrected automatically.<br/>You would have to have everyone move forwards or backwards dramatically<br/>in order to affect pitch, and you would have to have everyone flop to<br/>one side of the plane or the other in order to potentially impact roll,<br/>even though that\'s much less likely. It would be nearly impossible for<br/>passengers or cargo to affect yaw.\<br/>\<br/>\<br/>Hypothetically speaking, of course.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
