<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [As long as people are not moving forwards and backwards<br>too much changing the center of gravity on the plane, everyone standing<br>up and dancing shouldn\'t have much impact at all. Assuming that the<br>plane is at altitude and cruising with autopilot engaged, changes in all<br>three axes of rotation should be dampened and corrected automatically.<br>You would have to have everyone move forwards or backwards dramatically<br>in order to affect pitch, and you would have to have everyone flop to<br>one side of the plane or the other in order to potentially impact roll,<br>even though that\'s much less likely. It would be nearly impossible for<br>passengers or cargo to affect yaw.\<br>\<br>\<br>Hypothetically speaking, of course.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
