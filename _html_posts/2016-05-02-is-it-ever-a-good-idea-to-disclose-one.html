<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It\'s always okay to disclose your salary target to a recruiter.<br><br>It\'s *NOBODY\'S BUSINESS BUT YOURS (and your accountant)* what your<br>*current* salary is.<br><br>The bottom line is that **your current salary is not needed in order to<br>evaluate your suitability for employment.**<br><br>For any company, what good does it do you to judge your prospective<br>employee by what another company was paying them? What if they were<br>overpaying them? Worse, what if they were underpaying them?<br><br>When a recruiter asks your salary, you tell them that in this particular<br>job search, you are looking for positions paying in the \$120k range,<br>and you ask if this position is in that range. If it is, it makes sense<br>for you both to keep talking. If not, you can move on, no hard feelings.<br>Any recruiter worth his salt will be able to tell within 30 minutes of<br>talking to you whether or not you are a good candidate for the position<br>for which you are applying, and if your requested salary falls in the<br>range that the company is offering, all\'s the better.<br><br>Many companies do ask for your current salary, but as you know, that is<br>your private financial information, and at this early phase in the<br>hiring process, there is no reason that anyone needs to know your<br>private financial information. Just as the company does not share its<br>salary data with you, you are not under any obligation to share your<br>personal salary data with them. If the job in question pays in the<br>\$120k range, then you can keep talking. If not, then you can move on<br>with no hard feelings.<br><br>If the recruiter does not know the current salary range, you can safely<br>ignore that job. Why? Because the recruiter, or the company, is simply<br>not worth it. The days of \"employers make the rules, and job-seekers<br>follow the rules\" are over. You have worth! You have leverage in the<br>hiring process, or they wouldn\'t be talking to you in the first place.<br><br>Some recruiters may say, \"You\'re going to have to trust me if we\'re<br>going to work together.\" And that\'s fine, you shared your salary<br>target. If that\'s not sufficient, you should feel free to move on and<br>look at another company.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
