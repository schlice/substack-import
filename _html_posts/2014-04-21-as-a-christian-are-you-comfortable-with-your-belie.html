<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Some of the answers on this page that characterize<br/>Christians are quite wrong. The Bible says that Jesus said that He is<br/>the only way to get to heaven. \"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.<br/>No one comes to the Father except through Me.\" ([[John<br/>14:6](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9849d5&amp;url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search%3DJohn%2B14:6){.external_link<br/>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br/>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br/>qt-tooltip="biblegateway.com"}]{.qlink_container}).\<br/>\<br/>It is true that salvation is a gift, which means you don\'t have to<br/>\"do\" anything special to \"earn\" it. But in order to receive your<br/>gift, you do have to \"take\" it, and \"acknowledge\" it. Generally,<br/>people do this when receiving a gift. Your only requirement is to<br/>acknowledge that Jesus is your Lord and Savior and that He died for your<br/>sins. That\'s it. Once you have truly accepted that Jesus is your<br/>personal savior who died for your sins, the Bible teaches that you are<br/>\"saved.\" You don\'t need good works to go to Heaven. God\'s grace<br/>begets good works, not the other way around.\<br/>\<br/>Once you have accepted your gift, what then do you do with the rest of<br/>your life? You learn more about what it means to be a follower of<br/>Christ, and you do your utmost to pattern your life after His, the most<br/>perfect example of any life you can follow. You also try to follow<br/>Jesus\' teachings: \"As the Father has sent me, so I send you.\" ([[John<br/>20:21](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eea031&amp;url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search%3Djohn%2B20%253A21-23%26version%3DNIV){.external_link<br/>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br/>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br/>qt-tooltip="biblegateway.com"}]{.qlink_container}). It is what we refer<br/>to as the Great Commission: \"Therefore go and make disciples of all<br/>nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of<br/>the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded<br/>you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.\"<br/>([[Matthew<br/>28:19-20)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=905b2e&amp;url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search%3DMatthew%2B28%253A19-20%26version%3DNIV){.external_link<br/>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br/>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br/>qt-tooltip="biblegateway.com"}]{.qlink_container}\<br/>\<br/>This is, of course, a very simplistic view of the \"going to Heaven\"<br/>story, and there is so much deep meaning and interconnectedness in the<br/>Bible that it does take a lifetime of study to master it, but if you<br/>believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God and is infallible,<br/>then you believe that what Jesus said is indeed true, and the only way<br/>to get to Heaven is to believe in Jesus as your savior.\<br/>\<br/>(ED) I was reading over some of the other answers and I wanted to add<br/>something. It does seem pretty sad that some may not get to \"heaven\".<br/>But what is \"heaven\" anyway? Is it a place? Is it a location? I<br/>believe it is a state of being, in oneness with God, feeling the<br/>fullness of His love for eternity. Conversely, \"hell\" is a state of<br/>being in complete and utter separation from God\'s love, completely<br/>isolated, completely alone, forever. The Bible says that Jesus is the<br/>only way to get to heaven. And if we truly believe that Jesus is the son<br/>of God, we cannot fail to believe what he said. Jesus is the only<br/>founder of a religion who claimed to be God (the Trinity is all three,<br/>Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, one God, three persons). Every other<br/>religious founder was a \"prophet\" or a \"sage\" or some other form of<br/>\"enlightened person.\" Jesus is the only founder of a religion who was<br/>actually God. Every other religion is prophets pointing us to God;<br/>Christianity is the only religion in which God tells us how to get back<br/>to Himself. I think that is telling indeed. We are all sinners and have<br/>all fallen short of the glory of God. Jesus, through His conquering of<br/>death and His resurrection, opened the door for us to reunite with God.<br/>The only way for us to get back into that state of oneness with God is<br/>by leveraging Christ\'s death and resurrection. All we have to do is<br/>believe that this is true and repent, and that gift is<br/>ours.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
