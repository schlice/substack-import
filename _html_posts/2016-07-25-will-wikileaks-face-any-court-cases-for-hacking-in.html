<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>From Wikileaks inspiration,<br>[Wikipedia(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=73ab61&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks%23Potential_criminal_prosecution){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}:<br><br>> The U.S. Justice Department began a criminal investigation of<br>> WikiLeaks and Julian Assange soon after the leak of diplomatic cables<br>> began. Attorney General Eric Holder affirmed the investigation was<br>> \"not saber-rattling\", but was \"an active, ongoing criminal<br>> investigation.\" *The Washington Post* reported that the department<br>> was considering charges under the Espionage Act of 1917, an action<br>> which former prosecutors characterized as \"difficult\" because of<br>> First Amendment protections for the press. Several Supreme Court cases<br>> (e.g. [[*Bartnicki v.<br>> Vopper*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=07c085&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartnicki_v._Vopper){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}) have established<br>> previously that the American Constitution protects the re-publication<br>> of illegally gained information provided the publishers did not<br>> themselves violate any laws in acquiring it. Federal prosecutors have<br>> also considered prosecuting Assange for trafficking in stolen<br>> government property, but since the diplomatic cables are intellectual<br>> rather than physical property, that method is also difficult.<br>><br>> Any prosecution of Assange would require extraditing him to the United<br>> States, a procedure made more complicated and potentially delayed by<br>> any preceding extradition to Sweden. One of Assange\'s lawyers,<br>> however, says they are fighting extradition to Sweden because it might<br>> result in his extradition to the United States. Assange\'s attorney,<br>> Mark Stephens, has \"heard from Swedish authorities there has been a<br>> secretly empanelled grand jury in Alexandria \Virginia\\" meeting to<br>> consider criminal charges for the WikiLeaks case.<br><br>TL;DR: Highly unlikely that anyone could press charges against<br>Wikileaks.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
