<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Depending on where you live, it may not necessarily be<br>legal. How they went about the rate change is probably what you\'re<br>looking at contesting. If the power company is going to impose new<br>rates, there are notification periods, city approvals, etc. Again it all<br>depends on where you live. Check out your city\'s regulations on the<br>power company and rate changes. Check to make sure that the rate change<br>was approved in accordance with local laws.\<br>\<br>*Why* they are doing it, however, is no mystery. It\'s called<br>supply and demand.\<br>\<br>Supply and demand theory says (basically) the following:\<br>]<br><br>- All else being equal, if supply increases, price decreases.<br>- All else being equal, if demand increases, price increases.\<br><br>The power company increases the rates during the period of peak demand.<br>The power systems have to work the hardest during that peak period, and<br>so the production of energy costs more to the power company. So it\'s<br>not just that \"it\'s the hottest part of the day,\" but it\'s the part<br>of the day that the power company has the highest load on their<br>equipment, making it the costliest part of the day to produce energy.\<br>\<br>The increase in price during peak load times can serve several<br>functions: it helps to recoup the additional cost of producing energy<br>during those times, and it may also encourage people to conserve energy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
