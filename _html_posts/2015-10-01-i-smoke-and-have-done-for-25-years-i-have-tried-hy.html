<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You\'re never going to quit until you actually want to<br>quit, and right now, the nicotine is controlling you.\<br>\<br>You might think about e-cigarettes. I know you said you tried<br>\"substitutes,\" but e-cigarettes deliver all of the nicotine without<br>all the harmful toxins of tobacco smoke. You get a very similar<br>sensation when \"vaping\" that you do from a cigarette.\<br>\<br>Start out with a starter set and move on to more powerful sets if you<br>choose. You\'ll be able to gradually step down the dose of nicotine in<br>your vape oil until you\'re free of the drug<br>completely.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
