<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should "The Notorious RBG" (a.ka. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg) and her<br>anti-Trump bias be allowed to participate if The Schiff Show somehow<br>ends up at the Supreme Court?**<br><br>Ignoring the clear bias in your own question (you might think about<br>removing the plank from your own eye before you worry about the splinter<br>in your brother's eye), I'm curious how you think an impeachment will<br>end up at the Supreme Court.<br><br>Impeachment is a political process, not a legal one. The Supreme Court<br>has already determined that it has no role in impeachments as they are<br>purely political, not judicial. No one in the House or the Senate can<br>ask the courts to weigh in on the results of the impeachment, as it is<br>entirely up to the Congress to prosecute an impeachment.<br><br>There may be questions of law which rise to the level of the Supreme<br>Court; in Nixon's impeachment, there were questions about executive<br>privilege over his taped recordings of Oval Office conversations, and<br>that question regarding subpoenas *was* a legal question. But SCOTUS was<br>not involved with the *actual* impeachment or Senate trial in Nixon's<br>case; they addressed the narrow question of legality of the subpoenas<br>and whether or not the White House was obligated to produce the<br>information.<br><br>While the Supreme Court can judge specific legal questions, in this case<br>the Democrats in the House chose to ignore the courts and run the<br>impeachment on their own. They issued subpoenas, the White House exerted<br>executive privilege, and the House let it drop. They did not pursue the<br>subpoenas at all. They just ignored conducting a full and complete<br>investigation in favor of expediency.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
