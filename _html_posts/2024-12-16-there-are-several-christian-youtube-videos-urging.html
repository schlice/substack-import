<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The short answer is *it depends*.<br><br>Some Christians who don't understand the history of yoga see it as<br>nothing more than a way to exercise, and strengthen the body as well as<br>improving flexibility.<br><br>But yoga is actually a very old practice from India, and its goal is to<br>prepare the body for spiritual exercises aimed towards achieving<br>enlightenment. It is based on the belief that man and God are one, part<br>of the religious practice of *pantheism,* the belief that everything is<br>God and that reality consists only of the universe and nature. Because<br>everything is God, the yoga philosophy makes no distinction between man<br>and God. Consequently, this leaves the participant open to deception by<br>Satan and his demons, who are constantly looking for opportunities to<br>deceive Christians and turn them away from God.<br><br>\<br><br>So is it possible to do yoga as a Christian? I'd say *maybe*, but only<br>under very specific conditions.<br><br>As long as your practice of yoga:<br><br>- does not encourage you to trust yourself rather than God<br>- does not encourage you to seek answers to your problems within<br>  yourself<br>- does not encourage the belief that man and God are the same<br><br>then you might be okay doing yoga for solely physical exercise. But take<br>great care: the design of yoga was blatantly, overtly anti-Christian,<br>and those design philosophies have not changed.<br><br>Since Christians are admonished to not participate in things which may<br>pull them away from their faith, or encourage others in unfaithfulness,<br>yoga should be done only very cautiously.<br><br>> So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory<br>> of God. \-- 1 Cor 10:31 ESV<br><br>Whatever you do should be done for the glory of God, including your<br>physical exercise.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
