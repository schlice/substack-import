  & are so concerned about their right to choose not to have little or no regard for
  the rights of other Americans who do not want to contract COVID-19 from maskless
  people?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm going to address this question from another angle:<br><br>*Where did you find in state law, federal law, or the Constitution,<br>wherein you have the* *right* *to be free from infection by a<br>virus?*<br><br>You certainly have the right to be free from someone *knowingly*<br>infecting you with a virus. If you have unprotected sex with someone who<br>later tells you that they have AIDS and they knew it at the time, you<br>have a case. Similarly, if someone who has tested positive for COVID and<br>is in active infection is running around maskless, coughing on people,<br>they get arrested for assault as well.<br><br>But most people who don't wear masks (except for asymptomatic carriers)<br>are not knowingly, intentionally infecting anyone, and in such a case,<br>there is no right to not be infected with a virus. You are absolutely<br>free to go somewhere else where there is an enforced mask policy. There<br>are very few places you are required to be where there is no enforced<br>mask policy. In fact, in the United States, there are very few places<br>you are *required* to be at all.<br><br>And what about people who are fully vaccinated? Are you seriously<br>concerned that one of them is an asymptomatic carrier, just randomly<br>infecting people? If the vaccine won't prevent the spread of the virus,<br>what will? It's certainly not masks. Yes, they help, but they are not<br>guaranteed. Fully 70% of people who were infected reported that they<br>frequently or always wore their masks in public.<br><br>So if wearing masks won't do it, and getting vaccinated won't do it, at<br>what point do we stop being paranoid and get back to real life?<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why is it that people who refuse to wear a mask to safeguard against<br>COVID-19 & are so concerned about their right to choose not to have<br>little or no regard for the rights of other Americans who do not want to<br>contract COVID-19 from maskless people?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
