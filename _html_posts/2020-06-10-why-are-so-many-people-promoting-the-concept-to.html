<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why are so many people promoting the concept to \"Defund the Police\"?<br>To most people that sounds like a horrible idea - is there a better<br>phrase that could be used to garner more support?**<br><br>Sure, there are many. Using a phrase that makes it seem like you want to<br>completely disband the police doesn't help when you really want to<br>change them.<br><br>Also, actions like Minneapolis are trying to take don't help your cause<br>either:<br><br>[[Minneapolis Will Dismantle Its Police Force, Council Members<br>Pledge](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eec646&url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/us/minneapolis-police-abolish.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nytimes.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>So it *appears* when you say "defund the police" you really mean<br>"dismantle the police."<br><br>Words matter.<br><br>So you should use a phrase that means exactly what you want it to mean.<br>Since what you really want is to severely reduce funding to the police,<br>but to do that you need to overhaul who they are and what they do, I<br>might suggest some alternate phrases:<br><br>- Overhaul the Police - this sends the message that you want to<br>  strip down and rebuild the police, like when you overhaul a vehicle.<br><br>Similarly, you could say<br><br>- Retrofit the Police<br>- Renovate the Police<br>- Modernize the Police<br><br>but I don't think you get the biggest bang for your buck from anything<br>other than Overhaul the Police.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for<br>everyone.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
