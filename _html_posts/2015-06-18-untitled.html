<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [I didn\'t say \"God,\" I said \"higher power.\" A higher<br>power can be anything you believe in. It can even be the group<br>consciousness of a like-minded community. Whatever it is, we know that<br>it exists.\<br>\<br>Some know that it exists and choose to deny its existence as delusion or<br>fantasy or imagination. But they still believe in absolute morality. But<br>they have to embrace the fact that an amoral universe accidentally gave<br>rise to moral creatures, which also violates the laws of causation. So<br>either the laws of causation are wrong, or there is a higher power.<br>Can\'t be both.\<br>\<br>We do have a higher power, and we do have natural law which originated<br>from a higher power. The ignorance of this fact only makes life harder<br>for those who actively choose to ignore it.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Given-that-the-Second-Amendment-to-the-U-S-Constitution-is-an-amendment-why-do-people-think-it-can-never-be-changed/answer/Jasmine-Adamson<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
