<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, let's get something out of the way right now.<br><br>- The states certified their elections.<br>- The Congress certified the results of the state elections.<br>- The president was sworn in lawfully, and power was transferred.<br><br>Therefore, the president was Constitutionally elected. Nothing about<br>the process by which he assumed power was unconstitutional.<br><br>THAT SAID, if these audits find that there was significant fraud in a<br>state election, so significant that *it would have changed the outcome<br>of that state's election,* we're going to take a very strong look at<br>what failed in that state to allow an election to be corrupted in such a<br>way. And the big question to the states from the Congressional<br>subcommittees which do the investigations will be: *How could you<br>possibly have certified an election with so much fraud taking place?<br>What are you going to do to fix it?*<br><br>Remember the 2000 election? Bush v. Gore? Two words: hanging chads.<br>Florida got a *huge* black eye over that one, and they fixed their<br>voting laws. 2020 was a very smooth election in Florida because of those<br>voting law changes. States which changed their voting laws through<br>emergency orders (due to COVID) instead of lawfully through legislative<br>action are going to get a very stern look and a mandate to fix their<br>voting laws before the next presidential election.<br><br>Except that some states, in trying to do just that, are being<br>disingenuously attacked for "limiting" voting rights, when the things<br>that they are "limiting" were only put in place as emergency executive<br>orders.<br><br>Anyway, the only way that Biden leaves office is if he actually knew or<br>participated in any of the fraud which took place in any of the states.<br>If this evidence ever comes to light, he can be impeached and removed<br>from office.<br><br>If not, and it still comes to light that there was such significant<br>state fraud that it could have changed the course of the election, then<br>the Biden presidency will be indelibly marred by the stigma of being a<br>president who was very likely not the people's true choice. This has<br>been true of other presidents in history, and it would be true again.<br>Any mandates he thought he had would be questioned even more strongly<br>than they are now, and the Biden legacy will be reduced to a footnote in<br>the pages of history.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is there a Constitutional, legal recourse to remove Joe Biden from the<br>presidency IF it is proven through auditing processes, that he is not<br>the legitimate winner of the 2020 election, since an illegitimate<br>president is not Constitutional?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
