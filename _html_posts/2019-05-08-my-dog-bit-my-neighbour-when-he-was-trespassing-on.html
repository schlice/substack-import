<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My dog bit my neighbour when he was trespassing on my property. Am I<br>legally liable for paying his medical bills?**<br><br>There are a lot of factors to consider in a case like this.<br><br>For example, what does "trespassing" mean? If you invite me over your<br>house and I wander into an area in which I wasn't given permission to<br>enter, I'm technically "trespassing." If I'm in a convenience store and<br>I wander into an "Employees Only" area searching for an employee, I am<br>technically "trespassing."<br><br>The upshot of this is that *the fact that someone is trespassing does<br>not alleviate the owner of the responsibility to address known hazards.*<br><br>For example, if the dog is a known biter, leaving the dog alone in the<br>yard opens the homeowner up to liability if someone gets bitten. What if<br>a kid wandered in the yard? What if he was chasing a ball into the yard?<br>Technically, the kid was trespassing.<br><br>Again, not to split hairs, but you still wouldn't be responsible to "pay<br>his medical bills." He would pay his own medical bills, and then file a<br>negligence lawsuit against you, alleging that you were negligent when<br>you failed to properly secure your dog who was known to bite. He'd<br>attempt to recover his medical costs, as well as other damages.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
