<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You\'ve asked for specific legal advice, but I will only<br>give you general contract advice.\<br>\<br>You signed a contract. Unless your contract allows the company to<br>unilaterally modify that contract (which it usually does not), you are<br>only bound by the terms of your original agreement. Usually, contracts<br>are worded so they can be amended, but any amendments must be agreed<br>upon by both parties.\<br>\<br>I would hire a contracts attorney and review the terms of your original<br>agreement. I would ask the recruiter to provide me with copies of any<br>amended agreements that you may or may not have signed. They should have<br>copies of the amended agreements you signed. And then I would hold them<br>to the original agreement, or find them to be in breach of contract and<br>terminate the agreement, or propose an amendment to your agreement with<br>terms that you are both amenable to.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
