<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>He actually didn\'t have little gun experience, as you suggest. He<br>actually had a permit to carry a gun and he did so as part of his job.<br>He very likely had quite a bit of advanced firearms training. He may not<br>have personally owned an AR-15 before that day, but he had probably shot<br>one at least once before.<br><br>The basic principles behind firing any weapons platform are intuitively<br>transferable between weapons within that platform. If you can fire a<br>shotgun, you can pretty much fire any shotgun with the same level of<br>accuracy. If you can fire an AR-style rifle, you can pretty much fire<br>any AR-style rifle with the same level of accuracy.<br><br>This probably had a big impact on his ability to use a firearm<br>effectively.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
