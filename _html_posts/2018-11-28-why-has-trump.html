<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is it ok for Trump to marry someone for them to become a us<br>citizen but he does not want others to?**<br><br>I've read some of the criticisms of Trump's policies, but this<br>particular comparison between Trump and others is simply incorrect.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Melania became a lawful permanent resident of the United States in 2001.<br>She married Trump in 2005, and became a citizen in 2006.<br><br>The criticisms of Trump's policies come when people who are ***illegal<br>immigrants***, either by overstaying a visa or entering the country<br>illegally, subsequently marry a US citizen. Sometimes an illegal will<br>marry a US citizen out of convenience, and it would take an ICE<br>investigator months to determine if the marriage was genuine. In some<br>cases, ICE will allow the newly-married citizen to remain, and even gain<br>citizenship, but not always.<br><br>ICE, under Trump, is far stricter with people like these than Obama's<br>ICE was. At this point in the process, Obama's ICE would simply "look<br>the other way" when it came to the previous lawless behavior. Under<br>Trump, any classification of illegal immigrant can be deported at any<br>time. A subsequent marriage to a US citizen is not a guarantee that you<br>won't be adjudicated for your former lawlessness. And marriage to a US<br>citizen does not *automatically* make you a citizen, nor does it<br>alleviate any punishment you may receive for your previous lawlessness.<br><br>In some cases, newly-married illegals arrived at ICE for their<br>interviews and were arrested on the spot and deported for their previous<br>crime.<br><br>Thus, the outrage.<br><br>I have said it before, and I will say it again: *if your first act upon<br>entering the new nation you want to call home is to violate its laws, we<br>are absolutely right to question not only your reason for being here,<br>but your ability and willingness to uphold the rest of our nation's<br>laws.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
