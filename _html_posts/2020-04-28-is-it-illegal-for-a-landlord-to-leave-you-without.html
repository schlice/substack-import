<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it illegal for a landlord to leave you without heating?<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>However, in the vast majority of cases, heat is absolutely required.<br>It's covered under the *implied warranty of habitability* --- it's<br>implied that when you rent a home, you can actually safely live in it.<br>Heat, in areas of the country which get below 55 degrees at night and<br>stay below 68 during the day, must be provided.<br><br>They don't have to pay for your heat, but they must provide you with a<br>way to heat your home.<br><br>So what do you do if you don't have a heater, or your heater breaks and<br>your landlord won't fix it?<br><br>You can call your local code enforcement office. They can inspect and<br>assist with contacting your landlord.<br><br>But that's a slow process. In the meantime, you can probably buy some<br>space heaters and deduct the cost from your lease payments. This is a<br>practice known as "repair and deduct," but save all your receipts, and<br>do advise your landlord before you do this, so they at least have the<br>opportunity to fix it themselves.<br><br>If they *still* don't fix it, you may have grounds to terminate your<br>lease. At this point, it's high time to contact a lawyer.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is legal information, not legal advice.
