<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are the chances of a relapse if I stop injecting Rebif for a week<br>or two? I just found out that almost all problems I have are Rebif\'s<br>side effects.**<br><br>Talk to your neurologist.<br><br>There are indeed chances that you will relapse after stopping Rebif.<br>[[Studies have been<br>done](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=78f3d0&url=https://meridian.allenpress.com/ijmsc/article/22/2/75/432651/The-Dilemma-of-When-to-Stop-Disease-Modifying){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="allenpress.com"}]{.qlink_container} on stopping MS meds and<br>the chance of relapse, and the results were inconclusive.<br><br>To that end, you should discuss the issue with your neurologist. You and<br>your neurologist should balance the risk of stopping Rebif with the<br>benefit of reducing side effects.<br><br>Perhaps, if the side effects are too severe to continue your therapy,<br>it's time to change to another therapy. Plenty of MS medications are<br>stopped because of side effects, some medications more than others. Some<br>medications are stopped due to risk of severe side effects (i.e. Tysabri<br>and the risk of PML). Maybe it's time to broach the subject of changing<br>your MS therapy drug with your neurologist.<br><br>Bottom line: talk to your neurologist about the pros and cons of taking<br>a "drug holiday."<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
