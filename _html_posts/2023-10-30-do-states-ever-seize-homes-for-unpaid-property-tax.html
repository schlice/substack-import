<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No. Property taxes are levied by counties and cities, not states. So<br>states do not seize homes for unpaid property taxes, but county and city<br>governments do, all the bloody time.<br><br>Also, if you don't pay your income tax, the IRS can put a lien on your<br>house, and then foreclose on the lien to be paid. But the IRS has to<br>wait in line behind the bank, the local government, and the HOA. Once<br>they get paid, then the IRS can get paid.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
