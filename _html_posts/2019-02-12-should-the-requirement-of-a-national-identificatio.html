<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should the requirement of a national identification card be viewed<br>more as a violation of privacy or states rights or neither?**<br><br>It's not a violation of privacy. The Federal government can create an<br>identification card to identify you as an American citizen.<br><br>It's also not a violation of states' rights. The Federal government is<br>not forcing the states to use the ID card for anything.<br><br>Which raises the question: why have a national ID card at all?<br><br>What purpose would it serve? It wouldn't be used for elections, since<br>those are run by the states, and ID requirements vary. It wouldn't be<br>used for international identification; we have passports for that. And<br>we already have a passport card, which works like a passport book in and<br>around most places in North America you might reach by car or passenger<br>ship.<br><br>So what would be the purpose?<br><br>Unless you can come up with a good reason to have a national ID card,<br>then it just seems like a big waste of time and money.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
