<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There is much scientific information to show that rational<br>thought centers in the brain do not fully develop until age 25. So the<br>science shows that the age of consent should actually be higher.\<br>\<br>However, tradition and logic allow that there are variables in the aging<br>process, and everyone is different. The government has set 18 as the age<br>of consent, and it is a standard here. Most states follow that standard,<br>some do not.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
