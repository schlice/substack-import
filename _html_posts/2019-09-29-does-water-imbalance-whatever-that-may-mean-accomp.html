<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does water imbalance, whatever that may mean, accompany the onset of a<br>MS relapse? My friend says that is the first sign that he\'ll need<br>another infusion, soon.**<br><br>Water imbalance is another word for fluid imbalance or dehydration.<br><br>[[A<br>study](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b16fd9&url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5156578/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nih.gov"}]{.qlink_container} of 50 women found the<br>following:<br><br>> Fatigue is a prevalent and functionally disabling symptom for<br>> individuals living with multiple sclerosis (MS) which is poorly<br>> understood and multifactorial in etiology. Bladder dysfunction is<br>> another common MS symptom which limits social engagement and quality<br>> of life. To manage bladder issues, individuals with MS tend to limit<br>> their fluid intake, which may contribute to a low-hydration (LoH)<br>> state and fatigue.<br>><br>> \...\<br>><br>> LoH status was more common in MS subjects with bladder dysfunction.<br>> Statistically significant differences in self-reported Fatigue<br>> Performance Scale were observed between HiH and LoH subjects (*p* =<br>> 0.022). USG was significantly correlated with fatigue as measured by<br>> the MS Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) score (*r* = 0.328, *p* = 0.020).<br><br>So it is possible that being dehydrated can trigger the onset of certain<br>symptoms, such as fatigue, and perhaps can increase stress due to<br>self-limiting of fluids. All of these factors together could trigger a<br>relapse.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
