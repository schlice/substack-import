<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Jesus was not forgiving all people for all time without repentance and<br>faith with that statement. He was forgiving the people who persecuted<br>him, so that he could fulfill Old Testament prophecy: "He bore the sin<br>of many, and made intercession for the transgressors" (Isaiah 53:12).<br>Even on the cross, he forgave sinners.<br><br>Also important was that they did not know what they were doing. They had<br>no idea how important their part in history was.<br><br>Jesus' statement on the cross was indeed the very beginning of<br>forgiveness for all who believe in him.<br><br>> even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give<br>> his life as a ransom for many. --- Matthew 20:28 NIV<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>When Jesus said on the cross "Father forgive them for they know not what<br>they do", was that the very beginning of redemption for all humanity if<br>people seek him first?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
