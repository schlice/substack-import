<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> I consider myself to be a fairly high-functioning user, but everything<br>> has gone to shit and continues on that path. Do I deserve this because<br>> of my indulgence and addiction? I am so terribly unhappy. I still<br>> don\'t want to stop.<br>><br>> People are starting to say things about it (my weight mainly). And I<br>> don\'t know how to play it off. I jokingly say, \"I have AIDS.\"<br>> (Morbid humor.)<br>><br>> Is there a way I can continue to use and be happy? I only smoke and<br>> use around a gram a week. *Help*.<br><br>I\'d like to recommend a movie to you. It\'s called \"Pleasure<br>Unwoven.\" It\'s available on Amazon, and there are abridged video clips<br>of the DVD on YouTube.<br><br>The problem is not the drug. The problem is the *addiction.* You have a<br>disease, and it is a real disease. It is a failure of the biofeedback<br>system that runs the pleasure center of the brain. The fact that you<br>don\'t want to stop is evidence of the disease action.<br><br>You are not a bad person. You are a *sick* person (in the disease<br>sense). You need help. I would strongly recommend you seek treatment.<br><br>If you won\'t, or can\'t, go to a treatment center, I would suggest<br>finding an NA meeting in your area. Check their website to find a<br>meeting near you:<br><br>[[Narcotics<br>Anonymous](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=11b0b3&url=http://www.na.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="na.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>The only way you\'re going to get out from under the drug is if you<br>choose to change yourself.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
