How do you know it's a<br>real ID card? How do you know it's valid? How do you know the officer is<br>"in good standing" with his department?<br><br>Really, the only way to determine if an officer is real or an imposter<br>is to call 911 and tell the dispatcher what is going on. The dispatcher<br>will tell you whether or not the officer at the scene is a real officer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
