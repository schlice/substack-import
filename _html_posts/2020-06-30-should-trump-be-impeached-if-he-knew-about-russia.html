<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should Trump be impeached if he knew about Russia\'s Taliban<br>bounties?**<br><br>Nope.<br><br>Impeachment is very serious. It is reserved for *high crimes and<br>misdemeanors*. It is reserved for the lawlessness that is *so pervasive,<br>so damaging to the Office of the President* that the current occupant of<br>that office can no longer effectively administer the office.<br><br>No, the remedy for what you ask is to *not re-elect him in November, and<br>to encourage your friends to do the same*. Tell them about Trump's<br>knowledge of Russian Taliban bounties. And if they agree with you, have<br>them tell even more people about it.<br><br>Our remedy for an ineffective president is at the ballot box. *We*<br>have the power to get Trump out of office in just a little over four<br>months from now. Don't leave it up to Congress to do your job. If you<br>don't want Trump in office, don't re-elect him.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
