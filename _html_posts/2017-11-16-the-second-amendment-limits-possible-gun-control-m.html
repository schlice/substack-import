<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Your question begins with an incorrect assumption.<br><br>The compliance with the Second Amendment is not to the detriment of<br>"stopping crazies." It's not like we EITHER comply with the Second<br>Amendment, OR stop crazies.<br><br>It's more like *The US must comply with the 2nd Amendment. Also, we have<br>a problem of crazies we have to deal with. The crazies occasionally (but<br>not always) use guns. Sometimes they use box cutters, commercial<br>airliners, rental trucks and fertilizer, but the common denominator is<br>not the tool used, it's the crazies.*<br><br>We need better *crazy control*, not *gun control.*<br><br>On a separate note, we should not be broadcasting so much information<br>about these events. It is well known that some of these "crazies" do<br>what they do for the fame. There was at least one school shooter who<br>"idolized" Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, the Columbine High School<br>shooters.<br><br>But mass media is a business, and it is in the business of keeping your<br>eyeballs glued to the screen so they can sell more advertising. And what<br>better way to do that than to print and broadcast news reports about<br>these events, 24x7?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
