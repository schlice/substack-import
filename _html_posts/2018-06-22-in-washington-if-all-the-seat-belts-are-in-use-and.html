If not, can<br>you give a source to be sure of this?**<br><br>Hi, I'm not sure if you mean Washington state or Washington, DC.<br><br>I'll give you the answer for Washnigton state.<br><br>RCW 46.61.688 (3)(4):<br><br>> Every person sixteen years of age or older operating or riding in a<br>> motor vehicle shall wear the safety belt assembly in a properly<br>> adjusted and securely fastened manner.<br>><br>> No person may operate a motor vehicle unless all child passengers<br>> under the age of sixteen years are either: (a) Wearing a safety belt<br>> assembly or (b) are securely fastened into an approved child restraint<br>> device.<br><br>This means that the maximum number of people you can carry in your car<br>must equal the number of seat belts you have. Notice that it says *every<br>person* operating or riding in a motor vehicle *shall* wear the safety<br>belt, and the driver is responsible for making sure that everyone under<br>16 is in a belt.<br><br>It also says a little earlier in the statute that if your vehicle meets<br>the Federal safety standard (49 C.F.R. Sec. 571.208) and there is an<br>actual seating position with no seat belt, then it is not required.<br>However, all passenger vehicles of model years 2007 and later<br>(S4.1.5.2.2) have seat belts at all seating positions. So if your car is<br>older than 2007, it may actually have a valid seating position that may<br>not have a seat belt. It may have a lap belt only and no shoulder<br>harness. Regardless, whatever belt is present is required to be worn by<br>every passenger<br><br>Seat belt or not (depending on vehicle year), you can only carry the<br>number of people in the car as designated by the manufacturer. For<br>example, if your car is older, and you have a rear bench seat designed<br>for three people and the middle position does not have a shoulder<br>harness or a lap belt, you can't put four people in the back and have<br>the middle two with no seat belt and claim that it's legal for them to<br>ride there with no seat belt because there isn't one there anyway.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
