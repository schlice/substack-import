<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can a phone be temporarily disconnected, and does it not ring?<br><br>The type of phone will determine how it gets "disconnected." But in all<br>cases, the disconnected phone will not ring.<br><br>Traditional landline phones<br><br>Traditional landline phones can be disconnected in several ways:<br><br>- at the handset<br>- at the TNI (Telephone Network Interface)<br>- at the phone company end<br><br>The phone can be disconnected manually at the handset, which basically<br>entails unplugging it. The entire facility can be disconnected at the<br>TNI, which will disconnect all end units in the facility at one point.<br>Or you can contact the phone company who can disconnect the wires going<br>to the facility from their side.<br><br>Mobile phones<br><br>A mobile phone can be disabled in several ways:<br><br>- at the handset<br>- from the carrier<br><br>Mobile phones can be disabled at the handset by either removing the SIM<br>(Subscriber Identity Module) card, or by disabling the cellular radio.<br>Phones differ as to how this is accomplished, so I won't go into<br>specifics about disabling phones, but this is in general how it can be<br>done. The carrier can also temporarily disable a phone from accessing<br>their network. Carriers do this frequently for "lost" phones to prevent<br>someone else from using the phone on the network and perhaps racking up<br>large cellular data or long distance charges. Once the phone is "found,"<br>it can be re-enabled with another call to the carrier. You can similarly<br>temporarily disable a phone in this way.<br><br>A caveat for mobile phones: many smartphones can also connect to Wi-Fi<br>networks. There are also applications (think WhatsApp or Google<br>Hangouts) that will connect through Wi-Fi and can make phone calls.<br>This cannot be disabled by any of these means. The methods I<br>described only disable cellular phone and data service. You cannot<br>disable Wi-Fi access to a smartphone, so smartphones will always be able<br>to make some form of phone calls using some apps.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
