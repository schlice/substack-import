<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>After the last Walmart robbery, is it time to close all the Walmarts?<br><br>After the last car crash, is it time to remove all the cars from all the<br>people?<br><br>Don't you think you might be focusing on the wrong thing? Isn't it just<br>as bad as "After the latest school shooting, is it time to make everyone<br>turn in their guns?"<br><br>I've said it a number of times today. Why did the shooter choose that<br>school over the others she had in mind? This one had no armed security.<br><br>Let that sink in. She specifically chose this school because it was the<br>softest target. She may have been mentally unstable, with a warped set<br>of values, but she wasn't stupid; she knew that going up against armed<br>resistance wouldn't allow her to kill all the people she planned on<br>killing before she gets taken out.<br><br>- Allow teachers to carry concealed firearms, like they do outside the<br>  school.<br>- Get armed school security. The school district should provide at least<br>  one armed guard for every school.<br>- Have school resource officers. Partner with local authorities to post<br>  up SROs at all schools.<br>- Tighten down weak points. Do full security audits on all facilities,<br>  and budget in security improvements.<br><br>*BUT ALL IN ALL, DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN!*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
