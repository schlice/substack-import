<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The most common reason for a \"delay\" status is that one of the<br>agencies with which the NICS system normally communicates did not<br>respond within the appropriate time. So the request to that agency sits<br>in a queue, waiting to be processed. The request returns a \"delay\"<br>status which could turn to a \"deny\" should the delaying agency return<br>a non-approval status. If the response does not come, but all the other<br>reporting agencies report an approval status, the delay expires, and the<br>NICS request is approved.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
