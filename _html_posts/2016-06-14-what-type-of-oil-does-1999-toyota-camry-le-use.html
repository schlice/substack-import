<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Same type of oil that every other car uses: Automotive engine oil.<br><br>Could you potentially be asking what the *best* grade of oil would<br>be to use in the engine? Generally, the owner's manual will tell you<br>which oil the engine should use. With few exceptions, that's the oil you<br>should use.<br><br>I don't have a manual for a 1999 Toyota Camry, so I'm unsure which oil<br>is specifically recommended. You should check the manual, but I can<br>almost guarantee you it will say 5W-30 as the oil to use.<br><br>There may be an exception to this. Basically, if you live in a climate<br>that gets cold over the winter, you should be looking at 5W-30 oil.<br>If you live in a warmer climate, you might be looking at 10W-30 oil,<br>but you really would only be looking to use one of those two types of<br>engine oil.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
