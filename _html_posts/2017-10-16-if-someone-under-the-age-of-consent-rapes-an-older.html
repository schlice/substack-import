<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's unlikely, but it is possible. Statutory rape charges do not take<br>into account who was a "victim" and who was an "aggressor." They only<br>require sex with someone who cannot legally consent.<br><br>It's unlikely, however, that the state would bring charges against the<br>plaintiff, who is their client.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
