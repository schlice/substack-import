<br><br><p>Alan Dershowitz, Harvard law professor &gt;&gt;&gt; Who could agree with this?"<br>date: "May 21, 2020 12:12 PM PDT"<br>tags: "policy-analysis", "law-enforcement", "law"<br>Alan Dershowitz, Harvard<br>law professor &gt;&gt;&gt; Who could agree with this?**</p><br><p>Dershowitz went on to clarify that U.S. residents don\'t have a right to<br>infect others, and that if they wish to opt-out of vaccination, they<br>could be given an alternative in which people rejecting the state<br>mandate could remain in their homes permanently so as not to risk<br>infecting others.</p><br><p>\"That\'s what a democracy is about,\" he said. \"If the majority of the<br>people agree and support that, for public health measures, you have to<br>be vaccinated, you have to be vaccinated. They should give you an<br>alternative. The alternative is to live in your home, don\'t get<br>vaccinated, but never ever leave your home or live in a bubble. But if<br>you want to interact with other people, you cannot become Typhoid Mary.<br>The Constitution doesn\'t give you the right to spread your illness to<br>other people.\"</p><br><p>Basically, if a vaccine is developed, and you want to participate in<br>society, the government has the right to demand you be vaccinated. You<br>can refuse to be vaccinated, but if a majority of Americans agree, they<br>can demand that you not participate in society. Basically, like he said,<br>you don't have a right to spread illness to others. You are under no<br>obligation to get a vaccine to protect <em>yourself</em> from disease, but you<br>are indeed obligated to get a vaccine to prevent <em>others</em> from getting a<br>disease.</p><br><p>The protection of public health permits reasonable actions to prevent<br>the spread of communicable disease. The case that comes to mind is<br>[<a href="https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f18eb9&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobson_v._Massachusetts"><em>Jacobson v.<br>Massachusetts</em></a>{.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, and it was decided in<br>the early 20th century during the smallpox crisis (Dershowitz said<br>tuberculosis during his interview). <em>Jacobson</em> upheld the authority of<br>states to enforce compulsory vaccination laws. The Court\'s decision<br>articulated the view that individual liberty is not absolute and is<br>subject to the police power of the state. The court reaffirmed its<br>position in [<a href="https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=38121e&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zucht_v._King"><em>Zucht v.<br>King</em></a>{.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<em>,</em> in which a school was<br>permitted to deny entrance to a student who had failed to be vaccinated.</p><br><p>If a vaccine is developed, and if the vaccine prevents transmission of a<br>virus from one person to another, the state can compel your compliance<br>with the vaccination, or it can exclude you from participation in<br>society in any way it chooses in order to reasonably protect the public<br>health.</p><br></div><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
