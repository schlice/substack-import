<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are some of the biggest oversights in the Americans with<br>Disabilities Act?**<br><br>The ADA hamstrings businesses in favor of ease of access for the<br>disabled.<br><br>The law says that someone merely needs to claim to be disabled and<br>businesses must offer accommodations, no questions asked. So places of<br>public accommodation, like restaurants and amusement parks, are forced<br>to provide those accommodations to anyone who requests them. This has<br>led to widespread abuse of the system by the non-disabled. Businesses<br>are forced to limit the mechanisms by which accommodations are provided,<br>and what is actually provided, to the bare minimum required to make the<br>facility accessible, which does nothing to help the truly disabled.<br><br>Some balance in the law would have been nice. Some method of proving a<br>hidden disability would not have been terribly onerous on the disabled<br>person, but would greatly reduce abuse of the system.<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being<br>isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I<br>wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is<br>un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m<br>wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,<br>not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,<br>you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.<br>Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be<br>followed by a block and a mute. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
