<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Juvenile cases are handled by the juvenile justice system. All states<br>handle their programs differently, but the goal of these programs in all<br>cases is *rehabilitation*, not *punishment*.<br><br>Yes, they will get "in trouble." But it won't be jail time. They may<br>have to appear in juvenile court, and they may be ordered to receive<br>counseling or other remedies. So long as the juvenile is behaved after<br>that, those records remain sealed and are expunged after the youthful<br>offender turns 18.<br><br>But is this completely necessary? Perhaps you can take the video footage<br>to the parents of the juvenile, and you can all have a screening party<br>together and talk about what happened, as well as what can be done to<br>prevent such tragedies in the future. Don't you think that would be more<br>productive?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
