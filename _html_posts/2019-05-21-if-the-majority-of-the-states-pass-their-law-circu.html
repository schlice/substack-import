<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If the majority of the states pass their law circumventing the<br>electoral college would it be upheld by the Supreme Court when it is<br>challenged?**<br><br>Almost certainly not.<br><br>Let's look at the issue another way. The Supreme Court has stated that<br>states have the absolute authority to decide how their electoral votes<br>are divided. What if they decided to hold a lottery and sell their<br>electoral votes to the candidate who paid them the most money? Do you<br>think the Supreme Court would allow such a scheme?<br><br>If you said no, then you already understand why the National Popular<br>Vote (NPV) scheme is unconstitutional.<br><br>There are several portions of the NPV which violate the Constitution,<br>but the biggest one is related to the actual power of the state to<br>designate Electors who participate in presidential elections. This power<br>is a "delegated" power, unlike some other powers which are "reserved<br>powers." Madison said that reserved powers are "numerous and<br>indefinite," while delegated powers are "few and defined."<br><br>For example, the power of a state to enter into compacts with other<br>states is a reserved power. It generally involves the use of some other<br>reserved power, such as taxes or water rights. NPV's advocates believe<br>that because the power to enter into compacts is a reserved power, NPV<br>is Constitutional.<br><br>Delegated powers are specifically defined by the Constitution, and must<br>be used in accordance with the reason why they were delegated in the<br>first place (or in lawyer-speak, in accordance with the power's<br>underlying purpose, and its historical context). Courts can intervene if<br>a state tries to use a delegated power in a way in which it was not<br>intended.<br><br>The power of a state to appoint electors to participate in a<br>presidential election is a delegated power. It must be used in the way<br>it was intended: to represent the interests of *that state*. The<br>Electoral College and its system of electors was designed to balance a<br>number of competing interests, not just the popularity of the candidate.<br>To that end, the system of Electors was designed so that they act in the<br>best interests of their own state, in order to maintain the balance of<br>all of those competing interests. NPV would have Electors acting on<br>behalf of other states, and in just the same way that a state would not<br>be allowed to sell Electors to the highest bidder, a state cannot<br>declare Electors vote as agents of other states. This would be a breach<br>of the public trust, and would therefore be unconstitutional.<br><br>Additionally, because NPV would have a majority of electoral votes, it<br>would functionally repeal the Constitutional provision requiring the<br>House of Representatives to hold a run-off election in the event that no<br>candidate reached the requisite 270 electoral votes. This action<br>requires a Constitutional amendment to implement.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
