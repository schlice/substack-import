<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What agreement does the Constitution prohibit the states from<br>making?**<br><br>The Constitution prohibits the states from entering into *compacts* with<br>each other without Congressional approval.<br><br>Article I, Section 10, Clause 3:<br><br>> No state shall, without the consent of Congress...enter into any<br>> Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power\...\"<br><br>This doesn't mean that states can't enter into interstate compacts. It<br>simply means that they can't do so *without Congressional approval*.<br>Congress is specifically looking for compacts which make the new group<br>of states *more politically powerful* than it was before, because they<br>are *required to approve those*.<br><br>There are over 200 active compacts in the United States. 22 of them are<br>national, several of them with over 35 member states. More than 30 are<br>regional, each of them with 8 or more member<br>states.\[1\](#BYYzp){#cite-BYYzp .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-BYYzp){.citation_index}<br>[https://www.csg.org/knowledgecen\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8a6c0d&url=https://www.csg.org/knowledgecenter/docs/ncic/FactSheet.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="csg.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
