<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, it does not. The word "abortion" does not appear in the Bible.<br><br>What the Bible *does* speak of is the fact that life begins at<br>conception (not at first breath, as some abortionists like to quote).<br>The Bible speaks of God literally forming you in the womb, knowing you<br>even before you were created.<br><br>> I knew you before I formed you in your mother's womb. --- Jeremiah 1:4<br>><br>> For you formed my inwards parts; you knitted me together in my<br>> mother's womb. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.<br>> Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it full well. --- Psalm 139:13<br><br>If life is literally a creation of God, what right have we to destroy<br>it? It's clear that God is involved in the formation of new life, and<br>that life is alive (as we well know today); it is not inanimate, as the<br>dust of the ground.<br><br>Yes, God does kill in the Bible. He killed entire cities, filled with<br>women, children, and animals. Heck, he even flooded the whole earth and<br>killed everyone on it.<br><br>But every time he did so, it was because he had judged them to be<br>evil.<br><br>God was the judge, and the evil person or persons were destroyed. *Have<br>we done the same with a fetus*? What made the fetus so evil that we<br>needed to destroy it? Remember, *murder* in the Bible is "killing<br>without justification." What did that fetus, *created by God's own<br>hands,* do in order to deserve death? If the answer is nothing, then the<br>person committing this act is committing *murder*. Killing without<br>justification.<br><br>Abortion proponents who have limited Bible knowledge point to Exodus 21<br>as their justification for their belief that life begins at first<br>breath. This same chapter in the Bible authorizes slavery. Are you sure<br>this is the section of the Bible you want to hold sacrosanct? Remember,<br>these were the rules that God gave to the people of Israel so they could<br>create a functioning society. These rules were essentially made<br>unnecessary by Jesus. We no longer hold to the old law.<br><br>And God, as previously mentioned, has no tolerance for those who kill<br>innocents.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Does the Bible speak directly to the issue of abortion?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
