<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Nope. They can't, because they don't employ doctors of every specialty<br>to fact-check every answer. Nor are they required to under the law.<br><br>**Quora should do a better job of drilling it into people's heads that<br>you shouldn't get actionable medical advice from a question and answer<br>site.**<br><br>I'm not a doctor, but I've spent so much time as a patient advocate that<br>I can speak partly intelligently about multiple sclerosis. I'm also an<br>MS patient, so I can speak about my experience with the disease.<br><br>That said, I make it a point to not give out medical advice. I<br>*always* say "talk to your neurologist about xxx" or "you should<br>make sure you discuss this with your doctor" or "You can learn from my<br>experience, but don't change your diet/medicine/exercise routine without<br>talking to your doctor first." Because that's what I would do. But at a<br>certain point, I can only do so much. Can I make a mistake? Of course I<br>can, I'm not a doctor. But even if I was, I'm not your doctor. I don't<br>know your medical history. I don't know all the drugs you are taking, or<br>have access to your medical records. I wouldn't even be able to give<br>accurate, medically-relevant medical advice to one person.<br><br>People should also see the disclaimer on the message and take that to<br>heart. I've attached the disclaimer to this message, even though this<br>isn't a medical question, so that you can see it. We're already legally<br>protected when we provide medical answers. What more do you want?<br>Eventually, people have to be smart enough to know that you get what you<br>pay for, and *caveat emptor*. How much do you pay for medical advice on<br>Quora? Exactly my point. Remember the lyrics: "Talk is cheap, and free<br>advice is worth the price you pay."<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice. This answer is for GENERAL<br>INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. If you think you are experiencing a medical<br>emergency, call your local emergency number (in the United States, 911)<br>immediately.* *ALWAYS SEEK THE ADVICE OF YOUR DOCTOR* *before<br>starting or changing treatment.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to health-related questions are<br>intended third-party beneficiaries with certain rights under Quora\'s*<br>[[Terms of<br>Service](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
