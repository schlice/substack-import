<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [I think you have more options than you realize.\<br/>\<br/>The waiver usually says that the facility is not responsible for any<br/>injuries that occur while using the stuff, and the injuries can come<br/>from anywhere, even other people. So the facility clearly is protected<br/>by the waiver.\<br/>\<br/>HOWEVER, as is the case with all waivers, a waiver does not protect the<br/>facility against its own negligence. I would venture to guess that the<br/>facility does not allow more than ONE party on the trampoline at once.<br/>EVEN IF YOU SIGNED A WAIVER, IF THE FACILITY WAS NEGLIGENT, you can<br/>still sue the facility. This is one I would seriously check in to. If<br/>the trampoline is not specifically designed for multiple people to jump<br/>on at once, or if the facility specifically disallows more than one<br/>person on the trampoline at once, you can still sue the facility for<br/>negligence, regardless of the waiver. The facility is not allowed to act<br/>negligently, even with a waiver. Those things are not iron-clad, and<br/>they don\'t unilaterally protect the facility from anything under the<br/>sun. The facility still has to take reasonable protections to keep your<br/>kids safe, like making sure that more than one person isn\'t on the<br/>tramp at once. I would definitely check into this one, since that seems<br/>a little off to me.\<br/>\<br/>As for suing the injuring party, you would have to make the case that<br/>she was acting in a reckless manner, and it was her recklessness that<br/>caused the injury. Where she gets her money to pay your expenses is<br/>irrelevant (i.e. does her homeowner\'s insurance pay). If she was acting<br/>in a negligent manner, endangering herself and those around her, she can<br/>be sued for negligence in civil court and you can be reimbursed for your<br/>medical expenses along with \"pain and suffering\" like the adjustments<br/>you had to make to your vacation to accommodate the temporary handicap.\<br/>\<br/>So, of course, the trick is to prove recklessness or<br/>negligence.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
