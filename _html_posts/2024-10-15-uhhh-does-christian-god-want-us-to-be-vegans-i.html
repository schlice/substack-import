<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You probably need to keep reading.<br><br>So this encounter happens right after Noah gets out of the Ark with his<br>family. We pick up the action in Genesis 9:<br><br>> And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, "Be fruitful and<br>> multiply and fill the earth. The fear of you and the dread of you<br>> shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every bird of the<br>> heavens, upon everything that creeps on the ground and all the fish of<br>> the sea. Into your hand they are delivered. Every moving thing that<br>> lives shall be food for you. And as I gave you the green plants, I<br>> give you everything." \-- Genesis 9:1--3 ESV<br><br>So yeah, previous instructions superseded and updated with new<br>instructions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
