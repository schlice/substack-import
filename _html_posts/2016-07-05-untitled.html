<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's designed to be enforced retroactively, after a gun is used in a<br>crime. It's not designed to prevent any crime *per se.* It's designed to<br>ensure that everyone gets a background check.<br><br>But to be honest, what good will that do? Almost every mass shooter<br>acquired his guns completely legally, passing every background check.<br>Adding more background checks doesn't help anyone.<br><br>If a gun is involved in a crime, the ownership and transfer of that gun<br>between each owner is checked as far back as they can go; back to the<br>original purchase from the manufacturer, if possible. If a transfer took<br>place without a background check, the persons involved would face<br>criminal liability.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-loophole-in-the-U-S-that-makes-it-possible-to-buy-a-gun-at-a-gun-show-without-a-background-check/answer/Paul-Harding-14<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
