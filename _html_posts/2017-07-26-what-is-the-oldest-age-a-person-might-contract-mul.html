<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I had a PA at one clinic who developed and was diagnosed with MS in his<br>late 60s. It was relapsing-remitting, so they simply decided not to<br>treat it since the benefit would be minimal.<br><br>But to answer the question, there is no upper age limit at which someone<br>can be diagnosed with MS.<br><br>Additionally, there is no lower age limit. Pediatric MS is a thing as<br>well. These outer boundaries are rare, but they do exist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
