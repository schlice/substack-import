<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Emperor Constantine is generally recognized as championing December 25th<br>as the recognized birthday of Jesus.<br><br>In the early church, Jesus' birthday wasn't celebrated *at all*. If it<br>was even recognized, it was generally lumped in with another church<br>feast, most frequently it was the Feast of the Epiphany on January 6,<br>since this was one of the church's earliest established feasts.<br><br>Constantine declared that Christianity was going to be the religion of<br>the empire in 336, and December 25th of that year is generally<br>recognized as the first time western churches celebrated Christ's birth<br>on that date, and celebrated his baptism on the Feast of the Epiphany.<br><br>There's also lots of talk that Christians chose December 25th to<br>coincide with pagan rituals, particularly the Winter Solstice, and<br>evergreen trees from the Roman New Year and such. The church never tried<br>to change pagan traditions, or even co-opt them, but they were happy to<br>add the December 25th day because eventually (while not so in the early<br>days) they thought that celebrating birthdays was important. This<br>birthday, in particular, slotted in just nicely at the end of December,<br>allowing the celebration of the baptism story on the day of the Feast of<br>the Epiphany.<br><br>The church is always happy to celebrate a birthday, especially this one<br>--- but only to have another opportunity to celebrate the special nature<br>of the person who was born.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
