<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can the death penalty be constitutional in the USA when the<br>constitution explicitly declares that the individual has an unalienable<br>right to life ("We hold these truths to be self-evident...")?**<br><br>The quote you gave is from the Declaration of Independence, and is not<br>actually legally binding.<br><br>The salient part is from the Constitution, the 14th Amendment:<br><br>> *No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the<br>> privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States;* ***nor<br>> shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,<br>> without due process of law;*** *nor deny to any person within its<br>> jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.*<br><br>Note the sentence I highlighted. It's really important. It says that a<br>State many not deprive a person of life without due process of law.<br><br>Flip that around. It says that if you do have due process of law,<br>the State can deprive you of life.<br><br>It is universally assumed that your day in court and all of your appeals<br>are more than adequate due process.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
