<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I would suggest you first talk to eBay Customer Service. Purchases of<br>business equipment like industrial printers are covered under a separate<br>eBay insurance group (actually a third party). You should explain the<br>situation to them; they may be able to mediate the dispute.<br><br>If they cannot help you, you should consult with a property loss<br>attorney in your local area.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
