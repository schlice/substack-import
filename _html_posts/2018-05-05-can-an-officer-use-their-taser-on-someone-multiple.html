There is no requirement that a person must be charged with a crime<br>before a Taser can be deployed.<br><br>The Taser is a "pain compliance" device, so the only requirement is that<br>there is a directive given by police with which the suspect is failing<br>to comply. The Taser is used to "encourage" compliance with that<br>directive.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
