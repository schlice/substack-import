<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you own a gun, should you ensure your children are trained in gun<br>usage and safety?**<br><br>*YES YES YES YES YES!!!!!!!!!!!*<br><br>I cannot emphasize this strongly enough.<br><br>And this is more of a *parenting* discussion than it is a *gun*<br>discussion, because this is true about anything we prohibit our children<br>from touching. When we do this to our children, it becomes the<br>"forbidden fruit." The thing which, for some unknown reason, we can't<br>have.<br><br>*And we want it.*<br><br>We become *curious* about it.<br><br>And in that moment of forgetfulness, when we forget to lock the liquor<br>cabinet, or we put that handgun in the nightstand instead of the gun<br>safe, that child will touch it. They'll try a sip of bourbon, or they'll<br>play with that gun.<br><br>REMOVE THE NOVELTY! DO IT WHILE THEY ARE YOUNG!<br><br>Teach them about firearms, and what they do. Take them to the range.<br>They probably won't be able to shoot effectively, but the can see what<br>the gun does.<br><br>Most importantly, the whole experience should **teach them that guns are<br>dangerous, so until they are older, they should not touch them.**<br><br>The NRA is one of the world's biggest firearms safety organizations.<br>They have a youth gun safety program (even a mascot: "Eddie Eagle"). I<br>had a VHS cassette of their "Learn Gun Safety with Eddie Eagle" video<br>(narrated by Jason Priestly), and that stupid song sticks in your head:<br>"Stop, Don't Touch, Leave the Area, Tell an Adult." See if you can find<br>some educational materials that the NRA puts out to help you teach these<br>lessons to your kids.<br><br>These tenets are incredibly important to teach children, because<br>*they're not always within view!* Occasionally, they'll go to a friend's<br>house, or even have a sleepover, and other parents may not be as<br>cautious as you when it comes to securing firearms.<br><br>Teach them early, reinforce often, and stay safe!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
