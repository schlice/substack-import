<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it wrong to allow someone to commit suicide if they truly do not<br>have any will or desire to live or anyone to live for?**<br><br>So you asked if it was "wrong" to allow someone to kill themselves if<br>they truly have no will to live. So in order to determine "wrongness"<br>without using a religious context, we have to determine if it is right<br>or wrong to have a will to live. Note that in order to do this in the<br>way you're asking, we must ignore the religious aspect and focus just on<br>the morality of allowing someone to kill themselves without<br>intervention. And before the perfectionists start coming at me in the<br>comments, I know that without basis, morality is fluid. I'm going to try<br>to use human physiological traits to indicate the human desire to<br>continue to live, so gimme a break here.<br><br>So here goes:<br><br>Self-preservation is nearly a universal human trait. Subconscious action<br>is nearly always taken to preserve life at all costs. If you cannot<br>breathe, you will struggle against whatever condition is causing you to<br>not be able to breathe. Therefore, physiologically speaking, we can say<br>that people have an innate, inbuilt will to live. Society did not teach<br>them this. Their parents did not teach them this. They are innately<br>programmed to continue to live at all costs.<br><br>Therefore, anything done to countermand the continuance of your life<br>would lie in direct opposition to physiology. In other words, taking<br>your own life goes against how we are built as human beings.<br><br>Understanding this, we can also say that a "desire" to no longer live,<br>or a "lack of desire" to continue living, is also incongruous with how<br>we are built. Clearly, this would be something caused by invalid<br>thinking or invalid logic incorrectly influencing our natural desire to<br>continue to live.<br><br>Knowing that someone's desire to terminate their life is unnatural and<br>violates how we were designed, then yes it would be wrong to allow<br>someone to terminate their life when they are simply suffering from<br>invalid logic or invalid thinking leading them to believe that they do<br>not have a will to live.<br><br>TL;DR: *A lack of a will to live indicates mental disease and<br>invalid mental processing. It would be wrong to allow someone to kill<br>themselves when they are merely suffering from a mental disease. You<br>should lead them to get help, not assist them in fulfilling their faulty<br>desires.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
