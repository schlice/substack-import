<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, not at all.<br><br>The passage in Luke is a historical account of Jesus discussing the<br>kingdom of God. By using a parable, Jesus is explaining that He can't<br>take His throne now, he has to die, be resurrected, ascend into heaven,<br>and then wait until the time is right for Him to return (Luke 24:50--53;<br>Revelation 19:11--16).<br><br>When Christianity was spread by force during the time between 400 AD and<br>1500 AD, it was spread for a different reason. This was during the time<br>that the Latin Church insisted on universal Christianity. It was<br>perceived, at the time, that "religious aliens," or unbelievers, were<br>"contaminating" Christianity, and there was widespread intolerance by<br>church and state authorities, mobs, and vigilante groups.<br><br>\<br><br>In short, it wasn't any Bible passage that caused people to spread<br>Christianity by force. It was sin. It was the sin of pride, and its<br>resulting intolerance by people.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
