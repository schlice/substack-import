<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *How should America\'s Armed Forces deal with Putin sympathizers in<br>> their ranks?*<br><br>In exactly the same way we deal with, oh, I don't know, **everyone who<br>wears the uniform.**<br><br>*What you personally believe is irrelevant. What you* *do* *is what<br>is important.*<br><br>If your Putin sympathies cause you to steal classified information and<br>give it to Putin, you should go to jail.<br><br>If your Putin sympathies cause you to disobey direct orders, you should<br>be Article 15â€²d right out of the service.<br><br>If your Putin sympathies don't cause any change to the character or<br>quality of your service, then I don't care whether you believe in<br>ancient aliens or Kim Jong Un being all-powerful, or Putin. What you<br>believe matters not. What you do matters. And that's all that matters.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
