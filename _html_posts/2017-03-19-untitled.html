<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>My dad worked for Nassau County PD (east of NYC, on Long Island). I<br>watched him assist several local doctors and business owners get their<br>permits. So I know that with police assistance, it can be done, and<br>relatively easily. In New York, you do need a reason to get one, and<br>it\'s up to the chief of police to determine if your reason is good<br>enough. There are also pretty stringent registration requirements for<br>your firearms.<br><br>This was 25 years ago though; I can\'t speak to how easy it is today.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-chances-that-the-NYPD-will-issue-a-carry-permit-to-a-lawyer-who-has-been-getting-very-severe-death-threats/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
