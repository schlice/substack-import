<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The correct answer, as with the answer to all legal questions, is "it<br>depends."<br><br>If the fence is precisely on the property line, straddling both<br>properties, then when your neighbor hangs things on the fence and in to<br>your yard, this is technically a tort trespass (not criminal<br>trespassing). If the fence actually is located within the neighbor's<br>property, then hanging things on the fence technically is not a<br>trespass, as the action takes place completely within the neighbor's<br>property.<br><br>Therefore, your first step is to call your city or county and request a<br>survey to determine the actual location of the property line. If the<br>fence actually is on the property line, and if this trespass truly<br>bothers you, you should start by asking your neighbor to not do that any<br>more. Let them know that your side of the fence is actually your<br>property and you don't want items hanging into your yard.<br><br>Your next step should be to retain the services of a tort attorney in<br>your area. Let the attorney send them an official cease-and-desist<br>letter, citing the trespass, and what may happen if they don't stop,<br>which will be you suing them for trespass.<br><br>Applying treatments to your side of the fence which will damage their<br>towels is probably not advisable.<br><br>Instead of focusing on the problem, perhaps you could assist with some<br>solutions. Perhaps you can help by offering your neighbor some<br>suggestions on hanging towel racks which they could hang on their side<br>of the fence. If you were really motivated to end this practice, you<br>might consider chipping in to help them purchase these racks, or assist<br>them with putting them up. It benefits you as well as them. Win-win!<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice.
