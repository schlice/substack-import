<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it legal for a restaurant to forcefully take a non-reserved table<br>from a patron after the patron has sat down and placed an order? What<br>are the legal options of the patron?**<br><br>Today in Law 101 we're discussing *implied-in-fact contracts*. These are<br>contracts which are created by circumstances, not documents.<br><br>In this case, a contract is implied in fact because both parties assumed<br>that an agreement existed, and their behavior implied that they were<br>keeping to that agreement. When the restaurant seated the patron and<br>took their order, the restaurant was entering into an implied-in-fact<br>contract which stated that they would cook and serve the ordered food,<br>and the patron in turn would pay the restaurant for the food and the<br>service. The contract didn't need to be written and signed, because both<br>parties acted as if the contract existed.<br><br>It follows then that if an implied-in-fact contract existed, one of the<br>parties can be sued for breach of that contract.<br><br>In this case, however, it would not only be difficult to prove that an<br>implied-in-fact contract existed, what would be the damages? Would you<br>seek compensatory damages? Would you seek punitive damages? You can<br>absolutely sue the restaurant and take them to small-claims court<br>without any attorney needed, but the restaurant will likely present a<br>reason they moved you from the table, and you will have a difficult time<br>proving them wrong.<br><br>While you have a case, you don't have a good chance of prevailing, or<br>gaining anything substantial other than the cost of your meal. Leave a<br>bad review on Yelp and move on.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
