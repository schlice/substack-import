<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No. There is nothing special about being eternal that requires a being<br>to be omnipotent (all-powerful). Being eternal simply means that a being<br>has no beginning and no end. Omnipotence means that the being is<br>all-powerful; the being has an unlimited motivational force and can<br>apply that force with unlimited duration and power.<br><br>We know that God is omnipotent because the Bible tells us so. For<br>example, in Genesis 1, God creates the entire universe and everything in<br>it *by simply speaking it into existence*. For man to create something,<br>we need tools and effort, and even in that, we are only *transforming*<br>one thing into another. God *literally* made things *come into<br>existence* (meaning they weren't there before, and then they were) by<br>just *speaking*. This hints at God's power.<br><br>But in other areas of the Bible, God's omnipotence is discussed:<br><br>> "I know that you can do all things,\<br>> and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted. \-- Job 42:2 ESV<br>><br>> And the LORD said to Moses, "Is the LORD's hand shortened? Now you<br>> shall see whether my word will come true for you or not." \-- Numbers<br>> 11:23 ESV<br><br>There are many more Bible verses which display God's unlimited power to<br>do anything in keeping with His nature. Suffice it to say that we're not<br>guessing about God's omnipotence. It's in the Book.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
