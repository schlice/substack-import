<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your<br>> right to say it.\<br>> -Evelyn Beatrice Hall*<br><br>Dissent and differences of opinion are healthy and normal in a<br>well-functioning society. The ability to express your differing opinions<br>is a function of a free society.<br><br>Unfortunately, the political climate which has been fostered over the<br>last eight years and capped off by the election of a contentious figure<br>has ignited the passions of those who were already easily swayed by such<br>dramas. So normal differences of opinion morph into violence at the drop<br>of a hat.<br><br>I don't feel sad that a protest and a counter-protest took place. I feel<br>proud that I live in a place where such things are legal and that the<br>protesters are not immediately hauled off to jail for daring to express<br>an opinion. That's a sign of a well-functioning free society. I do<br>feel sad that a protest and a counter-protest so easily devolved into<br>violence. That's a sign that we have allowed our passions to take over<br>for our logic.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
