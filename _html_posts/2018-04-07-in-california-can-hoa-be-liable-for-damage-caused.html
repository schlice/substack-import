<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In California, can HOA be liable for damage caused by security to<br>property left (against the rules) in the common area?**<br><br>In general, a homeowner's association is not liable for the individual<br>actions of anyone, even their contracted security. In general, only the<br>security contractor would be liable for any damage to property they<br>cause.<br><br>The leaving of the property in a common area does not negate any<br>liability of any person. What it *may* do is limit the amount you may be<br>awarded, since the property was left in the common area in violation of<br>the HOA rules.<br><br>In your suit, you would have to establish that the security contractor<br>actually was the person who damaged the property, and then you would<br>have to establish that the contractor did so negligently, intentionally,<br>or maliciously. If you cannot establish that the security contractor<br>damaged the property, your case is probably over before it starts. So<br>hopefully you have some video evidence that shows the contractor<br>damaging the property. However, it is a common area, which implies that<br>the security contractor is not the only person with access to the area.<br>If anyone else has access to the common area (even if they weren't<br>expected to be in the area at that time), you probably haven't firmly<br>established that it was the security contractor who damaged the<br>property.<br><br>Moral of the story: don't leave your property in the common area when<br>you are not permitted to do so.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
