<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It depends on your definition of "unsatisfactory service." The only sort<br>of unsatisfactory service which is *actionable* is called "malpractice."<br><br>Malpractice occurs when your attorney does not provide competent<br>representation, or when they engage in professional misconduct.<br><br>Some of the things which may indicate incompetent representation could<br>include:<br><br>- Losing evidence, especially evidence crucial to your case<br>- Failing to file paperwork on time<br>- Lacking the skills needed to perform the duties hired to perform<br><br>Some of the things which could be considered professional misconduct<br>are:<br><br>- Intentionally overbilling<br>- Abandoning a client<br>- Concealing evidence<br>- Conflicts of interest<br><br>If you are unsatisfied with the services provided by your attorney, you<br>can do a few things.<br><br>1.  Talk to your lawyer. Tell him your concerns and see if you can<br>    work out a plan for improvement.<br>2.  Get a second opinion. To do this, ask your lawyer to send you<br>    copies of everything in your file, and take those copies to another<br>    lawyer for a consultation. Second opinions are relatively<br>    inexpensive, and are a really good way to "gut check" yourself to<br>    see if your lawyer is indeed really misrepresenting you.<br>    1.  To get that second opinion, you have to "get copies of<br>        everything in your file," or in other words, get your file.<br>        This step is really important, especially if there are deadlines<br>        and motions have been filed and trial dates are looming. You<br>        need to get all the work done so far so another attorney can<br>        better assist you. You may even ask your new lawyer to help you<br>        get your file. You may have to ask your state Bar Association<br>        for help to get your file. And if all else fails, you may have<br>        to sue your old attorney in small claims court to get your file<br>        and to reimburse you for the time spent redoing work in your<br>        file or the time and expense you incurred just to get the file.<br>3.  Fire your lawyer. You can always fire your lawyer and hire<br>    another one. But be warned, this may not be cheap, depending on how<br>    much work your first lawyer did, the quality of that work, and how<br>    much time you have until trial.<br>4.  File a complaint. File a complaint with your state Bar<br>    Association, which is usually the group that licenses attorneys. If<br>    your state uses a different group, complain to them.<br>5.  Sue. Yes, you can sue an attorney, *if you lost money because of<br>    the way your lawyer handled your case*. But suing for malpractice is<br>    a tough row to hoe. First, you have to show your lawyer mishandled<br>    your case and it cost you money. Then, you must show that the<br>    mistake lost you money that you would not have if your lawyer had<br>    handled your case properly in the first place.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer**:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
