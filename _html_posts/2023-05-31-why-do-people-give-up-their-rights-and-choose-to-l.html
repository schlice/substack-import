<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What rights, exactly, am I giving up? The right to paint my house<br>electric blue? The right to not mow my lawn for six months? The right to<br>leave my front porch looking like a shithole? The right to have six cars<br>in my front lawn, only three of them with wheels?<br><br>The reason why I choose to live in an HOA is not to control *my*<br>behavior. I already do that on my own; I don't need an HOA to tell me<br>how to live. Everything that the HOA would ever tell me, I already do. I<br>choose to live in a neighborhood with an HOA (and I serve on the Board<br>of Directors) to make sure that *my neighbors* control their own<br>behavior.<br><br>*And why do I care what my neighbors do?*<br><br>Because when everyone is forced to keep their houses and properties<br>looking neat and orderly, ***home values remain as high as possible,<br>even in a down market.***<br><br>So we choose to live in a community with an HOA to ***PROTECT OUR OWN<br>INVESTMENTS***. It's really that simple.<br><br>Plus, there are fringe benefits of living in a community with an HOA.<br>The HOA coordinates the collection of money to pay for insurance for the<br>common areas (so if one of my kids gets hurt playing there, someone can<br>help pay for the medical bills). They also pay for the landscaping in<br>the common areas and at the entrance monoliths, and the water to keep<br>those areas pretty. They coordinate community events to foster a sense<br>of community. They pay for amenities like playgrounds and dog parks, and<br>even if you don't take advantage of those amenities, they make your<br>community more attractive to prospective buyers.<br><br>I totally understand that some people simply don't like anyone ever<br>telling them what to do, especially neighbors. I get it. It's your<br>house. You paid for it. You should be able to do anything you like to<br>it, and you shouldn't need anyone's permission to do it. But even if you<br>don't live in a community with an HOA, don't you sometimes have to get<br>permission to do some things? If you want to put up a tower to create a<br>HAM Radio base station, doesn't the government in which your house is<br>located control that? If you want to start farming pigs on your<br>property, doesn't your local government control that? So it's not that<br>someone is telling you what you can and cannot do, and what you must get<br>permission to do before you do it (because you always have that). It's<br>the level of control you object to.<br><br>Again, that's just fine. But because I don't live out in the middle of<br>nowhere, because I choose to live in a neighborhood with 114 other<br>homes, and because, if I ever decide to sell my house, I want to get the<br>maximum value from it, I'm going to welcome that HOA ensuring that my<br>neighbors toe the line, because people won't buy a pretty house in a<br>shitty neighborhood. And if they do, they won't pay top dollar for it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
