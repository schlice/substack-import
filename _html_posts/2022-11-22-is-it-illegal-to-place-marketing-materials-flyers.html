<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Mailboxes are not controlled by the HOA, but by the US Postal Service.<br><br>And they have quite a bit to say about placing marketing materials<br>inside mailboxes. Section 508.3. 1.3 of the Domestic Mail Manual (DMM)<br>states the following:<br><br>> *No part of a mail receptacle may be used to deliver any matter not<br>> bearing postage, including items or matter placed upon, supported by,<br>> attached to, hung from, or inserted into a mail receptacle.*<br><br>So you can rest assured that you won't face the wrath of the HOA. You'll<br>instead be visited by a Postal Inspector.<br><br>It's also important to note that while it is illegal to put anything on<br>to or inside a *mailbox*, it is not similarly illegal to put anything in<br>a *mail slot*. So if individual homes have mail slots, placing flyers in<br>those is not illegal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
