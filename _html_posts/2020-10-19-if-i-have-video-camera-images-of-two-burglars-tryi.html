It was an attempted burglary, which is a crime in<br>nearly every jurisdiction in the United States.<br><br>However, it is highly unlikely that the police will investigate the<br>incident much beyond taking your statement and your camera footage.<br>Without some concrete evidence proving the identity of the criminals, it<br>is highly unlikely that the police can do much.<br><br>Are camera images deemed invasion of privacy?<br><br>No. There is no expectation of privacy on the outside of your home. Your<br>security cameras are capturing areas on your property, and you as the<br>property owner control the privacy of those areas. The persons who enter<br>those areas are bound by your rules of privacy, except in areas on your<br>property in which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, like<br>your bedroom or your bathroom.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
