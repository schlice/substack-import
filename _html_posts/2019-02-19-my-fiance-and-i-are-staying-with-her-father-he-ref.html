<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My fiance and I are staying with her father. He refused to let us pay<br>rent and now, suddenly wants us out within 24 hours and threatened to<br>move our stuff out when we are working. Is any of this legal?**<br><br>Because you and your fiancé agreed to pay rent, you are probably legally<br>considered to be "tenants," whether or not you actually paid that rent.<br>If you never paid money and you never agreed to pay money, you're<br>probably not a tenant, but a guest. But if you agreed to pay money to<br>stay there, even if you never paid, you are probably a tenant.<br><br>But let me look into my crystal ball and see where this is going: if he<br>does move your stuff out while you're at work, what are you going to do?<br>Legally, you'll have rights to file a lawsuit for wrongful eviction. A<br>wrongful eviction lawsuit can be very costly for him. He may have to<br>repay you for living costs while you were no longer in the house, lost,<br>stolen, or damaged personal property, pain and suffering, lost time from<br>work dealing with this, and what the law calls *punitive damages* to<br>punish him for what he did, especially if he did so maliciously.<br><br>That is, of course, if the judge agrees with you and finds that you did<br>agree to pay rent, making you a tenant instead of a guest.<br><br>But let's assume that you're right, and you are found to be a tenant,<br>and he is found to have wrongfully evicted you. He gets hit with a huge<br>judgement (which he may or may not be able to pay), and he may lose some<br>property which he is forced to liquidate in order to repay that<br>court-ordered debt to you. *Once he is settled up with you, he never<br>speaks to you or your fiancé again.*<br><br>Is that really what you're going for?<br><br>You may win in the short term, but are you prepared to accept the<br>consequences of winning in the long term?<br><br>You might just have to bite the bullet and move out. It may be better<br>that way.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
