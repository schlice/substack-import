<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm going to take these out of order.<br><br>> **Is it considered blind faith to believe in something without<br>> tangible evidence?**<br><br>I would argue that *you* believe in quite a few things which have no<br>tangible evidence. In fact, there are a number of things we are all<br>rational to believe, even though science cannot prove them. Here's a<br>short list:<br><br>- Logic and Math. Science cannot prove them, because science presupposes<br>  them.<br>- Metaphysical truths, such as believing that there are minds which<br>  exist outside of my own.<br>- Aesthetic judgements. Science cannot prove that a sunset is beautiful.<br>- Ethical judgements. Science similarly cannot prove that the Nazis were<br>  evil. The good, like the beautiful, cannot be proven through science.<br><br>And probably most surprisingly,<br><br>- Science itself. The belief that scientific experimentation produces<br>  truth cannot be proven through the scientific method. You therefore<br>  assume (through faith) that science produces truth.<br><br>With that understanding, let's address the first part of your question.<br><br>> Can the existence of God be proven if He has no physical form?<br><br>The answer is a resounding yes. Since we know that we are all rational<br>to believe some things even though we don't have physical proof, we know<br>that there must be other ways to determine truth *outside* of empirical<br>evidence. Besides, it makes no sense to look for tangible evidence of an<br>intangible God. Whether or not you believe that God exists, if He does,<br>He *necessarily* is transcendent and immaterial. So you're never going<br>to find one of God's hairs, or see one of God's footprints. It's<br>illogical.<br><br>Does that mean it is impossible to demonstrate that God exists? No. It<br>simply means that science is not the right means, just as a metal<br>detector is not the right tool to find a plastic cup.<br><br>The right means are "logical proofs," which are contained in the<br>discipline called *philosophy.* Philosophy is concerned with life's most<br>important issues, from morality to meaning to God. Philosophy allows us<br>to probe realities that can't be detected through our senses; thus,<br>philosophy provides an excellent method to explore evidence for the<br>existence of God.<br><br>Let's not forget, philosophy is not divorced from science, as if you can<br>rely on science alone, and philosophy is just pseudo-babble for PhDs to<br>discuss while smoking pipes in dimly-lit rooms. Philosophy is the<br>*foundation* of science. Science is dependent on philosophy. In fact,<br>*science is a slave to philosophy.* Bad philosophy results in bad<br>science, and good science requires good philosophy. Why? Because:<br><br>1.  Science cannot be done without philosophy. Philosophical<br>    assumptions are utilized in the search for causes, and, therefore,<br>    cannot be the result of them. For example, as we've already<br>    addressed, scientists assume (by faith) that reason and the<br>    scientific method allow us to accurately understand the world around<br>    us. That cannot be proven by science itself. You can't prove the<br>    tools of science (i.e. the laws of logic, the Law of Causality, the<br>    Principle of Uniformity, or the reliability of observation) by<br>    running some kind of experiment. You have to assume those things are<br>    true in order to do the experiment. So science is built on<br>    philosophy. Unfortunately, many so-called scientists are very poor<br>    philosophers.<br>2.  **Philosophical assumptions can dramatically impact scientific<br>    conclusions**. If a scientist assumes beforehand that only natural<br>    causes are possible, then probably no amount of evidence will<br>    convince him that intelligence created the first one-celled amoeba<br>    or any other designed entity. When Darwinists presuppose that<br>    intelligent causes are impossible, then natural laws are the only<br>    game in town. Likewise, if a creationist rules out natural causes<br>    beforehand (and I don't know of any who do), then he also risks<br>    missing the right answer. But a scientist who is open-minded to both<br>    natural and intelligent causes can follow the evidence wherever it<br>    leads.<br>3.  Science doesn't really say anything---scientists do. Data are<br>    always interpreted by scientists. When those scientists let their<br>    personal preferences or unproven philosophical assumptions dictate<br>    their interpretation of the evidence, they do exactly what they<br>    accuse religious people of doing---they let their ideology dictate<br>    their conclusions. When that's the case, their conclusions should be<br>    questioned, because they may be nothing more than philosophical<br>    presuppositions passed off as scientific facts.<br><br>Philosophy typically offers evidence in the form of *arguments*. In<br>fact, thinkers over the years have identified no fewer than twenty<br>arguments for God, arguments that range from the clear and simple to the<br>extremely complex. Some of these arguments appeal to the universe or<br>history, others to the existence of reason and beauty.<br><br>We can approach the God question from many angles, and there is no one<br>best way. But I think there is one argument that is not only clear and<br>convincing, but easy enough to understand.<br><br>First, if terms like "arguments" or "evidence" bother you, you might<br>instead consider these arguments as "clues" that converge and point to a<br>common conclusion, much the way road signs guide you to a specific<br>destination. A sign doesn't prove that the destination exists, but it<br>does point the way. These arguments are signposts to God. So, let us<br>look at one signpost that in my opinion, presents perhaps the simplest<br>yet most powerful argument for God's existence.<br><br>The Kalam argument dates back to the Middle Ages but has been made<br>popular today by William Lane Craig, an evangelical Christian<br>philosopher. The argument is very simple; in fact, it is probably the<br>easiest of all the arguments to understand, having only two premises and<br>one conclusion:<br><br>- P1: Everything which has a beginning has a cause.<br>- P2: The universe had a beginning.<br>- C1: The universe has a cause.<br><br>So let's dig in to these two premises and one conclusion:<br><br>Premise 1: This statement says everything that has a beginning has a<br>cause. It's very important that we get this right. Some atheists try to<br>refute this premise by responding, "But if everything that exists has a<br>cause, and God exists, then what caused God?" But the premise does not<br>claim, "Everything that *exists* has a cause." It says, "Everything that<br>*begins to exist* has a cause." Since God, by definition, and whether<br>you believe in Him or not, is eternal and never began to exist, this<br>first premise does not apply to Him. Therefore, the rhetorical question<br>"What caused God?" is like asking, "To whom is the bachelor married?" or<br>"What is the sound of one hand clapping?" Regardless of whether<br>bachelors or hands exist, these questions do not make sense. They are<br>literally nonsense because they confuse the meaning of terms.<br><br>Okay, back to the first premise. Is it true? Does everything that begins<br>to exist have a cause? For most people, the answer is yes; it is common<br>sense. Almost nobody denies it. The statement simply means that nothing<br>just springs into existence, randomly and without a cause. For if things<br>did come into being this way, then our world would be a wild spree of<br>things apparently popping into existence like sleight of hand magic.<br>Only it would be worse, since with sleight of hand you at least have a<br>magician who pulls rabbits out of a hat. However, in a world that<br>violates this first premise, rabbits would pop in and out of being even<br>without magicians or hats. Few sane people believe the world works this<br>way. Even the great atheist David Hume said, "I never asserted so absurd<br>a proposition as that something should arise without a cause." So,<br>through experience and reflection most people, even most honest<br>atheists, agree that everything that begins to exist has a cause.<br><br>Premise 2: This claim is slightly more controversial than the first<br>one. In fact, no less a thinker than St. Thomas Aquinas says that the<br>truth that the world had a beginning of its duration is only<br>conclusively known by faith and not by reason. Nonetheless, a host of<br>the greatest minds from antiquity to the present, including St.<br>Bonaventure in the Middle Ages and William Lane Craig today, offer<br>arguments that purport to defend this truth. An example of one of these<br>arguments, one which St. Bonaventure includes in his paradoxes of the<br>infinite, goes as follows: If the world has always existed, then there<br>would be an infinite number of past days. However, if there were an<br>infinite number of past days, we never would have been able to arrive at<br>the present day because an infinite series, by definition, cannot be<br>traversed. Since we have arrived at today (and today is the end date of<br>history), it follows that there must have been a beginning of time (a<br>beginning date).<br><br>Modern physics also seems to give weight to this position. Despite<br>cyclic cosmological models advanced by some physicists in recent years,<br>since the advent of the big bang theory in the twentieth century, the<br>scientific consensus is that the universe did have a beginning roughly<br>fourteen billion years ago. Alexander Vilenkin, a leading non-Christian<br>cosmologist, was invited to speak at a colloquium for Stephen Hawking's<br>seventieth birthday. There, in front of the greatest scientists in the<br>world, Vilenkin said, "All the evidence we have says that the universe<br>had a beginning." It is rare for scientists to speak with this measure<br>of conclusiveness, but Vilenkin stated his opinion that it is not just<br>that *some* of the evidence points to a beginning of the universe, or<br>even the *majority* of evidence, but that *all* of the evidence points<br>that way today.<br><br>Conclusion: The two premises are widely accepted today: everything<br>that begins to exist has a cause, and the universe began to exist. If<br>that is the case, then the third statement, the conclusion of the<br>argument, logically follows. We cannot avoid the fact that if everything<br>that begins to exist has a cause, and the universe began to exist, then<br>the universe must have had a cause.<br><br>This logical conclusion leads us to wonder: if the universe had a cause,<br>*what* is that cause? The cause certainly could not have been anything<br>*within* the universe or even *the universe itself*, since things can't<br>cause themselves to come into existence. This idea defies logic. Thus,<br>the cause of the universe must be something *beyond* the universe,<br>something beyond all matter, energy, space, and time. In other words, it<br>must be transcendent (beyond the universe), it must be immaterial<br>(beyond matter and space), it must be eternal (beyond time), and if it<br>has created something so massively complex as the universe, it must be<br>tremendously powerful and intelligent. Well, a transcendent, immaterial,<br>eternal, supremely powerful, and intelligent cause of the<br>universe---what does that sound like to you? As Thomas Aquinas pithily<br>puts it, "This is what most people mean by 'God.'"<br><br>Now of course, this doesn't tell us anything about *which* God exists,<br>or anything about that God. It simply is a logical proof which shows<br>that logically-speaking, a creator God must exist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
