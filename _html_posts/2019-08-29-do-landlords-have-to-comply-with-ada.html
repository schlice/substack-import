<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do landlords have to comply with ADA?<br><br>So the first thing you need to recognize is that there are two pieces of<br>legislation we need to look at. One is the ADA, and the other is the<br>Fair Housing Act. The ADA addresses places of public accommodation,<br>like restaurants, businesses, and hotels. So while ADA applies to<br>multifamily units (and might apply to areas like the clubhouse and the<br>rental office), it does not apply to the actual domiciles. The Fair<br>Housing Act addresses "domiciles" or "residences," places like rental<br>houses and apartments.<br><br>So to answer your question, landlords only have to comply with ADA in<br>areas of public accommodation. This would include places like the<br>clubhouse or the rental office, but not the actual domicile.<br><br>Let's then ask the follow-on question: **Do landlords have to comply<br>with the Fair Housing Act?**<br><br>The answer is a resounding "mostly." Most rental properties are indeed<br>covered under FHA, which states that a landlord cannot discriminate "in<br>the sale, lease, or rental of housing, or to make housing unavailable,<br>because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or<br>national origin." That said, there are certain categories of housing<br>that are not covered:<br><br>> - Owner-occupied buildings with four or fewer units. The FHA<br>>   generally isn\'t applicable when a building has two to four units,<br>>   and the owner lives in one of them.<br>> - Single-family homes rented without a broker. The FHA doesn\'t<br>>   apply when a single-family house is sold or rented without a broker,<br>>   so long as the owner doesn't own more than three houses.<br>> - Religious organizations. If you\'re a religious organization<br>>   leasing apartments at a property that you\'re not operating for a<br>>   commercial purpose, you may legally limit occupancy or give<br>>   preferences to people of your organization\'s religion. However, the<br>>   FHA points out that this exception is strictly limited to religion<br>>   and cautions that a religious organization still can\'t discriminate<br>>   based on race, color, or national origin ([[42 U.S. Code ยง<br>>   3607(a)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2cd616&url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3607){.external_link<br>>   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>   onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>   qt-tooltip="cornell.edu"}]{.qlink_container}).<br>> - Private clubs. If you\'re leasing apartments on behalf of a<br>>   private club and not for a commercial purpose, the FHA lets you<br>>   limit occupancy to your club\'s members.<br>> - Senior housing. The FHA includes \"familial status\" as one of<br>>   its seven protected classes, which refers to the presence of at<br>>   least one child under 18 living in a household. However, although<br>>   the FHA bans discrimination against families with children, you may<br>>   be exempt from this ban if your property qualifies as senior<br>>   housing. Exempt properties include those that fit the rules of 55<br>>   and older or 62 and older communities, or those that participate in<br>>   a federal, state or local senior housing<br>>   program.\[1\](#RobRL){#cite-RobRL .citation_link}<br><br>Persons with disabilities are protected under state and federal fair<br>housing laws, which provide that these individuals are entitled to<br>"reasonable modifications." A reasonable modification is a change in the<br>physical structure that will allow for an individual to enjoy the<br>dwelling unit.<br><br>**A reasonable modification in a single-family dwelling is the<br>responsibility of the tenant, not the property owner.** There are<br>agencies that provide funds for this type of modification so long as the<br>modification does not violate any local ordinances or fire codes.<br><br>You should contact the fair housing agency in your area for assistance<br>in requesting a ramp as a reasonable modification. If there is no fair<br>housing agency, contact the state Department of Fair Employment and<br>Housing or the federal Housing and Urban Development<br>Department.\[2\](#wzrNb){#cite-wzrNb<br>.citation_link}\[3\](#BWaqf){#cite-BWaqf .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-RobRL){.citation_index} [[Does the Federal Fair Housing<br>Act Apply to Your Rental<br>Property?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5e5b6c&url=https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/does-the-federal-fair-housing-act-apply-your-rental-property.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nolo.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-wzrNb){.citation_index} [[Disabled Renter Needs a<br>Ramp](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=054544&url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-sep-02-re-41190-story.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="latimes.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[3\](#cite-BWaqf){.citation_index} [[3 Misconceptions Regarding ADA<br>and Fair Housing<br>Accessibility](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=93ab0d&url=https://www.propertymanagementinsider.com/3-misconceptions-regarding-ada-and-fair-housing-accessibility-laws){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="propertymanagementinsider.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
