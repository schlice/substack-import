<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there a way that the president could effectively make marijuana<br>legal with an executive order or similar?**<br><br>The answer to the question is absolutely yes.<br><br>Marijuana is illegal at the Federal level because of a law called the<br>Controlled Substances Act. Congress passed this law, but it is the Drug<br>Enforcement Agency (DEA), which works for the Executive Branch, that<br>oversees the Drug Schedules. These are the lists of drugs which are<br>illegal under Federal law (which, as some other answerers have pointed<br>out, is a gross Federal overreach, but that is the answer to another<br>question). The DEA is an Executive-branch agency. Their boss is the<br>President.<br><br>Since the DEA controls which drugs are on which schedule, and the DEA<br>works for the President, the President can issue an Executive Order<br>directing the DEA to move marijuana to whatever schedule he tells them<br>to. For example, he could have it moved to Schedule IV, so it would<br>share a danger level with drugs like Xanax, Kionopin, Halcion, and<br>Valium. Or he could, at least, move it to Schedule II, where it would<br>still be considered highly addictive (which is debatable), with a high<br>potential for abuse, but has accepted medical uses. Drugs like cocaine<br>and opium live on Schedule II.<br><br>He could also use an Executive Order to order the DOJ to use as much<br>"prosecutorial discretion" as they wanted, in order to minimize<br>prosecution of marijuana crimes, effectively telling them not to<br>prosecute those cases. Which is exactly what President Obama did during<br>his administration. This signaled to willing states that if they chose<br>to change their own laws, the Federal government wouldn't get in the<br>way. Enter Colorado, who decided to make the first fully<br>government-approved marketplace for marijuana. They are still living<br>through the unintended consequences of that decision, but that too is an<br>answer to another question. Many other states either decriminalized<br>possession of small quantities of marijuana, or allowed medical use<br>only.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
