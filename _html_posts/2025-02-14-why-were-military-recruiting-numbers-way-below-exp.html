<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In case you haven't heard, Pete Hegseth, our new SecDef, tweeted the<br>following on Tuesday:<br><br>> BREAKING: In December 2024, the \@USArmy had its best recruiting<br>> number in 12 years. In January 2025, the Army hit its best recruiting<br>> number in 15 YEARS. BOTTOM LINE: America's youth want to serve under<br>> the bold & strong 'America First' leadership of \@realDonaldTrump.<br><br>So why did no one want to serve under Biden? Instead of raising up a<br>warrior class, the previous commander in chief seemed preoccupied with<br>[[drag shows on military<br>bases](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d4ea9e&url=https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-drag-show-02786741192dac64e566d41048a96ee5){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="apnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}, [[critical race<br>theory](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4d7c03&url=https://www.foxnews.com/media/critical-race-theory-taught-future-military-leaders-us-military-academies-according-new-study){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="foxnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}, [[preferred<br>pronouns](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7ee06f&url=https://washingtonstand.com/commentary/china-launches-warship-us-navy-launches-pronoun-video){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="washingtonstand.com"}]{.qlink_container}, [[underwriting<br>gender transition<br>surgeries](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=157ae6&url=https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/06/28/army-provide-gender-transition-care-surgeries-transgender-soldiers.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="military.com"}]{.qlink_container}, and projecting weakness<br>on the world stage.<br><br>It's no surprise that military recruiting numbers are way up under<br>Trump. Now that DEI is no longer a part of the military, and commanders<br>are not pressuring their people to do things like take vaccinations that<br>they don't want or aren't proven to do anything, people are far more<br>willing to step up and do the one thing they want to do in the military:<br>serve their country.<br><br>It's interesting that this all comes out following the conclusion of the<br>latest [[Military Family Lifestyle<br>Survey](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e60be4&url=https://bluestarfam.org/research/mfls-survey-release-2025/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bluestarfam.org"}]{.qlink_container}, which as you can<br>imagine, was pretty unflattering for the military. While 69% of<br>respondents agreed that military service "added value to their family's<br>life," a dismal 32% said they would recommend military service to a<br>young family member. And while most people you might ask on the street<br>may believe that the military at large is appreciated in this country,<br>only 19% of active duty families believe Americans are *truly* grateful<br>for their sacrifice. What's even worse from that survey: 83% of active<br>duty families believe that we will be in a global war within the next 3<br>to 5 years.<br><br>Freshman Rep. Pete Harrigan (R-NC), a former Green Beret, agrees. It was<br>the poor leadership under Biden which prompted him to run in the first<br>place. In [[a recent<br>interview](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bcfe77&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dd16dKZIGtvM%26feature%3Dyoutu.be){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="youtube.com"}]{.qlink_container}, he said, "We had never<br>been weaker than \during the Biden-led withdrawal from Afghanistan\ in<br>our nation's history. And so, we need real change in this country.<br>\...\ We need real leadership. Thankfully, we have it. And as you were<br>talking about with the record-breaking January recruitment cycle that<br>the Army had, I think that there is a resounding consensus that that<br>leadership is back. And this is a military that our young men and women<br>want to join again."<br><br>Tony Perkins, who served in the Marine Corps, agreed. "I know there<br>\are\ a lot of young men and women who are willing to serve this<br>country, but they don't want to serve for no reason. They want to serve,<br>and they're willing to make sacrifices if it's for a purpose. And I<br>think, as you pointed out, what happened in Afghanistan was disastrous.<br>And it just, I think, it turned many, many young men and women away,<br>thinking, 'What's the point?'"<br><br>Indeed. Harrigan replied, "I think there \was\ a genuine question<br>prior to President Trump getting elected: 'What are we fighting for? Are<br>we fighting for those time-tested concepts of freedom, democracy, free<br>market economies, and the things that our fathers and forefathers have<br>fought and died for in order to make this country the greatest country<br>on the face of the earth? Or are we fighting for some sort of social<br>agenda that we are actually trying to project across the globe?' \...\<br>I think that was a question in many folks' minds prior to November 5th.<br>And so it's just great to see that America is back --- that strong,<br>principled America that traditionally leads the world is back. And it's<br>here to stay moving forward."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
