<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm relieved. It's about time that someone decided to protect the<br>integrity of women's sports.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-187c24b0a158e4bec6f1b7125f1775a3){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-187c24b0a158e4bec6f1b7125f1775a3" master_w="714"<br>master_h="440"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(photo: Shutterstock)*<br><br>If the problem with transgender women competing in men's sports is<br>biological, the fix needs to be biological. And make no mistake,<br>biologically-speaking, transgender women are men.<br><br>You can see how having men competing in women's sports might be<br>problematic, no? How that might be problematic to biological women?<br><br>I'm glad the NCAA is finally making this change. But it's long overdue,<br>and the only reason they are doing it now is because of the President's<br>Executive Order. Without strong leadership on this issue from the White<br>House, this never would have happened. The NCAA would have continued to<br>allow gender activists to dictate policy from the sidelines.<br><br>\<br><br>*NOTE: I do not allow anyone in my comments section who has blocked me<br>from responding. I'd love to politely communicate about the issues with<br>you, but if you do not allow me to do so, then I do not allow your<br>comments on my answer.*<br><br>*Also note that this courtesy is limited. I will only tolerate hateful<br>behavior for a limited time before I am done wasting my time (and yours)<br>and will just delete the whole thing. Plan accordingly.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
