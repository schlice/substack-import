<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There is one other doctor who is doing similar work. Dr.<br>Roy L. Swank has developed the [[Swank MS<br>Diet](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fafb36&url=http://www.swankmsdiet.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="swankmsdiet.org"}]{.qlink_container} which has helped<br>thousands of people slow their disease progression and live a healthier<br>life. This is a statement that I can believe. I believe that good diet<br>and exercise can slow disease progression and help you live a healthier<br>life.\<br>\<br>However, you cannot \"treat\" MS by changing your diet. No disrespect<br>intended to Dr Wahls; her life\'s transformation was amazing. But to be<br>blunt, if you \"had MS\" and then changed your diet and you \"cured your<br>MS\", you didn\'t have MS. MS cannot be cured with dietary changes. See<br>my answer on [[What are the best treatments for Multiple<br>Sclerosis?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-treatments-for-Multiple-Sclerosis)]{.qlink_container}<br>for more information on my view on this topic. I have seen this many<br>times and have been told about similar things many times. I actually was<br>on the Paleo diet for about a year, and its overall effects were very<br>good for me. I lost weight, I was able to focus better, and I felt like<br>I had more energy. The diet, however, did not cure my MS. I still have<br>MS. I didn\'t expect it to cure my MS. I expected to lose weight and<br>feel better, which I did.\<br>\<br>Like I said in my other answer, here\'s the current take on \"best<br>treatment for MS\": eat right, exercise, and take one of the disease<br>modifying drugs. There are now many to choose from, including two oral<br>medications, and they all do the same thing: slow the disease<br>progression, and lessen the duration and severity of relapses. Do all of<br>these things, and you will be on your way to controlling this<br>\"slow-motion train wreck\" of a disease we call MS.]<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
