<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it against the law to agree to kill someone?<br><br>Let's find the exact point where you have run afoul of the law.<br>Remember, there are many differences between the states with respect to<br>other things with which you may be charged (solicitation to commit<br>murder comes to mind), but I'll try to highlight the most common in the<br>US.<br><br>A woman says, "Will you kill my husband?" and you say "Yes." **NOT<br>ILLEGAL.\<br>-** At this point, you have not yet technically done anything illegal,<br>other than speak freely. In the United States, simply making the verbal<br>agreement does not constitute conspiracy; there must be an "overt act"<br>in furtherance of the crime by at least one of the parties.<br><br>You plan out how you will commit a murder. **NOT ILLEGAL\<br>-** While pretty damning circumstantial evidence (especially if the<br>husband turns up dead later and his death matches your plan), it's still<br>not illegal to plan out how you might kill someone. You might be writing<br>a murder mystery novel. Just making a plan to kill someone might be<br>stretched to be the "overt act" needed to prove conspiracy, but it would<br>be a stretch (as I said, you might be writing a murder mystery novel).<br><br>A day later, you buy a gun. **POSSIBLY ILLEGAL\<br>-** Gun purchases are not illegal, even if you have conversations a day<br>prior. However, in some cases, purchasing the gun after having the<br>conversation could be considered the "overt act" needed to prove<br>conspiracy to commit murder.<br><br>You drive to the husband's house with the gun and the plan in your car.<br>DEFINITELY ILLEGAL\<br>- Driving around with a gun in your car and a plan on how to kill<br>someone is not, by itself, illegal. However, this is the point at which<br>you have actually engaged in criminal activity. You can now be charged<br>with attempted murder when you have made a step towards committing the<br>crime of which you are accused. You and the wife (with whom you made the<br>verbal agreement) can still be charged with conspiracy to commit murder.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
