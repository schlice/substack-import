<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There\'s an old adage in media:\<br>\<br>\"If it bleeds, it leads. If it thinks, it stinks.\"\<br>\<br>The reason mainstream US news agencies focus so heavily on violent<br>crimes is because that\'s what draws viewers/readers. Intelligent<br>discussion and discourse, logic, reasoning, etc. are not what draws<br>viewers/readers, and are relegated to the back pages.\<br>\<br>Ultimately, news agencies are for-profit businesses, and they have to do<br>whatever they can to increase their viewer/reader base. If violent crime<br>increases the number of eyeballs on your news program (and, by<br>extension, your advertising), that\'s what you run. You run what people<br>\"want,\" and people determine what they want by the number of eyeballs<br>looking at your content.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
