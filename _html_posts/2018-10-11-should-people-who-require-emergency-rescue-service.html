<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should people who require emergency rescue services as a result of<br>their own poor judgement be required to pay the cost of the rescue?**<br><br>People should only be required to reimburse agencies for rescue costs<br>when they violated a law which got them into the situation which<br>required rescue. For example, if they were in a prohibited area, and<br>they required rescue from that area, there should be some level of<br>culpability and they should have to reimburse a portion of the rescue<br>costs.<br><br>However, you said as a result of "poor judgement." Does this mean that I<br>go hiking and I think the weather is going to be fine based on all the<br>information I have available, and then the weather turns? I should have<br>know that the weather was going to turn. Is that "poor judgement?"<br><br>We really don't want the government getting into the business of<br>determining whether or not someone's judgement is faulty without a court<br>of law. This is why we have laws in the first place: to establish when<br>you are, and are not, in compliance with them.<br><br>If a law exists, and you violate it, and because of your violation you<br>require emergency rescue services, you should be liable for at least<br>part of the rescue costs.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
