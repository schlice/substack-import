<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Even though we are an association of single-family homes (not condos or<br>townhomes), we have several properties which are Airbnb destinations, or<br>what are called "luxury rental homes" which are also short-term rentals<br>(renters stay two weeks or less).<br><br>We discourage this practice.<br><br>We are against the practice for a number of reasons:<br><br>- A community of single-family homes (where residents buy property to<br>  raise their families; long-term single-resident ownership) is not<br>  conducive to short-term, in-and-out renters. We have our fair share of<br>  homes which are leased, but those are long-term rentals (i.e.<br>  residents in place for 6 months or more).<br>- If the property is not immaculately maintained and constantly<br>  monitored, short-term renters leave the place in far worse condition<br>  than they found it. Even leaving the place slightly worse than it was<br>  found, over the long term, and with many residents cycled through it,<br>  leaves a property looking pretty ratty, pretty quickly. Most owners<br>  don't put the time or effort in to maintaining the property in the way<br>  in which it should be maintained to keep neighboring home values high.<br>- Houses used exclusively for short term rentals universally lower<br>  surrounding home values. No one wants to buy a house next to a motel.<br>  Even if it's marketed as a "luxury rental" property, it's a motel.<br>  Average renters stay for two weeks or less.<br>- It puts tremendous wear on the streets, the driveways, and the house<br>  itself.<br>- The renters have ZERO regard for the covenants, and have no interest<br>  in following any of the neighborhood rules, which leads to many<br>  dissatisfied neighbors.<br>- It introduces an insecure element into the neighborhood: in an area<br>  where neighbors know their neighbors and derive a sense of security<br>  from understanding what's going on around them, short-term rentals do<br>  not fit.<br><br>The easiest and quickest way for a neighborhood to combat this is to put<br>in place a covenant amendment which requires the Board to approve every<br>rental. Along with an application fee, a rental agreement must be<br>reviewed and approved by the Board before it can be entered into.<br>Because it is part of the covenants, a home cannot be rented legally<br>without following this rule. And since the Board can take up to 30 days<br>to review and approve an application, that essentially puts the kibosh<br>on Airbnb or short-term rentals.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
