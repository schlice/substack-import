<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Absolutely! Repent and believe, even Catholics do this.<br><br>However, they miss the mark when they focus too heavily on "eating the<br>bread" and "drinking the cup." They can certainly perform those rituals,<br>but the thought that eating the bread and drinking the cup is what saves<br>you is decidedly unbiblical, regardless of how Catholics twist<br>themselves into a pretzel to try to justify it, even in light of the<br>definitive exegetical evidence against it. No disrespect to my Catholic<br>brethren, but growing up Catholic gives me a pretty unique perspective.<br><br>Additionally, holding that the Magisterium and Church Traditions are<br>sources of God's word is also decidedly unbiblical, with similar<br>exegetical evidence against it.<br><br>So Catholics can indeed have saving faith, so long as they don't focus<br>on the trappings of the church to have it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
