<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What would happen is that "may issue" laws in any state in which they<br>exist would immediately become unconstitutional, and would effectively<br>become unenforceable. The state would be required to replace the "may<br>issue" laws with laws which comply with the Constitution, laws which<br>complied with the Supreme Court's ruling. These would, in essence, be<br>"shall issue" laws.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
