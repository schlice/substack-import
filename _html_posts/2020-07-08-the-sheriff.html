<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**The sheriff\'s office left me a voicemail, saying he had paperwork for<br>me to fill out. What does this mean?**<br><br>This probably means that he has paperwork for you to fill out.<br><br>The only ways you can find out what this means:<br><br>- Call them back<br>- Go in<br><br>I'd suggest you cal them back and find out what this is all about. If<br>they're evasive and cagey with you, maybe tell them "no thanks" and tell<br>them that if they want you to fill out the paperwork, have a process<br>server serve it to you and then return it to them via certified mail.<br><br>Maybe they tell you that it's something you submitted to them a long<br>time ago. Maybe they got a complaint about you and they want your side<br>of the story. Ultimately, you'll never know what it's all about until<br>you call them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
