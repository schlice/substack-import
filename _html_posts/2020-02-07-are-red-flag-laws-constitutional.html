<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Are red flag laws constitutional?<br><br>Red Flag laws (or Extreme Risk Protection Orders, ERPOs) probably can<br>fit within the 4th and 6th Amendments. They may even fit within the 2nd<br>Amendment (which is dubious, but for now we'll let it slide).<br><br>Where ERPOs clearly and unarguably fall is the 5th Amendment.<br><br>> ...nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process<br>> of the law.<br><br>So the question becomes: *does the process of the ERPO comport with the<br>5th Amendment's requirement for due process?*<br><br>While there has been much variability over the decades, "due process"<br>has, pretty universally, involved a hearing in a court where the actual<br>person whose rights are to be curtailed may present evidence,<br>cross-examine witnesses, and have an opportunity to be represented by<br>counsel<br><br>...*before the rights are curtailed.*<br><br>This is where ERPOs fail Constitutional muster. Because if a person is<br>dangerous enough to have their 2nd Amendment rights limited, they're<br>still dangerous enough to have their 2nd Amendment rights limited when<br>they are in court represented by counsel. And ERPOs remove<br>Constitutional rights without the accused being present or being<br>represented by counsel or having any opportunity for due process at all.<br><br>And yes, the argument is absolutely true that a dangerous person may win<br>in court and not have his 2nd Amendment rights curtailed when he<br>probably should. But remember Blackstone's Ratio: "It is better that ten<br>guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer." In other words, we<br>would rather see the man who should have his gun rights revoked go home<br>with his guns than to have someone falsely accused lose his guns.<br><br>The risk is not enough to deprive citizens of their due process rights.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
