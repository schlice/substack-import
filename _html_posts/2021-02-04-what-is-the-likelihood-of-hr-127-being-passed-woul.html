<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the likelihood of H.R. 127 being passed? Would it go to the<br>Supreme Court? Would it be affected at all by Miller V. Becerra from<br>California?**<br><br>*If* it passed (the chances of which are slim), it would be immediately<br>stayed because it contradicts several other laws already on the books.<br>It could not go into effect until Congress decides how to reconcile it<br>with its other laws. For example:<br><br>- The law requires each gun owner to be licensed. This alone is a<br>  violation of the 2nd Amendment, as you cannot license a right. You can<br>  *restrict* a right, but that comes from a different position (everyone<br>  has the right *except for* these select few). This law comes from the<br>  position of *no one* has the right *except for* those select<br>  licensed few, and that is a *prima facie* violation of the 2nd<br>  Amendment.<br>- The law requires each firearm in the United States to be registered to<br>  an owner. This is a violation of the Firearm Owner's Protection Act of<br>  1986, which states that neither the government nor any state can keep<br>  any sort of registry that ties any firearm specifically to any owner.<br>- Insurance. I don't understand why the Left doesn't get this. My<br>  insurance that I buy protects *me* from *someone else's* actions. My<br>  insurance doesn't protect *you* from *my* actions. And there isn't an<br>  insurance policy in the world (and there never will be) that protects<br>  *you* from *my* *unlawful* actions. No insurance policy pays out<br>  when someone does something illegal.\<br>  \<br>  (EDIT) Yes, liability insurance may kick in if you accidentally shoot<br>  someone, but that's not what the bill is discussing. It's discussing<br>  carrying liability insurance in case of injury following "any use" of<br>  your firearm, except insurance doesn't pay unless you were following<br>  the law, and only in the slimmest minority of cases was any accident<br>  fully legally compliant.<br>- More about insurance. Check out the insurance requirement in the bill<br>  (emphasis mine):<br><br>> \(d\) FIREARM INSURANCE.---<br>><br>> (1). IN GENERAL.---The Attorney General shall issue to any person who<br>> has applied for a license pursuant to subsection (c) and has ***paid<br>> to the Attorney General the fee specified in paragraph (2)*** of this<br>> subsection a policy that insures the person against liability for<br>> losses and damages resulting from the use of any firearm by the person<br>> during the 1-year period that begins with the date the policy is<br>> issued.<br>><br>> (2). FEE---The fee specified in this paragraph is *\$800.*<br><br>\$800 to the Attorney General's office for the privilege to buy<br>liability insurance (at additional cost over the \$800 fee) which will<br>probably *never pay out* so you can exercise a *RIGHT?* This<br>provision also likely would price the poor out of the firearms market,<br>which makes the bill a violation of the 14th Amendment, and also is<br>another violation of the 2nd Amendment. The poor are the very people who<br>need access to firearms. And since persons of color are<br>disproportionately represented in the poorer classes, **this bill is<br>also inherently racist.**<br><br>It's clear that this bill has a less than zero chance of passing.<br><br>Then why write it in the first place?<br><br>Two words: virtue signaling.<br><br>This bill is designed to show Rep. Lee's constituents that she is trying<br>to do something they want, and when it fails, she'll have a ready-made<br>foil to point to and say it's *their fault* that this bill didn't pass.<br>It's not, of course, but they'll still point to it and make the claim.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
