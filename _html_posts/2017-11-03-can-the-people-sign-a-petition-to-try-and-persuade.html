<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Can* the people sign a petition to try and persuade a judge to sentence<br>a terrorist to death penalty? Yes, people can sign any sort of<br>petition they want to say anything they want to say.<br><br>Is it likely to make any difference? No, it is not.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Because despite what "the people" may want, ***the judge does not use<br>"petitions" in determining sentencing.*** The judge will follow the law<br>when it comes to sentencing. Additionally, in most states which permit<br>capital punishment, there is an extra level of "protection" against<br>abuse: After the guilty verdict and before sentencing, the jury must<br>also decide whether or not the death penalty will be authorized in that<br>particular case. It is not authorized in every case. If the death<br>penalty is sought, and the verdict in the crime which allows the death<br>penalty is guilty, the jury will then have to decide if the death<br>penalty will be authorized.<br><br>Most crimes have enumerated punishments listed directly within the same<br>statute that defines the crime. If the person is found guilty of that<br>crime, the judge imposes the sentence listed in the statute. Some<br>statutes may read something along the lines of, "Violations of this<br>statute constitute a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not to exceed<br>\$500, imprisonment not to exceed 30 days, or both." This means that the<br>judge can assign any fine up to \$500, any amount of incarceration up to<br>30 days, or both the fine and the incarceration.<br><br>So the judge has some leeway in his final determination of sentence. At<br>this point, he uses *mitigating circumstances* or *aggravating<br>circumstances* to determine where along the range of punishments offered<br>the defendant's punishment should fall. Some mitigating or aggravating<br>factors that a judge may consider:<br><br>- whether the offender is a \"first-time\" or repeat offender,<br>- whether the offender was an accessory (helping the main offender) or<br>  the main offender,<br>- whether the offender committed the crime under great personal stress<br>  or duress,<br>- whether anyone was hurt, and whether the crime was committed in a<br>  manner that was unlikely to result in anyone being hurt,<br>- whether the offender was particularly cruel to a victim, or<br>  particularly destructive, vindictive, etc.<br>- (sometimes) whether the offender is genuinely contrite or<br>  remorseful.\[1\](#mLTsG){#cite-mLTsG .citation_link}<br><br>Finally, the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure requires that the<br>attorney for the defendant speak on behalf of the defendant before a<br>sentence is declared. The court will also usually give the defendant an<br>opportunity to make any statement if he chooses. In most states, the<br>prosecutor (the representative of the state) also has an opportunity to<br>similarly speak on behalf of "the people." In some states, the families<br>of the victims or of the survivors may also have an opportunity to<br>address the court and recommend leniency or strictness in sentencing.<br><br>The judge will use all of this information to determine the final<br>sentence.<br><br>Therefore, the "petition" you sign has no bearing on whether or not the<br>judge imposes the death penalty.<br><br>So what should you do? Send your petition to the prosecutor.<br>Whichever agency is prosecuting the terrorist should be the recipient of<br>your petition. If there was any doubt as to whether or not to seek the<br>death penalty as opposed to life in prison without parole, your petition<br>may help the prosecution decide.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-mLTsG){.citation_index} [[Factors Considered in<br>Determining Sentences -<br>FindLaw](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e616ac&url=http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-procedure/factors-considered-in-determining-sentences.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="findlaw.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
