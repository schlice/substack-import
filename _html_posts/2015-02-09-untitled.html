<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [I think someone saying \"I\'m looking to find out more<br>information about suicide\" is very different than someone saying \"I\'m<br>thinking about killing myself, does anyone know how to do it\".\<br>\<br>I think if someone expresses a desire to kill themselves, you have an<br>obligation to try to get them help. I also think the Internet is awash<br>with resources for people who want to kill themselves. I think that<br>anyone who is suicidal and knows how to use Google is a dangerous<br>combination.\<br>\<br>I think that you should probably be very cautious when recommending<br>anything to someone who may be suicidal. The only two places where<br>physician assisted suicide is legal are Oregon and Washington, and the<br>laws are very tightly controlled (i.e. the person has to be terminally<br>ill, has to be getting worse, requires independent doctor corroboration,<br>strict reporting guidelines, etc). It\'s illegal everywhere else, and<br>when you\'re talking to someone over the Internet, I would always<br>presume they are somewhere where assisted suicide is illegal.\<br>\<br>I think if you\'re going to give advice to someone, I would say<br>something along the lines of, \"If you are having suicidal thoughts,<br>please call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 800-273-TALK<br>right away. If you\'re not having suicidal thoughts but you want more<br>information for research or informational purposes only, check out some<br>books like Peaceful Pill or Final Exit.\"]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/If-someone-asks-for-information-online-on-how-to-kill-themselves-and-you-give-them-information-on-euthanasia-are-you-assisting-in-a-suicide/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
