<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My doctor recently submitted a letter to my employer for some minimal<br>ADA accommodations, however my general manager became angry and has been<br>very mean to me and not acknowledge them what do I do?**<br><br>Since you mentioned ADA, I'll assume you're in the United States.<br><br>First of all, an employer *is* allowed to ask for medical documentation<br>when a disability is not apparent. For example, if you use a wheelchair<br>and you ask your employer to raise the height of a desk to accommodate<br>your chair, they probably don't need to ask for medical documentation<br>before making that accommodation.<br><br>However, if you have a hidden disability, an employer may ask for<br>medical documentation before making an accommodation. For example, if<br>you have rheumatoid arthritis which is made worse by below average<br>indoor temperatures in the office and you request a space heater, your<br>employer may ask for medical documentation before purchasing and<br>installing that heater.<br><br>Now, on to the next part of your question.<br><br>It sounds like you submitted a request for an accommodation, your<br>employer asked for documentation, you provided it, and the employer<br>granted the accommodation. Now, the employer has changed his attitude<br>towards you, and treats you differently in the workplace because you<br>requested an accommodation.<br><br>If this is the case, it is illegal.<br><br>This behavior is called reprisal, and it is a negative action taken<br>in response to you exercising a protected legal right.<br><br>The EEOC defines three elements in order to identify reprisal:<br><br>1.  protected activity: \"participation\" in an EEO process or<br>    \"opposition\" to discrimination;<br>2.  materially adverse action taken by the employer; and<br>3.  a requisite level of causal connection between the protected<br>    activity and the materially adverse action.<br><br>This means:<br><br>- You participated in a "protected activity" (i.e. you requested<br>  ADA-compliant accommodations for a disability)<br>- Your employer engaged in "materially adverse action" after you engaged<br>  in the protected activity. This provision covers any employer action<br>  that \"might well deter a reasonable employee from complaining about<br>  discrimination.\"\[1\](#JEtVd){#cite-JEtVd .citation_link} If the<br>  employer's behavior towards you might deter a reasonable employee from<br>  complaining about discrimination, it counts as a materially adverse<br>  action.<br>- A connection has to be made between the exercise of your protected<br>  activity and the materially adverse action taken by the employer. In<br>  other words, if you can connect, even casually, the exercise of your<br>  rights with the change in the employer's treatment of you, they have<br>  satisfied the causal connection component.<br><br>It seems to me, from a casual reading of your question, that you may<br>have a claim under the ADA.<br><br>The question, of course, is what to do about it.<br><br>Your first stop should be your HR department. You must advise them that<br>the behavior you see could potentially be in violation of the EEOC's<br>guidelines surrounding reprisals, and tell them everything we have<br>documented here. Let them make the first move. They may discuss the<br>matter with the general manager, and that may be the end of it.<br><br>If it is not, your only other option is to seek professional legal<br>advice. You'll want to visit your local ACLU office or your local EEOC<br>office and ask to speak to an attorney about a possible ADA claim.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.
