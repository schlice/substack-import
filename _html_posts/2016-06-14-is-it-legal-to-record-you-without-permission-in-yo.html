<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The correct answer is "it depends."<br><br>It depends on a few things:<br><br>1.  Who is doing the recording<br>2.  What is being recorded (audio, video, or both)<br>3.  Where you are located<br><br>For bullet 1, if you are the homeowner, you are generally legally<br>allowed to place cameras in common areas inside your own home and record<br>any activities that go on inside your home. Note that you are generally<br>prohibited from placing cameras in locations inside your home in which<br>there is an expectation of privacy, such as a bedroom or bathroom.<br><br>For bullet 2, you are generally allowed to record people in your own<br>home. Some states have some old phone-based laws which governed the<br>recording of audio between two callers which governed things like<br>notification (which parties had to know that the call was being<br>recorded), and some legal professionals believe these laws are still<br>applicable to audio recordings made by surveillance cameras, and they<br>may very well be. The law still needs to be modernized to catch up to<br>the technology.<br><br>For bullet 3, laws in some states vary with regard to what you can<br>record and when, and what sort of notification must be made before<br>someone enters an area which is under surveillance.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
