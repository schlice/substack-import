<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [No, the logic doesn\'t follow.\<br>\<br>Republicans claim that Democrats who vote against tax cuts are<br>voting for tax increases.\<br>\<br>The logical corrollary for gun control laws would be that Democrats can<br>claim that Republicans who vote against gun control are actually<br>voting for gun rights. They could then claim that Republicans<br>are voting to support the rights of mass shooters.\<br>\<br>But they would then have to prove that mass shooters acquired their guns<br>legally, following all the laws that Republicans voted to enact.\<br>\<br>Conflating Republicans with accomplices to mass murder is a logical leap<br>which is invalid.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
