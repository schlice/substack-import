<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not sure where you get the line that Israel simply lied about all of<br>this. Hamas admitted to kidnapping women and children. They published<br>photos of themselves with raped and killed women. They published photos<br>of themselves with beheaded babies. Hamas did all of this on their own;<br>Israel didn't have to goad them into doing it.<br><br>But Hamas was going for *shock value*, which indeed they got.<br><br>What they didn't expect was for Israel to not respond with *more of the<br>same*. Instead, Israel is going to *steamroll all over Gaza*.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
