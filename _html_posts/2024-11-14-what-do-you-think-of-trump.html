<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Oh my gosh yes. Keep it coming, I'm not tired of winning yet.<br><br>Bear in mind that he has only been President-Elect for nine days.<br>And he has basically filled out most of his cabinet, at least when it<br>comes to national security and national defense.<br><br>And his choices have been *brilliant*. People can squawk and blanche<br>at some of those choices, but he has made some excellent choices.<br><br>For example, he has selected Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense. The<br>military-industrial complex is losing its collective shit over this<br>choice, but if you've ever listened to Pete, he has the right ideas. He<br>literally [[wrote the<br>book](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=08be49&url=https://www.amazon.com/War-Warriors-Behind-Betrayal-Keep/dp/0063389428){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container} about removing DEI from the<br>military. I personally appreciate his desire to remove woke ideology<br>from our service academies. It has been so disheartening to see what our<br>academies are teaching our supposedly preeminent military officers. Pete<br>will clean house.<br><br>And that's the general tenor of the appointments he has made thus far:<br>these are people who are going to come in, and on day one, start<br>cleaning house and draining the swamp.<br><br>Just look at his appointment of Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk to the<br>extra-governmental Department of Government Efficiency (and no, the<br>acronym DOGE is not lost on me). An agency that exists outside of the<br>governmental chain of command, that the OMB will be taking direction<br>from, is a masterful move. Additionally, this department will,<br>*literally*, be the most transparent department we have ever had. How?<br>Everything they do will be posted publicly, on line.<br><br>\"All actions of the Department of Government Efficiency will be posted<br>online for maximum transparency,\" Musk wrote on the new DOGE X account.<br>\"Anytime the public thinks we are cutting something important or not<br>cutting something wasteful, just let us know! We will also have a<br>leaderboard for \the\ most insanely dumb spending of your tax dollars.<br>This will be both extremely tragic and extremely entertaining.\"<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
