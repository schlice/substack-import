I'd even go so<br>far as to say that they ***hope that another vacancy happens during<br>Trump's term with a Republican Senate.***<br><br>But we should draw the distinction at wishing for an opening, and<br>*wishing for someone to die*.<br><br>I'm relatively sure that neither Trump nor McConnell is actively wishing<br>for anyone to die.<br><br>They're hoping that another opening on the court turns up, but no one is<br>hoping for anyone to die.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
