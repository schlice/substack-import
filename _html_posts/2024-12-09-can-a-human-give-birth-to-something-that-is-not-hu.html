<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I guess it's up to me to buck the apparent trend.<br><br>No, a human cannot give birth to something that is not *human.*<br><br>The answer to this question clearly rests on what you define as "human."<br>So: *what is a human?*<br><br>A human is an organism which is given rise by two human parents, one<br>male, and one female. Embryologically, when the male sperm joins with<br>the female egg and produce a zygote, this organism is the earliest form<br>of human being. Some other forms this early human progresses through are<br>called a blastocyte, an embryo, and a fetus. But crucially, at every<br>phase, in every form, the organism is undeniably *human*.<br><br>When two humans mate and produce a zygote, that organism is human. It<br>can never be anything else beyond a human. Even if it comes out with<br>developmental defects and doesn't *look* human. Even if it doesn't look<br>human while it is still developing. It meets all of the criteria for<br>being human. It cannot *not* be a human, as it has two human parents.<br>Two human parents can only produce a human offspring and nothing else.<br><br>It also rests on what you define as "giving birth." In this context, we<br>are discussing the natural process by which a gestating fetus is<br>delivered through the birth canal at approximately 40 weeks of<br>pregnancy. Some parasites (which do not belong in the host and for which<br>the host does not have specialized structures to grow and nurture) can<br>emerge from their hosts, but this process is generally not referred to<br>as "giving birth."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
