<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Where is it completely acceptable to say that a country<br>should have never existed? If you\'re talking about the US, and saying<br>that its acceptable to exercise free speech, and you\'re saying that one<br>is acceptable and the other is not, what you\'re actually talking about<br>is *tact*.\<br>\<br>It\'s always tactful to be self-effacing. It\'s never tactful to<br>denegrate someone else. It\'s okay for an Israeli in Israel to declare<br>that Israel never should have existed, but for that same Israeli to say<br>that the US never should have existed is disrespectful and<br>tactless.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
