<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Any question like this gets answered primarily with "it depends." It<br>depends on the load the person was shot with, the composition of that<br>load, the power behind that load, distance away from the shooter the<br>victim was, and where the shots landed. Yes, people shot multiple times<br>can indeed survive. The chances are all dependent:<br><br>- All rounds will cause more damage at closer range, as they still<br>  retain much of their forward velocity. Rounds will slow down as they<br>  fly (somewhat), so will necessarily be less able to inflict serious<br>  damage at greater distances.<br>- Larger (heavier) rounds will cause more impact trauma than lighter<br>  rounds.<br>- Fully-jacketed rounds will cause less trauma than unjacketed rounds.<br>  The metal jacket on a bullet will prevent the bullet from deforming<br>  quite as much as it hits soft tissue, so it will pass completely<br>  through soft tissue and out the other side (i.e. a "through and<br>  through"). Softer, unjacketed rounds will deform as they hit soft<br>  tissue and make a much larger wound cavity, which leads to more<br>  potential injury and more possibility for the victim to die.<br>- Hollowpoint rounds will also deform more than fully-formed or jacketed<br>  rounds, again releasing more energy into the victim rather than<br>  retaining that energy in the bullet and passing clean through the<br>  body. This results in a larger wound cavity and a greater possibility<br>  that the victim will die.<br>- Rounds which land on extremeties are less likely to cause death than<br>  rounds which land in the center mass of the victim. That said, anyone<br>  who can get shot in the arm with a .50 BMG and not die is a superhero.<br>  Besides the fact that the arm would be instantly vaporized and turn<br>  into nothing more than red mist, the impact trauma alone would kill<br>  you, even if you're shot in the arm or the leg.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-6ceefcd6b4812f2059f716914f98b9b7){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-6ceefcd6b4812f2059f716914f98b9b7" master_w="450"<br>master_h="430"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>The .50 BMG is on the far left. That's a big bullet. The M-16 (or AR-15)<br>fires the 5.56 NATO cartridge (second from the right). My M-4 carbine<br>also fires .223 Remington, which is not pictured but is very similar to<br>the 5.56.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
