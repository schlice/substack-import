<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>EBV was investigated as a possible trigger for the MS disease process,<br>as have many viruses, such as rabies, herpes simplex virus, measles,<br>coronavirus, canine distemper virus, and HTLV-1, among others. None has<br>yet been confirmed. Chlamydia pneumoniae, a bacteria which 90% of the<br>population has been exposed to over their lifetime, has also been<br>suggested but never proven.<br><br>While we have yet to identify positively the virus, scientists still<br>believe that some infectious trigger initiates the disease process.<br><br>(EDIT) It's looking more and more like EBV is the infectious trigger<br>that initiates the disease process. [[A<br>study](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d756f5&url=https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2022/01/epstein-barr-virus-multiple-sclerosis.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="stanford.edu"}]{.qlink_container} done at Stanford<br>University in 2022 proved that the Epstein-Barr virus triggers multiple<br>sclerosis by priming the immune system to attack the body's own nervous<br>system.<br><br>> "This is the first time anyone has shown rather definitively that a<br>> virus is the trigger for multiple sclerosis," \co-author Lawrence\<br>> Steinman said. "And these exciting findings open up some new<br>> directions for clinical trials in MS treatment."<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can multiple sclerosis be caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
