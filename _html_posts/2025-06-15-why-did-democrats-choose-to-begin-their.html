<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because the day was also important for one other reason: **it was Donald<br>Trump's birthday.** Worse than that, someone got the bright idea that<br>Trump, being the conceited ass that they believe him to be, probably<br>organized this whole 250th anniversary parade just to throw himself a<br>birthday birthday at taxpayer expense. Thus, the No Kings movement was<br>born.<br><br>And what better way to celebrate than to have the Democratic Party fund<br>protests in 19 states specifically against Trump? That's right, the<br>whole purpose of the protests was to bash Trump...on his birthday.<br><br>But Democrats are having trouble getting *anything* to stick to Trump.<br>Actually, Trump and Clinton are similar in that regard. *Slick Willie,<br>the Teflon President*. That's what we used to call him, because nothing<br>would stick to him. Similarly, Democrats can't seem to find anything<br>that they can get to stick to Trump. It's almost like what Trump said in<br>the first campaign was true: he could shoot someone stone cold dead in<br>the middle of 5th Avenue and he'd gain support.<br><br>Do they care that they disrespected the Army? HA! They couldn't give a<br>rat's ass about the Army.<br><br>Do they care that they disrespected America on Flag Day? HA! They don't<br>care about America; they'd rather see America burn because they believe<br>America was founded on racism and slavery and deserves to be destroyed<br>and given back to Native Americans or somesuch.<br><br>It's all about Trump.<br><br>But Trump can take it. And while the protestors are busy whining about<br>Trump, they're not watching what he's doing with his other hand, which<br>is good for us.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
