<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a two-part question.<br><br>> How can Donald Trump obstruct justice?<br><br>Trump can indeed obstruct justice. If you'd like to know how, let's look<br>at how some other presidents obstructed justice. Clinton did it when he<br>tried to influence potential witnesses to not tell the truth. Nixon did<br>it; he paid hush money, he told people to lie, he destroyed evidence. It<br>is indeed possible for presidents to obstruct justice. Trump can<br>obstruct justice in this way, too.<br><br>> **His lawyer Dowd says that Trump is not guilty of obstruction of<br>> justice according to the Constitution.**<br><br>So the question here is: did Trump obstruct justice by firing Comey? Did<br>Trump obstruct justice by saying that he wished the whole Flynn thing<br>would go away quickly?<br><br>The short answer is no.<br><br>The President has the authority to direct how the Justice Department<br>investigates cases, and he has the authority to fire the director of the<br>FBI, under Article II.<br><br>**It cannot be obstruction of justice if you are exercising your power<br>under the Constitution, *even if you do it specifically to avoid<br>your own prosecution!***<br><br>Case in point: George H.W. Bush did it. He pardoned Casper Weinberger to<br>forestall the investigation that would have eventually implicated him.<br>No one talked about obstruction of justice then.<br><br>Trump *could have* done the same thing here! ***He could have pardoned<br>Mike Flynn!*** He has the power to pardon Flynn, but he chose not to. If<br>Flynn was pardoned, he wouldn't have to cooperate with the Special<br>Counsel. *But he didn't!* That alone should tell you that there is<br>no obstruction of justice.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
