<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends."<br><br>If you warn someone of an impending arrest *in an attempt to get them to<br>flee*, you are committing a crime called "aiding and abetting." When you<br>aid someone in avoiding capture, that is a crime.<br><br>If you instead warn someone of an impending arrest *so that they can get<br>their affairs in order before they are arrested*, this would not be a<br>crime. You would have to be clear that the only reason you are telling<br>them is so that they can get their affairs in order before their arrest.<br><br>However, even then, you are susceptible to being charged yourself if you<br>should have known that your actions could reasonably have been assumed<br>to lead to the suspect attempting to flee in order to avoid the<br>impending arrest. Even if you tell them of their impending arrest just<br>so they can get their affairs in order before they are carted off to<br>jail, but instead they try to run, you can still be charged with aiding<br>and abetting if a reasonable person would believe that the suspect would<br>run upon hearing that news. Maybe they have a history of trying to evade<br>capture, and if you knew of that history, you should have known that<br>telling them that they're going to be arrested would lead to them trying<br>to flee.<br><br>So while it's not a guarantee, you place yourself in legal jeopardy if<br>you tell the suspect that they are going to be arrested and they then<br>try to evade capture.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
