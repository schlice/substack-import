<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I grew up in an area where we had only all-volunteer fire departments.<br>The whole place, no paid firefighters.<br><br>In that area, we had need of a hazmat (hazardous materials) unit, as<br>most metropolitan areas do. However, the fire departments (who would<br>normally run hazmat) were not staffed nor funded to be able to support a<br>dedicated hazmat unit, with all of its requisite training and special<br>equipment.<br><br>So what do you think happened? Yep, the police did it. ESU, to be<br>precise.<br><br>The guys in ESU actually bought a Coke delivery truck (you know, looks<br>like a big box truck with lots of roll-up doors) and painted and<br>outfitted it as their hazmat truck. They staffed an initial crew and<br>sent them all to training. OSHA training in New Jersey, hazmat training<br>at the LSU Fire Academy, etc. It wasn't an easy job, and standing up a<br>new unit was extremely stressful. But they did it, and they were very<br>successful, literally saving the day on some very high-profile hazmat<br>calls.<br><br>ESUs fill the gaps where firefighters lack, and vice-versa. The two<br>teams work well together, which is why the model has endured for as long<br>as it has.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
