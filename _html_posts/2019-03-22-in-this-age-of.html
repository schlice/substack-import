<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Even though [[Peter<br>Kruger](https://www.quora.com/profile/Peter-Kruger)]{.qlink_container}<br>shared [[one of the best answers<br>possible](https://www.quora.com/In-this-age-of-fake-news-and-alternative-facts-how-do-we-know-that-the-so-called-fact-checking-sources-are-accurate-and-honest-arbiters-of-what-is-true-and-what-is-false/answer/Peter-Kruger)]{.qlink_container},<br>I want to share something I just saw the other day that speaks<br>specifically to this issue.<br><br>I regularly watch a YouTube creator named [[Destin<br>Sandlin](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=195a53&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destin_Sandlin){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} who runs a YouTube<br>channel called Smarter Every Day. If you haven't watched any of his<br>stuff, you should. He's a scientist by trade. Destin was, until late<br>2018, a full-time Missile Flight Test Engineer at Redstone Arsenal. He<br>is currently a PhD candidate at the University of Alabama Huntsville.<br><br>Destin's latest contribution is called "Why your newsfeed SUCKS." It<br>discusses exactly this: how we determine what news is real and what news<br>is fake. Watch the video, you'll enjoy it:<br><br>[https://youtu.be/MUiYglgGbos(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7e435c&url=https://youtu.be/MUiYglgGbos){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Destin adds this note to his video:<br><br>> Hey guys\... this stuff is pretty serious to me. I want to be able to<br>> accurately discern truth in all that I do, so the techniques that Katy<br>> taught me here were super helpful. I hope you are able to use them as<br>> well. MediaWise has been using the hashtag<br>> [#IsThisLegit(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=123a83&url=https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query%3D%2523IsThisLegit){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="youtube.com"}]{.qlink_container} across all social media,<br>> so tag them on Insta or Twitter (Where a lot of misinformation<br>> happens) and they\'ll get a team to help you figure it out. Also, the<br>> upcoming series I\'m doing on Algorithmic Manipulation is going to be<br>> a very hardcore look into the inner workings of YouTube, Twitter, and<br>> Facebook. I hope you\'ll subscribe<br>> ([http://bit.ly/Subscribe2SED(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e4a535&url=https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token%3DLSZU0Zehs-ZQ8GR9rzxD_vklWAN8MTU1MzM2MDI3NkAxNTUzMjczODc2%26q%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fbit.ly%252FSubscribe2SED%26stzid%3DUgyRESmS99pDShOdHK14AaABAg%26event%3Dcomments){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="youtube.com"}]{.qlink_container} ) and consider watching<br>> this 3 part series with me. I\'ve never done a series like this, so I<br>> hope you find it to be as fascinating as I have while doing the<br>> research. Thank you very much for watching my internets. I\'m<br>> grateful.ï»¿<br><br>If you do feel inclined to follow Destin, hit that Subscribe button on<br>his YouTube channel, or just click<br>[here(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=52350d&url=http://bit.ly/Subscribe2SED){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bit.ly"}]{.qlink_container}. I don't work for Destin or know<br>him personally (other than what I've learned from his channel), but I<br>respect him as an engineer and a scientist, and I respect his opinions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
