<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Impeachment is a *political* function, not a *judicial*<br>one. This is why only the House can draft Articles of Impeachment,<br>and only the Senate can hold a trial.<br><br>I know the Constitution calls it a "trial" and that sounds a lot like<br>what happens in a courtroom, and I know that the Chief Justice of the<br>Supreme Court presides in the case of the trial of a president, but it<br>is not a judicial proceeding, period. It is a political proceeding.<br><br>Therefore, it takes place in the hallowed halls of politics (Congress),<br>not in the hallowed halls of a courtroom.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
