<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I'm 17 and want a new car but my parents are skeptical because they<br>don't know how much insurance will go up with my name on the policy.<br>Could my mom or dad insure the car under their name only and if I get<br>pulled over, I just say I'm borrowing it?**<br><br>The issue is not when you're pulled over. Especially if you don't own<br>the car, you don't have to be listed on the insurance card to drive the<br>car. So long as the vehicle is covered by an active insurance policy,<br>the police are happy. The issue is what happens if you get into an<br>*accident* without being on the policy. And the issue is not with the<br>police, but with the auto insurance company.<br><br>Most insurance companies will extend coverage to teen drivers who<br>haven't been added yet to their parent's policies. Sometimes it's just<br>an oversight. Sometimes, people are just trying to save money. In most<br>cases, if you get into an accident, insurance will still cover you even<br>if you're not on the policy.<br><br>Most. Not all.<br><br>Some insurance companies consider this to be *misrepresentation*, and<br>the company could deny coverage to you if you're in an accident, leaving<br>the cost of repairing the car, and the cost of covering any injuries you<br>cause, up to your parents. In some cases, they may cover the accident<br>you're in, but then charge you back premiums for the time that you had<br>your license and were driving without being on the policy. Sometimes,<br>they'll do one of the above, and then drop your parents from coverage<br>when everything is paid up. Most policies have a clause which says that<br>you must notify them of all changes in drivers. Some have a clause which<br>says basically, "if you don't notify us, we won't cover you."<br><br>Yes, it can be expensive. But trying to conceal you from insurance could<br>be just as costly if you get in to an accident. Have your parents talk<br>with their insurance company about discounts which may be available,<br>like good student discounts and discounts for attending safe driver<br>courses.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
