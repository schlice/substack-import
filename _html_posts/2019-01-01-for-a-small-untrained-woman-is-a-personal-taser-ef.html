<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**For a small, untrained woman, is a personal TASER effective for<br>warding off an attack?**<br><br>No. A Taser is much less effective than, say, pepper spray.<br><br>For most assailants, pepper spray is highly effective and does not cause<br>lasting damage. Tasers must be deployed precisely in order to be<br>effective, and some use cases make Tasers ineffective.<br><br>Additionally, pepper spray is far less regulated than Tasers, so<br>depending on where you live, you may not even be legally permitted to<br>carry a Taser without a concealed weapons permit, assuming you're even<br>allowed to possess one at all.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
