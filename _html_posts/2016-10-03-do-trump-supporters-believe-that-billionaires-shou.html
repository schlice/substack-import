<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Everyone should have to pay taxes. No one should not have to pay taxes.<br>That said, laws are designed so that you can have write-offs. No one is<br>alleging that Trump did anything illegal. They're simply alleging that<br>if Trump is such a master businessman, how did he incur a \$916 million<br>loss?<br><br>We all know that Trump took a \$916 million loss in 1995. In 1995, the<br>New York Times even reported on it.<br><br>> After the collapse of the real estate market of the 1980\'s, Mr.<br>> Trump\'s company was left holding some \$8.8 billion in debt, causing<br>> his personal net worth to drop to a low of about \$1 billion in the<br>> red by 1991.<br><br>One billion in the red by 1991, and he has recovered to be what he is<br>now. That\'s a pretty significant comeback, and the Times was writing<br>about it in 1995. They called him "the Comeback Kid," and it prompted<br>him to write his book, "The Art of the Comeback."<br><br>Again, no one is alleging that Trump did anything illegal. The IRS is<br>not alleging that Trump violated federal tax law. People are simply<br>shocked to find out that Trump took a \$916 million loss in 1995. It's<br>hard to imagine because we don't think in terms of numbers that big.<br>Also, the New York Times and President and Mrs. Clinton have used the<br>same provision in the tax laws as Trump has. Nothing to see here.<br><br>What really surprises me is that **the media (the New York Times, to be<br>precise) does something so *illegal* and no one cares.**<br><br>It just makes me laugh. Does anyone remember the emails from the<br>University of East Anglia which showed that global warming was a hoax?<br>The New York Times refused to publish the emails because they were the<br>fruits of a hack, and since hacks are illegal, it would be unethical to<br>publish the emails.<br><br>But now, someone drops a manila envelope with three pages of Trump tax<br>returns (p.s. it was an IRS employee) on the Times' front door and they<br>happily publish it, even though they were obtained illegally. Just<br>ask Trump; he never agreed to release those tax returns. But because it<br>benefits the Democrats, the Times jumps to publish them.<br><br>There's no more pretense; this is literally the most corrupt media we<br>have ever seen.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
