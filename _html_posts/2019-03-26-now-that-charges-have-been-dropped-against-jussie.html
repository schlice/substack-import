It<br>doesn't even mean "not guilty."<br><br>It simply means the state is not going to exert the effort (and taxpayer<br>dollars) needed to prosecute the crime.<br><br>In this situation, one of two things may have happened:<br><br>- Either the prosecution discovered a defect in their case, perhaps<br>  something in the background of the witnesses or the defendant that<br>  would make their prosecution problematic<br>- or they simply decided to perform what is known as ***deferred<br>  prosecution***. In Chicago, there is no requirement to plead guilty in<br>  a case of deferred prosecution.<br><br>We will probably never know which one of these two things actually<br>happened. But while this crime was a travesty, there was no violence,<br>there was no injury to anyone else (except for the alleged emotional<br>injury to Smollett), and prosecutors could have simply used their<br>discretion to drop the charges and not prosecute the case.<br><br>Or someone could have gotten to them. Someone with great political<br>power. Someone with Hollywood connections. And asked them, in the nicest<br>way possible, to maybe not bother with this case. With all the implied<br>force behind that "nice" request.<br><br>The truth is, we can speculate all day long, but we'll never know<br>exactly why they decided to drop their case.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
