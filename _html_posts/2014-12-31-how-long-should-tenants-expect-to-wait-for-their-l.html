<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It should be on your lease, both SLOs (Service Level<br>Objectives) for emergency and non-emergency repairs. You should also<br>have a number to contact for both.\<br>\<br>For emergency repairs (such as a failed water heater), I would hound<br>the landlord day and night until they got it fixed. I mean phone calls<br>every 2 hours until a repair person showed up at the location. Get the<br>landlord to give you a deadline, and when that deadline has passed +1<br>second, I\'d be back on the phone with them. There is no excuse for a<br>landlord to not call out an emergency repair within 2 hours after<br>receiving the call.\<br>\<br>For non-emergency repairs (such as a failed dishwasher), as long as<br>the issue is not causing a health or safety issue, the landlord can take<br>(or not take) as much time as they choose to get it fixed, but as we<br>said, it should be in your lease. If there are no timeframes specified<br>in your lease, try to work with the landlord to see when they want to<br>get it fixed.\<br>\<br>You can always document your conversations using postal mail if you<br>think it\'s going to be a problem. In other words, follow up your phone<br>calls with a certified return-receipt letter indicating that you had a<br>phone call on x day at x time and this is what you talked<br>about.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
