<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I work for a doctor and one of our patients died from an accidental<br>overdose on a pain medication she prescribed. What happens now?**<br><br>What happens is very situation-dependent. If the doctor prescribed the<br>medication correctly, and the medication was given with all of the<br>correct warnings regarding proper use of the medication, then most<br>likely nothing at all will happen. You even said that it was an<br>"accidental overdose," and doctors are not liable when accidents occur.<br>Accidents are accidents.<br><br>If the doctor did not prescribe the medication correctly, or the doctor<br>prescribed the wrong dosage, or the doctor did not adequately discuss<br>the medication with the patient (which we'll really never know), then<br>there may be some consequences. However, it doesn't sound likely that<br>anything will come of this, because again, if it truly was an accident,<br>then nothing should happen.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
