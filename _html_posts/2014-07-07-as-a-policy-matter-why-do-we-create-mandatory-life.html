<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Any time a decision like this is made, it is done so in<br/>the public interest. So ask yourself why the public would want someone<br/>convicted of a crime to have a permanent record. There are several<br/>reasons why we would want this.\<br/>\<br/>- While past behavior is no indication of future actions, it is possible<br/>that in the future, an investigation may need access to the wealth of<br/>information that was previously collected during a criminal<br/>investigation.\<br/>- There is an entire field of research devoted to looking at statistics<br/>and inferring patterns based on those statistics. We learn a great deal<br/>of information from this field of study, called epidemiology. It is most<br/>often used in healthcare, when we are unsure of the cause of the<br/>disease. We can look at ancillary statistics about the disease, and we<br/>can narrow our focus towards the cause of the disease using those<br/>statistics. The same can hold true for criminal behavior, and<br/>maintaining records can help us narrow down societal causes of aberrant<br/>behavior, in the hopes that we can make positive changes to reduce<br/>violence.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
