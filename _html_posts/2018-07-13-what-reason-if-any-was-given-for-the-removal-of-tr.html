<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What reason if any was given for the removal of trans personnel to be<br>not allowed to serve in the US military?**<br><br>There are lots of different categories of people who are not allowed to<br>serve in the US military.<br><br>As a comparison, let's look at one category of people who can't serve:<br>obese people. We've begun a massive exercise in "body positivity" which<br>had its roots in "fat acceptance" in the United States, yet this move<br>towards normalization of the obese has not changed the military's mind,<br>and obese people still cannot serve. Does their weight diminish their<br>desire to serve? Are they not good and loyal soldiers? Of course not!<br>But can they hump a 50 pound ruck on a 15 mile hike and not pass out<br>from exhaustion? Probably not.<br><br>And, on average, do obese people have more health issues than non-obese<br>people? When we have a soldier sidelined because he's got a health<br>problem, we're out a soldier. So doesn't it make sense to select the<br>soldiers who have the lowest possibility of being sidelined?<br><br>Trans people pose the same problems for the military. Besides the fact<br>that it is well established that there is a higher rate of mental issues<br>among the transgendered (whether or not they have already had gender<br>reassignment surgery), gender reassignment surgery is definitely an<br>issue. A trans military member could rightly claim that the military<br>should pay for their gender reassignment surgery because it is a mental<br>health issue. The surgery would not only sideline the troop during the<br>recovery process, the attendant hormones required are likely not<br>available in field hospitals while deployed, making the troop ineligible<br>for worldwide deployment.<br><br>As in the case of the obese person, doesn't it make sense to select the<br>soldiers who have the least likely possibility of being sidelined?<br><br>Finally, if we are to treat the transgendered as we do in society, they<br>can dress and act and be accepted as their chosen gender. However, in<br>the military, you are required to wear the uniform of the gender<br>specified on your ID card. The gender specified on your ID card is your<br>biological gender, as specified on your birth certificate. Only male or<br>female is authorized on the ID card, regardless of whether or not your<br>birth certificate says "Other" or whatever is coming into vogue these<br>days. If the birth certificate does not specify a M or F gender, the<br>actual genitalia as observed by a doctor is used to determine what goes<br>on the ID card. The gender on your ID card can only be changed after<br>gender reassignment surgery and issuance of a new birth certificate<br>specifying the new gender. This means that if you have male genitalia,<br>you have an M on your ID card, and you wear the male uniform. End of<br>discussion. A biological male cannot wear the uniform of the opposite<br>sex. Therefore, we would be objectively harming (psychologically) the<br>transgender individual by forcing them to wear the uniform of the sex<br>with which they do not identify.<br><br>Membership in the military is not mandatory. The military is not<br>required to select everyone. It can be selective in order to meet its<br>mission objectives. There is no "right" to serve in the military. It is<br>a "privilege," not a "right." The military can choose or not choose to<br>allow any type of person it chooses.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
