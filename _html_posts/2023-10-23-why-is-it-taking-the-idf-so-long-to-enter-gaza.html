<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In case you were unaware, the bulk of the IDF is *reservists.*<br><br>As you know, Israel has *compulsory military service* for two years.<br>After this, you can transition into the Reserves until you are in your<br>mid-40s, I believe.<br><br>So in order to create this army of over 300,000 troops to invade Gaza,<br>the bulk of these people needed to be recalled to active duty.<br><br>This involves *a lot of work*. They have to be fitted with uniforms,<br>issued weapons, re-certified on those weapons, the weapons themselves<br>need to be zeroed, and the newly-reactivated troops need to be issued<br>everything they need to sustain them in a ground assault, along with<br>training them on the current situation on the ground and their<br>engagement plans.<br><br>This does not happen overnight. They are indeed moving at breakneck<br>speed, but again, it is not an instantaneous call-up for the bulk of the<br>military.<br><br>(EDIT) They are also dealing with differing attitudes across the<br>population. Israelis generally either want to move slowly and<br>cautiously, or they want to get in to Gaza and finish the job. Really<br>not easy to navigate.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
