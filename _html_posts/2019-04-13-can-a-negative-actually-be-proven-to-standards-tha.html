<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can a negative actually be proven to standards that will be upheld in<br>a court of law?**<br><br>In law, the "burden of proof" standard is probably what you're talking<br>about. And as many have already answered here, yes you can most<br>certainly prove that someone did not do something using the "burden of<br>proof" standard.<br><br>In philosophy is often found the phrase "you can't prove a negative."<br>However, this is different from a legal standard, because when we<br>discuss this concept philosophically, we're actually talking about<br>affirmatively proving the non-existence of something. The difference<br>between this and a positive claim is that it takes only one example to<br>demonstrate the positive claim, whereas to affirmatively prove the<br>non-existence of something, you must be omniscient and omnipresent<br>(being all-knowing in all places at all times) in order to show that the<br>something does not exist and has never existed, which simply cannot be<br>done. This is not what we're doing in a legal context, so "proving a<br>negative" is not actually what we're doing in a court of law.<br><br>The common example used to illustrate this principle is the "red eagle"<br>example. I can claim that red eagles exist, and you can claim that red<br>eagles do not exist (an affirmative claim of non-existence). In order<br>for me to prove my claim, I simply need to show some evidence that red<br>eagles exist or have existed at one point in time. In order to<br>affirmatively prove that red eagles do not exist, you must be present in<br>all places at all times in order to show that there were never any red<br>eagles that existed, which is clearly an untenable position.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
