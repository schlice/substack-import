<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Everyone's got the Trump angle covered, so I want to specifically<br>address the last part of your question:<br><br>> Would you take a bullet to the head for democracy?<br><br>Yes. I even *voluntarily* agreed to do so. I voluntarily agreed, without<br>any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, to take a bullet to the<br>head for democracy when I signed on the dotted line and entered military<br>service in the United States Armed Forces.<br><br>Yes, that's what our military does. Yes, that's why you "thank a vet."<br>You thank a vet because they volunteered to take a bullet to the head<br>for democracy. Or in more descriptive terms, they volunteered to make<br>the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our Constitution and our way of<br>life.<br><br>So when you thank a vet for their service (assuming you do), this is<br>what you're thanking them for.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
