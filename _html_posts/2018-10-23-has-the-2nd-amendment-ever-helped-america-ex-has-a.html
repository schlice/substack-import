<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Has the 2nd Amendment ever helped America? (ex. has any mass shooter<br>been taken down by a civilian gun)**<br><br>I think you artificially limit yourself when you focus on mass<br>shootings. The number of people who die in mass shootings every year<br>*pales* in comparison to the number of people who die at the barrel of a<br>gun, and that number is *orders of magnitude* smaller than the number of<br>people who use a gun to stop crime, in most cases without a single<br>shot being fired.<br><br>In other words, guns are used *far* more frequently to prevent crime<br>than they are to commit crime.<br><br>So does the 2nd Amendment help America? Absolutely.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
