<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it an impeachable offense to knowingly try to artificially create a<br>National Emergency, even if there is a process to stop you?**<br><br>There really isn't a definition of what constitutes an impeachable<br>offense. The Constitution says "high crimes and misdemeanors," but<br>that's not a specific legal definition.<br><br>When Gerald R. Ford was in the House, he said that "an impeachable<br>offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers<br>it to be at a given moment in history."<br><br>Therefore, if a majority of the House believes that the President is<br>abusing the national emergency power, they can indeed file articles of<br>impeachment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
