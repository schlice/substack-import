<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, refrigeration is not recommended. Like all vegetable oils, olive oil<br>can be stored in a cool, dark place. It shouldn't be too warm, because<br>that could cause the oil to begin to oxidize and it will go rancid<br>faster (we'll talk about rancid EVOO in a minute). But it shouldn't be<br>refrigerated either, because that causes crystals to form and start to<br>solidify. Bringing it back to room temperature will return the oil to<br>its liquid state. According to the [[North American Olive Oil<br>Association](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ea12d8&url=https://www.aboutoliveoil.org/should-olive-oil-be-stored-in-the-refrigerator){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="aboutoliveoil.org"}]{.qlink_container}, some research has<br>found that repeatedly chilling and warming your oil may reduce its shelf<br>life and puts stress on the oil. Besides, it's really inconvenient to<br>have to warm your oil before you use it.<br><br>That said, it has a shelf life, even if it is a pretty good one. Most<br>olive oils can last about 18--24 months from the time they are bottled.<br>EVOO is maybe a little less, like 12--18 months. After that time, your<br>oil will go rancid. As<br>[HealthLine(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=02be8a&url=https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/does-olive-oil-go-bad){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="healthline.com"}]{.qlink_container} states, "You'll know<br>your olive oil has gone rancid by giving it a taste. It may taste bitter<br>or sour and smell a bit like crayons or putty. While it won't make you<br>sick, it may ruin your recipe." Keep an eye on the "Best By" date on<br>your bottle - it will show you when it's probably getting close to the<br>time to discard your old oil.<br><br>Speaking of EVOO and refrigeration, there was a myth running around for<br>a while (perpetuated by Dr. Oz on his TV show) that you could tell the<br>quality of your EVOO by putting it in the fridge. He claimed that poorer<br>quality oil would solidify in the fridge while good quality oil would<br>not. However, after his show, researchers at the [[UC Davis Olive<br>Center](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9e1dde&url=http://olivecenter.ucdavis.edu/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ucdavis.edu"}]{.qlink_container} tested the theory and found<br>that the fridge test is "unreliable in judging whether an olive oil is<br>truly made from olives, nor does it provide information on the quality<br>of the oil."
