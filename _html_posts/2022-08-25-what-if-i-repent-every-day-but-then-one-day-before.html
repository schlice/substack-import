<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We, in this space, believe in what is sometimes called OSAS, but It<br>means "Once Saved, Always Saved."<br><br>**If you have accepted that you are a sinner, you believe that Christ<br>died for your sins, and you confessed with your mouth that Christ is<br>your lord and savior and you humbly asked for forgiveness and for Christ<br>to take over your life,** and you have done this with your whole heart<br>in a true spirit of obedience, we believe you are *saved*.<br><br>Salvation is a one-time action. Christ died once to save us. We are<br>saved once. We don't have to be "re-saved," and we believe you can't<br>lose your salvation unless you intentionally walk away from your faith<br>in Christ.<br><br>In other words, **once you have been saved, you do not "lose" your<br>salvation.**<br><br>We are all sinners, and we will all face judgement at the end of days.<br>We will all stand before the throne and will all have our sins laid<br>bare. For the believer who has accepted Christ, the penalty for ALL of<br>our sins is paid for by Christ; past, present, and future. All sins are<br>paid for.<br><br>But what about sins for which we haven't repented?<br><br>First. are you *absolutely sure* that you didn't miss a sin? I know I'm<br>not. When we know that we can sin in thoughts, I can tell you just how<br>possible it is that I'd miss something. And as hard as I try, as hard as<br>I pray for the Spirit to reveal to me my sins so that I can repent of<br>them, I bet there's something that I missed. And let's say, for<br>argument's sake, that I'm driving home with my wife and we're having a<br>bad evening for some reason and I speak harshly with her, and the car<br>gets quiet. I don't have an opportunity to confess my sins and repent,<br>and we immediately get hit by a truck and die. I have sinned and didn't<br>have the opportunity to repent. Did I just forfeit my salvation?<br><br>Second, there is a difference in the *quality* of sin between one who<br>has been saved and one who has not been saved. For the unsaved, there is<br>a sort of *more deliberate, more eager, more persistent* pattern of sin,<br>perhaps you could think of it as a "settled" pattern of sin. Do you<br>think that the person who engages in this pattern of sin after they have<br>been "saved" has really repented, and is really trying to live as a<br>saved Christian should? For that person who sins in that way, I believe<br>he was probably never really saved in the first place.<br><br>So I really feel there are two types of sins: the sins that we all, as<br>believers, engage in because we are human and we will always fall (and<br>we try with our whole heart to confess those when we learn about them,<br>or when we realize we've done them), and the type of persistent,<br>deliberate, settled, intentional pattern of sin which categorizes<br>someone who has not been saved (even if they believe they were, but they<br>persist in an *intentional* pattern of sin). And I think the intention<br>is very important in that type of sin pattern.<br><br>I believe God knows us, he loves us, and for those of us who have<br>repented and accepted Christ, he doesn't hold our honest mistake in<br>failing to repent for a sin against our salvation.<br><br>From here, we can get into the really deep Biblical stuff about<br>"heavenly rewards" that our sin may cost us, but Christians can rest<br>assured that once saved, always saved.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
