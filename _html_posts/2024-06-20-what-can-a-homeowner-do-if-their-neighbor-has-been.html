<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, if the person's rule violations aren't harming your home's value<br>(i.e. they're not doing something that would cause a buyer to think<br>twice about buying your house), then just let it go.<br><br>Second, how do you know that the Board hasn't been pursuing action<br>against this person? Actions between the Board and a homeowner are kept<br>confidential. They may actually be pursuing violations, but have run<br>into legal roadblocks which you may be unaware of.<br><br>You can always ask the Board if they are doing anything. If the Board is<br>unresponsive to homeowners, bring it up in a Board meeting (they are<br>open to homeowners). If they are still unresponsive, perhaps you could<br>run for the Board yourself and make sure that they are doing what they<br>are supposed to be doing. I have noticed that this is a very unpopular<br>choice, despite how vocal some homeowners are about wanting change.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
