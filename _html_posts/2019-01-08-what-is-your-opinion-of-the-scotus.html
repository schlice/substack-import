<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is your opinion of the SCOTUS' 2nd Amendment ruling that the<br>phrase regarding \"well-regulated militia\" can essentially be ignored<br>as it relates to individual gun ownership?**<br><br>I think "ignored" is the wrong word to use when it comes to the<br>prefatory clause.<br><br>The ruling in *DC v. Heller* clarified that the 2nd Amendment has two<br>parts:<br><br>- The first clause of the Second Amendment that references a "militia"<br>  is a *prefatory clause*.<br><br>> *A well-regulated Militia, being essential to the security of a free<br>> State*<br><br>The prefatory clause explains part of the reason we have the Amendment<br>in the first place, *but it does not limit the operative clause of the<br>Amendment*. Additionally, the term "militia" should not be read to limit<br>gun ownership to those serving in the military, because at the time the<br>term "militia" referred to all able-bodied men who were capable of being<br>called to such service.<br><br>- The second clause of the Second Amendment is known as the *operative<br>  clause.*<br><br>> *The right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be<br>> infringed.*<br><br>The phrase "the right of the people" is used three times in the Bill of<br>Rights, and each time it denotes a right reserved to individual citizens<br>by virtue of their citizenship, not because of membership in a<br>particular group (other than the group of citizens).<br><br>> Because the text of the Amendment should be read in the manner that<br>> gives greatest effect to the plain meaning it would have had at the<br>> time it was written, the operative clause should be read to "guarantee<br>> an individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of<br>> confrontation."\[1\](#MyHLX){#cite-MyHLX .citation_link}<br><br>TL;DR: So to answer your question specifically, we don't "ignore"<br>the prefatory clause. However, the prefatory clause does not limit the<br>operative clause.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-MyHLX){.citation_index} [[District of Columbia v.<br>Heller](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bf785c&url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2007/07-290){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="oyez.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
