<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are three levels of belief about Trump in the current Republican<br>party, ranked from those who love Trump to those who don't:<br><br>- MAGA Republicans: These people *love* Trump. These are the men<br>  who wear "'Mericuns fer Trump" and the women who wear "He can grab<br>  this pussy any time" shirts. Their houses are decorated outside with a<br>  garden of Trump flags, American flags, and weird amalgamations of the<br>  two. The insides of their homes are decorated with every single bit of<br>  swag that some enterprising entrepreneur has ever come up with to<br>  market Trump, from candy bars to collectible dinner plates. Some of<br>  them (since the attempted assassination) have ascribed some sort of<br>  *divine mandate* to his candidacy. They will never not vote for<br>  him. If he would have, as he described in his first presidential bid,<br>  shot someone in broad daylight in the middle of 5th Avenue, these<br>  would be the people who would still vote for him. This is a<br>  *small* *fringe* of the Republican party.<br>- Bog-standard Republicans: This is the "considered middle." These<br>  are the people who know that Trump is a flawed man. They know that he<br>  is a sinner, just as we all are. But they vote for **policy, not<br>  people**. And they know that Trump's policies are going to be better<br>  for the majority of their citizen brethren than Harris' policies every<br>  day of the week and twice on Sunday. They are looking forward to<br>  easing grocery store prices and easing gas prices. They're looking<br>  forward to an improving economy and more money in their pockets. They<br>  will overlook Trump's personal foibles because he's human, and he's<br>  flawed, but his policies are good. This is the *vast majority* of<br>  the Republican party.<br>- Never Trumpers: These are the people who know that the Republicans<br>  have answers that will be better for everyone, but they simply cannot<br>  bring themselves to put a vote in the R column while Trump is on the<br>  ticket. They believe the GOP has sold us out by nominating someone<br>  like him. They know all people are flawed, but they cannot, in good<br>  conscience, vote for any ticket that he is on. These are the people<br>  who are willing to *throw their vote away* instead of voting for<br>  Trump. They certainly won't vote for Harris, but they won't vote for<br>  Trump either. They will either stay home, or they will vote<br>  third-party. This too is a *small fringe* of the Republican party.<br><br>\<br><br>So to answer your question, you can't find any MAGAs who say they will<br>stop supporting Trump if he revealed he is a pedophile because they are<br>MAGAs; they will never not support Trump. If you're looking for MAGA<br>Republicans to not vote for Trump because he did<br>\<insert_bad_thing_here\>, good luck. They will never not vote for<br>him, because in their eyes, he can do no wrong.<br><br>Honestly, you probably are just trolling, looking for some MAGA person<br>to respond to you so you can poo poo all over their values, but these<br>people are mostly silent. Oddly, it's questions like yours which cause<br>them to stay silent. They also don't respond to polls for the same<br>reason, so poll numbers you see before the election woefully<br>underrepresent Trump's support. Again, it's questions like yours which<br>cause MAGAs to stay silent.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question: How come I can't find any MAGA who says they will<br>stop supporting Trump if he revealed he was a pedophile?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
