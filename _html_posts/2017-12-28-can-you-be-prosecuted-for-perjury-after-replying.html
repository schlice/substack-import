<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you be prosecuted for perjury after replying "NO" to an officer<br>inquiring as to whether you committed a crime?**<br><br>If the "officer" is a lawyer and you are in a court and you have sworn<br>to tell the truth, then you can be charged with perjury.<br><br>But in the United States, and you have not been sworn in on the witness<br>stand, you are under no legal obligation to tell the police the truth<br>about anything other than your name.<br><br>Especially in the scenario I have given, the 5th Amendment to the<br>Constitution specifically says that you cannot be "a witness against<br>yourself." This means that you cannot be forced to say things which<br>might incriminate you, *even if you are sworn to tell the truth, as in a<br>court of law.*<br><br>So in such a situation as I originally described, and you were providing<br>sworn testimony, and you were asked if you committed a crime, you would<br>decline to answer under the 5th Amendment to the Constitution, as such<br>an answer might incriminate you. This is also called "pleading the 5th,"<br>if you've ever heard that phrase.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
