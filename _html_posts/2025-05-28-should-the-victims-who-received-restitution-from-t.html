<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It depends on whether the money has actually been transferred to the US<br>Treasury and whether the victims have been compensated.<br><br>If the Treasury has already received the funds, and if the victims have<br>already been paid, then the pardon generally doesn't grant a right to<br>refund.<br><br>If the Treasury hasn't yet received the funds, they can be reimbursed so<br>long as the pardon details don't preclude a refund.<br><br>But *should* they? I think that the current setup is appropriate. If the<br>funds have already been transferred, they should be considered<br>unrecoverable, but if the funds haven't been transferred, they should be<br>considered beyond the reach of the Treasury or the victims.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
