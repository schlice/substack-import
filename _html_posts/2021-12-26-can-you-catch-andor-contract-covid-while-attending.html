<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Can you catch and/or contract COVID while attending Church services?<br><br>Of course you can. Especially with Omicron running around, which seems<br>to target both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated with equal vigor.<br><br>> Will Jesus heal you if you do?<br><br>Nope. I don't know where this idea came from. Maybe you're just guessing<br>why people would go to church during a pandemic. Maybe you think that<br>they think that Jesus will heal them.<br><br>We just had one of our congregation die from COVID, so we know full well<br>that no one is healing us if we get sick.<br><br>But there is a big, big difference between the church crowd and everyone<br>else.<br><br>We do not live in fear. We live in faith. Doesn't mean I don't<br>take proper precautions (I'm fully vaccinated with boosters), but I also<br>don't cower in my home, having my all my meals delivered and having<br>clean underwear shipped in from Amazon.<br><br>- If we contract COVID in church, in Walmart, or in Disney World, we<br>  still contracted COVID. And it was part of God's plan.<br>- If we die from contracting COVID, it was part of God's plan.<br>- If we contract COVID but we recover, it was part of God's plan.<br><br>So, I'm sure you're asking yourself right now: *what is God's plan?*<br><br>We don't know. We probably won't ever know until we meet him face to<br>face. But we know he has plans for us.<br><br>> "For I know the plans I have for you,\" declares the LORD, \"plans to<br>> prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.<br>> Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will listen<br>> to you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your<br>> heart." --- Jeremiah 29:11 NIV<br><br>We can expound on this topic quite a bit more, but I'll limit it to this<br>for now. Bottom line: live in faith, don't live in fear. God's got this.<br>He always has.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
