<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**As an American gun owner, would you fight back if law enforcement came<br>to confiscate your firearms?**<br><br>Like, try to kill them? Who exactly do you think I am?<br><br>I certainly would not "fight back" in that way. I would allow law<br>enforcement to search my house from top to bottom, assuming they had<br>followed all the requisite laws in order to do so (assuming the 4th<br>Amendment was still on the books, I'd want to see a search warrant). I'd<br>show them my two empty gun safes and explain the tragic boating accident<br>that caused all of my guns to fall to the bottom of the reservoir. I'd<br>show them the gas receipt from driving to and from the lake. Tragic, sad<br>tale.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
