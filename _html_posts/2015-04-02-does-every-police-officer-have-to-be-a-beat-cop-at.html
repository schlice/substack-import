<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In general, most police officers start out as patrol<br>officers. It is different in some jurisdictions.\<br>\<br>For example, in the county, we run the county jail. Our deputies start<br>out in the jail as their first duty assignment out of the academy,<br>before they ever hit the streets as a patrol officer. However in most<br>departments, since patrol is the biggest and most personnel-demanding<br>bureau in the department, this is where most police officers go first.<br>This is also the place where officers get OJT (on-the-job training),<br>performed by a FTO (Field Training Officer) who progresses them through<br>their \"probationary\" period until they are fully qualified to work<br>solo.\<br>\<br>They are generally reassigned from patrol to other divisions in the<br>department as they are promoted or after they have an acceptable service<br>record as a patrol officer. Who gets assigned to other divisions, and<br>when, differs by department.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
