<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No one said you must answer your door.<br><br>It\'s just odd how the asker is asking, essentially, what did the cop<br>want, when the way to have determined, quite easily, what he wanted, was<br>to answer the door.<br><br>The asker didn\'t answer the door because the officer didn\'t have the<br>right to entry without a warrant (or an invitation). But that\'s not a<br>reason to not answer the door. It may be a reason to not allow entry. It<br>may be a reason to not open the door. But it\'s not a reason to not<br>answer the door at all.<br><br>The asker should at least be honest with himself/herself and say they<br>didn\'t answer the door for fear of the consequences.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-would-a-police-officer-follow-me-home-and-then-knock-on-my-door/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
