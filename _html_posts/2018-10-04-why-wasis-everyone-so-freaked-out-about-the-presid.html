<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why was/is everyone so freaked out about the presidential alert?<br><br>It's a general freakout about Trump.<br><br>You know that Trump *loves* Twitter. You also know that no other<br>president in history has talked as plainly and as openly directly to the<br>American people through a social media platform as Trump has.<br><br>Therefore, some people worry that the Presidential Alert would become<br>"Trump's personal Twitter Line" directly to people that they can't turn<br>off.<br><br>Not only is this ridiculous (he does just fine with Twitter), but it's<br>untrue.<br><br>The Presidential Alert is one of three categories of messages which the<br>government can send through the Wireless Emergency Alert system, part of<br>the nation's Emergency Alert System (which used to be called the<br>Emergency Broadcast System). It preempts all other communications, and<br>the WEA system itself can preempt other communications on your device to<br>get through.<br><br>But, the system can only be actually activated as a "last-ditch"<br>communication method if the President can't get to the media.<br>Additionally, its use is controlled by three different groups: FEMA, the<br>FCC, and NOAA.<br><br>Therefore, so long as Trump has access to Twitter, you're not going to<br>be seeing the WEA become Trump's personal text message service to your<br>phone.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
