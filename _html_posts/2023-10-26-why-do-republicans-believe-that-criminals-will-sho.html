<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because "unarmed" does not equal "not dangerous."<br><br>Remember, deadly force is justified when you are in fear of your life<br>*or grievous bodily harm*. If someone punches you so hard that they<br>break your orbital socket, you can go permanently blind in that eye.<br>This qualifies as *grievous bodily harm*. You may defend against<br>such an attack using any force at your disposal, including deadly force.<br><br>But that's not the real issue here, is it. Because if victims of crime<br>are unarmed, *then why aren't criminals?* If criminals were going to be<br>real thugs like they want to be, then *they* should be unarmed. Why do<br>criminals have guns if the people they are committing crimes against are<br>unarmed? You know who is *not* going to disarm if you take their "little<br>right" away? *Criminals.*<br><br>Why do you think it's okay for a criminal to have a gun and to use it to<br>commit a crime, but it's somehow not okay for the victim to have a gun<br>and to use it to defend against crime? What do you have against crime<br>victims that you seek to disarm them?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
