<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [You said \"leaders.\" The question asked specifically<br>about short people being successful, not being successful *leaders*.\<br>\<br>Modern leadership is a popularity contest. People who are taller do have<br>a slight advantage, as a leader is often conflated with *stature*, and<br>taller people are generally viewed as having a greater stature. You want<br>your leader to be a towering, imposing figure. So in government, there<br>is an advantage for the taller person.\<br>\<br>That doesn\'t mean that short people can\'t be leaders. The lack of<br>height can be made up for in charisma or charm. But height<br>helps.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-short-guy-under-55â€³-who-is-considered-to-be-successful/answer/Kandarp-Joshi-4<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
