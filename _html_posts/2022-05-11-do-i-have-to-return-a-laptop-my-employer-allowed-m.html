<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I really like [[David<br>Schwartz](https://www.quora.com/profile/David-Schwartz-9)]{.qlink_container}'s<br>answer, billing them for your time in moving your data off of the<br>machine and then returning it for refund plus expenses. The problem I<br>have with this is that you now have to haggle with them over your pay<br>rate, and if they reject it, you're stuck, and they still want your<br>laptop back.<br><br>I have a different opinion. **I think you have just as much right to<br>keep the laptop.**<br><br>You have a purchase receipt, and you purchased it from the entity which<br>had "ownership" of the laptop at the time. Whether or not they had the<br>right to sell it is not your problem, but they are trying to make it<br>your problem. The "owner" made a sale decision, and as the "owner of<br>record" at the time, they legally can bind their company to contracts,<br>whether or not they had the authority to do so. Now, the leasing company<br>is likely coming back to them and telling them that they actually want<br>the hardware back, and they're trying to minimize what they have to pay<br>out, along with not having to go back to the leasing company and admit<br>that they actually sold the laptop when they were not authorized to do<br>so.<br><br>My answer: tell your former employer to go kick rocks. They legally<br>sold it, I have a receipt, I paid fairly for it, it's mine. If they<br>found out they didn't have permission to sell it, that's their problem,<br>not mine. Looks like they need to pay the leasing company for their<br>mistake. Don't put me in the middle of your contract issue with your<br>leasing company.<br><br>If they complain about this at all, you may need to retain the services<br>of an attorney in your area to help you politely tell them to go kick<br>rocks.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Do I have to return a laptop? My employer allowed me to buy my work<br>computer after I left my job. Later, they asked for it back saying they<br>never had the right to sell it (they will refund me). Do I have to<br>return it?<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice.
