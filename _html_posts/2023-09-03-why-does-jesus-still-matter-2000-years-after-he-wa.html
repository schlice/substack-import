<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because Jesus died once for all, and because we still need Him.<br><br>Jesus didn't die once for the people in Jerusalem around 33 AD. He<br>didn't die for only the people who came before HIm. He died once, for<br>ALL. That's EVERYONE who has ever lived and ever will live. Jesus'<br>sacrifice is sufficient for everyone.<br><br>And unless you've been asleep at the switch all these years, people<br>still need Him. They still need His salvation. They still need His<br>grace. They still need His comfort and His aid, as only He can provide.<br><br>And since He is the *ONLY* way into Heaven, He will continue to<br>matter until the end of the age.<br><br>> Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes<br>> to the Father except through me." --- John 14:6 NIV<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
