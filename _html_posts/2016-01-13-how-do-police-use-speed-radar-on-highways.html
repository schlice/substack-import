<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When a vehicle is sitting parallel to the direction of travel, and<br>clocking traffic, it\'s usually because the vehicle has a *built-in*<br>radar system. It consists of three parts: two radar transceivers, and a<br>dash-mounted control unit. The control unit is capable of maths that<br>allow the unit to run while the police vehicle is in motion, clocking<br>speeds of vehicles in front of, and behind, the patrol car, while it is<br>in motion.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-fc3237a372dbbfc961bd92cf80721e5d){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-fc3237a372dbbfc961bd92cf80721e5d" master_w="500"<br>master_h="500"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>This photo shows the front transceiver and the control unit. There is a<br>similar transceiver mounted on the rear deck of the patrol vehicle.<br><br>If the patrol vehicle is sitting *perpendicular* to the flow of traffic,<br>he theoretically could be clocking traffic in *either* direction.<br>However, if we\'re to apply a little logic to the situation, it is far<br>more likely that he is using LIDAR out the passenger window so that he<br>can proceed forward into traffic to stop a speeder. I wouldn\'t use that<br>as logic to speed past him if he is facing into the opposite lane of<br>traffic, though. Nothing says he can\'t back up and follow you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
