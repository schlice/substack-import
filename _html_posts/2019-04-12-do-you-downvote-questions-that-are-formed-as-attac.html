<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you downvote questions that are formed as attacks on conservatives,<br>Republicans, or other parts of the center-right coalition and why?**<br><br>No. Not at all.<br><br>Why?<br><br>*Because that's not what the Quora voting system is for.*<br><br>Votes are cast for *high-quality content.* Votes will move a question up<br>or down in other users' feeds, or make it visible to a larger segment of<br>the Quora population.<br><br>Similarly, upvoting answers is reserved for *high-quality content.*<br>Answers which are both correct and engaging get upvoted, *even if I<br>disagree with what the user says.*<br><br>There are many popular Quorans with whom I fundamentally politically<br>disagree. I still consistently upvote their content, because it is<br>high-quality content.<br><br>*So how, then, do we deal with questions which attack any group (not<br>just Conservatives)?*<br><br>The answer is to *Report* that content. You can do that<br>through the three dot menu underneath the question. Click it, and choose<br>*Report.*<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-4c822357b6f8e4caa6b95b328b13774f){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-4c822357b6f8e4caa6b95b328b13774f" master_w="772"<br>master_h="377"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>If a question attacks a person or group, I immediately report that<br>question as Harassment.<br><br>*But Bill*, I can hear you saying right now, *when you Report a<br>question, it automatically downvotes that question! So why are you<br>saying we shouldn't downvote the question?*<br><br>The answer is **if your downvote is in relation to a Report, then that's<br>Quora using their algorithm to show the answer to fewer people because<br>of the alleged harassment, not because of your opinion on the tone of<br>the question.**<br><br>The report is the important part; the downvote is secondary to the<br>report. The downvote alone only fixes the symptom of the problem, not<br>the problem itself.<br><br>**To that end, using downvotes alone does nothing to alert Quora to<br>harassing behavior, and the misuse of their platform.**<br><br>Please, don't downvote questions like this. Please Report them, and the<br>system will downvote the question automatically.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
