<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why are laws in place that charge you with murder just because one of<br>you accomplices in another crime is killed by someone else not you?**<br><br>Ah, the infamous [[felony murder<br>rule](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ce010e&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony_murder_rule){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>This is a very old rule and dates back to the 12th century in common<br>law. And the Wiki page explains it best. Basically, "the malicious<br>intent inherent in the commission of any crime, however trivial, was<br>considered to apply to any consequences of that crime, however<br>unintended."<br><br>In order to deter dangerous crimes, they use the intent while committing<br>a dangerous crime to apply to any consequences of the crime, even if you<br>didn't intend on that consequence.<br><br>So if you're robbing a bank, and one of your cohorts kills a security<br>guard, even if you didn't plan on killing anyone, you can still be found<br>guilty of murder because a murder was committed during the course of a<br>felony.<br><br>This is an example of strict liability where a person who chooses to<br>commit a crime is considered absolutely responsible for any possible<br>consequences of that crime. The rule acts as a deterrent to dangerous<br>crimes.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
