<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Your rights to free speech are not limited by someone<br>else\'s right to carry a weapon. Can you call the police and tell them,<br>\"he\'s violating my right to be free from intimidation\"? (HINT: nope).<br>There are laws protecting you against someone verbalizing a threat, but<br>someone\'s imposing presence is not illegal.\<br>\<br>You have no right to be free from intimidation. Anyone has the right to<br>intimidate you, either overtly or covertly. If you want to continue to<br>make that assertion, please provide some case law that shows that a<br>right to be free from intimidation exists in the Constitution. Because<br>there is certainly no text in the Constitution that enumerates such a<br>right.\<br>\<br>If you are intimidated by someone\'s presence, hire a bodyguard. Or<br>carry your own weapon. Or grow a spine. You have as much right to speak<br>as he has to carry a gun. Those two are not mutually exclusive. The<br>simple act of him carrying a gun does not change your rights.\<br>\<br>No one has the right to \"wave guns in the air.\" That\'s called<br>\"brandishing a weapon,\" and is illegal everywhere. There is a big<br>difference between someone \"waving a weapon in the air\" and someone<br>with a pistol on his belt. But those people are not arrested because<br>they \"violated your right to not be intimidated,\" but because they<br>\"brandished a weapon.\" Big, big difference.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
