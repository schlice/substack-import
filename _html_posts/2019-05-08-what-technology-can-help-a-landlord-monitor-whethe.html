<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What technology can help a landlord monitor whether a tenant is<br>illegally renting out his or her place as an Airbnb?**<br><br>As with all questions which drift towards the legal, the answer is "it<br>depends."<br><br>Landlords, in general, have broad authority to manage their property.<br>They can go so far as to install cameras in the common areas of the<br>property to monitor activities in that space, and this is perfectly<br>legal.<br><br>Many landlords partner with service companies to turn their properties<br>into "smart properties." This has advantages for both the landlords and<br>the tenants. The landlords can monitor things like power usage,<br>utilities, and security, while tenants receive smart home benefits, like<br>keyless entry, smart thermostats, and those same security cameras to<br>check on your dog while you're at work.<br><br>One such service company is<br>[SmartRent(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=13a36c&url=https://smartrent.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="smartrent.com"}]{.qlink_container}, but there are others<br>like<br>[Stratis(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d5fd73&url=https://stratisiot.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="stratisiot.com"}]{.qlink_container},<br>[Zego(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=526981&url=https://www.zego.io/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="zego.io"}]{.qlink_container}, and<br>[Vivint(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=785e80&url=https://www.vivint.com/smart-properties){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="vivint.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>Finally, the best way a landlord can monitor whether or not a tenant is<br>illegally renting out his place as an Airbnb is...Airbnb. You can very<br>simply search Airbnb listings for your apartment. If you're going to<br>list a place on Airbnb as an illegal rental, potential tenants, as well<br>as the landlord, can find that listing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
