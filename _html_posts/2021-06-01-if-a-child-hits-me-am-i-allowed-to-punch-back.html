<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>In all cases, if you are in a situation in which you fear for your life,<br>you can always defend yourself. But you will have to articulate why you<br>felt as if your life was in danger.<br><br>You always have a right to self-defense, no matter what the age of your<br>attacker is. Persons of any age can commit assault and/or battery. You<br>can use whatever force necessary to stop the unlawful conduct.<br><br>The criminal side of the equation is simple. A crime was being<br>committed. You used reasonable force to stop the crime. You are not<br>guilty of anything because you acted in self-defense.<br><br>The civil side is going to be much more difficult and nuanced. They are<br>going to try to parse exactly what you did to see if the force you used<br>was excessive based on the age of the person attacking you and their<br>ability to really injure you. This idea of *proportionality* in the<br>civil assault case will be on vivid display. If the child kicked your<br>shin and you flat-out cold-cocked him with one of those punches you use<br>at the amusement park strength testing games and you cause him a<br>concussion *with your fist*, the courts will not look too kindly that<br>you stopped the "attack" with only the force required. But if the child<br>is swinging (and possibly connecting) with a baseball bat and you<br>cold-cock him with the same punch, your defense might be seen as<br>reasonable, and your liability for any injuries your punch caused would<br>be severely reduced.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If a child hits me am I allowed to punch back?<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice. This answer is for GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. If<br>you ignore this warning and convey confidential information in a private<br>message or comment, there is no duty to keep that information<br>confidential or to forego representation adverse to your interests.
