<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In the United States, if a suspect dies before he can be<br>tried, and there is no other accused, the state has no case, and the<br>charges are dismissed.\<br>\<br>However, it sounds like the tenor of your question (who pays after him)<br>is seeking retribution for a crime. In the United States, it\'s called<br>the \"Justice System,\" not the \"Vengeance System.\" It is about<br>*justice*, not *retribution.* If you\'re looking for payback, look<br>elsewhere.\<br>\<br>Since the person died before he was found guilty, he has repaid his debt<br>to society through his death, and there is no one else who needs to pay.<br>Society has its justice. If you still feel slighted after he has died,<br>perhaps you can seek a civil judgment against his family or something<br>similar.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
