<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why did the Supreme Court delay the decision on the disclosure of<br>Trump\'s finances?**<br><br>This is an extremely important case, and it deserves to be handled with<br>the utmost of care.<br><br>Trump's presidency is unique because Trump is not a politician and his<br>finances affects more than just himself. He has companies in his name,<br>and his family's and others' finances are also directly related to his<br>finances. Disclosure of those finances, for political purposes, can cost<br>his companies many millions of dollars.<br><br>Trump is also the first modern president who has not voluntarily<br>released his financial information. This lack of candor has rankled his<br>political opponents, who truly believe that he is only withholding his<br>personal financial information because he has something to hide.<br><br>The Court will be determining the scope of the separation-of-powers<br>doctrine which is part of the design of the Constitution. It will<br>determine the limits of Congressional oversight; in other words, how far<br>can Congress go into investigating the financial history of a president<br>before he became president. This decision affects not only Trump, but<br>every other president to follow, so it is very important.<br><br>This is why the court is moving slowly and deliberately.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
