title: '"Luke 10:25-28 says that Christian salvation solely depends on your relationship
  with God and with other humans, therefore, those who are condemned to hell have
  obviously caused grievous offence to God or to their fellow humans. Do you agree
  or not?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As usual, a small quote misses the context. And as I've said many times<br>when answering Christian questions, **text, without context, is just<br>pretext.**<br><br>Luke 10:25-28 says the following (it's short, so we can paste it in<br>here):<br><br>> On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus.<br>> "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"<br>><br>> "What is written in the Law?" he replied. "How do you read it?"<br>><br>> He answered, "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all<br>> your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and,<br>> 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"<br>><br>> "You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do this and you will<br>> live." (NIV)<br><br>So what was Jesus saying here? He was talking to a lawyer about the law,<br>and He said, "What is written in the Law?" So Jesus was pointing a<br>lawyer right back to the Law, the same Law that the lawyer held himself<br>to.<br><br>In other words, **if you hold yourself to the Law, then you must keep<br>the Law**.<br><br>*But can anyone do that?*<br><br>No one perfectly keeps the Law. Only Jesus perfectly kept the Law.<br>That's why Paul said in Romans 3:28 that "we are justified by faith<br>apart from the works of the Law" because no one can perfectly keep the<br>Law.<br><br>That is why the Gospel says that Jesus kept the Law perfectly (1 Peter<br>2:22), so we can be justified before God by faith in Him (Romans 4:3, 5;<br>5:1; John 1:12; 3:16) without the works of the Law (Romans 3:28).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
