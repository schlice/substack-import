<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: no.<br><br>What more guns among citizens *won't* do is *increase* the risk<br>of mass shootings. The converse (more guns reduces risk of mass<br>shootings) is not always true.<br><br>It may be possible that one armed person might be able to offer some<br>level of resistance to a mass shooter when they were expecting none.<br>This may dissuade the shooter from continuing.<br><br>*But remember, this is not why citizens are armed.* ***This is why the<br>police are armed.*<br><br>Citizens are armed so that they can defend themselves or their<br>families. Citizens are *not* armed to be quasi-police and try to<br>take on every moron with a gun. It might be nice if an armed individual<br>used his training to try to stop a mass shooter, but it is by no means a<br>requirement. More power to him if he believes in his training enough to<br>try to intervene, but we are not asking this of concealed carry holders.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
