<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Currently, as of today (14 June 2017), it appears that Michigan does not<br>have a state law which allows persons to use a bathroom based on their<br>gender identity. They're working on one, but it's not law yet.<br><br>If you're a student, the Michigan Board of Education recently approved a<br>measure which directs districts to allow transgender students to use<br>bathrooms or locker rooms that match their gender identity, although<br>private accommodations should be made for all students upon request. The<br>new rules also direct schools to enact polices that protect LGBT<br>students from harassment and to designate a staff member who can provide<br>LGBT-related support to students who request it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
