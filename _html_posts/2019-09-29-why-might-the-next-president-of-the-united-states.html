Remember that impeachment is a<br>*political* remedy, while prosecution is a *legal* remedy, and<br>prosecution has a much higher bar to overcome than impeachment.<br><br>Besides, the power of prosecution is resident in a single unitary<br>President, under the Constitution. This wasn't done to allow for<br>Presidential lawlessness (see Impeachment). It was done to provide a<br>hedge against Congressional overreach and abuse of power. Congress was<br>routinely seen as the most powerful of the three branches, and it was<br>the vesting of prosecutorial authority in the President that was one of<br>the means to counter that power.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
