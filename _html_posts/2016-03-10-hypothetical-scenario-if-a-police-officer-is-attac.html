<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Legally,* there are no circumstances in which you have the legal<br>authority to resist a police officer in the performance of his duties.<br>In fact, doing so gives the officer *more* authority, not *less*, to<br>continue his assault.<br><br>However, since we\'re talking about a very unlikely hypothetical, I<br>think the assault would reach a point where you would have no choice but<br>to defend yourself.<br><br>The difference comes in the punishments. If the officer was legally<br>carrying out his authority but just used excessive force, he might lose<br>his job. If you defend yourself against a police officer, you are<br>resisting arrest, and quite possibly assaulting a peace officer, and<br>you\'re going to jail *and* you\'re a convicted felon.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
