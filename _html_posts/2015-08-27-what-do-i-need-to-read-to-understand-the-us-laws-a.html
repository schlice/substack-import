<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Have you ever seen a law library? Guess what those books<br>are? Half of them are Federal and State laws, and the other half are<br>documented court cases which comprise the bulk of *case law*.\<br>\<br>There are volumes upon volumes of laws to read, so many in fact, that it<br>would be far too challenging to read them all.\<br>\<br>My advice: learn the generalities about US law. Take a civics class.<br>Learn how the government works, learn how the Constitution works. Learn<br>the differences between Federal and state laws.\<br>\<br>Then, when you have specific questions about laws, you can look those up<br>individually.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
