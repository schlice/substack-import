<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is an interesting case, and it has to do with what is known as<br>"Kaufman language." Kaufman language for HOAs is the inclusion of a<br>single phrase in Governing Documents:<br><br>> "This community shall be governed by Chapter 720 of the Florida<br>> Statutes as exists on the date hereof, and as same may be amended from<br>> time to time."<br><br>It stems from a 1977 Florida lawsuit, *Kaufman v. Shere*, which<br>essentially had the effect of incorporating \"substantive\" statutory<br>changes into the Governing Documents of a community. The judge ruled, in<br>part, that the Declaration by which the property was created and<br>governed had provided for the adoption of future legislative acts as<br>amendments to the declaration by including this phrase.<br><br>Absence of Kaufman Language allows (with some notable exceptions) that<br>the statute as it exists, on the date the governing documents are<br>recorded, will govern the substantive rights and duties of the parties.<br>Inclusion of Kaufman Language allows, in theory, that subsequent changes<br>in the law should be automatically available.<br><br>Basically, some Florida HOAs are pushing back on the new amendments to<br>Florida law directing HOAs that they must allow trucks to park in<br>driveways. They are saying that, since their Governing Documents do not<br>include "Kaufman language," then homeowners accepted the rules ***as<br>they existed on the date the Governing Documents were recorded.***<br><br>In other words, the HOA is *grandfathered* in.<br><br>The question of whether or not HOAs can do this will have to be<br>determined by the courts. In other words, a homeowner will have to park<br>a truck, the HOA will have to fine the homeowner, and the homeowner will<br>have to file suit against the HOA, claiming that the fine violates the<br>new Florida Statute. The HOA will argue that because their Governing<br>Documents do not contain Kaufman language, the HOA is grandfathered in,<br>and their Governing Documents do not include the new additions or<br>modifications to State law.<br><br>We shall see how this shakes out.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
