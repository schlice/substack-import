<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>"Gun violence" is a bad phrase. When you use that phrase, you tend to<br>put the focus on the "gun" instead of the "violence." Then, to stop the<br>"violence," you simply need to remove the "gun," and the "violence"<br>magically disappears.<br><br>As if the gun has some magical quality that causes people to commit<br>violence.<br><br>It's almost like the phrase leads you to believe that if you could<br>simply get rid of that pesky gun, the violence would somehow stop.<br><br>The phrase leads you to believe that the gun causes the violence.<br><br>*This simply is not true.*<br><br>Guns do not cause violence. Guns are nothing more than tools. They<br>are popular targets to score political points because guns are the only<br>tools available specifically designed to kill. No other tool that can<br>kill was specifically designed to kill (the knife may be an exception,<br>but in its current form, it is far more useful as a non-killing tool<br>than its ancestor). And I'm talking about portable personal weapons; I'm<br>not talking about other tools designed to kill like the electric chair.<br><br>I'm also going to tell you something that you already knew:<br><br>You can stop gun violence by getting rid of guns.<br><br>It's amazing. If you get rid of guns, you won't have gun violence<br>anymore! If you could somehow magically make 300 million guns disappear,<br>there would be no more gun violence!<br><br>However<br><br>You will still have *knife* *violence* and *frying pan*<br>*violence* and *baseball bat* *violence* and *suicide vest*<br>*violence* and *truck bomb* *violence* and *car* *violence* and<br>all manner of other violence that is completely unrelated to guns. The<br>Orlando night club *shooting* would have been the Orlando night club<br>*bombing* if the gun wasn't there (some reports said that Mateen was in<br>fact wearing a suicide vest, but it may very well have been a tac vest<br>that someone didn't recognize). The actual death toll would have been<br>higher if it wasn't for the gun limiting the damage done. You would have<br>had *hundreds* dead instead of 49.<br><br>So the question becomes: which problem do you want to solve? The problem<br>of "gun," or the problem of "violence?"<br><br>It's true, solving the problem of why people are violent towards each<br>other in such high numbers is a *hard problem to solve*. It really is.<br>So why not just start with the gun? Why not just get the "low-hanging<br>fruit" and reduce some violence by getting rid of guns?<br><br>There are several reasons why it makes no sense to get rid of guns.<br><br>1.  Getting rid of guns will not get rid of violence. As I've<br>    already alluded to, even if you were able to magically make 300<br>    million guns vanish, people will still kill people. Every. Single.<br>    Day. Getting rid of guns will solve nothing in terms of stopping<br>    people from acting violently towards each other. Yes, it's a hard<br>    problem, but let's make sure we focus on the real problem.<br>2.  99.9% of gun owners are not violent killers. Taking guns away<br>    from everyone simply disarms lots and lots of honest, law-abiding<br>    citizens. It might stop a handful of gun-related crimes because a<br>    criminal was not able to steal a gun from a law-abiding citizen, but<br>    the vast majority of illegal guns are not stolen. They are straw<br>    purchases or illegal imports. So the criminal element will still<br>    have guns. Now all you've done is created more soft targets for the<br>    crazies to hit. Just like gun-free zones have done, you've created a<br>    place where a looney can go shoot with abandon, knowing he'll not<br>    face any armed resistance from any law-abiding citizens. Look, they<br>    may be looney, they may be wacko, they may have a warped sense of<br>    right and wrong, but they're not stupid. Not by any stretch of the<br>    imagination. They want to kill lots of people. So where do they go?<br>    Places where they can kill the largest number of people before<br>    meeting any armed resistance.\<br>    \<br>    Anyway, disarming the vast law-abiding population doesn't really<br>    affect gun violence at all. There are estimated to be about two<br>    million defensive gun uses each year, and many of them take place<br>    without a single shot being fired. The mere presence of a defensive<br>    weapon will cause many criminals who only want soft targets and no<br>    resistance to turn tail and run. Removing guns from the population<br>    leaves these millions of gun owners defenseless against crime.<br><br>**TL;DR: You're addressing the wrong term. Don't address the gun.<br>Address the violence.**<br><br>(EDIT) The OP apparently thought my answer was disingenuous. In the<br>comments, he/she anonymously stated, "This was a genuine question about<br>reducing the amount of people murdered each year (the vast majorty<br>\sic\ of whom die from a wound inflicted by a gun) in the United<br>States."<br><br>So let's dissect the numbers, shall we?<br><br>Each year, about 33,000 people die from a wound inflicted by a gun.<br>Two-thirds of those are suicides. The OP is concerned only with murders,<br>so let's discount the problem of suicide using a gun. That leaves us<br>with 11,000 people killed by guns. Nearly 8,000 of those remaining are<br>criminals killed by other criminals in the course of some criminal<br>activity (i.e. a drug deal gone bad). But a murder is a murder, so let's<br>include the numbers of criminals killing each other in criminal activity<br>in the "murder" category.<br><br>Here's where that falls on the scale of "preventable" deaths:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-a4c368a28853523532007ffdc1c506e5){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-a4c368a28853523532007ffdc1c506e5"<br>master_w="2000" master_h="1300"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Note that the number used for the graph (33,000) includes suicides<br>involving firearms, and we didn't really want to consider that. If we<br>remove suicide from the mix so we're only looking at murder, it probably<br>falls somewhere below drug abuses in terms of preventable deaths.<br><br>*In other words, murders caused by a gun barely moves the needle.*<br><br>There are far more poignant causes you can rally behind, **especially<br>considering that none of the other preventable causes of death are<br>protected by the Constitution.**<br><br>So why do we fight so hard against guns? Indeed, 11,000 people murdered<br>with guns is a high number, but when I see people using these numbers to<br>advocate either complete or partial firearm bans, I always wonder: What<br>about alcohol? In comparison, the Centers for Disease Control and<br>Prevention<br>[report(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2e4ddc&url=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/alcohol.htm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cdc.gov"}]{.qlink_container} that, as of 2010, over 15,000<br>people die from alcoholic liver disease in our country every year. The<br>number for "alcohol-induced deaths, excluding accidents and homicides"<br>is over 25,000. Why are we arguing so passionately for gun control but<br>ignoring alcohol? Let's also consider that probably half of the gun<br>deaths on that chart probably involved alcohol as a motivating (or<br>exacerbating) factor. So these columns are not mutually exclusive. How<br>many other preventable deaths has alcohol contributed to? How many drunk<br>drivers? How many evenings of unprotected sex leading to STIs? How much<br>drunken drug use?<br><br>The only thing I can think of is that "I like alcohol but I don't like<br>guns."<br><br>If you're going to ban an item, why wouldn't you ban the item that is<br>demonstrably more dangerous, and NOT a Constitutional right? Besides, at<br>least my gun can protect me from a criminal. Your beer can't do that.<br><br>The logic simply does not follow.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
