<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Johnson Amendment should be *clarified*, not *repealed*.<br><br>We should definitely say that you can't spend Federal tax-free dollars<br>on political campaigns. There is a definite conflict of interest there.<br>Thankfully, most churches have never wanted to publish pamphlets about<br>political candidates, and while they have probably wanted to donate<br>money to candidates, this should rightly be prohibited.<br><br>However, allowing pastors to discuss the religious aspects of candidates<br>in a Sunday sermon is *not* a political campaign. Unlawfully denying the<br>1st Amendment rights of pastors is patently unconstitutional.<br><br>There are plenty of tax-exempt organizations (think 501(c)3) which are<br>allowed to make political positions known, and there are no restrictions<br>on them. The Johnson Amendment *only* applies to churches, which makes<br>it a 14th Amendment violation.<br><br>Additionally, controlling speech by leveraging the government's taxing<br>authority unconstitutionally controls the practice of religion. A<br>religious organization cannot freely practice religion because of the<br>government, which is a clear 1st Amendment violation.<br><br>The whole point behind making churches tax-exempt in the first place is<br>that *the power to tax is the power to control*. To avoid even the<br>pretense of a 1st Amendment violation, it's better to not tax churches.<br>However, this tax-exemption doesn't force a church to give up other<br>rights in the Bill of Rights, and your 1st Amendment rights are not "for<br>sale" through tax rules. The tax exemption provided to churches doesn't<br>give the government the right to regulate their speech.<br><br>"If you want to talk about politics, just give up your tax exemption!"<br>What other rights in the Bill of Rights do you think should be<br>contingent on receiving a tax exemption from the government? What other<br>organizations in the country do you keep under the same restriction?<br>Regulate your speech or we'll remove government program X. It's a clear<br>violation of several parts of the 1st Amendment, as well as a violation<br>of the 14th Amendment.<br><br>The Johnson Amendment should be clarified to state that churches cannot<br>contribute tax-exempt money to political candidates, but their 1st<br>Amendment rights cannot be infringed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
