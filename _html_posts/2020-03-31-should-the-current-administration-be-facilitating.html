<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should the current administration be facilitating the espousement of<br>one religion in the US when there are hundreds of others that do not<br>receive equal time, since we are all equal under the constitution?**<br><br>First of all, we are not all equal under the Constitution. Actually, it<br>was a few other documents which discussed the fact that we are equal:<br><br>- the Declaration of Independence states, "We hold these truths to be<br>  self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are<br>  endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among<br>  these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."<br>- the Gettysburg Address stated, "Four score and seven years ago, our<br>  fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in<br>  liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that **all men are created<br>  equal.**"<br><br>Unless you didn't catch the subtlety there, Lincoln and Jefferson both<br>said that we are all created equal, and Jefferson went on to say<br>that we are endowed by our (big C) Creator with unalienable rights.<br>Sounds vaguely religious to me, but whatever.<br><br>As far as the Constitution is concerned, the 14th Amendment states that<br>laws must be applied equally to all people. Besides that, nothing in the<br>Constitution requires the government to treat everyone equally. At least<br>I hope not. The government executed Ted Bundy. I don't want to be<br>treated as equally as he was, and if the government was required to<br>treat everyone equally, they'd have to electrocute everyone in order to<br>treat everyone equally. Be careful what you wish for.<br><br>You're kinda confusing a lot of topics, and one of them is the First<br>Amendment. It simply states that the government cannot create a state<br>religion. Allowing someone to use their free speech rights (also in the<br>First Amendment) does not amount to the government creating a state<br>religion. And there's no requirement for the government to give "equal<br>time" to every religion. The government cannot discriminate because of<br>religion, but there is no equal time requirement either.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
