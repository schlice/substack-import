<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Proving that God exists using logic an philosophy is the correct way to<br>prove God's existence. The proof is not complex at all.<br><br>We start with the fact that we exist. Life is not an illusion. We're<br>not a figment of imagination. We really, actually exist.<br><br>We exist inside of a universe which we have (largely) observed. And we<br>have used the scientific method (observation and repetition) to<br>determine some rules about the universe in which we live, and how it<br>works. We call these "laws." The laws of conservation of energy tell us<br>that you can't get something from nothing. And the law of causality<br>tells us that everything which has a beginning has a cause.<br><br>Yet, in a universe in which the laws of conservation of energy exist,<br>the universe itself was created out of nothing. We know this is true<br>thanks to Einstein's theory of General Relativity, which states that all<br>time, all matter, and all space began at a single point. General<br>Relativity has been proven accurate down to five decimal places.<br><br>So in a universe which is governed by physical laws, *the very existence<br>of this universe violates those laws*. We got something from nothing.<br><br>This means that there must be a *supernatural* (outside of the<br>natural) cause for the universe's existence. We know that the universe<br>had a beginning, and thus a cause. That cause must be outside of the<br>natural, because it existed before the universe did.<br><br>This forms the basis of the Cosmological Argument for God's<br>existence:<br><br>1.  The Law of Causality tells us that everything that has a beginning<br>    has a cause.<br>2.  The universe had a beginning.<br>3.  Therefore, the universe had a cause.<br><br>And since something undeniably exists today, then something must have<br>always existed. The only two choices are the universe, or something<br>which created the universe. And since the universe had a beginning, it<br>must have had a Beginner.<br><br>We also know that there was *intelligence in the design of the universe<br>and of life*. DNA proves that there was intelligence in the design of<br>life, and the myriad of [[anthropic<br>constants](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ad1198&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} proves that there was<br>intelligence in the design of the universe.<br><br>This, by the way, leads us to the Teleological Argument for God's<br>existence:<br><br>1.  Every design had a designer.<br>2.  As verified by the Anthropic Principle, we know *beyond a reasonable<br>    doubt* that the universe was designed.<br>3.  Therefore, the universe had a Designer.<br><br>And if you want to get even more philosophical, try out the **Kalam<br>Argument for why the universe had a beginning:**<br><br>1.  An infinite number of days has no beginning and no end.<br>2.  But today is the end date of history (history being a collection of<br>    all days).<br>3.  Therefore, there were not an infinite number of days before today.<br><br>In other words, time had a beginning, which correlates well with<br>Einstein's findings.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
