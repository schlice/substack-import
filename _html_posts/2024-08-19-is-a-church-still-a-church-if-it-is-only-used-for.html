<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So I guess it comes down to me to answer the *real* question:<br><br>*What, exactly, is a church?*<br><br>A church is a group of people. It's not a place. It's not a<br>building.<br><br>But people commonly confuse the church building with the church. These<br>days, however, churches don't look like old traditional church buildings<br>did.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Economics.<br><br>If I build a church building like this:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-62fe2ce18f407113a22bfc6b194ed284){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-62fe2ce18f407113a22bfc6b194ed284" master_w="488"<br>master_h="306"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>There's pretty much only one thing I can use it for. If I sell this<br>building after the church closes (or, God-willing, relocates to a bigger<br>facility), I can't really re-use that building for much else. I have a<br>pretty limited pool of buyers for that building. Or it would take a lot<br>of money to modify that building to repurpose it, and my selling price<br>would be lower because of that.<br><br>But if I build a church building like *this*:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-ad4e94f8ff2ad33b3140637702cfa723){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-ad4e94f8ff2ad33b3140637702cfa723" master_w="516"<br>master_h="306"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(the entrance to my last church,* [[*The Grove Bible<br>Chapel*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=081670&url=https://thegrovebiblechapel.org/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="thegrovebiblechapel.org"}]{.qlink_container} *in Winter<br>Garden, FL)*<br><br>...and they wish to sell the building to relocate to a larger facility,<br>they are going to have a *much easier* time selling the building,<br>because it will require minimal remodeling in order to make it useful<br>for another purpose. The buyer pool will be *much larger* for The<br>Grove's building than it will for the generic church pictured above.<br><br>But it makes a valid point: the church building is just a building. The<br>owners can use it for whatever they want when services are not ongoing.<br>That said, casinos and brothels (in Nevada) must have special licensing,<br>and it's unlikely that the church would rent out the building for such<br>uses anyway, let alone that you likely cannot rent a building to host a<br>casino or a brothel. Zoning laws probably don't permit that.<br><br>\<br><br>To that point, sometimes a church has a need to reach a community before<br>that church has enough money raised to build their own building. So they<br>will often rent out other facilities so that they can have a place to<br>hold Sunday services.<br><br>And what government buildings are large enough to hold lots of people,<br>and are free on Sundays? That's right, *schools*.<br><br>Many churches rent out school buildings on the weekends to hold their<br>Sunday services. They use the classrooms for Sunday School or for<br>nursery, they use the library for meeting space, and they use the<br>auditorium for services. Churches operating like this will have all of<br>their church equipment in trailers, they will have volunteer setup crews<br>set up the church on Saturday afternoon/evening, hold services on<br>Sunday, and then break down Sunday afternoon/evening.<br><br>So in that instance, the services are held on Sunday, and the building<br>functions as a school Monday through Friday.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
