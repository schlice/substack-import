<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can I cut my neighbor\'s tree limb without their consent? The branch<br>runs into the master bedroom window on the 2nd floor, and I am afraid of<br>small rodents getting access to my roof. I\'ve asked them for two years<br>to do something about it.**<br><br>You will have to check your local ordinances, but in most cases, the<br>other property owner is committing a tort trespass by allowing his tree<br>to grow on to your property (which you own up to 500 feet over your<br>property (in most places), where the FAA takes over).<br><br>In most places, you can cut any tree that is extending into your<br>property. Of course, it's best to get the homeowner's permission before<br>you do that, but if you can't (or they won't give permission), you<br>should be able to safely cut any of the tree extending on to your<br>property. Make sure you take before/after pictures of the tree so that<br>you can document exactly what you removed and that you are not harming<br>the tree by doing so.<br><br>If you really want to be a stickler about it, you can hire a<br>professional arborist to do the work, and then bill the homeowner for<br>the amount due. If he doesn't pay, you can take him to small claims<br>court to recoup your investment.<br><br>Ideally, according to most extension offices, the best time to trim a<br>tree is late winter, when fungi and diseases are at their lowest<br>activity level. The only difference is for spring-blooming trees; trim<br>those immediately after they bloom. For all others, prune in late<br>winter, while the trees are fully dormant.\[1\](#ljfbJ){#cite-ljfbJ<br>.citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ljfbJ){.citation_index} [[When to Trim Trees and Shrubs \|<br>Today\'s<br>Homeowner](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e0df0d&url=https://www.todayshomeowner.com/when-to-trim-trees-and-shrubs/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="todayshomeowner.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
