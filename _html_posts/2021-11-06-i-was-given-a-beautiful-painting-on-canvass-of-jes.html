This is because any image of God or Jesus<br>necessarily *constrains* them to that image, and they are so much more<br>powerful and awesome than can ever be captured in an image.<br><br>Images might be useful to guide our prayer, but they are very easy to<br>abuse as they end up becoming the *focus* of the prayer instead of a<br>*conduit* for prayer.<br><br>Don't pray to the picture.
