<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It shouldn't be. It is simply a statement of fact.<br><br>If you believe it is contentious, then you are taking exception to it. I<br>was once Catholic but am no longer so. Clearly (and in my opinion,<br>obviously), I believe that my current set of religious practices is<br>*better* than what I was experiencing as a Catholic. That should be<br>fairly obvious and not surprising.<br><br>Perhaps you believe that Catholicism is the one true religion. That's<br>okay. You're welcome to your beliefs. But I have come to believe that<br>certain church practices (transubstantiation, sprinkle baptism,<br>adoration, etc) are unbiblical, so I left the church.<br><br>It's pretty much that simple.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
