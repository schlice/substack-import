<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Yes, you will have to root your phone and apply one of the<br>hacks that enables the call recording functions. If you are not<br>comfortable doing this, don\'t. I don\'t want you to damage your phone.<br>But if you are comfortable rooting your phone and applying changes that<br>require root, that is how you enable call recording.\<br>\<br>I need to say this again: the only way to enable call recording is to<br>root your phone and install additional software that uses the root<br>functionality of your phone to bypass certain protections put in place<br>by your carrier\'s software. If you are not comfortable doing this, I<br>would try to find another way. Perhaps you can use your speakerphone<br>whilst sitting at your computer, and you could use your computer\'s mic<br>to record the call.\<br>\<br>If you want to set your mobile up for call recording, look for Xposed<br>Additions in the Google Play store. This requires the Xposed Framework,<br>which is not available in the Play Store; you must download it directly<br>from xda-developers online. Search Google for Xposed Framework. Before<br>you can use Xposed, your phone has to be rooted.\<br>\<br>Once you install Xposed Additions, you can enable call recording, along<br>with many other great tweaks.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-is-call-recording-in-Moto-G-unsupported/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
