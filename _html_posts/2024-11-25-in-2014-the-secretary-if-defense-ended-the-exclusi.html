<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Simple. No new women will be assigned to those frontline combat units.<br>The women currently in those positions will serve out their time and<br>rotate out, and will not be replaced by women.<br><br>However, if Hegseth was smart, instead of closing the door altogether to<br>women in frontline combat roles, he'd make the military adopt uniform<br>physical standards for all frontline combat roles, not just for<br>specialized units. While there currently are physical standards in the<br>military services, they are separate standards for men and women.<br><br>Frontline combat roles should have ONE uniform physical standard<br>for everyone, men and women included. Speciaized units already have<br>this. In the Army, Ranger school has one standard. The Special Forces<br>Qualification Course (SFQC) is one standard. In the Navy, BUD/S has one<br>standard. Women are welcome (and are even encouraged) to apply. There is<br>a female liaison officer attached to BUD/S to specifically serve women<br>applicants, but to date, no woman has ever successfully completed BUD/S.<br>And while only 143 women have ever completed the Ranger Assessment and<br>Selection Program, or RASP, and wear the Ranger tab, most are not<br>serving in deployed Ranger units. A few have been deployed during the<br>Global War on Terror (GWOT). In 2020, a woman passed SFQC and likely<br>served in ODA (Operational Detachment-Alpha). Women do successfully<br>serve in frontline combat roles when they can pass the physical<br>qualifications.<br><br>Frontline combat roles should be treated exactly the same way we treat<br>our specialized units.<br><br>Women are not the problem. Standards are.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
