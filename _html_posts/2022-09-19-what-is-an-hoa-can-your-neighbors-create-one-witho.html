<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What is an HOA?<br><br>An HOA is a "Homeowner's Association." It is a not-for-profit<br>corporation (IRS section 501(c)(4)) which manages a common interest<br>company. The mission statement of the company generally includes keeping<br>home values high by controlling the exterior appearance of the homes<br>under its purview.<br><br>There are two types of HOAs: mandatory and voluntary.<br><br>Mandatory HOAs are created before the houses are first sold, and are<br>included as part of the deed to the property. When you purchase the<br>property, you agree to abide by the rules of the HOA that is already in<br>place. You cannot "opt out" of a mandatory HOA. They control the<br>exterior of your home, and can tell you whether or not you can or can't<br>make certain changes to your home. They can also fine you, place a lien<br>on your home if you don't pay, and foreclose on that lien to get their<br>money.<br><br>Voluntary HOAs run much the same way as mandatory HOAs. They are also<br>not-for-profit corporations which help to pay for some neighborhood<br>amenities, but they are, as the name implies, voluntary. They don't<br>control the outside of your house; they rely on whatever local<br>government zoning is in place (and they help you stay in compliance with<br>them, even though they don't provide the local control). They may also<br>offer voluntary benefits, like club memberships.<br><br>Can your neighbors create one without the board of directors?<br><br>Since an HOA is a 501(c)(4) not-for-profit corporation, it has to<br>conform with all of the requirements of having a corporation, such as<br>appointing a Board of Directors.<br><br>But even if your neighbors *create* one, it would only be voluntary.<br>Mandatory HOAs can only be implemented before any of the houses are<br>sold.<br><br>You can convert a voluntary HOA to a mandatory HOA, but you must have<br>permission of 100% of the homeowners. Even one dissenting homeowner<br>would mean that you can't create a mandatory HOA in that community.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
