Why are they<br>not usefully deployed across the country at all times?**<br><br>The Posse Comitatus Act makes it illegal for the military to be used to<br>execute the law unless specifically authorized by the Constitution or by<br>an act of Congress. And since we can't even get Congress to agree to an<br>aid package to assist with COVID-19, I find it hard to believe we'd get<br>Congress to agree to deploy the military to do anything.<br><br>But it can be done. Generally speaking, the military can assist with<br>things not specifically related to executing the law. They can provide<br>second-level assistance, while leaving the front lines to the local<br>police. A state governor can appeal to the Department of Defense and<br>request assistance.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
