<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do Protestant priests bless people like a Catholic Priest will?<br><br>First of all, Protestants in general do not have "priests." They follow<br>the Bible much more closely in this regard, and they have positions as<br>you'd find in 1 Timothy, such as "elders" and "deacons." Deacons in<br>Protestant churches would be closer to Pastors today. Catholics have the<br>Magisterium, which includes priests, bishops, cardinals, and the Pope.<br><br>Anyway, more accurately asked, do Protestant pastors bless people?<br><br>Kinda.<br><br>Protestant pastors follow the traditions in the Bible and will perform<br>the "[[laying on of<br>hands](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6fb1a7&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_laying_on_of_hands){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}" (Acts 6:5--6) in order<br>to bless people who are leaving on missions, or who are undertaking some<br>other spiritual calling. The laying on of hands also tends to be a more<br>community-oriented function; Protestants tend to do this as a community<br>rather than by themselves.<br><br>They certainly don't bless people with the regularity that Catholic<br>priests would bless people.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
