<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Trump seems to want to use money ear marked for an emergency to build<br>the wall. Can this be voted down by the Senate?**<br><br>There is no money "earmarked for an emergency." If there were, it would<br>actually be easier for him to use that money. He declares a national<br>emergency (which he is well within his authority as President to do),<br>and the money becomes available.<br><br>The way this works is that in many of our Federal laws are these little<br>inbuilt "short-circuits" that allow the president to do certain things<br>that would normally have to go through Congressional approval during a<br>time of declared war or declared national emergency. Clearly, declared<br>war is out, as declarations of war can only be made by Congress. But the<br>president can declare a national emergency, and it's solely his job to<br>do so. [[It's been done many<br>times](https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-U-S-president-simply-declare-there-will-be-an-emergency-some-number-of-days-in-the-future-specifically-pending-the-outcome-of-a-funding-measure/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container},<br>probably more often than you know. It's governed by the National<br>Emergencies Act. The law outlines what the president needs to do in<br>order to declare a national emergency.<br><br>Once the national emergency is declared, all of these Federal laws with<br>their little inbuilt short-circuits become available. For instance, 10<br>USC § 2808 has the following in it (*emphasis* added):<br><br>> \I<br> the event of a declaration of war *or the declaration by the<br>> President of a national emergency* in accordance with the National<br>> Emergencies Act (50 USC § 1601 et seq.) *that requires use of the<br>> armed forces*, the Secretary of Defense, without regard to any other<br>> provision of law, may undertake military construction projects, and<br>> may authorize the Secretaries of the military departments to undertake<br>> military construction projects, not otherwise authorized by law *that<br>> are necessary to support such use of the armed forces.* Such projects<br>> may be undertaken *only within the total amount of funds that have<br>> been appropriated for military construction*, including funds<br>> appropriated for family housing, that have not been obligated.<br><br>Now, if you read this carefully, you'll see that this applies when the<br>president declares a national emergency, and that emergency involves the<br>use of the military. The construction projects must support the mission<br>that the military is undertaking.<br><br>To that end, we have military stationed at the border, and we are<br>sending more. DHS has been requesting additional troops since January.<br>DHS needs the help doing things like installing more concertina wire.<br><br>Therefore, the military deployment, and their mission, could be laying<br>the groundwork for a legal basis to invoke 10 USC § 2808(a) to release<br>funds to construct a more permanent barrier like the one they're already<br>constructing.<br><br>To your question, this is outside of Congress' hands. Why? **Congress<br>already gave the President the authority to do this when they wrote the<br>law with a provision for national emergency**. Legally, if the President<br>meets the burden of evidence required by the law, he is well within his<br>right to declare a national emergency and then use DoD funds to secure<br>the border.<br><br>There are several reasons he can cite to declare a national emergency.<br>It's hard to make the case that illegal immigration constitutes a<br>national emergency, but that's not the only crisis which could easily<br>constitute a national emergency at the southern border. The most obvious<br>other crisis is the counterdrug effort.<br><br>[[10 U.S.C. §<br>284](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1dce3e&url=http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req%3D(title:10%2520section:284%2520edition:prelim)%2520OR%2520(granuleid:USC-prelim-title10-section284)%26f%3Dtreesort%26edition%3Dprelim%26num%3D0%26jumpTo%3Dtrue){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="house.gov"}]{.qlink_container} authorizes the Secretary of<br>Defense to "provide support for the counterdrug activities or activities<br>to counter transnational organized crime of any other department or<br>agency of the Federal Government or of any State, local, tribal, or<br>foreign law enforcement agency" for the purposes set forth in the<br>section if requested by another Federal agency or State, local, or<br>tribal governments in support of law enforcement efforts. We in NORAD<br>have been using this provision to assist the counterdrug mission for<br>decades. We have been using our southern resources (downward-looking<br>RADAR, incerceptor aircraft, etc) to assist the DEA in their drug<br>interdiction role.<br><br>The things the military is authorized to do under 10 USC § 284 include,<br>among other things, "\c\onstruction of roads and *fences* and<br>installation of lighting to block drug smuggling corridors across<br>international boundaries of the United States," as well as the "\t\he<br>establishment (including an unspecified minor military construction<br>project) and operation of bases of operations or training facilities for<br>the purpose of facilitating counterdrug activities or activities to<br>counter transnational organized crime of the Department of Defense or<br>any Federal, State, local, or tribal law enforcement agency within or<br>outside the United States" (emphasis added).<br><br>You will note that the President has been backing off of using the word<br>"wall" and has instead started (seemingly begrudgingly) calling it a<br>"border barrier" or a "fence" or "whatever you'd like to call it" (his<br>words, not mine). But again, is he being obsequious, or is he actually<br>laying the groundwork of being able to call this wall a "border fence"<br>and thus be able to fund it under the counterdrug mission included in 10<br>USC § 284?<br><br>We shall soon see.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
