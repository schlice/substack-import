<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Dell privatized the company a few years ago. Removing themselves from<br>the public trading market does several things. First, it allows them to<br>not have to do things like quarterly reporting of revenues, which tends<br>to scare off investors when markets fluctuate. It also allows your<br>business to be more agile, as you have fewer layers of approvals to go<br>through in order to make significant business decisions. A Board of<br>Directors which is beholden to the shareholders requires much more time<br>and effort to \"make the elephant dance.\" Privatizing allows you to<br>focus more on structuring the business the way you want it to be,<br>without having to be constantly worried about hitting earnings targets.<br><br>It\'s no secret that Dell wanted to get out of the flagging PC business.<br>Tablets by Microsoft and Apple are giving PCs a run for their money.<br>Dell has long desired to increase their footprint in the enterprise<br>space. A privatization move allowed them to make the necessary changes<br>to advance that goal.<br><br>#IWork4Dell<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
