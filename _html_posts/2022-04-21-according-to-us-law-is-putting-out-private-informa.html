There<br>are two Federal laws which might address it, but they are old and were<br>never intended to address this issue.<br><br>States are coming up to speed with laws against doxing, and victims<br>would be best served by looking to their state to address it:<br><br>> Much of the conduct that is considered "doxing" may fall under<br>> multiple state laws relating to **cyber stalking, stalking,<br>> harassment, threats, or extortion** (e.g., threatening to make<br>> information public if money is not paid). A doxer can also be charged<br>> if he illegally obtained the data about his victim, such as from<br>> protected government databases.\[1\](#AGyVn){#cite-AGyVn<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>According to US law, is putting out private information about someone as<br>a way of retaliation considered illegal?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-AGyVn){.citation_index} [[Fact or Fiction: Doxing Someone<br>Can Get You Arrested. \| The Reeves Law<br>Group](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b03097&url=https://www.robertreeveslaw.com/blog/doxing-arrested/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="robertreeveslaw.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
