<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>To expound on the legal side of your question, you're trying to sue for<br>"false advertising." The legal definition of false advertising is when a<br>seller uses "confusing, misleading, or blatantly untrue statements when<br>promoting a product."<br><br>When the difference is *cosmetic* (as [[Cody<br>Dostal](https://www.quora.com/profile/Cody-Dostal)]{.qlink_container}<br>showed in his answer), this does not rise to the level of "confusing,<br>misleading, or blatantly untrue." You received a product which consisted<br>of exactly the same ingredients, in the same proportions, as the one<br>pictured in the ad. That does not constitute "false advertising."<br><br>Your case would be dismissed because you didn't meet the legal criteria<br>to establish that the respondent had committed false advertising.<br><br>You also haven't shown any damages that were done because your burger<br>didn't look like the one in the picture. You haven't suffered any<br>articulable damage, so your award would be nothing more than the cost of<br>the burger, even if you did win.<br><br>Then, you'd still have to pay McDonald's legal fees, which would be far<br>in excess of what you were awarded, because you didn't give the<br>restaurant a chance to correct their error.<br><br>So the whole exercise would do nothing more than cost you a lot of<br>money.<br><br>Ask them to make a burger that more closely resembles the one they<br>picture, or ask them to give you your money back. Don't waste your time<br>and money trying to sue them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
