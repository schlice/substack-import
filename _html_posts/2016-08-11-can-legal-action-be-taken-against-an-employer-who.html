<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>In the US, there is no standard for a "minimum" amount of time an<br>employer is required to pay an hourly employee who reports to work but<br>then is told to leave. There are state standards for minimum work time<br>for hourly employees, but they vary by state. For example, some states<br>like California say that if you are an hourly worker who comes in<br>expecting to work eight hours and you work less than half of the usual<br>time (or the scheduled time), the employer is required to pay half of<br>the usual hours. California calls this "reporting time."<br><br>There are some instances in which the employer doesn't have to pay<br>reporting time:<br><br>1.  When the employer\'s operations cannot begin or continue due to<br>    threats to employees or property, or when civil authorities<br>    recommend that work not begin or continue.<br>2.  When public utilities fail to supply electricity, water, or gas, or<br>    there is a failure in the public utilities, or sewer system.<br>3.  When the interruption of work is caused by an Act of God or other<br>    cause not within the employer\'s control, for example, an<br>    earthquake.<br>4.  If the employee is not fit to work.<br>5.  If the employee has not reported to work on time and is fired or<br>    sent home as a disciplinary action.<br>6.  If an unexpected or unusual occurrence during off hours makes it<br>    impossible for the employer to open for business and the employer<br>    has made every reasonable effort to notify employees not to report<br>    for work.<br><br>Call your local Office of Labor Standards in your state, or you can also<br>call the [[Wage and Hour<br>division](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7f4ee4&url=https://www.dol.gov/whd/america2.htm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="dol.gov"}]{.qlink_container} of the US Department of Labor.<br><br>Failing that, hiring a good labor attorney would be a great thing to do.<br><br>In the meantime, use your down time to find another job. When they ask<br>you why you want to leave your old job, it's easy enough to tell them<br>you're not getting enough hours at your old job.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
