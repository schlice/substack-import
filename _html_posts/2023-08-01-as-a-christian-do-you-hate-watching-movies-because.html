<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not exactly.<br><br>As a Christian, I hate watching movies because the values of the people<br>who are portrayed in the movie are *so different from me.*<br><br>I see how they live, and I know that they live by the desires of their<br>flesh. They love their lives. They love the life they live, and the<br>Bible talks about this.<br><br>You often hear the kitchy phrase, "Love the sinner, hate the sin."<br>That's not directly out of the Bible, but it is referenced in a<br>roundabout way. We hate sin by recognizing it for what it is, refusing<br>to take part in it, and condemning it as contrary to God's nature. Sin<br>is to be hated, not excused or taken lightly. We love sinners by showing<br>them respect (1 Peter 2:17), praying for them (1 Timothy 2:1), and<br>witnessing to them of Christ.<br><br>It is a true act of love to treat someone with respect and kindness even<br>though you do not approve of his or her lifestyle or sinful choices, and<br>this is something that Christians have great difficulty with. It is not<br>loving to allow a person to remain stuck in sin. It is not hateful to<br>tell a person he or she is in sin. In fact, the exact opposites are<br>true. Sin leads to death (James 1:15), and we love the sinner by<br>speaking the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15). We hate the sin by refusing<br>to condone, ignore, or excuse it.<br><br>So if I'm itching to live that life that I see on the screen, then I<br>wish to live in sin. If I desire to live in sin, I am not saved. I'd<br>have some serious work to do before I'd be comfortable calling myself<br>Christian.<br><br>So if you call yourself Christian and you find yourself envious of the<br>people you see around you, you also have some work to do, as we all do,<br>as we are indeed all sinners. We need to recognize the fact that we are<br>living in sin and only faith in Christ can save us.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
