<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What do you think about the Gold Star Families who, because of Pres.<br>TRUMPS income tax OVERHAUL, are PAYING ALMOST 4 TIMES the amount of<br>income tax in 2018 as they did in 2017?**<br><br>It's the unintended consequence of trying to make the rich pay their<br>fair share, something you should be all for.<br><br>Here's the context you left out (I also added it to the question for<br>you):<br><br>[[Tax overhaul raises taxes for some Gold Star families on survivor<br>benefits](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=49db8a&url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/24/politics/gold-star-families-higher-taxes/index.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cnn.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>[User-12209089141318703872(https://www.quora.com/profile/User-12209089141318703872)]{.qlink_container}<br>is spot on: the problem is happening to Gold Star families who receive<br>benefits from both the VA and the DoD. Legally, you can't receive both<br>at the same time. What some Gold Star families would do is assign their<br>DoD benefits directly to their children while they are minors (called<br>the "child option") so that they can continue to receive full benefits<br>from both the DoD and the VA.<br><br>The new tax laws create a "kiddie tax" which taxes unearned income for<br>children at a higher rate, up to 37%. This was done because some wealthy<br>families were hiding money in their children\'s names. It is supposed to<br>be a trust or estate tax, not a tax on death benefits received from the<br>government, but it seems that children of Gold Star families were<br>inadvertently swept up in the tax law, forced to pay the 37% rate, as<br>well as back taxes.<br><br>To be clear, it was not designed to impact Gold Star families. This<br>was an unintended consequence, and the government is working to rectify<br>this situation for Gold Star families.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
