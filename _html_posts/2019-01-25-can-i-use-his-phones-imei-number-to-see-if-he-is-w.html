<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can I use his phones IMEI number to see if he is where is says he is?<br>That way I am not crossing a line. I don\'t want him to know I am<br>checking on him. I just need the truth and I\'m not sure he will tell<br>me.**<br><br>Unless you are a law enforcement agency with a warrant, no. You cannot<br>get cell data from the cellular provider unless you have a warrant.<br><br>By checking on his location without his permission, you are already<br>trying to cross a line. No amount of equivocating will make this<br>anything other than crossing a line. Sorry to disappoint you, but it is.<br><br>But the bigger issue, of course, is that if you feel like you need to<br>check up on him, and you don't feel like you can talk to him about it,<br>what you are really facing is a trust issue.<br><br>But who has the trust issue? Him or you?<br><br>The only thing you can do in this case is ask him. Give him the<br>opportunity to do the right thing and tell you the truth. At least<br>you've put the ball in his court and given him a chance.<br><br>If you don't ask him, or you don't want to give him the opportunity to<br>lie (however you choose to see it), you should really think about<br>breaking up. It's not fair to either of you. Without trust, your<br>relationship is not long for this world.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
