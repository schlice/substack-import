<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**As a former Muslim, can I be a Christian without believing in the<br>Trinity? I want to worship God and worship/ venerate Jesus as the Son of<br>God, but not as God.**<br><br>It sounds like you're asking for the definition of Christianity when you<br>ask whether or not you can only believe parts of it.<br><br>Christians get their beliefs from the Bible, which is believed to be the<br>inspired word of God. Clearly, God did not write the Bible, but we<br>believe that the people who did had divine inspiration to write.<br><br>The Bible tells us who Jesus is. There are various passages that tell us<br>that Jesus is God.<br><br>- John 8:24, "Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins;<br>  for unless you believe that I AM, you will die in your sins."<br>- Colossians 2:9, "For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily<br>  form,"<br>- Titus 2:13, "looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the<br>  glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus,"<br>- John 1:1-3, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,<br>  and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things<br>  came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into<br>  being that has come into being."<br>- 2 Peter 1:1, "To those who have received a faith of the same kind as<br>  ours, by the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ."<br><br>But probably one of the most telling passages is Paul's letter to the<br>Romans:<br><br>> However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the<br>> Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of<br>> Christ, he does not belong to Him. If Christ is in you, though the<br>> body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is alive because of<br>> righteousness. But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead<br>> dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give<br>> life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you ---<br>> Romans 8:9--11<br><br>Paul interchangeably calls the Holy Spirit the "Spirit of Christ" and<br>the "Spirit of God" in just this one group of verses. This would not<br>make sense unless Jesus was God. We wouldn't say the "Spirit of God" and<br>the "Spirit of that really important human teacher." The passage equates<br>the Spirit of God with the Spirit of Christ.<br><br>But this passage also distinguishes the Holy Spirit from God when he<br>says that not only is the Holy Spirit the "Spirit of God," but he is<br>also the Spirit of "Him who raised Christ from the dead." Thus, the<br>Father and the Son are distinguished from one another. Christ and He who<br>raised Christ from the dead are distinct and interactive persons in this<br>context. Thus, we are not talking about three unique, totally separate<br>individuals. We're also not talking about one person who sometimes acts<br>as Father, sometimes as Son, and other times as Spirit. We are talking<br>about one God who is Father, Son, and Spirit all at once and<br>interactively. One God, three persons.<br><br>Christian orthodoxy is determined by who you believe Jesus to be.<br>Christians believe Jesus is one of three persons in the Trinity, all at<br>once, one God, in three distinct persons.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
