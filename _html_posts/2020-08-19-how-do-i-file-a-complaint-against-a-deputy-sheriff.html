<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How do I file a complaint against a deputy sheriff?<br><br>It's easy. Just visit the Sheriff's Office.<br><br>You will have to swear to your statement. This means you will have to<br>sit in an interview room, fill out your complaint, show proof of<br>identity, and then swear that your statement is true to the best of your<br>knowledge, and acknowledge that you can be prosecuted for knowingly<br>giving a false statement to the police. Just be aware you must do this.<br><br>You must also be aware that there are always three sides to every story:<br>your side, his side, and the truth, which is usually somewhere between<br>the two sides. The truth is most generally not in anyone's story because<br>reality is colored by our view of it, which includes our biases as well<br>as physiological issues which cause us to remember things differently<br>than they happened. Therefore, while you may issue a complaint, the<br>results of that complaint are up to the department to address. Perhaps<br>the deputy will be counseled. Perhaps he will need to attend additional<br>training. Or, if there is a group of people who have gone though the<br>effort to file a complaint, perhaps the deputy will be officially<br>reprimanded, or maybe investigated. But not always. You must accept that<br>the best you can do is to file a complaint, unless you plan on retaining<br>an attorney and suing the department because you believe the deputy<br>violated your rights or the law.<br><br>(EDIT) Didn't think I needed to add this to this answer, but clearly the<br>trolls are out tonight...<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being<br>isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I<br>wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is<br>un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m<br>wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,<br>not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,<br>you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.<br>Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be<br>followed by a block and a mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this<br>immediately and with no compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
