<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [First of all, let me say that I\'m sorry that you have to<br>think about this in this way in this day and age. Some day, humanity<br>will look back on this period of time and scratch their heads in<br>wonderment at discrimination. Secondly, your worries are based on the<br>fact that you are different races, and not anything else. I don\'t want<br>to minimize your fear, but I don\'t think it\'s really justified.\<br>\<br>Rape is nothing more than sex that is not consensual (minors can\'t<br>consent, so that\'s why statutory rape is also sex that is not<br>consensual). Consensual comes from the word \"consensus,\" which means<br>agreement between all parties. As long as your sex is consensual,<br>you\'re good.\<br>\<br>There are some practical things you can do to avoid even the possibility<br>of sex that is not consensual:\<br>]<br><br>- Avoid drunk sex. If you\'re drinking, you have diminished capacity to<br>  consent. So anything that might diminish her (or your) capacity to<br>  consent should be avoided.<br>- Try to get verbal consent before you start. The \"yes means yes\"<br>  movement on college campuses is seeking to change the burden of proof<br>  from the accuser to the accused. Under the law, however, you are still<br>  innocent until proven guilty, and in most states, the guy has to use<br>  force or threat of force, or the girl has to be completely<br>  incapacitated in order for it to be rape. That doesn\'t make the<br>  concept behind \"yes means yes\" bad. Affirmative consent (not just<br>  the absence of \"no\") is a positive step in protecting yourself. And<br>  it doesn\'t need to be anything more than \"Is this okay?\" \"Yes.\"<br>  That\'s it. That\'s positive consent.<br><br>\<br><br>[https://youtu.be/h99w08UHv60(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=64a880&url=https://youtu.be/h99w08UHv60){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\<br>\<br>Yeah, the video is totally cheesy. But you get the idea.\<br>\<br>Could she totally lie and accuse you of rape, accuse you of never<br>seeking consent, in the exact opposite manner in which it actually<br>happened? I suppose she could. But unlike college campuses, real world<br>rape, in a court of law, still has to be proven: Did she try to resist?<br>Are there defensive wounds? Did anyone else hear it? What did she do<br>afterwards? Did she call the police? Did she visit the hospital? Did she<br>talk to a girlfriend? Did anyone see bruising? Is there any physical<br>evidence at all? Were they dating (not to minimize date rape, but it<br>plays into whether or not there may have actually been consent)?\<br>\<br>Again, it\'s sad that you have to think this way. But the realities of<br>modern life in the United States always have to be kept in mind.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
