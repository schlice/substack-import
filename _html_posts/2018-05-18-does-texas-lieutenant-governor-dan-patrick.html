<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick\'s idea about reducing the<br>number of entrances and exits in schools to prevent school shootings<br>have merit?**<br><br>He may have misspoken slightly, but he's absolutely right. We need to<br>limit the number of entrances into schools, and we need to limit the use<br>of all of the other doors. All of them. Make one teacher entrance<br>controlled by key fob or entry card. Other than that, all other<br>entrances are secured.<br><br>How many entrances and exits are there to the county courthouse (which<br>he also mentioned)?<br><br>There's one entrance you can use. The rest are there, but you can't use<br>them.<br><br>Of course, there are other exits, but have you ever heard of a **fire<br>door**?<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-6a54f78024f9d8985655582b3db024fa){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-6a54f78024f9d8985655582b3db024fa"<br>master_w="2592" master_h="1750"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Turn all other doors except for the main entrance and the secured<br>teacher entrance into alarmed fire doors.
