<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because you cannot prove that your life is at risk because someone else<br>chooses to not protect themselves with a vaccine. Your hyperbole does<br>not follow the science.<br><br>Since you can be fully vaccinated and still contract COVID-19, as well<br>as pass COVID-19 on to other people, then their vaccination status<br>should mean nothing to anyone but them.<br><br>In other words, the only people who have to fear the unvaccinated are<br>the unvaccinated.<br><br>If they are unvaccinated and they contract COVID-19, they have greater<br>potential to end up with a worse disease course and worse outcomes than<br>those who are vaccinated. But the people who are vaccinated can put you<br>at risk just as the people who are unvaccinated can.<br><br>Additionally, Omicron changes the entire discussion. Omicron hits<br>everyone, regardless of vaccination status. But Omicron in general<br>does not produce bad outcomes. It produces general flu-like symptoms,<br>and burns out quickly. Both vaccinated and unvaccinated alike can be hit<br>by Omicron, but it is killing very few people at all. The people dying<br>with Omicron had comorbidities, and they are dying because Omicron<br>exacerbated their other illness.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>My life is at stake because of anti-vaxxers. Why aren't they forced to<br>take vaccine with harsh force?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
