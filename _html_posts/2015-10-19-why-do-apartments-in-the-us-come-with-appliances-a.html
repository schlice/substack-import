<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Cost.\<br>\<br>It is much cheaper for an apartment complex to build out all of its<br>units already appointed with appliances and lights, or in industry<br>terms, \"move-in ready.\" The complex buys these items in bulk, which<br>saves money. Installers\' time is not cheap either. Electricians would<br>have to be hired every time someone moved in or out.\<br>\<br>Some apartments in the US can be rented fully-furnished (with furniture<br>like couches and beds), but under most normal circumstances, apartments<br>do not come with furniture.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
