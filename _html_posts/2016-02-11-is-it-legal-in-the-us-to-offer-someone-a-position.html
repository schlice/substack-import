<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer, of course, is \"it depends.\"<br><br>Health insurance coverage was most recently affected by the<br>Affordable Care Act (ACA). Employers were required to comply with the<br>Employer Shared Responsibility (ESR) provisions of ACA by 2016 if they<br>have 50-99 full time employees or FTEs (full-time equivalents), or by<br>2015 if they have 100 or more full time or FTE employees.<br><br>To determine whether or not you qualify for coverage, and when you get<br>it, you must determine what category of worker you are:<br><br>- full-time employee (or FTE)<br>- variable-hour employee<br>- seasonal employee<br><br>If you are a full time employee or FTE, which means that at the time<br>that you start working for the company, you are expected to work 30<br>hours a week or more (or 130 hours per month) the employer must offer<br>health benefits starting on the first day of the fourth month.<br>Essentially, this means that for all regular employees, there is a<br>90-day grace period at the beginning of your employment where the<br>employer (of appropriate size) is not mandated to provide health<br>coverage. But starting the first day of the fourth month of employment,<br>you must be covered.<br><br>Note that this only applies to health insurance, and it only applies if<br>you know that the employee will be working more than 30 hours per week.<br>If the employee is a variable-hour employee and you do not know whether<br>or not they will work 30 hours per week at the time they start working<br>(a variable-hour employee), or they are a seasonal employee who you also<br>do not know whether or not they will be working 30 hours per week,<br>coverage does not have to be offered on the first day of the fourth<br>month. There is a completely separate computation for such employees,<br>and health coverage may not start until 13 or 14 months into employment.<br><br>Other benefits (i.e. 401(k) participation, vacation accrual, stock<br>purchase plan, etc) are not covered under the law, and are all<br>considered part of an employee\'s \"total compensation\" which is<br>negotiated between employer and employee as a condition of hire.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
