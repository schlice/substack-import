<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you're talking about legal consequences, performing an action that<br>unintentionally causes the death of another person is generally<br>classified as involuntary manslaughter. This occurs when a person\'s<br>reckless or negligent actions lead to a death, but there was no intent<br>to cause harm or kill.<br><br>The crime of involuntary manslaughter generally turns on the idea that<br>the person was doing something *recklessly*. Recklessness in this<br>context means that the person was doing something without considering<br>the safety of others. This is normally measured using the "reasonable<br>person" test: they failed to exercise the level of care that a<br>reasonable person would have in the same situation.<br><br>This level of recklessness is what we call "criminal negligence." This<br>is a key element in involuntary manslaughter cases. It means the actions<br>fell far below what a reasonable person would do in the same situation,<br>and this failure to act reasonably resulted in the death.<br><br>In some jurisdictions, there is a distinction made between **involuntary<br>manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide.** Involuntary<br>manslaughter generally requires a greater degree of recklessness than<br>criminally negligent homicide. So for example, if a person doesn't<br>properly secure a dangerous area, and someone enters that area and dies,<br>this would be an example of criminally negligent homicide.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
