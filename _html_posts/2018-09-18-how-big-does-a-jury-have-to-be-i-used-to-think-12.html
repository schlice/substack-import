I used to think 12, but then served on<br>a jury with less people.**<br><br>You're not the first person to ask that question. The answer is *as big<br>as the state thinks it should be, but not fewer than six.*<br><br>The seminal case surrounding jury size is *Williams v. Florida*, a case<br>that came before the Supreme Court in 1970, alleging (among other<br>things) that Florida's 1967 law reducing the size of a non-capital jury<br>from 12 to 6 was a violation of the 6th Amendment.<br><br>The court found (obviously, based on your experience) that it does not.<br><br>The court said that the 6th Amendment did not mandate a set number of<br>jurors. The primary function of a jury is to prevent abuses by<br>government officials:<br><br>> *Providing an accused with the right to be tried by a jury of his<br>> peers gave him an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or<br>> overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant, biased, or eccentric<br>> judge.*\[1\](#ljSVE){#cite-ljSVE .citation_link}<br><br>The functions of a jury, the court found, could be just as effectively<br>carried out by six members as it could by twelve:<br><br>> *\T\he essential feature of a jury obviously lies in the<br>> interposition between the accused and his accuser of the common sense<br>> judgment of a group of laymen \\...\ The performance of this role is<br>> not a function of the particular number of the body that makes up the<br>> jury.*\[2\](#qUpDj){#cite-qUpDj .citation_link}<br><br>Later, in *Ballew v. Georgia,* which was heard in 1978, the Supreme<br>Court found that a Georgia law allowing for a jury of five members was<br>indeed unconstitutional.<br><br>State laws, therefore, cannot limit jury size to less than 6 members,<br>but states can create juries of as few as six and still be<br>Constitutional.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ljSVE){.citation_index} [[Williams v.
