<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>TL;DR: It was a lot of fun, and as I understand it, it still is.<br><br>The whole \"NORAD tracks Santa\" thing started before I got there. It<br>actually started in November of 1955, when a Colonel in the COC (Combat<br>Operations Center) answered his commercial desk phone line to hear a<br>child\'s voice saying, \"Is this Santa Claus?\" It seems that a Sears ad<br>listed a phone number that you could call and talk directly to Santa,<br>but a child mis-dialed, inverting two digits and reaching an unlisted<br>number in the COC. The Colonel answered \"\...much more roughly than he<br>should---considering the season: 'There may be a guy named Santa Claus<br>at the North Pole, but he's not the one I worry about coming from that<br>direction.'"\1\<br><br>The newly-formed Air Force decided to use the gaffe as a PR stunt, and a<br>month later, they published press releases indicating that the Air Force<br>was in contact with Santa and they would be monitoring his progress the<br>whole way to keep him safe. Remember that we were in the height of the<br>Cold War at that time, and kids were rightly afraid for Santa\'s safety.<br>The press ate it up, and the AP wire picked up the story and<br>redistributed it with abandon.<br><br>The Air Force initially used the momentum to gain some much-needed free<br>publicity for the mission that they just recently started. However, the<br>good-hearted military members who call themselves Airmen continued the<br>Santa-tracking tradition, publishing an actual phone number that kids<br>could call. When I was working in NORAD in the late 90\'s, it was a<br>rollover line that was added to our desk phones, and we had a script to<br>read which changed based on the hour. It was actually quite fun; we<br>really enjoyed being able to give back to the community with something<br>as simple as answering a phone and reading a paragraph.<br><br>These days, the NORAD Santa hotline is staffed in a dedicated facility<br>with over 1200 Air Force volunteers answering calls.
