<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there any legal retribution or recourse for victims of over-zealous<br>prosecutorial misconduct such as perjury traps, threats against family<br>members and entrapment?**<br><br>These things are not "prosecutorial misconduct." *Webster\'s New World<br>Law Dictionary* defines prosecutorial misconduct as \"an illegal act or<br>failing to act, on the part of a prosecutor, especially an attempt to<br>sway the jury to wrongly convict a defendant or to impose a harsher than<br>appropriate punishment.\"\[1\](#YXUpF){#cite-YXUpF .citation_link}<br><br>Let's start with "perjury traps," the phenomenon where an unscrupulous<br>lawyer tricks you into committing perjury. Here's an example of a<br>perjury trap: Let's say a lawyer knows you committed a crime, but the<br>statute of limitations expired on that crime, so you can't be<br>prosecuted. Let's say the lawyer asks you under oath about that crime.<br>If you lie about it, that's a new crime (perjury). Tricking someone into<br>lying is still someone lying. No US federal court has ever dismissed a<br>case because someone claimed a perjury trap. You weren't tricked into<br>lying; you lied. Period. If the prosecutor told you that you can still<br>be prosecuted for that crime when he knew that you cannot, that may be<br>considered *entrapment by estoppel,* which we'll get into a little bit<br>later in this answer.<br><br>Threats against family members are exactly that: threats. If someone<br>threatens your life or your safety, that's a threat. Call the police.<br><br>It's also unlikely that a prosecutor can get someone to commit<br>entrapment, which is enticing someone to commit a crime who would not<br>otherwise have committed a crime.<br><br>The *only* charge you may be able to make is *entrapment by estoppel*,<br>which is a defense which \"applies when, acting with actual or apparent<br>authority, a government official affirmatively assures the defendant<br>that certain conduct is legal and the defendant reasonably believes that<br>official\"\[2\](#VXJKK){#cite-VXJKK .citation_link}. This was first<br>asserted in *Raley v. Ohio*, where a defendant was told they could<br>reasonably plead the 5th. However, in Ohio, because they were already<br>provided immunity deals, the 5th didn't apply. When they pleaded the<br>5th, they were then prosecuted for failing to answer questions. The<br>convictions were overturned on appeal under the grounds of entrapment by<br>estoppel.<br><br>If you think you have a case for entrapment by estoppel, you must appeal<br>your conviction. Prosecutors who engage in this sort of misconduct can<br>be disbarred.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-YXUpF){.citation_index} [[Prosecutorial misconduct<br>dictionary<br>definition](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7f592a&url=https://www.yourdictionary.com/prosecutorial-misconduct){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="yourdictionary.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-VXJKK){.citation_index} [[United States v.
