<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No. That's not why we should scrap the student loan forgiveness program.<br>We shouldn't scrap the program because of the motivations behind its<br>authors.<br><br>We *should* scrap it because it is unfair, unethical, and quite<br>probably illegal.<br><br>Here's an example "ripped from the headlines" of recent history.<br><br>Let's say Trump, as President, decides to ban immigration from ten<br>mostly-Muslim countries, because he has a visceral, deep-seated hatred<br>of brown people from the Middle East. He tells his lieutenants to draft<br>such executive action. Well, his lieutenants know that there is no legal<br>way to simply ban immigration from a country because Trump hates brown<br>people. So they draft an Executive Order using the fact that these<br>countries do not properly vet their immigrants and have been known to<br>allow criminals to emigrate. While the *intent* of that executive action<br>was unethical and immoral, the way that it was written was perfectly<br>legal and well within the executive authority to control immigration.<br><br>The purpose of that example is to show that we don't use *intent* behind<br>legislation to determine whether or not legislation should be<br>overturned. We only use *legality* of the legislation; how it is<br>*written*.<br><br>So back to the student loan forgiveness program.<br><br>Should the fact that Democrats are simply using this program to buy the<br>votes of young, college-age voters motivate the scrapping of the<br>program? No, we don't scrap legislation because of the intent behind it.<br>We scrap it because of the *legality* of the legislation.<br><br>And the student loan forgiveness program is not legal.<br><br>The President does not have the authority to cancel student loans. Only<br>Congress has the authority to control spending on federal programs.<br><br>> The executive branch cannot spend money that has not been appropriated<br>> by Congress, per 31 USC 1301 et seq (Antideficiency Act (P.L. 97-258))<br>> and Article I, Section 7, Clause 7 of the U.S. Constitution.<br>><br>> The claims that the President has the authority to forgive student<br>> loans are based on a misreading of the Higher Education Act of 1965 at<br>> 20 USC 1082(a)(6). That section of the Higher Education Act of 1965<br>> provides the U.S. Secretary of Education with the authority to:<br>><br>> "\...modify, compromise, waive, or release any right, title, claim,<br>> lien, or demand, however acquired, including any equity or any right<br>> of redemption."<br>><br>> But that quote is taken out of context. The preamble to that section<br>> of the Higher Education Act of 1965 limits this authority to operating<br>> within the scope of the statute:<br>><br>> "In the performance of, and with respect to, the functions, powers,<br>> and duties, vested in him by this part, the Secretary may---\"<br>><br>> In other words, when Congress authorizes a loan forgiveness program,<br>> such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness, Teacher Loan Forgiveness or<br>> the Total and Permanent Disability Discharge, the U.S. Secretary of<br>> Education has the authority to forgive student loans as authorized<br>> under the terms of these loan forgiveness programs.<br>><br>> Without authorization by Congress of a specific loan forgiveness<br>> program, the President does not have the authority to forgive student<br>> loan debt. As the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in *Whitman v. American<br>> Trucking Assns., Inc.,* (531 USC 457, 2001), Congress does not "hide<br>> elephants in mouseholes."\[1\](#fcjkV){#cite-fcjkV .citation_link}<br><br>It's also *unethical*.<br><br>> - The increase in the national debt by forgiving student debt (i.e.,<br>>   much of it is held by government entities) is unsustainable.<br>> - The mounting debt forgiven disproportionately harms those graduates<br>>   who have already paid off their debt.<br>> - Are we sending a message that it's all right to get in deeper debt<br>>   than one can afford because someone or some institution will pick up<br>>   the pieces?<br>> - Will the debt forgiveness program incentivize colleges and<br>>   universities to admit more students so they can hire more faculty,<br>>   open more centers, and start new programs with student fees?<br>> - Don't students have a personal responsibility to pay off their debt<br>>   given that they knew it was coming when they enrolled in<br>>   college?\[2\](#VOKRz){#cite-VOKRz .citation_link}<br><br>\<br><br>For these reasons, the student loan forgiveness program should be<br>canceled. The motivations of Democrats behind the program is not<br>relevant, despite the fact that their motivations are indeed suspect.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-fcjkV){.citation_index} [[Is Student Loan Forgiveness By<br>Executive Order<br>Legal?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f788ad&url=https://thecollegeinvestor.com/35892/is-student-loan-forgiveness-by-executive-order-legal/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="thecollegeinvestor.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-VOKRz){.citation_index}<br>[https://www.higheredethicswatch\....(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cc44cf&url=https://www.higheredethicswatch.com/2022/09/is-student-debt-relief-ethical.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="higheredethicswatch.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
