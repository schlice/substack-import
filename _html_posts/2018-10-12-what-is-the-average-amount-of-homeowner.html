They charge residents of<br>> a 3,400-square-foot condo about \$4,000 per month in HOA fees.<br>> Suddenly that \$250 monthly fee you're considering feels a bit more<br>> reasonable, doesn't it?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
