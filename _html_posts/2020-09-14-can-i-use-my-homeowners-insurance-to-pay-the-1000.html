<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can I use my homeowners insurance to pay the \$1,000 deductible for<br>damage done to my car, parked in my assigned parking space in the condo<br>building's parking lot? My auto insurance covered the damage.**<br><br>Generally, homeowner's or renter's insurance cannot be used to pay<br>deductibles. You may have separate gap coverage (i.e. AFLAC) which might<br>cover deductibles, but in general, insurance can't be used to pay<br>deductibles.<br><br>The deductible is the amount you must pay before insurance will pay. You<br>can always choose a lower deductible and higher monthly premiums, but<br>the deductible is the way risk is shared between you and the insurance<br>company. So the deductible is on you to pay.<br><br>If your insurance reimburses you for the damage done to your car, they<br>will simply deduct your deductible from what they reimburse, so in<br>function, you don't necessarily have to "pay" your deductible out of<br>your pocket in most cases. There are a small subset of cases where you<br>may have to put that money down, but one way or another (either out of<br>pocket or out of your reimbursement), you will pay your deductible.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
