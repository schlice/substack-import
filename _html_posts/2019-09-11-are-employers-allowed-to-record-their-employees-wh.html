However, for precision, we must clarify what<br>kind of recording you are talking about, and what is being recorded.<br><br>If you're in an office owned (or leased) by the company, you can be<br>subject to video recording anywhere in that office space, except in<br>areas in which there is an expectation of privacy (i.e. bathrooms,<br>locker rooms, private offices, etc). The company has a right to protect<br>its resources, and video surveillance is a part of that. Audio recording<br>along with the video is not permitted.<br><br>All of your electronic communications can be monitored. This includes<br>telephone and Internet. If you are using the company's resources, they<br>can monitor those resources for appropriate use and to watch for<br>violations of policy which might harm the company.<br><br>In nearly all states, the company does NOT need to post a notice that<br>you may be under video surveillance while inside their facility. They<br>also do not need to post a login banner which states that your sessions<br>using their Internet connections may also be monitored (but most do). So<br>long as their End User Agreement states it (which you signed when you<br>got a login to their system, or when you hired on with the company),<br>that is all the notice that is required.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
