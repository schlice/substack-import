<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>"Blessing" is treated differently depending on what word is used, and<br>whether you are referencing the Old or New Testament.<br><br>In some cases in the Old Testament, "blessing" referred to material<br>wealth. For example, in Genesis 24:35 Abraham's servant tells Laban,<br>"The Lord has blessed my master abundantly, and he has become wealthy."<br>And in Job 42:12 we are told: "The Lord blessed the latter part of Job's<br>life more than the first. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand<br>camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys." In these<br>instances blessing is expressed through wealth and possessions.<br><br>But the Old Testament also makes it clear that there is much more to<br>God's blessing than material possessions. Psalm 132:15 promises that God<br>will bless Zion with abundant provisions and satisfy her poor with food.<br>Psalm 37:11 promises that "the meek will inherit the land and enjoy<br>great peace." In these instances there is still the promise of earthly<br>goods, but it goes hand in hand with a special concern for the poor. And<br>the people in Old Testament times learned that they could experience<br>God's blessing even in the most difficult circumstances. The lives of<br>individuals like Ezekiel, Daniel, and Esther are examples of how God may<br>use difficulty and suffering to his faithful servants\' advantage and<br>benefit.<br><br>In the New Testament, however, "blessing" is never shown through<br>material wealth. In Luke 6 Jesus says, "Blessed are you who are poor,<br>for yours is the kingdom of God" (v .20) and, "But woe to you who are<br>rich, for you have already received your comfort" (v. 24). James tells<br>us that the brother in humble circumstances should take pride in his low<br>position and that the rich man will fade away as quickly as a wildflower<br>(1:9-11). And Paul warns us that the love of money is a root of all<br>kinds of evil (1 Tim. 6:10).<br><br>The New Testament uses one word more than any other when describing<br>God's blessing to people. This word, µακαριοσ, or makarios, means<br>"blessed." It's used 44 times in the New Testament. Of those, 31 involve<br>descriptions of righteous behavior or characteristics that God considers<br>desirable. The most prominent and familiar example of this usage of the<br>word makarios is in the beatitudes in Matthew 5. Here Jesus blesses the<br>poor in spirit, the mourning, the meek, the merciful, the pure in heart,<br>and the persecuted. Luke 6 declares a blessing on the poor, the hungry,<br>the weeping, and the hated. In parables about servants behaving<br>responsibly while their masters are away, Jesus repeatedly blesses those<br>servants who are ready and watching when their master returns. James<br>blesses the person who perseveres under trial (1:3), and the book of<br>Revelation blesses the reader who is faithful to the message being<br>proclaimed (22:7).<br><br>Eleven uses of the word makarios speak of the blessing of being part of<br>the coming kingdom of God. Thus someone eating with Jesus in Luke 14:15<br>states that the person who will eat in the kingdom of God is blessed,<br>and Revelation 19:9 proclaims: "Blessed are those who are invited to the<br>wedding supper of the Lamb!" The final two uses of makarios refer to God<br>as the one who is blessed.<br><br>The New Testament idea of blessing, then, pictures people who rejoice in<br>the coming of salvation in Jesus Christ. They enjoy spiritual blessings<br>in Christ as they put their faith in Him, experience His love and<br>forgiveness, and work faithfully for the coming of His kingdom.<br><br>\<br><br>You may be wondering about a dangerous trend in modern Christianity,<br>called the prosperity gospel. The prosperity gospel is an unbiblical<br>Christian doctrine which teaches that faith can bring health, wealth,<br>and happiness into believers\' lives. It\'s also known as prosperity<br>theology, the health and wealth gospel, the gospel of success, or seed<br>faith.<br><br>The prosperity gospel teaches that:<br><br>- God wants people to be prosperous, especially financially<br>- Wealth is a sign of God\'s blessing<br>- The poor are poor because of a lack of faith<br>- Believers can transcend poverty and/or illness through devotion and<br>  positive confession<br>- Financial blessing and physical well-being are always the will of God<br>  for them<br>- Christian faith equates with material, and particularly financial,<br>  success<br><br>The prosperity gospel has its roots in an American occult tradition<br>called [[New<br>Thought](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=860306&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Thought){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. It primarily took hold<br>in the Pentecostal revivals of the post-World War II years, and is<br>therefore frequently associated with Pentecostalism, Evangelicalism, and<br>Charismatic Christianity, although today these groups do not<br>*exclusively* preach the prosperity gospel. Some ministers who have<br>preached the prosperity gospel include Oral Roberts, Joel Osteen, Gordon<br>Lindsay, and Kenneth Hagin.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
