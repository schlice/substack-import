title: '"Why do all the Quora members that do not agree with your comments block you
  from replying by just disabling comments and what really are these people frightened
  of; being shown up as ignorant people of the true facts or just believe they are
  God?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I can't tell you why "all the Quora members" do anything. You would be<br>included in that group, so you would know. But since you don't, this<br>answer doesn't apply to "all the Quora members."<br><br>But I can tell you why I disable comments (when I do). I will disable<br>comments when:<br><br>- People are being offensive or disrespectful. Quora has (technically,<br>  on paper) a "Be Nice, Be Respectful" policy. It used to be enforced<br>  very strongly. These days, with the growth they have seen, less so.<br>- Commenters are not having a "discussion," they are having an<br>  "argument." If they are being heavily argumentative (and then throw in<br>  a little insulting), and I just don't want to deal with it, I'll<br>  disable comments.<br><br>When you're outside of the rules of Spaces, the answerer owns his or her<br>answer, and owns the whole comments section. You may not be aware of<br>this. They are under no obligation to keep any of your comments on their<br>answer. They are also not under any obligation to turn comments on at<br>all. They can allow comments up to a certain point, but if the comments<br>do not appreciably contribute to the answer, or even if they just don't<br>want their comments feed clogged up with comments, they turn them off.<br><br>On heavily contentious topics or heavily emotionally-charged topics<br>(i.e. abortion or gun control), I'll default to having comments off.<br>I'll add a disclaimer to the end of the answer which says, in part:<br><br>> *Sorry, no comments on this answer. If you don't like what I wrote,<br>> tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or un-cited<br>> opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think you know<br>> better, write your own answer. But Quora is a "question-and-answer"<br>> site, not a "question-and-answer-and-engage in endless arguments"<br>> site. I simply do not have time to engage in inane argumentation* ad<br>> infinitum/ad nauseum*. If you literally came here just to tell me<br>> "Akshually," then you're the reason I disable comments. Well done<br>> Karen, you ruined it for everyone.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
