<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It\'s important to remember that the people who first came<br>to America came *from England*, so these former English citizens had<br>a \"dream\" of something \"better.\"\<br>\<br>They dreamed of a place where:\<br>]<br><br>- they could freely practice their religion<br>- there was no taxation without representation<br>- you could speak out against the government without fear of reprisal<br>- there was no king<br><br>\<br>The original \"American Dream\" was to have a self-determined life<br>without being a pawn of the king; it was freedom to live your life on<br>your own terms, to make your own way.\<br>\<br>This eventually morphed into the \"dream\" of making it big in America<br>because everyone had *equal opportunity* under the new American<br>government*.* This is an important piece of history that, sometimes, it<br>seems our current administration forgets. Equality in America means<br>equality of opportunity{.underline}, not equality of<br>outcome{.underline}. It\'s the \"rags to riches\" story: everyone<br>has the same opportunity to make it big. Freedom and equality means we<br>all get the same opportunity to succeed or fail, and if that opportunity<br>is not there, the government should be stepping in and leveling the<br>playing field. The government should not be taking from one class and<br>giving to another because it\'s not \"fair.\" Equality of outcome was<br>never part of the American Experiment; equality of opportunity was the<br>driving factor.\<br>\<br>(NOTE: That\'s not to say we don\'t care about the poor; Americans are<br>exceedingly generous and give freely of their time and resources<br>whenever possible; but the American people grow weary of generations of<br>professional moochers who do little more than create new generations of<br>professional moochers.)<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
