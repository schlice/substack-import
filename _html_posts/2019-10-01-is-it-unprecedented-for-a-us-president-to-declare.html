<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it unprecedented for a US President to declare "We are at war"<br>publicly?**<br><br>No, it is not without precedent. Other presidents have said as much.<br>Roosevelt said , "I ask that the Congress declare that since the<br>unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, December 7, 1941, a<br>state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese<br>Empire." In other words, we are at war; it's up to you to officially<br>declare it.<br><br>Additionally, saying words is not illegal. 1st Amendment and all. And<br>saying it doesn't make it true. Congress is the only body that can<br>declare war, according to the Constitution.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
