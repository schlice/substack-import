He did a very in-depth review of<br>**[23andMe.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5f95e9&url=http://23andMe.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="23andme.com"}]{.qlink_container}**, which you should really<br>take the time and watch, especially if you are concerned at all about<br>what information these DNA testing places can glean about you.
