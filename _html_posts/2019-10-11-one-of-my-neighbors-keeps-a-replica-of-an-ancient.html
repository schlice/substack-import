I find this tasteless,. What options do I<br>have to have this kind of thing removed?**<br><br>Unfortunately in this case, the "replica of an ancient torture device"<br>is also a recognized religious symbol.<br><br>To that end, it is protected by the 1st Amendment, so unfortunately, in<br>the United States, there is nothing you can do to have it removed.<br><br>Your best option is to sell your house and move to a country which<br>allows religious oppression, so you can suppress those silly symbols.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
