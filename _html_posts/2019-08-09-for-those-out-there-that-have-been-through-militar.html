<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**For those out there that have been through military basic training,<br>are you or anyone you know immune to CS gas or pepper spray?**<br><br>Military training involves CS tear gas. Only specialized units use<br>pepper spray (i.e. military law enforcement, and not in every<br>situation). Everyone trains on CS tear gas in the military, because it<br>has immediate, debilitating effects, but it rapidly clears from the body<br>with virtually no incidence of long-term effects.<br><br>I went through it as a trainee, and I administered it as a trainer. I<br>have never seen someone be able to remove their gas mask and breathe<br>normally. What I have seen is a difference in the amount of time it<br>takes to affect someone. Most people are immediately impacted by the<br>gas. Besides the choking, you literally get fluid from every pore in<br>your face: eyes water, nose runs, saliva, and for most, it's<br>instantaneous. Just this massive explosion of snot and tears. Some can<br>actually take a few breaths before starting to choke and tear up. But<br>everyone is affected by the gas.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
