<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The short answer, for all legal questions, is "it depends." And in this<br>case, it depends on your Governing Documents.<br><br>It's different for every Association. In some cases, some Associations<br>may allow their Board members to enter on to your property to address<br>emergency situations while the homeowner is not home. In my last<br>association in Florida, Board members could access a homeowner's<br>property to address emergency situations which threatened nearby homes.<br>We had an incident at one house (where the owner was not home) where a<br>sprinkler head had broken and was spouting water on to the neighbor's<br>property (and their house). We entered the property and turned off the<br>reclaimed water at the meter, and then left messages for the homeowner<br>explaining what we did.<br><br>The true answer is to check your HOA's Governing Documents to find the<br>answer for your HOA.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
