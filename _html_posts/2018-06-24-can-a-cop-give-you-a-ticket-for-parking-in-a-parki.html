<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can a cop give you a ticket for parking in a parking meter spot but<br>you are still in the car?**<br><br>Can they? Of course they can. Will it hold up? Unlikely.<br><br>"Parking" and "Standing" have two legally distinct definitions. If<br>you're still in the car in the operator's position, your vehicle is<br>technically "standing." Once you get out and leave the vehicle, it is<br>now "parked."<br><br>Of course, this is highly dependent on local laws, local definitions of<br>parking and standing, and local laws regarding stopping, standing, or<br>parking.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
