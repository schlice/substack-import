If Congress watched the president fire the lead<br>investigator in a case against him, the remedy is exactly the same as if<br>actual crimes were found to have taken place.<br><br>Once that president is no longer president, he can be indicted and tried<br>as an ordinary citizen.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
