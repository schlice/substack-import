<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The best home security cameras to buy without a subscription, *by<br>far* (and it's not even close) is the camera system from Ubiquiti. Their<br>UniFi system is second to none. Their cameras are all PoE cameras (no<br>flaky Wi-Fi here) and their data is stored on a DVR device in your home.<br>You will have to install Ethernet, a PoE switch, and a UniFi gateway<br>device to utilize the storage. But none of this goodness comes free. You<br>said you wanted the best home security camera system which did not<br>require a subscription, and this is it. Ubiquiti normally caters to<br>business installations, but their smaller UniFi cloud gateway systems<br>are a perfect fit for a home or small business installation.<br><br>If you want the best *consumer-grade* camera system you can buy, go<br>with Eufy. Their cameras are wireless, and they are solar-powered. When<br>you pair their cameras with the HomeBase 3 system, you can upgrade your<br>storage with external hard drives. No subscription is necessary<br>(although they offer one for online backup if you choose). The Eufy<br>system is *good*, but it's not *great*. Some issues with their system:<br><br>- The motion detection on their cameras is abysmal. The vast majority of<br>  the cameras in their lineup have absolutely terrible motion<br>  sensitivity. The event will likely be passed by the time the camera<br>  wakes up and starts recording, and that's sad. Some of their newest<br>  Pro cameras have incorporated LIDAR to improve motion detection, but I<br>  have yet to hear if it made a huge difference, and again, the majority<br>  of their product line uses really terrible PIR sensors.<br>- The solar panels basically don't work over the winter. The sun just<br>  isn't strong enough to do the job. If you live anywhere north of<br>  Florida, you're likely going to have a month or two where your cameras<br>  simply don't work. Be prepared to take them down and charge them with<br>  a USB cable during that time.<br>- Integration with Apple/Google/Amazon smart home tech is *there*, but<br>  it's not *great*. They've been "working on improving it" for years. It<br>  still sucks.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
