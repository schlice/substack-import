<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it possible for the Congress to outlaw abortion everywhere if<br>SCOTUS allowed it, or would each state decide?**<br><br>If *Roe* is overturned, Congress *could* pass a law outlawing abortion<br>throughout the country. The 14th Amendment would mean that this law<br>applied to the states. Therefore, no states would be allowed to perform<br>abortions at all.<br><br>This will not happen.<br><br>Not only can Congress not get a consensus about this, *they shouldn't*.<br>If *Roe* is overturned, it will be up to the individual states to make<br>laws regarding abortion. This actually should be a state's rights issue,<br>and each state should decide for itself how it will structure its laws.<br>Some states will allow elective abortions at any time, up until the baby<br>is born. Some states will ban abortions once a heartbeat is detected.<br>Some states will ban all abortions except in cases of rape or incest, or<br>when the life of the mother is threatened.<br><br>The only thing that Congress should do is to pass a law to ensure that<br>Title X money is not used to pay for abortions in any state, such that<br>taxpayers in an anti-abortion state don't end up paying for abortions in<br>an abortion-friendly state.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
