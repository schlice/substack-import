<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*I* don't expect to get anyone to believe in Jesus. Jesus does the work<br>of conversion, *I* don't. I just show people that there is a better way<br>to live than what the world is offering, *and I bring them to him*. He<br>does the heavy lifting.<br><br>But if you're just looking at his death, you're not looking at the whole<br>picture. The beauty of the story is that he died, **but was<br>resurrected**. He turned death from something permanent to something<br>temporary. Death is nothing more than a transition from this world to<br>the next. His death *and resurrection* opened the door for us to be<br>reunited with God, as our sins are paid for, once and for all. Jesus<br>paid for our sin with his death and resurrection.<br><br>The "good news" is the Gospel. Gospel actually means "good news." The<br>good news is embodied in that Bible reference you sometimes see at<br>football games: John 3:16:<br><br>> For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son. that<br>> whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.<br><br>*This* is the good news. Heaven is open to you. It is open to anyone who<br>confesses their sins, repents, and believes in Jesus' death and<br>resurrection to pay for that sin.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How do you expect to get people to believe in Jesus by burdening them<br>with the guilt of his death? Where is the \"Good News\" in that?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
