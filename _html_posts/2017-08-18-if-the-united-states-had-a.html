<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A no confidence vote would simply remove the person from office. Trump<br>would go back to Manhattan and would resume CEO duties for the Trump<br>Corporation.<br><br>If Trump himself was removed from office under such a vote (if we had a<br>mechanism to do that), the 25th Amendment (and its subsequent<br>definitions) would kick in, and the Vice President would become<br>President for Trump's remaining term.<br><br>We don't have a "no-confidence" vote because we are fairly confident<br>through over 250 years of precedent that we can peacefully vote someone<br>out of office when the next election rolls around. The people have<br>decided that four years is enough time to give someone to either<br>generate confidence, or prove that they have none. Precedent has shown<br>us that the only necessity would be to make someone a "one-term<br>President."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
