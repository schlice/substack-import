<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My medical records should be protected through HIPAA. My mother is a<br>doctor. She called my doctor\'s office and received my medical<br>information without my consent. Was this illegal? Is there anything I<br>can do about it?**<br><br>In addition to the other answers here, if you are not a minor, you may<br>have signed a consent form allowing select individuals to access your<br>medical records without further consent. You can revoke that consent at<br>any time.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
