<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there any legal recourse when a spouse calls their work place<br>multiple times and gets them fired?**<br><br>The only way something could be done is if the spouse lied about<br>something, and it was that lie that cost you your job. This is called<br>slander.<br><br>Remember though, it must have been a lie, and the lie is what needs to<br>have cost you your job. The truth is always a defense against slander.<br>And you are only able to recover damages from the spouse, you can't get<br>your job back.<br><br>In concert with the slander lawsuit (if you actually plan on suing your<br>spouse), I would also follow [[Gareth<br>Greetham](https://www.quora.com/profile/Gareth-Greetham)]{.qlink_container}'s<br>advice and get a divorce. If you don't, it's really difficult to sue<br>your spouse when you are married, as his finances are your finances. So<br>it's like you're suing yourself.<br><br>So get the divorce first, then sue for slander.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
