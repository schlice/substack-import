<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would you allow government to anonymously \"look\" through your emails<br>to prevent potential terrorism and other serious crimes?**<br><br>That's not the way our justice system works in the United States,<br>regardless of the altruism of your motive.<br><br>In this country, we have evidence of a crime first, and then we<br>obtain permission through the courts to "look" through emails. We don't<br>go fishing for evidence before we have it.<br><br>"Allowing" government to look through your emails is giving away your<br>rights without any reason. The government should be focusing on<br>gathering actual evidence of a crime, not going on fishing expeditions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
