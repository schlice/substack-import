<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Well, let's take a look at how Jesus handled rude people.<br><br>You could technically say that Jesus was, too, in the "customer service<br>industry," such that it was. He also dealt with rude people. So we can<br>look to the example of Jesus to see how to deal with rude people.<br><br>Jesus dealt with mean people in a variety of ways:<br><br>- He would rebuke them when necessary (John 8:47)<br>- Sometimes He would remain silent (John 8:6)<br>- Other times, He would ask questions (Mark 11:28--29)<br>- Sometimes He would point them to Scripture (Mark 10:2--3)<br>- He might also tell them stories (Luke 7:40--42)<br><br>When Jesus delivered the Sermon on the Mount, He was quite specific<br>about the fact that we must deal with difficult people in love and<br>humility:<br><br>> But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who<br>> hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.<br>> If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. If<br>> someone takes your cloak, do not stop him from taking your tunic. Give<br>> to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do<br>> not demand it back. Do to others as you would have them do to you ---<br>> Luke 6:27--31 ESV<br><br>We must never give back to others exactly what they give to us:<br><br>> Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary,<br>> repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you<br>> may inherit a blessing --- 1 Peter 3:9 ESV<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
