<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The external force need not be a god, but objective moral truth cannot<br>exist without an external force, be it cooperation between people to<br>hold to a certain moral standard, or reliance on an external standard.<br><br>Otherwise, you only have morals that you infer (i.e. subjective),<br>and my morals may not match yours. For example, I may say that "survival<br>of the fittest" is my objective moral truth, and I may kill you to<br>achieve it. There is no objective moral truth that all sentient beings<br>naturally arrive upon without some external collaboration to achieve it.<br><br>HOWEVER, if there is an *imprinted* morality, how did it get there?<br>Morality cannot develop from nature, as the cold, immoral universe<br>cannot impart morality onto any of its creations (see the Law of<br>Causation). Arguing such implies that you can get something from<br>nothing, which is a postulation long since abandoned.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
