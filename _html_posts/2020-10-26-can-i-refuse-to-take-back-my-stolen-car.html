<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The difference regarding whether or not you can take your stolen and<br>then recovered car back is whether or not your insurance has already<br>paid out the comprehensive claim on your car. If you have comprehensive<br>insurance and your car is stolen, your comprehensive coverage pays you<br>the fair market value for your car.<br><br>If your insurance has not yet paid off your car, you do have to take it<br>back. And I would posit that you would *want* to take it back, even if<br>you are just taking it back so that you can immediately turn around and<br>sell it, because insurance didn't pay you for it. Even if you don't want<br>it anymore, not taking it back in the event that insurance didn't pay<br>for it would be throwing money away. You *can* refuse to take it back,<br>but why would you? If you refuse to take it back for long enough,<br>adverse possession laws kick in, and the car becomes the property of the<br>impound lot. Impound lots love people like this. They get free money.<br><br>But if your insurance has already paid you out of your comprehensive<br>insurance, then your insurer legally owns your vehicle and they<br>decide what to do with it. Similar to what my commenter said, the<br>impound lot (and eventually the junk yard) is full of cars that<br>*insurance companies* *wrote off as a loss.* So if the police call and<br>tell you they found your stolen car and it's in the impound lot, tell<br>them that insurance already paid out for that car and it's not yours<br>anymore.<br><br>\<br><br>*Original question:*<br><br>*Can I refuse to take back my stolen car?*<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer**:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
