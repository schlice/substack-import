<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Isn\'t the fact that the Secret Service doesn\'t allow guns to be<br>brought to NRA conventions when the President is speaking a glaring<br>hypocrisy, particularly when they always trot out the good guy with a<br>gun line?**<br><br>No.<br><br>The only way the Secret Service disallowing guns at any one place would<br>be hypocritical is if they arbitrarily allow concealed firearms at one<br>location but disallow them in another.<br><br>In this, the Secret Service is remarkably consistent: *ANYWHERE* a<br>protected individual will attend is turned into a sterile area and no<br>guns are allowed. It doesn't matter if it's an NRA convention or a<br>Catholic church. It is contained and sterilized. Period.<br><br>So therefore, no hypocrisy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
