<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>All religions should have religious freedom protections, not just<br>Christians.<br><br>The Indiana anti-abortion law was written in such a way as to specify<br>that life begins at conception. This is what caused them issue, since<br>the plaintiffs in this case argued that there are other non-Christian<br>religions which do not hold that life begins at conception, specifically<br>Judaism and Islam, as well as other "independent spiritual belief<br>systems."<br><br>The non-Christian litigants are being represented by the ACLU.<br>\"Although some religions believe that human life begins at conception,<br>this is not an opinion shared by all religions or all religious<br>people,\" the ACLU said in a statement.<br><br>Therefore, the religious beliefs of these non-Christian religions are<br>being substantially burdened by a law which has at its basis the claim<br>that life begins at conception.<br><br>Indiana legislators should take note: **how you word your laws<br>matters.**<br><br>[[**US News: Judge Blocks Indiana Abortion Ban on Religious Freedom<br>Grounds**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4100ba&url=https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2022-12-02/judge-blocks-indiana-abortion-ban-on-religious-freedom-grounds){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="usnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>(EDIT) I will add that I think Indiana's judges missed the point of<br>these laws. A law which states that abortions are illegal does not<br>unduly burden any religion. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (both<br>the Federal version and Indiana's version) prohibits the government from<br>substantially burdening anyone's religious beliefs *except "in<br>furtherance of a compelling governmental interest,"* and it requires<br>politicians to use "the least restrictive means" possible. The<br>government has a compelling interest in protecting innocent life, and no<br>less restrictive means are available than prohibiting abortion.<br><br>"Science, not religion, tells us that abortion kills a human being," a<br>spokesperson for Attorney General Todd Rokita (R) said in a statement.<br>"When a legislature outlaws abortion, it extends the same ethical<br>judgment embodied in laws prohibiting homicide. Making ethical judgments<br>about the treatment of human beings is a compelling function of<br>government. Indeed, the very nature of law is to make ethical judgments<br>about human actions and their consequences. Just because a legal rule<br>effects an ethical judgment does not make it 'religious.'"<br><br>In other words, even if there was a religion which expressly authorized<br>murder, the state could still pass a law making murder illegal; and<br>while it would substantially burden that religion, it is done in<br>furtherance of a compelling governmental interest (the protection of<br>innocent life), and it is done by the least restrictive means possible<br>(there is no less restrictive means available other than to make it<br>illegal).<br><br>Abortion laws follow the same ethical standards, and are not<br>religiously-based. But even if they are, the same philosophy applies.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
