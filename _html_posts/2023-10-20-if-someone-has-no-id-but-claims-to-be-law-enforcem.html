<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you mean "into your home," they need more than ID. They need a<br>*search warrant*.<br><br>Otherwise, you are under no obligation to open the door, let alone let<br>them into your home, **even if they are real police officers with real<br>ID**.<br><br>Believe me, if they have a search warrant, something as trivial as a<br>*locked door* is not going to stop them from coming in. So if they tell<br>you, "It's the police, we have a search warrant, open the door or we're<br>breaking it down," I suggest you open the door, or you're going to end<br>up with a broken door that you'll have to pay for. But if they say,<br>"Open the door, it's the police" and they don't have ID (or refuse to<br>show it) or a search warrant, you are under no obligation to open the<br>door.<br><br>I'd suggest calling 911 and preparing to defend yourself against a home<br>invasion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
