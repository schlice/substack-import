<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Oh watch out there, you're using intelligence again!<br><br>Politicians try to make money complicated, but it really isn't. Since<br>government doesn't *generate wealth*, it only gets money by collecting<br>it from its citizens, and then giving it to other citizens by funding<br>programs.<br><br>Property taxes are part of the way that government collects money from<br>citizens. There are many ways: sales tax, income tax, etc. Some states<br>are so buoyed by taxes generated from tourism, that they don't even need<br>income taxes (looking at you, Florida). But in general, those are the<br>kinds of things that generate revenue for government.<br><br>When you eliminate one source of revenue, you can make up for the<br>shortfall in one of two ways: increase the amount of revenue you derive<br>from other sources, or decrease the amount you spend on programs. You<br>can do one, or both, but you must do at least one of those. Eliminating<br>one type of tax will either result in higher taxes in other areas, or<br>reduced government spending. Maybe that's what they're going for. But if<br>you don't reduce spending, you'll have to increase other taxes to make<br>up the difference.<br><br>Ultimately, it's just a shuffle game. Shuffling money from this area to<br>cover this other area. You don't get something for nothing.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Texas Governor candidate Huffines says that he will do away with<br>property taxes if elected. Wouldn't that possibly just make taxes more<br>expensive in other areas though?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
