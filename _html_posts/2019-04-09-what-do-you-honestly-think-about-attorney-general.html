<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What do you honestly think about President Trump\'s handpicked<br>Attorney General Barr plans to only release a REDACTED version of the<br>Mueller\'s report? I don\'t like it!**<br><br>You don't have to like it, but he is following the law.<br><br>A recent court challenge reaffirmed that grand jury testimony must<br>remain protected, so that information (which is included in the report)<br>cannot be released.<br><br>So now you're in a quandry. You'd like to see the whole report, but<br>there's information in it that would be *illegal* to release.<br><br>Also, Mueller referred some matters to other agencies to address. For<br>example, some tax evasion he found at state levels were referred to<br>those states to prosecute. If that information were to be released, it<br>would ruin the state's opportunity to get justice on behalf of their<br>residents. Is that fair to them?<br><br>So while you may not like that you don't have the opportunity to see the<br>full report, there are certain matters of law which even Congress is<br>required to follow.<br><br>But you're thinking, "But...but...that HANDPICKED Barr guy! He's going<br>to redact anything that makes Trump look bad!"<br><br>If that was the case, why isn't Mueller out there saying exactly that?<br>He may be a registered Republican, but he was appointed to government<br>positions by both Bushes, Clinton, and Obama. He should be out there<br>telling the truth! "This summary mis-characterizes my report! Trump<br>needs to go to jail, and Barr isn't doing it!"<br><br>Except...that's not exactly what's happening, is it. Why? Is Mueller<br>scared of Congress? Doubtful. He's a Marine. He's the former director of<br>the FBI. I don't think he's scared of much.<br><br>Maybe it's because, oh, I dunno, the summary is actually an accurate<br>summary of Mueller's findings?<br><br>That's more likely, isn't it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
