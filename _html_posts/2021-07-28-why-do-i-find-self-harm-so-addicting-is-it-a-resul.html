<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are six main reasons why people self-harm:<br><br>> 1.  Distract themselves, alter the focus of their attention, or regain<br>>     control over their minds when experiencing pressing, unavoidable<br>>     and overwhelming feelings or thoughts.<br>> 2.  Release tension associated with strong emotions or overwhelming<br>>     thoughts.<br>> 3.  Feel something physical when they are otherwise dissociated and<br>>     numb.<br>> 4.  Express themselves or communicate and/or document strong emotions<br>>     they are feeling and cannot otherwise articulate.<br>> 5.  Punish themselves.<br>> 6.  Experience a temporary but intense feeling of euphoria that occurs<br>>     in the immediate aftermath of<br>>     self-harm.\[1\](#AptoN){#cite-AptoN .citation_link}<br><br>It seems like you may be discussing reason number six. I think it\'s<br>like what runners call a \"runner\'s high\"; a temporary good feeling<br>that occurs right after you\'ve worked out. Except here, the good<br>feeling happens after self-harm. The self-harmer remembers that<br>"runner\'s high" and wants to self-injure again to re-create that<br>feeling.<br><br>Here's a few things you can do to help you break the cycle of self-harm:<br><br>> - **Name your reason for hurting yourself and your reason for<br>>   quitting.** Ask yourself: "What do I feel before, during, and after<br>>   self-injury? Which of those emotions do I actively seek out, and<br>>   which are harmful?"<br>> - Identify other ways of achieving the same result. For example,<br>>   if you self-harm for the physical sensation, seek other ways of<br>>   releasing endorphins, like exercise. For real, try throwing a few<br>>   punches at a kickboxing class or tapping it back in a spin class<br>>   with the \*perfect\* playlist. If you self-harm to express your<br>>   emotions, practice expressing them in words by writing them down.<br>>   Grab a pen and your favorite notebook, or start typing away in your<br>>   notes app.<br>> - Tackle the underlying emotions. Explore the feelings that lead<br>>   you to want to hurt yourself. If it's guilt, where is that guilt<br>>   coming from? Maybe try finding a therapist---there are pros trained<br>>   specifically to help with this.<br>> - Tell someone you trust. Let a friend, family member, or trusted<br>>   adult know what you're going through and that you need their<br>>   support. Opening up to people can be easier said than done. Here's a<br>>   place to start: "I'm having a hard time processing some painful<br>>   emotions and I could use your support right<br>>   now."\[2\](#CEMvy){#cite-CEMvy .citation_link}<br><br>Don't discount the benefit of therapy. Finding a professional who can<br>help you sort through the feelings *causing* you to self-harm in the<br>first place would be beneficial. Like the second article said, there are<br>pros who deal specifically with self-harm who can help you through it.<br><br>Who knows, you may become the next adrenaline junkie doing like base<br>jumping or bungee jumping off of high bridges.<br><br>But ultimately, talk to someone. There is help. You can get a rush<br>without drugs or self-harm. Please think seriously about talking to<br>someone.
