<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there a HOA that itemized dues so that only dog owners pay for<br>costs of operating a dog park and tennis players pay for that of a<br>tennis court which belong to the association?**<br><br>Initially, this request seems innocuous. Even logical.<br><br>But let's extend that. Why should I have to pay taxes that go to<br>schools, when I don't have a child in school? Why should I have to pay<br>taxes that go to certain state parks when I don't use those parks? The<br>reason: educated children and open space are important to everyone, even<br>if you don't personally use them.<br><br>The same holds true for tennis courts and dog parks. It is easy to argue<br>that these things enhance the overall value of your neighborhood. It<br>makes your neighborhood a more desirable place to live. So even if you<br>don't personally *use* those services, you *benefit* from those<br>services, indirectly, by living in a more desirable neighborhood.<br><br>Additionally, your buying power is multiplied when everyone shares those<br>costs. How would you calculate what you had to charge each individual<br>dog owner? And what if you get a new dog? Would you charge by dog? And<br>what about when someone moves in/out? And what about if someone only<br>uses the park occasionally? Would they pay less than someone who uses<br>the park every day? The administrative logistics of such a plan would be<br>a nightmare.<br><br>To that end, everyone in the association contributes to the amenities in<br>the association, whether or not you use them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
