<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, it says that you shouldn't isolate.<br><br>*But! But! Jesus went off alone and prayed! But Jesus often withdrew to<br>lonely places and prayed (Luke 5:16 NIV).*<br><br>Yes, this is true. But this is just text, **and text, without context,<br>is just pretext.**<br><br>Look closer at the rest of this chapter:<br><br>> While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered<br>> with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground<br>> and begged him, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."<br>><br>> Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he<br>> said. "Be clean!" And immediately the leprosy left him.<br>><br>> Then Jesus ordered him, "Don't tell anyone, but go, show yourself to<br>> the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your<br>> cleansing, as a testimony to them."<br>><br>> Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people<br>> came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses. But Jesus often<br>> withdrew to lonely places and prayed. --- Luke 5:12--16 NIV<br><br>So why did Jesus withdraw to lonely places to pray? The Bible says that<br>it was because "crowds of people came to be healed of their sicknesses,"<br>not necessarily because praying by yourself is the only way to pray.<br><br>It is also true that Jesus spent 40 days alone in the desert. Matthew 4<br>describes Jesus' time in the desert, fasting and praying for 40 days.<br><br>But after each time of solitude, of fasting and prayer, Jesus came back<br>to witness and to disciple and to be with His friends and brothers.<br><br>This is the lesson to take away from this story.<br><br>If you want to isolate and pray, do it. *But do not do it permanently.*<br>Take your time to fast and pray, but then return to normal life with<br>other people. "For where two or three are gathered together in my name,<br>there am I in the midst of them." (Matthew 18:20 NIV)<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
