<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>God's voice will never contradict the Bible.<br><br>If you're hearing what you believe is God's voice, do like the Bereans<br>did and test it against the Bible to see if it is true (Acts 17:11).<br>God's voice will never violate Scripture.<br><br>Bank clerks are trained to recognize fake bills not by studying every<br>forgery which has ever been created, but by studying *the real thing*.<br>Once you know the real thing, you can tell a forgery simply by comparing<br>it to the real thing.<br><br>We do the same with God's voice. When we study Scripture, we know God's<br>Word. God's voice speaking to us through the promptings of the Holy<br>Spirit will always be in congruence with God's Word in the Bible. We<br>know His Word because it will never violate the Bible.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
