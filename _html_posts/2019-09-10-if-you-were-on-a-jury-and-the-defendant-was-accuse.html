<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Remember that the trial phase is to determine if the defendant did what<br>he was accused of doing. That\'s it. Did the prosecutor prove, beyond a<br>reasonable doubt, that a crime had been committed. That\'s what the jury<br>determines.<br><br>Your personal opinion as to whether or not this should actually be a<br>crime, or if you were the DA whether or not you would have pursued<br>charges, is all irrelevant. If you can\'t decide the case on its merits,<br>without second guessing the intent of the law or it\'s application, be<br>sure to tell the judge before the trial starts so you can be sent home.<br><br>Where leniency is warranted is in sentencing. That\'s where we say<br>things like it didn\'t create a nuisance, his work was as good or better<br>than the city, etc. That\'s where he is able to walk away with a slap on<br>the wrist.<br><br>I hope you can see the difference.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
