<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How can the HOA kick you out of your house when you own it?<br><br>Your HOA cannot directly kick you out of your home. There is a bit of a<br>legal process. The HOA can do this because while you own your home, the<br>HOA owns the neighborhood in which your home lives. That means you are<br>responsible to pay dues to the HOA which controls your neighborhood. If<br>you break HOA rules, you may get fined. If you fail to pay fines or HOA<br>dues, the HOA can put a lien on your house for the dues and fines and<br>lawyers fees owed. You cannot sell or refinance your home until that<br>lien is paid.<br><br>And if the lien goes unpaid for long enough, the HOA can choose to<br>foreclose on that lien, which means that the home will be sold to pay<br>the outstanding liens against the house.<br><br>You must, as a homeowner, maintain your financial obligations that you<br>agreed to when you bought your home. Remember that stack of papers you<br>spent an hour signing (and you never knew you could sign your name that<br>many times)? One of those was the covenants on file with the City which<br>says that you agree that the HOA runs the show in your neighborhood and<br>you have to play along or face financial penalties. You also agreed that<br>if you don't pay, the HOA can take what you owe out of the cost of the<br>home. You agreed that the HOA would be the primary non-mortgage<br>lienholder, and could use your house as the collateral for unpaid HOA<br>debts. The bank may be the mortgage lienholder, but the HOA is usually<br>the first non-mortgage lienholder in line behind any mortgage liens. So<br>even if you're paying your mortgage on time but you fail to pay HOA dues<br>or fines, you can still have a lien foreclosed, and you can be evicted<br>and your house can be forcibly sold in a foreclosure sale to cover what<br>you owe.<br><br>*I oversaw two foreclosures for failure to pay HOA dues and fines during<br>my tenure on our Board of Directors. It's a very lengthy process, but we<br>worked as closely with the homeowner as they would allow. In one case,<br>we worked out a payment plan with the homeowner which allowed him to<br>stay in his house. In another, the homeowner simply wouldn't play nice<br>at all. Tangentially, he ended up going to jail on a DV charge. A real<br>sweetheart, that one. We threatened to foreclose, and while we were<br>preparing to file, the bank decided to foreclose which meant we got paid<br>without paying for the foreclosure. Phew.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
