<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a boyfriend who is 18 and his girlfriend gives birth at 15, and the<br>baby is his, will he get arrested and charged with rape, or a similar<br>crime even though it\'s what they wanted?**<br><br>The answer, of course, is "it depends."<br><br>First of all, simply the act of having a baby in a hospital does not<br>trigger legal action. The hospital is a hospital, not a police station.<br>Health care workers usually only have mandatory reporting requirements<br>when they suspect abuse or a dangerous situation. For example, hospitals<br>do not generally call the police when an underage person comes in<br>presenting with acute alcohol poisoning (i.e. they drank too much).<br>However, if while treating the patient, they see signs and symptoms<br>which are common in abuse, they may be obligated to report to police. In<br>most cases, hospitals have to report sexual abuse.<br><br>Statutory rape laws sometimes include "close in age" laws. These laws<br>would state something like statutory rape only applies when the<br>participants are more than four years apart. These are also called<br>"Romeo and Juliet" laws. They are designed to prevent older people from<br>taking advantage of younger people.<br><br>Finally, in many states, a 16 year old can be legally married with her<br>parents' permission and a judge's order. This could obviate the<br>statutory rape charge. In a few states, a statutory rape charge can be<br>alleviated through marriage, though those laws are currently under<br>review.<br><br>Check with your local laws about statutory rape and close-in-age laws.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
