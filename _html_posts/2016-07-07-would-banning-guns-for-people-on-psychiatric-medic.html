<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Effective psychiatric care is a combination of therapy and medications.<br>Being on one or the other is much less effective than both. Mental<br>health professionals are keenly aware of this. However, the people who<br>provide therapy are not the people who provide medications, and the<br>people who provide medications are not the people who provide therapy,<br>and often, the two professions don't see eye to eye.<br><br>Let's be clear: our mental health system is *broken*. Simply trying<br>to apply a band-aid to the system (i.e. medications=guns banned) is not<br>going to fix the problem. It will simply mean that more<br>mentally-unstable people will use other methods to kill, and we've<br>simply turned a toothache into a headache; we haven't solved anything.<br>Therefore, it would be wrong for us to say "medications=guns banned".<br>Being on medication alone is not an indication that someone is not<br>mentally stable enough to own a gun.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
