<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: no.<br><br>The NRA does not write regulations for owning guns in the United States.<br>If you want to complain to someone for "lax regulations" (which I find<br>absolutely hysterical), complain to Congress. They write the laws, not<br>an affinity group of gun owners who also happens to have a lobbying arm<br>(NRA Institute for Legislative Action).<br><br>Any citizen or group, including the NRA, is entitled to express their<br>opinions about what government does, does not, should, or should not do.<br>This is the express purpose of the First Amendment.<br><br>Should I try to sue Everytown, USA when someone can't buy a gun because<br>regulations are too tight and then a robber kills them? Everytown, USA<br>is no more responsible for what a robber does than the NRA is<br>responsible for what the Las Vegas shooter did.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
