<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Since all this \'horrible\' background information has come out on<br>Kavenaugh, shouldn\'t we go back and null and void all the cases he has<br>presided over in the past as a judge?**<br><br>Horrible.<br><br>Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley said the investigation found<br>"no hint of misconduct."<br><br>> *"I've now received a committee staff briefing on the FBI's supplement<br>> to Judge Kavanaugh's background investigation file. There's nothing in<br>> it that we didn't already know. These uncorroborated accusations have<br>> been unequivocally and repeatedly rejected by Judge Kavanaugh, and<br>> neither the Judiciary Committee nor the FBI could locate any third<br>> parties who can attest to any of the allegations. There's also no<br>> contemporaneous evidence. This investigation found no hint of<br>> misconduct and the same is true of the six prior FBI background<br>> investigations conducted during Judge Kavanaugh's 25 years of public<br>> service."*<br><br>Yep. Horrible. The man should be tarred and feathered.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
