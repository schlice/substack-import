<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>SCOTUS does not extend rights to anyone. Unless, of course, you're<br>talking about *Griswold v. Connecticut,* the most recent example of<br>SCOTUS extending rights to anyone.<br><br>*Griswold* was the last case in which SCOTUS invented a right to give to<br>someone, and that was the right to privacy. This right does not exist<br>anywhere in the Constitution, but SCOTUS at the time found it. Where,<br>you might ask? In the "emanations and penumbras" of the Constitution.<br><br>Basically, it works like this. Let's assume a hotel has a sign which<br>says "No Dogs, Cats, or Birds Allowed." One type of SCOTUS justice would<br>read that sign and say, "Your pet snake is allowed because the sign does<br>not say that snakes are not allowed. If the owner wanted to disallow<br>snakes, he would have put 'Snakes' on the sign." These type of justices<br>are known as "textualists" or "originalists." They believe that the<br>Constitution means exactly what it says, its interpretation should be<br>based on the common understanding when it was written, and if you want<br>it to mean something else, you have to modify the Constitution using one<br>of the documented methods to do so.<br><br>A second type of SCOTUS justice would read the same sign and think,<br>"Well, the person who wrote that sign was generally trying to exclude<br>any sort of common pet from the hotel, so your pet snake is therefore<br>not allowed." These types of justices are generally known as<br>"non-originalists." They believe that the Constitution should be<br>interpreted in accordance with the climate of the day, not based on the<br>interpretation when it was written, because the framers indicated that<br>they didn't want their specific intentions to control interpretation.<br><br>It is the non-originalists who fashioned the findings in *Griswold*, the<br>most classic example of imputing meaning *into* the Constitution instead<br>of reading it for exactly what it says.<br><br>Therefore, **to stop SCOTUS from extending rights to anyone, you must<br>remove anyone who has a non-originalist mindset**. The Constitution<br>means exactly what it means, and if the people want it to mean something<br>else, they can amend it. It's been amended before, even very recently<br>(i.e. within the last 30 years), so it can be amended again. Yes, it is<br>not easy. But it was not designed to be easily amended. It was designed<br>with a relatively high bar.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How do we fix SCOTUS so that they can no longer extend rights to<br>corporations at the expense of the people?<br><br>\<br><br>*Ugh, I had to disable comments again.*<br><br>*If you are a non-originalist, please feel free to write your own answer<br>about how we can fix SCOTUS so they can no longer be non-originalist.*<br><br>*But you're not going to convince me that "a right to privacy exists in<br>the Constitution" because it simply does not.* *Griswold* *got it<br>wrong. But it wasn't the wrong* *outcome* *(that's a whole other<br>discussion). It's the wrong* *method to achieve the outcome**. In<br>other words, the ends do not justify the means.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
