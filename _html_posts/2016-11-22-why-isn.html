<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's probably not illegal because of a flawed interpretation of the<br>first amendment.<br><br>Remember that the Bill of Rights was originally meant to protect you<br>against government action. For example, the government cannot throw<br>you in jail for protesting against them.<br><br>However, over time, and through case law, the first amendment has been<br>interpreted to mean that *anyone* is free to say *anything*<br>to *anyone* at *any time*.<br><br>Whether or not this is a good thing depends on the particular speech.<br>Clearly, protesting at a funeral is in bad taste. It is a time of<br>mourning, and whether or not you agree with the person who died, letting<br>the family grieve is right and proper. So not a good thing, but under<br>current interpretations of the Constitution, it is legal.<br><br>Trying to make it illegal would be constitutionally problematic.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
