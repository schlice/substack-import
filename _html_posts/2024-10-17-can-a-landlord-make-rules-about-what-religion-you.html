<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>In the *vast* majority of cases, the answer is absolutely no. The<br>First Amendment and the Supremacy Clause makes certain of that. No law<br>shall be made which abridges the free exercise of religion.<br><br>But since there are always exceptions, here's one. While landlords<br>cannot discriminate based on religion, they can implement reasonable<br>rules regarding property use that *might impact* religious practices,<br>**as long as these rules are not specifically targeting a particular<br>religion** and are applied equally to all tenants. So you can't bypass<br>the landlord's rules just because you're practicing religion, so long as<br>the rule applies to all tenants regardless of whether or not they are<br>practicing religion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
