<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Please Note: I have no affiliation with this app or its developer*<br><br>The app I use to overcome the "screen overlay" issue is called [[Install<br>Button<br>Unlocker](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=107890&url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Djp.sfapps.installbuttonunlocker%26hl%3Den){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container} from SFApps. It will<br>forcibly push the button beneath the overlay. After you install and run<br>it, you'll see a small lock icon on the buttons which are affected by<br>the screen overlay issue.<br><br>The buttons which are affected:<br><br>- INSTALL button（From Android 4.1 to 7.1）\<br>  It will be displayed when you install the app from the apk file.<br>- VPN button（Android 4.3 or lator）\<br>  It will be displayed when you want to allow VPN.<br>- Accessibility button（From Android 5.0 to 7.1）\<br>  It will be displayed when you activate accessibility features.<br>- ALLOW button（Android 6.0）\<br>  It will be displayed when an app requests permissions. It is also<br>  effective for permission buttons on the \"App permissions\" screen in<br>  the settings.<br>- START NOW button（From Android 6.0 to 7.1）\<br>  It will be displayed when you start a screen capture.<br>- ACTIVATE button（From Android 6.0 to 7.1）\<br>  It will be displayed when you activate device administrator.<br><br>Note that the free version is ad-supported, so on random clicks of<br>buttons where screen overlay is bypassed, you will see an ad pop up, or<br>it will open the Play Store and show you all of the apps published by<br>SFApps. Performing an in-app purchase will prevent these ads.<br><br>I'm not a big fan of adware, but this software works. I've had great<br>success with it on several phones, so I live with the occasional ad.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
