<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Please show me where it says in the Bible that God allows children to be<br>raped. Do you assume that God "allows" children to be raped because He<br>does not actively intervene? Just because God does not actively<br>intervene to prevent people from sinning does not mean that He "allows"<br>evil, meaning He "approves" of evil.<br><br>God hates evil. God hates anything contrary to His will, and anything<br>which is contrary to His will is *sin*, and is therefore *evil*. But God<br>so loves the fact that people have free will that He allows people to<br>choose to reject Him and to live on in their sin. This really hits at<br>the heart of why we exist at all, and why God might not be as overt in<br>revealing Himself to us as some would like. For if the Bible is true,<br>then God has provided each of us with the opportunity to make an eternal<br>choice to either accept Him or reject Him. And in order to ensure that<br>our choice is *truly* free, He puts us in an environment that is filled<br>with evidence of His existence, *but without His direct presence*---a<br>presence so powerful that it could overwhelm our freedom and thus negate<br>our ability to reject Him.<br><br>In other words, God has provided enough evidence in this life to<br>convince anyone *willing* to believe, yet He has also left some<br>ambiguity so as not to compel the *unwilling*.<br><br>In this way, God gives us the opportunity either to love Him or to<br>reject Him without violating our freedom. In fact, the purpose of this<br>life is to make that choice freely and without coercion. For love, by<br>definition, must be freely given. It cannot be coerced.<br><br>The simple fact is that we live in a fallen, evil world. And nowhere in<br>the Bible does it say that Christians should expect God to eliminate all<br>evil from their lives. It's not as if God promised to skip in front of<br>us with His great cosmic leaf-blower, clearing away all of the evil from<br>our path.<br><br>In fact, the Bible says exactly the opposite.<br><br>> *"I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In<br>> this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the<br>> world." --- John 16:33 NIV*<br><br>Jesus says that we are to *expect* trouble in this world. That's because<br>God doesn't promise good days. God promises a *great eternity*. Sadly,<br>some people look at the depravity of the sin and blame God for not<br>intervening, when He never promised to protect anyone from evil.<br><br>This fallen, evil world is full of sadness and pain. But God promises a<br>great eternity with Him for those who love Him and keep His commands.<br>The ones who do not know God and who actively reject Him will be<br>eternally separated from Him, suffering the eternal torment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
