<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is that you don\'t understand what being a fiscal<br>Conservative is.<br><br>Being a fiscal Conservative doesn\'t mean never spending money.<br><br>Being a fiscal Conservative does mean spending money on the things that<br>the government is mandated to do under the Constitution, and to avoid<br>spending money on things that are not part of the government\'s charter.<br><br>A fiscal Conservative looks to the Constitution to determine what it is<br>that the government should be spending money on. Since the Constitution<br>requires that the government raise and train a standing army, this is<br>something that we can spend money on. The Constitution requires the<br>government to promote the general welfare, and to do that, you need<br>electricity, sanitation, police and fire services, roads, etc. These are<br>all programs which fiscal Conservatives fully support as well.<br><br>And the statement that \"we spend more than the next 8 countries put<br>together\" is a useless fact. Does the fact that we spend more than<br>other countries mean that it is irresponsible or wrong to do so? Hardly.<br>There are many reasons that we spend so much on the military, but I\'ll<br>let my esteemed colleague [[Joshua<br>Alexander](https://www.quora.com/profile/Joshua-Alexander-356)]{.qlink_container}<br>answer that question for you:<br><br>[[Joshua Alexander\'s answer to Why does the US government spend so much<br>on<br>military?](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-US-government-spend-so-much-on-military/answer/Joshua-Alexander-356)]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
