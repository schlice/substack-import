<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>To answer your very specific question:<br><br>> *How can the 2nd Amendment be worded to the restrict gun ownership to<br>> actual members of a well-regulated militia like the National Guard?*<br><br>You can't re-word an amendment. You must repeal and replace the<br>amendment, since in its current wording, it applies to "the people,"<br>which has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to mean all citizens.<br>Never mind the whole "natural rights" thing and that the Bill of Rights<br>doesn't actually grant rights so it can't take them away; that<br>discussion is clearly above some, so we'll stick with the question as it<br>was asked. Specifically, you can't just "re-word" an amendment, you have<br>to repeal it and replace it with a new amendment.<br><br>And if you thought repealing and replacing Obamacare was difficult,<br>repealing and replacing the Second Amendment will be infinitely<br>harder. By the way, the rules for drafting and ratifying new amendments<br>are in Article V of the Constitution.<br><br>First, you need to *draft* an amendment. Sounds easy, right? But it's<br>not as simple as you or I writing words on a form and shoving it in a<br>mailbox. There are only two ways that a new amendment can be drafted:<br><br>1.  Congress (by a 2/3 vote in both houses) can draft a new amendment.<br>2.  An "Article V Convention," also called an "Amendments Convention,"<br>    can be called by 2/3 of the states, to propose and draft a new<br>    amendment.<br><br>Once the amendment has been drafted, the second step is to send it to<br>the states to be *ratified.* *3/4ths* of the states need to ratify<br>the amendment. Once you have the requisite number of states that ratify<br>the Amendment, it becomes part of the Constitution.<br><br>This means you have to get 3/4ths of the states to agree with you that<br>only the National Guard should have guns. Once you do that, maybe you<br>can repeal and replace the 2nd Amendment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
