<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>To add to<br>[Me(https://www.quora.com/profile/Me-9043)]{.qlink_container}'s<br>answer, I think you would be hard-pressed to categorize such a business<br>as a *scam*.<br><br>What it may be, more than a scam, is a very expensive, very unproven,<br>treatment option. Some people have found great success with stem cell<br>treatment. Some stem cell treatments (for example, treatment which<br>completely rebuilds your immune system using stem cells, after<br>destroying it with chemotherapy) are very dangerous and should only be<br>used when there are zero other options for treating your disease.<br><br>Stem cell treatments have not been proven to be effective. They haven't<br>been recognized by any governing body as a treatment which does anything<br>it claims to do. That doesn't mean it may not work. It just means that<br>it may not work with any regularity, or with any predictability. We also<br>don't know the *permanence* of such treatment. Does it wear off in a<br>year? Five years? Are there any undesirable side effects? Has anyone who<br>has received this treatment had his/her disease return, ever? And most<br>importantly for any treatment, how *safe* is it? What's the risk? Can it<br>kill you? Basically, is the treatment worse than the disease?<br><br>Until we know the answers to these questions, stem cell treatment is<br>still in its young, development phase. Not yet ready, IMHO, for prime<br>time.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
