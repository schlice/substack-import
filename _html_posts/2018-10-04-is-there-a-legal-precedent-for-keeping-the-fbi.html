<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there a legal precedent for keeping the FBI\'s report on Kavanaugh<br>from the public?**<br><br>Yes. It's not really a "report," but it's a background investigation.<br><br>It's a "supplemental" background investigation, in that it supplements<br>other background investigations.<br><br>As such, it contains personal and confidential information about a<br>person. Additionally, it contains information gleaned from other people.<br>There are so many privacy concerns, therefore, that it's unlikely that<br>the information from a background check will ever be released to the<br>public while the subjects are still alive. You will likely see a summary<br>of what's found (and I'm certain that Senators will be happy to put<br>their spin on what they read), but the actual documents themselves will<br>likely remain unreleased.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
