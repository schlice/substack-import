<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>"Forgive if you want to be forgiven" is a re-telling of the Golden Rule:<br>"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." It's actually in<br>the Bible:<br><br>> *"So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them,<br>> for this is the Law and the Prophets. \-- Matthew 7:12 ESV*<br><br>One of the key points we need to understand about forgiveness is that<br>the real issue is not so much between you and the other person. **It's<br>between you and God.** As you can see in Matthew 7:12, God commands us<br>to forgive. Jesus reiterates this when Peter asks Him about forgiveness:<br><br>> *Then Peter came up and said to him, "Lord, how often will my brother<br>> sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?" Jesus said<br>> to him, "I do not say to you seven times, but seventy-seven times. \--<br>> Matthew 18:21--22 ESV*<br><br>So when we forgive, we are following God's command.<br><br>But, as you pointed out, what about being able to bring your worship to<br>church if someone has something against us?<br><br>- If you have offended that person, yes you should go to them, ask for<br>  forgiveness, and put things right, as far as you are able. *But<br>  your forgiveness is not contingent upon their acceptance of your<br>  apology.* Because as we just showed, forgiveness is between you and<br>  God, not you and the other person.<br>- But if someone has offended you, don't go to them. Go to God. Your<br>  need to forgive others is first and foremost an issue between you and<br>  God. That actually makes sense if you stop and think about it. Your<br>  forgiveness cannot be dependent on someone else, otherwise it wouldn't<br>  be guaranteed.<br><br>And after you have forgiven them, they may not accept it. And in this<br>case, they may not be sorry, or they may not admit any wrongdoing.<br>Whether or not they do is not up to you. But regardless, you forgiving<br>them removes Satan's ability to use that issue against you.<br><br>How do you move on? You forgive. And if you're still feeling pain, their<br>hook is still in you. You haven't removed it yet, you haven't forgiven<br>them. You haven't let them "off the hook." But you might be thinking,<br>"But you don't know what they did to me! You don't know how much they<br>hurt me!" ***Don't you see that by leaving that hook in you, they're<br>still hurting you?***<br><br>So how do you stop the pain? Remove the hook! **You need to forgive<br>them.** If you are still feeling the affects of that offense, you have<br>not forgiven them. Yes, forgiving them lets them off the hook. If you<br>choose to not forgive them, you stay hooked to that pain. Maybe you<br>choose to not forgive them because when you do, you know that you are<br>letting them off the hook, and you feel like they are getting away with<br>it. But if you *don't*, you are the one with the hook still in you. You<br>will continue to feel the pain of that hook until you remove it.<br><br>But here is the beautiful part: ***while you may let them off of your<br>hook, you don't let them off of God's hook.***<br><br>> *Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God,<br>> for it is written, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord."<br>> \-- Romans 12:19 ESV*<br><br>Vengeance is mine. I will repay, says God. You don't have to worry about<br>letting them off the hook, because God has promised that He will not let<br>them off of His hook. So it's time to truly forgive them, knowing<br>that in the fullness of time, God will judge them for what they have<br>done, and they will receive the due penalty for hurting you. When you<br>choose to forgive, you are taking a step of faith to trust God to be the<br>judge who will weigh what has been done on the scales of justice and<br>demand that the scales balance. Everyone who has sinned against you will<br>have to stand before the throne of God and explain themselves. And the<br>scales can only be balanced in one of two ways: the blood of Christ for<br>those who believe in Him, or that person will have to pay the penalty<br>themselves if they do not. "I will repay, says the Lord." God will<br>balance the scales. We have to choose to trust His promise.<br><br>Now it's time to hand over all of that pain and those demands for<br>justice and vengeance to Him. He has promised to repay. You can walk<br>free of that pain, safe in the knowledge of God's promise.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
