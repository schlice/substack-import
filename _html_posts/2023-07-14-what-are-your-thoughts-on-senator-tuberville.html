<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's an interesting tactic.<br><br>Clearly, the policy he is protesting is illegal. Federal law only allows<br>the military to provide abortions in three very narrow circumstances:<br>rape, incest and threat to the life of the mother. Yet the DoD has<br>decided that it can rewrite Federal law with nothing more than a memo,<br>and allow servicemembers to travel using taxpayer funded travel to get<br>elective abortions, and providing paid time off to obtain such elective<br>abortions.<br><br>As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Tuberville<br>certainly has the right to oppose nominations for promotion for whatever<br>reason he chooses.<br><br>Most of the opposition on the Republican side of the house goes, "I<br>agree with what he's doing and he has the right to do it, but I wouldn't<br>do it that way."<br><br>But just because it's a hard-line stance and this is the hill he is<br>choosing to die on doesn't mean it's necessarily bad.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
