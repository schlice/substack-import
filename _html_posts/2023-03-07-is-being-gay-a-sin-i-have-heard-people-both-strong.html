title: '"Is being gay a sin? I have heard people both strongly side with yes and strongly
  side with no. If it is a sin, why? Where in the Bible does it say that being gay
  is bad? I thought we were supposed to love everyone, so why does it matter the gender?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with similar questions on Quora, people are not being precise enough<br>with this question.<br><br>**Having homosexual temptations is not a sin.\<br>Allowing those temptations to turn into something else (either sinful<br>thoughts or sinful acts) is sin.**<br><br>This is no different for the homosexual than it is for the heterosexual.<br>Look at the example of King David in the Bible. He went out on his<br>rooftop terrace one night at the palace, and he saw a woman, Bathsheba,<br>taking a bath on an adjacent rooftop, *and she was beautiful*. David<br>lusted after her, and after he took her, he killed her husband to cover<br>up his crime. This is chronicled in 2 Samuel if you want to read it<br>yourself.<br><br>The mechanism of sin is virtually the same for everyone, and it looks<br>just like David: I saw, I wanted, I took, I hid. The old adage is<br>definitely appropriate here: *the eyes are the window to the soul.* What<br>the eyes see can invade your soul and influence your actions.<br><br>Seeing Bathsheba was an accident, a temptation. That alone was not sin.<br>David sinned when he didn't look away. When he kept looking at her<br>and allowing his juices to get flowing, he fell into desire, and<br>desiring something which is not ours to desire is the sin of *lust*.<br><br>The pattern is no different for us. I saw, I wanted, I took, I hid. The<br>seeing is an accident, designed to tempt you to sin (and it is designed,<br>but not by God), but is not actually sin. Allowing yourself to proceed<br>further into *desiring something that is against God's will* is the sin.<br><br>What I'm saying here is that there is a very bright-line delineation<br>between temptation and sin. Just having homosexual temptations<br>is not a sin, and is a function of our fallen nature. Allowing that<br>temptation to proceed to desire *is* the sin. Seeing the fork in the<br>road is not a sin. Allowing the mind to think about what it would be<br>like to go down the sinful path, *and then proceeding down the sinful<br>path*, is.<br><br>> I thought we were supposed to love everyone, so why does it matter the<br>> gender?<br><br>We are supposed to love everyone. We're not supposed to have sex with<br>everyone. I think that's a fairly straightforward distinction to make.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
