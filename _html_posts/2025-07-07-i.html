<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You presumed that you're paying the same rate as other people who have<br>had auto claims, and that's a presumption you cannot make, and it's<br>largely incorrect.<br><br>Insurance companies can and do modify the rates of "problematic"<br>drivers. In some states, that calculus is mandated by state law. Here in<br>NC, "accident forgiveness" is not a thing. If you were at fault in an<br>accident, your insurance rates are going up, no questions asked, and<br>you'll pay that rate for no less than three years assuming you keep your<br>nose clean. That's because insurance rates are governed by *state law,*<br>not by the insurance company (when it comes to drivers who have negative<br>items on their driving history: at fault accidents, speeding tickets,<br>etc). The insurance company does this analysis in other states, raising<br>the rates charged to drivers who have negative items on their driving<br>history. But by and large, companies can afford to give "accident<br>forgiveness" in other states if it's your first minor accident and no<br>one was hurt and it's nothing other than an auto repair claim.<br><br>Additionally most large insurance companies offer you discounts for good<br>driving. Several of them offer vehicle monitoring devices which you plug<br>in to your OBD II port and connect to your phone, monitoring things like<br>excessive speed, hard braking, hard accelerating, etc. If the system<br>detects that you're a "good driver," you can get a discount of (in some<br>cases) up to 30% off of your premium. I know that Progressive and USAA<br>both use this system today; I'm certain other insurers do it also. So<br>while they may not necessarily change your premium because you're a good<br>driver (some do, but mostly not), they do offer *discounts* for safe<br>driving, and those can actually be fairly significant.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
