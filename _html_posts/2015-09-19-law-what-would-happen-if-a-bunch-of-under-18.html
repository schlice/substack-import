The age of the victim is what is considered, not the age of the<br>attacker.\<br>\<br>Depending on the jurisdiction, the juveniles may be treated as juveniles<br>and be charged with sexual assault. In some jurisdictions in the United<br>States, the age of the victims is close enough to 18 to try them as<br>adults.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
