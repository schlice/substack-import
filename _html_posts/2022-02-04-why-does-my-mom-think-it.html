<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let me ask you this question:<br><br>If you carry your baby to term and give it up for adoption, ***what<br>difference does it make?***<br><br>If you have been mentally scarred by your experience, and you simply<br>don't want to go through that again, and if it's truly "your body, your<br>choice," then if you choose to carry the baby to term, what's the harm<br>in that?<br><br>In other words, if you feel it is going to be better for your mental<br>health to carry the baby to term and then give it up for adoption, then<br>why do you care what your mother thinks about abortion vs adoption?<br><br>It doesn't matter whether or not abortion *actually* can cause mental<br>damage; there will be plenty of opinions on either side of the aisle.<br>None of them are relevant. What matters is what *you* think.<br><br>I truly believe it is your body, and you do get to choose. I would<br>*prefer* that you carry the baby to term and give it up for adoption<br>rather than killing it, but that's my preference, it has no bearing on<br>you or your life.<br><br>**TL;DR: Don't worry about what your mom thinks. It's your body, and<br>your life. Do what will be best for you.**<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why does my mom think it's so much easier to have an abortion than carry<br>to full term? I have had 2 abortions and 1 miscarriage, I am damaged<br>mentally and don't want to go through it again with this pregnancy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
