<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So let me get this straight. You think God should condition His love to<br>*others* based on how they treat *you?* Did I understand that right?<br>Doesn't that sound a bit *conceited* to you?<br><br>The truth is that God's love is *unconditional*. That means "no<br>conditions." He loves all of us equally. There is nothing you can do to<br>make Him love you less. There is also nothing you can do to make Him<br>love you *more*. He loves you when you do good, and He loves you when<br>you don't do as much good. There are literally no conditions on His<br>love.<br><br>So let's go back to your very first question: ***what is God's love<br>worth?***<br><br>The answer is that God's love is *priceless*. It's priceless, which<br>means it has no price. There is nothing you can pay to gain God's love.<br>I never have to do anything to merit God's love. He loves me *despite*<br>my sin. He loved me *even when I was still a sinner.*<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-31698bcf87f4a0fbd7fedfe5c1e6f90f){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-31698bcf87f4a0fbd7fedfe5c1e6f90f" master_w="640"<br>master_h="366"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(Image courtesy*<br>[*Kar3nt*(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=be5c6b&url=https://pixabay.com/users/kar3nt-15976817/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="pixabay.com"}]{.qlink_container} *at*<br>[*Pixabay*(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4597a8&url=https://pixabay.com/illustrations/ai-generated-lamb-of-god-8664141/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="pixabay.com"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br>> but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners,<br>> Christ died for us. --- Romans 3:8 ESV<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-6bfe7c8455a4973d11a0e6df97ddac52){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-6bfe7c8455a4973d11a0e6df97ddac52"<br>master_w="1024" master_h="1024"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
