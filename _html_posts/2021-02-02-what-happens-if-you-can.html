<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What happens if you can\'t afford to miss work for jury duty because<br>you're living check to check?**<br><br>Most jurisdictions allow for deferrals and excusals from jury duty.<br><br>You usually can't be excused from jury duty because of your employment<br>status. You may be able to be *deferred* from a particular reporting day<br>because of work requirements, but generally not *excused* completely.<br><br>If you have a financial hardship that prevents you from serving,<br>deferring your duty may give you the opportunity to pick a date in the<br>future that you can serve, and then requesting vacation from your work.<br><br>Most jurisdictions use the "one day, one trial" system whereby if you<br>are not selected for trial, your jury duty is over. Most trials don't<br>last longer than three days.<br><br>There are also employment laws which protect employees from being fired<br>because they were summoned to jury duty, but I can understand how<br>employers may abuse "at will" employment law to skirt that particular<br>rule.<br><br>I know that it sucks. I know that it is a tremendous hardship to go to<br>jury duty.<br><br>But ask yourself this question: ***if you were on the other side of the<br>courtroom, behind the defendant's table instead of in the jury box,<br>would you want someone to try to get themselves out of your jury?***<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
