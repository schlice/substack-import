<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>My 18 year old son read the question and said, "I'd punch that fucking<br>bitch in the face and say, 'Get the fuck out of here!'"<br><br>I can't disagree with his feelings, because that's exactly what I'd like<br>to do, but apparently with age comes some level of maturity. So while I<br>feel like he does, I must take issue with his methods.<br><br>So here's my take on it.<br><br>First of all, I know that pepper spray won't injure my dog. It will do<br>to my dog exactly what it does to me: it will sting my eyes and cause my<br>nose to run. It might irritate my sinus passages, and it might also<br>irritate my esophagus. I would have to watch my dog carefully over the<br>next few days to ensure that she wasn't suffering any unforeseen ill<br>effects from the spray, but I know that besides being in pain for some<br>time, she'll be fine.<br><br>Secondly, pepper spray is not a weapon in my state. It is a self-defense<br>tool. The person merely needs to feel threatened in order to deploy it.<br>However, I would argue that a muzzled dog isn't a threat to anyone, and<br>that the child approached the dog, not the other way around. It was the<br>*child* who was uncontrolled, not the *dog*. The woman's statement also<br>corroborates this account, as she essentially admitted that she<br>preemptively used her defensive tool as an offensive one, which would be<br>an improper use of a self defense tool. This, to me, would fall under my<br>state's definition of Cruelty to Animals, a violation of Colorado<br>Revised Statute 18--9--202. Conviction of Cruelty to Animals is a Class<br>1 Misdemeanor with a minimum fine of \$400, maximum fine of \$5000. In<br>addition to any other fine, a surcharge of up to \$400 shall be paid to<br>the county where the violation occurred to be put into the Animal<br>Cruelty Prevention fund.<br><br>Therefore, I would immediately be calling the police and getting a<br>report filed so that even if not convicted of an animal cruelty<br>violation, I'd know who to sue if there were any health-related<br>complications that followed the unlawful spraying.<br><br>Incidentally, I use a device on my dog called a Halti. There is a big<br>difference between a Halti...<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-b0fec1ddcbb73319972c19100b4c2af6){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-b0fec1ddcbb73319972c19100b4c2af6" master_w="200"<br>master_h="162"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>...and a muzzle.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-16c7554e521549c53105357f7a1fecfa){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-16c7554e521549c53105357f7a1fecfa" master_w="300"<br>master_h="300"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>The Halti almost looks like a muzzle to the uninformed, doesn't it?<br>(well not to me, but to each his own I guess). It's also called a<br>"gentle lead" as it corrects a dog's improper pulling against a leash by<br>closing the dog's mouth when it pulls against the leash. For both of my<br>Goldens, application of the Halti almost instantly stopped the pulling<br>on-leash. My current Golden is a stubborn little girl though, and if she<br>really wants to go see something, she will actually endure the<br>mouth-closing effects of the Halti so she can see what she wants to see.<br>Nevertheless, I had someone ask me once why my dog was muzzled, and so I<br>had to explain what a Halti was, while I marveled at the lack of<br>understanding of what a muzzle is.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
