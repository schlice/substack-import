<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can having multiple sclerosis make your food tastes change?<br><br>There are two separate questions here, and you could be asking either<br>one. My colleagues have been answering the first question: *does having<br>MS cause food to taste different?* There is a second question: *does<br>having MS cause your food "tastes" (i.e. preferences) to change?* I<br>think that the appropriate question for this cohort is the first one:<br>*does MS cause your food to taste different?*<br><br>One thing I will caution you about MS: Because MS affects everyone<br>differently, we can't really say whether or not any particular symptom<br>is or is not MS. There is a tendency, therefore, to assume *everything*<br>that is unknown is MS. We with MS tend to blame anything unusual or<br>unknown on MS. "My hip is constantly itchy. Think that's MS?" "My hair<br>has been so dry lately. Think that's the MS?" "My toenail is growing<br>crooked. It must be MS." In general, if it's highly unusual that a<br>symptom is found in the general population of people with MS, then it's<br>highly unlikely that your particular symptom is directly related to MS<br>disease activity, and you should probably rule out any other cause of<br>the symptom before assuming that it might be MS.<br><br>That said, it is at least *conceivable* that MS could cause your food to<br>taste different (i.e. could the nerve pathways be affected in such a way<br>that food now tastes different). However, it's highly unlikely. The area<br>of the brain which controls taste and the nerve pathways from the tongue<br>to the brain are not *usually* impacted by MS. However, there was at<br>least one rather fascinating study about taste and MS, and the<br>observation really nails why this might be important (emphasis<br>mine):<br><br>> *Our senses, particularly smell and taste, are critical to our<br>> appetite. If something is not appealing, we often choose not to eat<br>> it. That's no big problem if it is simply a few food items such as<br>> broccoli or salmon, both of which do not taste good to me and I skip<br>> those when offered; there are plenty of other foods such as steak and<br>> chocolate which do tickle my taste buds and appetite is not one of my<br>> problems. But for some people with MS, there is a concern about their<br>> nutrition and lack of desire to eat, which might be connected in some<br>> way to the food or beverages just not tasting good. This problem can<br>> also be a serious factor in affecting our quality of life. The authors<br>> \of the study\ mention that* ***this problem will not affect a large<br>> number of people with MS but it is worth taking note of by<br>> neurologists who are caring for people who struggle with caloric<br>> intake and maintaining weight.***<br>><br>> *Although there is no 'cure' for faulty wired taste buds, knowing this<br>> problem could be caused by food and drink not tasting right thanks to<br>> multiple sclerosis, might allow for adjustments to the diet of people<br>> with MS to meet their nutritional needs.*\[1\](#Otoly){#cite-Otoly<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>To summarize briefly, the study found that people with MS had a<br>significant difference in which categories of flavors (sweet, sour,<br>bitter, and salty) they were able to distinguish, with the largest<br>variances in the salty and sweet categories.<br><br>What the study *didn't* account for was MS medications. The medications<br>all work differently and have different methods of administration. It is<br>also at least conceivable that MS medications affect taste as much as MS<br>does.<br><br>Nevertheless, there is at least one clinical study which has shown that<br>some people with MS do indeed taste things differently, and while it's<br>not a tremendous number of people, it's at least statistically<br>significant. This is incredibly important for people with MS who also<br>have nutritional issues and who struggle with getting enough calories.<br>In other words, *part of the problem with their caloric intake may<br>simply be that food doesn't taste good anymore*.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-Otoly){.citation_index} [[Taste and MS -<br>MultipleSclerosis.net](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=18aaa2&url=https://multiplesclerosis.net/living-with-ms/taste/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="multiplesclerosis.net"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
