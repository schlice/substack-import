<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*The opposition regularly calls explicitly and implicitly for the<br>military to remove Sanders.*<br><br>The military works for the president, as he is the commander in chief.<br>Military members learn quickly that you can respect the *office* without<br>respecting the *person*. Calls for stupid things happen all the time<br>from Congress (i.e. calls to impeach Trump with zero evidence). People<br>just expect it now..<br><br>*Airports are closed, highways are blocked, and bridges are barricaded.<br>Amid this turmoil the calls for the military to restore order increase*.<br><br>Again, it\'s not going to have any effect on the military. The military<br>works for the people, as all military leaders are civilians. At the head<br>of every military chain is not a general, but a civilian. This ensures<br>that the military will always answer to the people. *But what if the<br>people want to remove the president by force?* Again, the military will<br>follow the Constitution even more closely than the politicians, and will<br>not actively violate it. All military members are empowered to disobey<br>an order which violates the Constitution. The military is very aware of<br>the Posse Comitatus Act, the Insurrection Act, and the Habeas Corpus<br>clause, which together prevent the military from interfering in civilian<br>law enforcement. Unless you have a wholesale rejection of the<br>Constitution (which is extremely unlikely), the military won\'t actively<br>violate it.<br><br>The way this is handled is through the state militia, also known as the<br>National Guard. If the fully constituted forces of the National Guard<br>can\'t handle an uprising, the governor can call for assistance from the<br>military. Their rules of engagement would make them accountable to the<br>governor only to quell an insurrection and restore order, and then they<br>are done.<br><br>What makes the US different from anywhere else is the premise of<br>individual accountability. No longer can you say, "I was just following<br>orders." That dog won\'t hunt any more. You are accountable for your own<br>actions and you suffer your own consequences, more so than anywhere<br>else.<br><br>It\'s a culture thing. If you're not from here, you wouldn\'t<br>understand.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-circumstances-would-precipitate-a-military-coup-in-the-USA/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
