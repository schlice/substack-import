<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If Attorney General Bill Barr is intentionally spinning the Mueller<br>Report to mislead Congress, the media, and the public in order to<br>protect Donald Trump, can he be convicted of obstruction of justice?**<br><br>You read that Barr is intentionally spinning the Mueller report to<br>mislead everyone in *Slate* magazine.<br><br>They have some notable quotes in that article, like this gem (emphasis<br>mine):<br><br>> \O<br> the question of whether Trump obstructed justice, Barr draws<br>> his own conclusion: "Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have<br>> concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's<br>> investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President<br>> committed an obstruction-of-justice offense." **That's Barr's opinion,<br>> not Mueller's**. As the letter concedes, Mueller "did not draw a<br>> conclusion one way or the other as to whether the examined conduct<br>> constituted obstruction." That's for the rest of us to decide.<br><br>"That's Barr's opinion, not Mueller's."<br><br>*Of course it is!* Mueller decided not to render an opinion on whether<br>or not the President obstructed justice.<br><br>When that happens, the evidence from the Special Counsel's investigation<br>is forwarded to the Attorney General (and the DOJ as a whole) ***and it<br>is up to them to decide whether or not obstruction charges are<br>warranted. Which they did.***<br><br>Specifically, from the letter, you should move on to the next paragraph,<br>and you'll understand how the DOJ came to that conclusion (again,<br>emphasis mine):<br><br>> In making this determination, we noted that **the Special Counsel<br>> recognized that \"the evidence does not establish that the President<br>> was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election<br>> interference,\" and that, while not determinative, the absence of<br>> such evidence bears upon the President\'s intent with respect to<br>> obstruction.** Generally speaking, to obtain and sustain an<br>> obstruction conviction, the government would need to prove beyond a<br>> reasonable doubt that ***a person, acting with corrupt intent, engaged<br>> in obstructive conduct with a sufficient nexus to a pending or<br>> contemplated proceeding.*** In cataloguing the President\'s actions,<br>> many of which took place in public view, **the report identifies no<br>> actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a<br>> nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with<br>> corrupt intent,** each of which, under the Department\'s principles of<br>> federal prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be<br>> proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an<br>> obstruction-ofÂ­-justice offense.<br><br>"That's for the rest of us to decide."<br><br>*Only if you think that your opinion is more important than the Attorney<br>General, who is actually charged with prosecuting crime.*<br><br>If you want to "decide," you should become the Attorney General. Until<br>then, it's up to the AG and the DOJ to decide if a crime was committed.<br><br>And, Congress can review that determination (which they will, no doubt,<br>do).<br><br>But it's not up to "the rest of us" to decide. But because *Slate*<br>thinks they know better than the Attorney General, the DOJ, or the<br>Special Counsel, they believe they should.<br><br>And they're trying to convince you of the same.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
