<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'ll start with MS, and move to Parkinson\'s. With MS,<br>the short answer is: it depends. MS affects everyone who has it<br>differently, so there is no easy answer about what a MS patient cannot<br>do. Some of the most common symptoms of MS include vision loss, muscle<br>weakness, and memory and cognition problems, but again, those are common<br>problems. MS can manifest itself differently in different people.\<br>\<br>With Parkinson\'s, the short answer is the same, but Parkinson\'s<br>produces gradual degradation in the patient\'s ability to perform gross<br>motor movements. So eventually, Parkinson\'s patients will be unable to<br>walk or talk.]<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
