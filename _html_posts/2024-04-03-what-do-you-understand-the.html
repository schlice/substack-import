<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is in Revelation, primarily in Revelation 13, and it is<br>related to the "end times," the times when the Great Deceiver will unite<br>all the nations of the world. He will appear to be a savior, but he will<br>actually be Satan. He's sometimes referred to as "the Antichrist." He<br>will also be assisted by the "false prophet," and it is this being who<br>forces everyone to take the mark. It will include something visible to<br>everyone, either on the right hand or on the forehead.<br><br>Revelation tells us that he will make everyone take a mark in order to<br>participate in financial transactions in society. In order to buy or<br>sell in the new world, you will have to take the mark. It will only be<br>given to those who worship the Antichrist.<br><br>People have been worried that many modern-day items could be the mark.<br>Some are worried about RFID chips in the hand, and are claiming them to<br>be the mark. They are not. They may be part of what will ultimately<br>become the mark, but simply having a microchip embedded in your hand is<br>not, in itself, the mark. Remember that the mark is something visible on<br>the hand or head, not just a card that you carry, and the mark is only<br>given to those who worship the Antichrist, who is a single entity. Some<br>people were worried about the COVID-19 vaccine, or "vaccine passports,"<br>being the mark; they are not. But the idea is headed in the same<br>direction as the mark. However, the mark will be something visible, on<br>the right hand or on the forehead, and it will be affirmatively given<br>only to those who freely worship the Antichrist.<br><br>2 Thessalonians tells us that we will know who the Antichrist is when he<br>is revealed. So we are certainly not there yet. Also, when he is<br>revealed, it will be clear how the number 666 relates to him, so we can<br>use that to dispel the idea that any of our current national leaders are<br>the Antichrist. Our friends at<br>[BibleRef.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c6f9e0&url=http://BibleRef.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container} explain the two clear<br>events detailed in 2 Thessalonians which will herald the time of the<br>Antichrist:<br><br>> First, there will be \"the rebellion.\" This likely means an overt and<br>> extreme revolt against truth. The word translated \"rebellion\" can<br>> also be translated, \"the falling away,\" \"the apostasy,\" or \"the<br>> departure.\" The use of a definite article---\"the\" in English, from<br>> *hÄ“* in Greek---attached to the word for \"rebellion\" indicates a<br>> specific event previously mentioned in the passage. It may refer to<br>> Israel\'s revolt against Old Testament teaching when the nation turns<br>> to idolatry. Perhaps it refers to the state of the world following the<br>> departure of the church due to the rapture. It is noteworthy that Paul<br>> describes the rapture in verse 1 as \"*the* coming of our Lord Jesus<br>> Christ and our being gathering together to him.\"<br>><br>> The second event Paul mentions in verse 3 is the appearance of \"the<br>> man of lawlessness,\" \"the son of destruction.\" Based on the<br>> description of this man\'s activities, it seems probable that he is<br>> one of the two infamous figures described in Revelation 13. God will<br>> punish the man of lawlessness by consigning him to eternal punishment<br>> in the lake of fire (Revelation 19:20--21).<br>> \[1\](#qcTqj){#cite-qcTqj .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-qcTqj){.citation_index} [[What does 2 Thessalonians 2:3<br>mean?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=feae0d&url=https://www.bibleref.com/2-Thessalonians/2/2-Thessalonians-2-3.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
