<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If stopped by a law enforcement officer, are you required to tell them<br>where you are going or where you\'ve been?**<br><br>In the United States, you are not required to converse with the officer<br>about anything other than the reason for which you were stopped, which<br>is your driving behavior.<br><br>You are required to give your real name. You are required to present<br>your driver's license and other secondary information (registration,<br>proof of insurance) if they are required in your state.<br><br>Beyond that, you are under no obligation to try to explain your driving<br>behavior. You can let the officer's perception of your behavior stand<br>without explanation, and you can accept your ticket and move on.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
