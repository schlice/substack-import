<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [We can\'t keep the mentally ill away from guns until we<br>can do a better job of identifying *who* is mentally ill, and<br>*what* constitutes a mental illness that is severe enough that it<br>can\'t be treated. Basically, until we fix the mental health system in<br>this country, there are no more laws or restrictions that we can pass<br>that will make any substantive difference without unduly burdening<br>law-abiding gun owners.\<br>\<br>The gun laws are not the issue. The treatment of mental health is the<br>issue.<br>[Deinstitutionalization(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=18cb6f&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinstitutionalization){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} has been great for most<br>inpatients, but it has indeed left a portion of the mental health<br>population, literally, \"out in the cold.\" It has marginalized that<br>group and has led to some not being treated at all. I want to quote the<br>above-linked page from Wikipedia, because it says exactly what I was<br>trying to say, but more succintly.\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> With the closing of these state mental institutions it has become<br>> increasingly difficult for people who suffer from severe mental<br>> illness to receive treatment in a facility. Many mentally ill<br>> individuals were left homeless after Deinstitutionalization, making up<br>> one-third of the homeless population (D.E. Torrey). Today the most<br>> prominent treatment for the severely mentally ill is incarceration in<br>> a correctional facility, where mentally ill individuals are not<br>> receiving adequate care for their<br>> disorder.[\[22\](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5e572d&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinstitutionalisation%23cite_note-22){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>> \<br>> \\...\\<br>> \<br>> Although deinstitutionalisation has been positive for the majority of<br>> patients, it also has severe shortcomings. Expectations that community<br>> care would lead to fuller social integration have not been achieved;<br>> many remain without work, have limited social contacts, and often live<br>> in sheltered<br>> environments.[\[23\](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e5d51a&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinstitutionalisation%23cite_note-Torrey_Shadows-23){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>> \<br>> New community services are often uncoordinated and unable to meet<br>> complex needs. Services in the community sometimes isolate the<br>> mentally ill within a new ghetto, where service users meet each other<br>> but have little contact with the rest of the public community. It has<br>> been said that instead of \"[[community<br>> psychiatry](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d392c0&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_psychiatry){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}\", reforms established<br>> a \"psychiatric<br>> community\".[\[7\](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4981f8&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinstitutionalisation%23cite_note-Fakhourya07-7){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>> \<br>> Existing patients are often discharged without sufficient preparation<br>> or support. A greater proportion of people with mental disorders<br>> become homeless or go to<br>> prison.[\[7\](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4981f8&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinstitutionalisation%23cite_note-Fakhourya07-7){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>> \<br><br>And finally, the issue we are seeing most recently with the most violent<br>(emphasis mine):\<br><br>> \<br>> Families can often play a crucial role in the care of those who would<br>> typically be placed in long-term treatment centres. However, many<br>> mentally ill people are resistant to such help due to the nature of<br>> their conditions. **The majority of those who would be under<br>> continuous care in long-stay psychiatric hospitals are paranoid and<br>> delusional to the point that they refuse help, believing they do not<br>> need it, which makes it difficult to treat<br>> them**.[\[24\](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60128a&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinstitutionalisation%23cite_note-24){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\<br>While deinstitutionalization has helped many rejoin active community<br>life, a portion of those people **actually needed continuous psychiatric<br>care** and are not getting it, because the laws have changed such that<br>entry into psychiatric care is generally only court-ordered or emergency<br>room physician ordered. This means that the vast majority of people that<br>really require continuous psychiatric care are actually on the streets<br>or incarcerated. The top three mental institutions in this country in<br>terms of population are prisons, [[the largest being the Cook County<br>Jail in Chicago,<br>Illinois](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ba425b&url=http://thttp://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/americas-largest-mental-hospital-is-a-jail/395012/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}.\<br>\<br>The sad fact is that by implementing a process of deinstitutionalization<br>to try to re-integrate the mentally ill who can be successfully treated<br>with antipsychotics, we have actually created a population of people who<br>can\'t be treated on an outpatient basis. In other words, ***we have<br>created this problem ourselves***.\<br>\<br>We need common-sense reform of psychiatric care in this country so that<br>these people can be treated in continuous care facilities. We need to<br>remove the stigma that accompanies mental health. We need better<br>integration between psychiatrists (who generally do not counsel) and<br>mental health counselors (who generally cannot prescribe medications).\<br>\<br>Our mental health system is a mess, and many seriously ill patients who<br>need help either end up in jail or on the 6 o\'clock news.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
