<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Hardware: No difference at all. The hardware runs on both<br>networks interchangeably.\<br>Software: Both carriers took Samsung\'s TouchWiz operating systems and<br>modified it, adding their own proprietary software to the OS which allow<br>it to work seamlessly with their specific networks. In addition, they<br>\"SIM-lock\" the devices to only allow SIMs for their specific networks.<br>Once the contract is up, the carriers will unlock the device so that<br>they can install a SIM from another GSM provider.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
