<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In general, answers to HOA questions are going to be "check your CC&Rs"<br>and in this case, it's no different. Check your CC&Rs to find the exact<br>correct answer for your HOA.<br><br>*In general*, in most HOAs, the Board of Directors does not need<br>additional approval to raise dues, implement fees, or impose special<br>assessments, with some exceptions. Some construction projects may need<br>homeowner approval before they are started, but some repair-related<br>assessments do not need prior approval.<br><br>The Board is normally specifically empowered to maintain the budget and<br>collect money as needed.<br><br>But again, as always, check your own CC&Rs to get the specific rules for<br>your HOA.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitationo to ffer legal advice regarding specific facts.
