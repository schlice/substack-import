<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How does the government get away with so many illegal taxes that they<br>impose on us?**<br><br>I suppose first you'd have to identify what taxes you consider to be<br>"illegal." I wasn't aware that the government had a restriction on what<br>taxes they can legally levy and what taxes are "against the law" to<br>levy. I know that poll taxes are specifically restricted, but I haven't<br>seen a poll tax in a long time.<br><br>There was a time when the courts said that taxes which were regulatory<br>in nature (rather than revenue-producing) were not Constitutional, but<br>they reversed that position. Taxes which are purely regulatory (i.e.<br>designed to get you to behave in a certain way) are legal, and several<br>court decisions provided for the legality of those taxes. Most recently,<br>the court ruled on *National Federation of Independent Business v.<br>Sebelius (2012)*, which found that a purely regulatory tax (the<br>"individual mandate" portion of Obamacare) was Constitutional<br>specifically because it operated as a tax.<br><br>Anyway, if we assume that the government is actually taxing citizens in<br>violation of the law, they get away with it because no one challenges<br>it.<br><br>To challenge it, here's what you have to do:<br><br>1.  Get taxed with an "illegal" tax. This gives you *standing* to<br>    challenge the legality of the tax. If you aren't actually taxed with<br>    an illegal tax, you can't challenge the tax in court.<br>2.  Refuse to pay the tax.<br>3.  Receive some sort of fine for failing to pay the tax.<br>4.  Challenge the fine in court, claiming that the tax is illegal.<br><br>If they find that the tax is actually not illegal, you will owe the tax,<br>the fines, and any interest on the tax and the fines.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
