<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you already own your home, any HOA formed will be a *voluntary* HOA.ยน<br>You are under no obligation to join the HOA. The only time you become<br>part of a mandatory HOA is if it is part of your purchase agreement.<br>Mandatory HOAs can only be attached to properties if 100% of the<br>landowners agree. Developers can create mandatory HOAs because they own<br>all of the properties during the development phase.<br><br>If an HOA is formed later on, it is voluntary. You are not obligated to<br>join. That said, you won't get any of the benefits of joining. Perhaps<br>the HOA decided to build a fitness center in the neighborhood on a piece<br>of property owned by someone. The HOA could allow you access to that<br>fitness center. That's just an example of what a voluntary HOA could do.<br>But even if the voluntary HOA performs services for you, you are not<br>obligated to join it.<br><br>\<br><br>ยน *As mentioned, if a community gets 100% approval to create a mandatory<br>HOA, it can be done, but in order to become mandatory and binding on all<br>current and future homeowners, it must be done with 100% approval.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
