<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: Constitutionally-speaking, a fetus has a right to keep and<br>bear arms. Rights are for "the people" and that includes all people.<br><br>But like all rights, it is not unlimited. The Federal government<br>controls pretty heavily who may purchase and possess a firearm. Firearms<br>ownership and possession are subject to reasonable regulations. And no<br>one is claiming that a fetus would qualify under those reasonable<br>regulations.<br><br>So while a fetus has the right to keep and bear arms, the fetus doesn't<br>have any ability to exercise that right under Federal regulations.<br><br>It also doesn't have the physical ability to do so, but don't let<br>reality get in the way of your hypothetical.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Does a fetus have a right to own a firearm?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
