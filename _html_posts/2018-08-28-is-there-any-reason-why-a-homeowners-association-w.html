<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there any reason why a homeowners association would react<br>negatively to a homeowner with bee hives in their backyard?**<br><br>There are several reasons why an HOA would react negatively to a<br>homeowner maintaining an apiary (bee hives) in their backyard.<br><br>In all cases, you must check your Governing Documents to see exactly<br>what issues your HOA may have with apiaries. All Governing Documents are<br>specific, and none are exactly the same. I can't tell you specifically<br>what your HOA may be concerned with, but it may be one or more of the<br>following:<br><br>1.  The bees may be prohibited under the "pets" category of the HOA<br>    Rules and Regulations. In that case, the R&R may specify what pets<br>    you are allowed to keep, and what pets are not. In general, where<br>    pets are limited, they are limited to "common" household pets (dogs,<br>    cats, birds, etc). "Exotic" or otherwise uncommon pets are generally<br>    prohibited.<br>2.  Also common in HOA R&Rs: "nuisance" rules. Anything which may<br>    constitute a "nuisance" is generally prohibited.<br>3.  The apiary may be covered as a "business" you run out of your home.<br>    While generally allowed, the business cannot cause things like<br>    increased vehicle traffic in the neighborhood, or other nuisances.<br>    An inordinate amount of bees in the neighborhood might be considered<br>    a nuisance caused by your business, which might give them pause.<br>4.  Allergies are a big deal these days. For the safety of neighborhood<br>    children, the HOA may restrict your apiary so that they can mediate<br>    the increased risk of bee stings by not artificially increasing the<br>    number of bees in the neighborhood.<br><br>In addition to reviewing your Governing Documents, I would suggest<br>getting in contact with the Board and pre-approving your apiary before<br>starting it. If they do allow it, there may be other pre-requisites they<br>have (i.e. getting industry certifications before starting, etc).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
