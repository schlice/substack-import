<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What are the HOA compliant alternatives to grass?<br><br>Are you asking this forum if we know your HOA's landscaping rules?<br><br>The rules for each HOA are completely different. You will need to<br>consult your HOA's governing documents to determine what exterior<br>landscaping is acceptable to your HOA.<br><br>In some cases, HOA rules regarding grass are unenforceable due to water<br>restrictions. For example, our original landscaping policy was not<br>written during a water shortage, and we originally required homeowners'<br>landscaping plans to consist of at least 50% turf grass in the front.<br>Once water restrictions were put in place, that portion of the rules<br>became unenforceable.<br><br>These days, we have an extensive Xeriscape guide in our Landscaping<br>Policy. In all cases, homeowners who want to make changes to the<br>exterior of their homes (including landscaping) must submit their<br>proposed changes to the Architectural Review Committee before they<br>implement those changes. It's a fair bet that your HOA has a similar<br>function defined. Make sure you check with them and follow that<br>procedure before you make changes. If you don't, and your changes<br>wouldn't have been approved, you could be on the hook for the cost of<br>fixing it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
