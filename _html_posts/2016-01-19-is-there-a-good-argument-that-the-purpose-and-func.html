<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When military police detain a military member, he is not arrested and<br>thrown in the brig. He may be held in a detention cell temporarily, but<br>he is not hauled off to jail. He is turned over to his commander (or<br>first sergeant if he is enlisted). His commander then decides whether or<br>not Article 15 proceedings will be initiated, based on a review of all<br>the evidence provided by investigators. Accordingly, that commander will<br>be held to account for his eventual decision. Nevertheless, a commander<br>is involved, up until the point where an Article 15 proceeding begins.<br>Following that decision, the military justice system takes over, and<br>military lawyers are involved. Military lawyers both argue for the<br>government, and defend the accused. Article 15 hearings are held in<br>front of a panel comprised of both military judges and military<br>commanders (not the commander of the defendant\'s unit).<br><br>I hope this answers your question.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
