<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The article doesn't say that at all.<br><br>The article doesn't say that "Trump will force department stores to say<br>Merry Christmas." What the article says is that Trump stated:<br><br>> \"They don\'t use the word Christmas because it is not politically<br>> correct,\" Trump said, complaining that department stores will use red<br>> and Christmas decorations but say \"Happy New Year.\" \"We\'re saying<br>> Merry Christmas again.\"<br>><br>> \...\<br>><br>> \"You go into a department store. When was the last time you saw<br>> \'Merry Christmas?\' You don\'t see it anymore,\" Trump said on the<br>> campaign trail. \"They want to be politically correct. If I\'m<br>> president, you will see \'Merry Christmas\' in department stores,<br>> believe me, believe me.\"<br><br>Note that he doesn't say *how* he plans on getting department stores to<br>say Merry Christmas, but if I had to venture a guess, it would be by<br>example. He will probably champion the causes of those whom he believes<br>are being discriminated against because of their faith. He will probably<br>use the term himself. He will probably also stand behind people who are<br>attacked because of their religion, and stunningly in America, this is<br>mostly directed at Christianity, not the oft-maligned Muslim:<br><br>> Attacks on the expression of religion in the "public square" of<br>> government and public property, land, and buildings are not recent.<br>> For many years, those opposed to crosses and monuments in public<br>> places have attempted to use the courts to have these displays<br>> declared unconstitutional, often under Establishment Clause grounds.<br>> However, zealous atheist groups increasingly have focused their<br>> hostility on private religious expression which is only very tenuously<br>> connected to government. They have continued to harass small towns and<br>> localities which merely maintain the traditions handed to them<br>> involving years of public prayer, displays of religious history on<br>> public buildings, or crosses on veterans' memorials. Often, not<br>> knowing any better and lacking proper counsel, localities capitulate<br>> to the demands of those hostile to any public expression of<br>> faith.\[1\](#JYngh){#cite-JYngh .citation_link}<br><br>He will probably also attempt to pressure businesses to allow their<br>employees to use whatever seasonal greeting they choose. He will likely<br>face a great deal of push-back for that, but if NFL players can express<br>personal opinions while they are at work and not be fired for it, why<br>can't a Macy's employee say "Merry Christmas" to a customer as they<br>leave the store?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-JYngh){.citation_index}<br>[http://downloads.frc.org/EF/EF17\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a9d4ae&url=http://downloads.frc.org/EF/EF17F51.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="frc.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
