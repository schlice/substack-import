You might consider reaching out to some of those.\<br>\<br>Also, your absolute best bet is to reach out to the [[National MS<br>Society](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=26e11d&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} as their chapters<br>can publicize information about upcoming drug trials to their clients.<br>They can also direct you to other locations where you can continue to<br>spread the word about your trial.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
