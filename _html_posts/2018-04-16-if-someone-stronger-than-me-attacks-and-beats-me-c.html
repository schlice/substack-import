<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If someone stronger than attacking me and beating me can I stab them<br>as a self defense or should I just take the beating?**<br><br>The answer to this is more than a simple yes or no.<br><br>Let's keep our answer focused on the United States.<br><br>In general, if you are in fear for your life, you can use any amount of<br>force, up to and including lethal force, to defend your life. So in the<br>United States, if you are in fear for your life, and you can articulate<br>that fear, your actions can be justified as self defense. Remember that<br>this is an *affirmative defense,* which means you admit that you stabbed<br>your attacker, but you did so only to defend your own life or to defend<br>yourself from grievous bodily harm.<br><br>If you can articulate the honestly-held belief that you were in fear for<br>your life, you may likely have a defense against the assault charge<br>which will be leveled against you. But remember you will have to defend<br>your actions in court.<br><br>(EDIT) I also recognize that a small handful of states don't universally<br>give you the right to defend yourself without first trying to escape.<br>These are called "duty to retreat" states. However, most states have<br>what's called a "Stand Your Ground" clause in their self-defense law.<br>States began expanding their self-defense laws in the 1980s, when a<br>handful of states added clauses stating that citizens have a right to<br>feel secure inside their homes, and can use whatever force necessary, up<br>to and including deadly force, to defend themselves against intruders<br>into their homes. These are commonly referred to as "castle doctrine<br>laws," referring to the phrase "a man's home is his castle."<br><br>In 2005, Florida expanded further, creating what is now commonly<br>referred to as "Stand Your Ground" laws, essentially expanding their<br>castle doctrine laws to "any place you are legally allowed to be."<br>Florida's law states "a person who is not engaged in an unlawful<br>activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a<br>right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her<br>ground and meet force with force, including deadly force, if he or she<br>reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great<br>bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the<br>commission of a forcible felony." Other states quickly followed suit,<br>and at least 25 states have Stand your Ground clauses in their<br>self-defense laws.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice.
