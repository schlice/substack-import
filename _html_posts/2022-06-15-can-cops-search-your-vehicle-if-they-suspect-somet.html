<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is *maybe*. And it depends on what you mean by "suspect." Why<br>do they suspect something illegal is in it? Their suspicion must amount<br>to what we call "probable cause."<br><br>When it comes to anything besides cars, probable cause must be the basis<br>for obtaining a search warrant. But there is an exception for cars. The<br>police can search your car without a warrant if they have probable cause<br>to believe that evidence or contraband is in the vehicle. Cars are<br>excepted because there is "a lower expectation of privacy because of the<br>regulations under which they operate. Also, the ease of mobility creates<br>an inherent exigency to prevent the removal of evidence and<br>contraband."\[1\](#SlscF){#cite-SlscF .citation_link}<br><br>However, and any time a police officer wants to search a car, he must<br>have probable cause. Probable cause is "a reasonable amount of<br>suspicion, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong to justify a<br>prudent and cautious person\'s belief that certain facts are probably<br>true\"\[2\](#PYYrA){#cite-PYYrA .citation_link}<br><br>So if a police officer **orders you to get out of the car so they<br>can search**, allow them to do so and then tell your lawyer.<br><br>But if a police officer *asks* **if he can search your vehicle,<br>he does not have probable cause.** If he had probable cause, he'd yank<br>you out of the car and search it. If he's asking you for permission, he<br>does not have probable cause. You can politely tell him to go pound sand<br>and to get a warrant.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can cops search your vehicle if they suspect something illegal is inside<br>it?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-SlscF){.citation_index} [[Motor vehicle exception -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=03aa87&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_exception%23:~:text%3DThe%2520motor%2520vehicle%2520exception%2520is,vehicle%2520without%2520a%2520search%2520warrant.){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-PYYrA){.citation_index} [[Probable cause -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e36274&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
