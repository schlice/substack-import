<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, the found votes are not necessarily proof that fraud has taken<br>place.<br><br>They are, however, proof that mail-in voting is a medium rife for abuse,<br>and a vivid demonstration that mail-in voting is not nearly as "safe" or<br>"secure" as everyone has been saying it is.<br><br>Do we have proof? Not really. We have never had widespread mail-in<br>voting. Some states have all mail-in balloting, but if they believe<br>their system is good, they're not going to be looking very closely for<br>problems. Additionally, people claim that mail-in balloting is safe<br>because it's always been safe, and that's not entirely accurate. We have<br>had *absentee balloting* in the past, not widespread mail-in voting. And<br>your mail-in voting system is only as secure as your requirements on<br>voters.<br><br>This is why we should go back to the original system, and limit absentee<br>ballots to those who will physically be outside of the state on Election<br>Day, or who are physically incapable of going to a polling place on<br>Election Day.<br><br>TL;DR: **mail-in voting makes your election less secure and more<br>susceptible to malicious and accidental tampering.**<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**Are the \"found\" votes in MI, WI, and PA proof of the fraud involved<br>in mail-in voting?**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
