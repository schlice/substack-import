<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I found out the system and contents from my Android device has been<br>cloned by someone of malicious intend and spread to several others. How<br>do I stop that and regain my privacy? Will the factory reset reverse the<br>clone? Any practical tips?**<br><br>First, I find the premise of this question highly unlikely, unless you<br>have rooted your own Android device, or the person works for your<br>carrier and has access to carrier-specific hardware technical support<br>tools.<br><br>Modern versions of Android are protected from "cloning" by anyone. The<br>operating system and the applications reside in protected memory space.<br>They cannot be directly accessed, unless you have gained "root"<br>privilege (the superuser). On a non-rooted system, the root user is<br>inaccessible, and thus so is the data in those protected memory areas.<br>This means that the data within your apps is not accessible from outside<br>of your apps, unless you intentionally exported that data.<br><br>It is possible that your personal data storage was accessed. This would<br>be your downloads folder, your documents, your pictures, any media files<br>you may have uploaded, and any files you may have saved while browsing<br>the Internet. This is a crime, and should be reported to the police if<br>you have evidence of this.<br><br>If you have rooted your phone, a factory reset *may* reverse the root.<br>Some root tools install themselves in the boot partition, and can<br>"re-root" the device upon factory reset. If you used one of these tools,<br>you may have to uninstall it first before factory resetting your device<br>to ensure that it will not be rooted again upon wipe and reset.<br><br>For most normal cases in which you have not rooted your device, a<br>factory reset will restore the configuration to a default state.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
