<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can so many Christian\'s be so certain that God exists, even with<br>such a lack of evidence? Faith means belief even without evidence, so<br>how?**<br><br>Let's start with the second sentence, the claim that "faith means belief<br>without evidence." That is a simply ridiculous statement. Faith is most<br>certainly not belief without evidence. *Faith is trust based on<br>evidence*. But you claim that there is no "evidence." What exactly do<br>you count as evidence? It sounds like you maybe are thinking that<br>"evidence" is instead "logical proof." Indeed, what evidence is there<br>for your idiosyncratic definition of evidence? If you can't provide<br>evidence for how you define evidence, your position self-destructs<br>before it even begins.<br><br>But if you want to talk about faith, let's look at some things you have<br>faith in:<br><br>- The existence of a physical world outside of your mind<br>- The existence of other people<br>- The reliability of your senses<br>- The comprehensibility of nature<br><br>You can't provide evidence for these beliefs that don't assume them. You<br>simply take them as faith.<br><br>The evidence for God is clear. But God doesn't *make* you believe.<br>Because that's not what he wants. He gave you free will. But if he<br>announced his presence with trumpets and angels and massive displays of<br>power, you would be stupid *not* to believe, and that's the exact<br>opposite of free will.<br><br>When we discuss evidence for the existence of God, I prefer the "Why and<br>Wherefore" argument, because it discusses the why's and wherefores of<br>"stuff" existing --- anything that physically exists, like matter,<br>energy, laws of physics, etc. The basics of the argument are simple:<br><br>1.  There must be some explanation as to why stuff exists, instead of<br>    nothing existing at all.<br>2.  There are only two explanations for why stuff exists:<br>    1.  Stuff *must* exist, or<br>    2.  Something else made stuff exist.<br>3.  There is nothing which shows that stuff must exist.<br>4.  Therefore, some necessary and eternal something else made stuff<br>    exist.<br>5.  There are only two possibilities for what could have made stuff<br>    exist:<br>    1.  An eternal universe<br>    2.  An eternal creator<br>6.  To date, all evidence points away from an eternal universe and<br>    towards an eternal creator.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
