<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because that's the definition of repentance.<br><br>The word \"repent\" comes from the Greek word metanoeō, which means \"to<br>change one\'s mind.\" Its literal translation combines two Greek words,<br>"meta" and "noieo" which means to "think differently." From Strong's<br>Concurrence:<br><br>> Repent\<br>> Μετανοήσατε (Metanoēsate)\<br>> Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural\<br>> [[Strong\'s<br>> 3340:](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5fa64a&url=https://biblehub.com/greek/strongs_3340.htm){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="biblehub.com"}<br>> ]{.qlink_container}From meta and noieo; to think differently or<br>> afterwards, i.e. Reconsider.<br><br>In order to repent, you must think differently about sin. It's a literal<br>turning away from the thoughts of sin.<br><br>It is sometimes conflated with another Greek word:<br><br>> turn back\<br>> ἐπιστρέψατε (epistrepsate)\<br>> Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural\<br>> [[Strong\'s<br>> 1994:](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7be9f6&url=https://biblehub.com/greek/strongs_1994.htm){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="biblehub.com"}<br>> ]{.qlink_container}From epi and strepho; to revert.<br><br>But that's the word which literally means "to turn back." We can see it<br>in Acts 3:19, where both Greek words are used together:<br><br>> *Repent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out,<br>> \-- Acts 3:19 ESV*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
