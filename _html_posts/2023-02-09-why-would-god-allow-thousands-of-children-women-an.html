<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It doesn't make sense, right? If this so-called God is so omnipotent and<br>omnipresent, why didn't He stop these people from suffering? All of<br>these wonderful lives, just cut short. It seems all so pointless.<br><br>To phrase the question in another way: **why do bad things happen to<br>good people?**<br><br>First of all, **if you believe that somehow God is obligated to explain<br>Himself to us, you ought to do a better job reading the Bible**.<br>Proverbs 25:2 says, "It is the glory of God to conceal a matter." Isaiah<br>45:15 says, "Truly You are a God who hides Himself." First Corinthians<br>2:11 says, "No one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God."<br>Deuteronomy 29:29 says, "The secret things belong to the Lord our God"<br>(NKJV). Ecclesiastes 11:5 says, "As you do not know the path of the<br>wind, or how the body is formed in a mother's womb, so you cannot<br>understand the work of God, the Maker of all things." Isaiah 55:8--9<br>says, "'For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My<br>ways,' declares the Lord. 'As the heavens are higher than the earth, so<br>are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts higher than your<br>thoughts.'"<br><br>It appears as if the Bible is telling us we don't have the capacity to<br>understand God's infinite mind or the plans He has for us. It's<br>arrogance for us to believe we have the ability to understand the mind<br>of God. It's like you standing over a pregnant mother's womb and trying<br>to explain what life is like on the other side, in such a way that the<br>baby in the womb would understand. That baby simply doesn't yet possess<br>the capacity to understand. Paul told the believers in Corinth, "Now we<br>see but a poor reflection; then we shall see face to face. Now, I know<br>in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known" (1 Cor.<br>13:12). Paul was basically saying that we may not ever gain full<br>understanding while we are alive on earth, and we probably need to learn<br>to accept that.<br><br>Secondly, **no one ever said that being a Christian would mean a<br>problem-free life**. If you've ever looked into any of the lives of the<br>great men and women of the Bible, their lives were not the most<br>glamorous. Look at Joseph. His brothers and sisters hated him so much,<br>they sold him into slavery. When in Egypt, he was thrown in prison,<br>falsely accused of rape, and threatened with execution. During the<br>entire ordeal, there is no indication in the Bible that God explained<br>His plan to Joseph. He was simply expected to live out his life in<br>less-than-complete understanding, as you and I are. *What pleased God<br>was Joseph's faithfulness when nothing else made sense*. Stephen was<br>stoned because he proclaimed God's name. James was put to death with a<br>sword for his faithfulness. Paul was persecuted, stoned, flogged, and<br>beheaded in a Roman prison. During their lifetimes, they never knew<br>God's great plan for them. Jesus said that life wouldn't be easy. He<br>said, "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace.<br>In this world, you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome<br>the world" (John 16:33).<br><br>Throughout the Bible, it tells us not only that bad times can happen,<br>but that we should *expect* bad times to come because they will. Yet<br>somehow, we still expect God to take away all of our problems, skipping<br>along ahead of us with his massive Godly leaf-blower, clearing our path<br>of any trials, hardships, or pain. This causes a great deal of anxiety,<br>even among long-time faithful, because life is hard.<br><br>The Bible tells us to not bother trying to understand, not to bother<br>trying to make all the pieces fit together. "Trust in the Lord, lean not<br>on your own understanding" (Prov. 3:5). We are not told to not try to<br>understand, just don't "lean on" your understanding, which means don't<br>make it an ultimatum. "God, you'd better explain yourself, or I'm outta<br>here!" That would be "leaning" on your own understanding, and we are<br>admonished against that.<br><br>So what does this all mean? Basically, expect trouble in life, and<br>expect that there will be situations we do not understand. Faith is the<br>point at which logic stops making sense. We must have faith that God<br>will keep His promises, and that everything we go through in this life<br>has a purpose, even though our minds do not have the capacity to<br>understand it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
