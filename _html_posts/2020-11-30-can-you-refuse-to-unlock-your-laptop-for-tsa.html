<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can you refuse to unlock your laptop for TSA?<br><br>For context, we are talking about United States domestic airline travel<br>within the United States. We are NOT talking about a US citizen at a<br>Customs and Border Patrol checkpoint while you are traveling back into<br>the United States from abroad. Totally different set of rules at the<br>border.<br><br>\<br><br>I have been a frequent flier for many decades now. *At worst,* during<br>the whole 9/11 airline scare and increased airport security, I was<br>occasionally asked to open and power up my laptop, so that they could<br>see it was a laptop that actually booted, and not a bomb. I have only<br>had that experience maybe twice in my life. They saw the beginnings of<br>the boot sequence and then let me go.<br><br>Never have I been asked to power up my laptop and log in.<br><br>Because that's illegal.<br><br>In order for any US law enforcement official to examine the *contents*<br>of your computer, they must have a search warrant.<br><br>TSA is not law enforcement. TSA is exactly what it stands for:<br>Transportation Security. They work for the Department of Homeland<br>Security. They are not law enforcement.<br><br>The only time you must enter your password and unlock your laptop is<br>when you are presented with a search warrant. If you are presented<br>with a search warrant and you refuse to comply, you can be arrested and<br>charged with obstruction of justice, or whatever the appropriate crime<br>is in your jurisdiction.<br><br>However, *none of this* would happen in the TSA screening line.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
