  would you say that it should be illegal to have it removed because it would kill

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Once you understand the basis of the pro-life movement, you should be<br>able to easily answer this question yourself. The very existence of this<br>question means that people still refuse to accept the true basis of the<br>pro-life movement.<br><br>Pro-life people value *all life equally,* **regardless of its<br>stage of development.**<br><br>That's it. When you boil it all down, that's what we believe.<br><br>So let's look at your parasitic twin example. Parasitic twins are<br>conjoined twins, but one twin develops mostly normally, while the other<br>twin does not. The incompletely formed twin is usually dependent on the<br>other, mostly fully formed twin.<br><br>However, none of this changes the value of either life.<br><br>If separating the twins will kill one of them, then separation surgery<br>is not justified. If they would live longer staying conjoined, then<br>separation surgery is not justified.<br><br>If, however, separation surgery will not kill them, but will leave them<br>both permanently disabled, then separation surgery is morally<br>justified, because neither twin will be killed by the surgery. They<br>would each have to accept the results of being separated and the health<br>problems that the separation will cause.<br><br>This is completely in line with the pro-life movement, which values all<br>life equally. No one should have the right to say that one twin should<br>live and another should die, regardless of their status of formation or<br>the dependence of one on the other. All life is valuable and deserves<br>equal protection. Both twins have value because they are both human and<br>they are both alive. We believe that all living humans possess an equal<br>right to life, and to not have that life taken from them without due<br>process.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
