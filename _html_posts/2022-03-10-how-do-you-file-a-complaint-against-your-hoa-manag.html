I would<br>suggest starting with the Board.<br><br>If you don't get any results from the Board, you can attempt to complain<br>directly to the HOA management company. Depending on their size,<br>however, you may not get any satisfactory results.<br><br>In that case, you should address your complaint to the state agency<br>which regulates HOA Management companies. In most states, HOA Management<br>companies must be licensed by the state, and you can file your complaint<br>with that agency which oversees these companies.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How do you file a complaint against your HOA management company?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
