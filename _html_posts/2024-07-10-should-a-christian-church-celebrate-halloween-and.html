<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sure! But they should be careful in *how* they do so.<br><br>Dressing up as a ghost has absolutely no effect other than to limit your<br>field of vision. Man, it was hard to see in those costumes.<br><br>The truth is that ***holidays only have the meaning that we give<br>them.***<br><br>That said, pretty much every holiday once derived from some sort of<br>pagan ritual. Even Christmas. According to some evidence, Pope Julius I<br>chose December 25, 336 AD as the date when Christmas was first<br>celebrated. This date was chosen in an effort to adopt and absorb the<br>traditions of the pagan Saturnalia festival. Saturnalia was an<br>adaptation of the Ancient Greek festival known as Kronia. Kronia was<br>celebrated in midsummer rather than midwinter. It is thought to signify<br>the end of the harvest season to honor Saturn, a god associated with<br>agriculture.<br><br>These days, really the only thing remaining of the old pagan rituals is<br>the date. We have so modified and commercialized the holiday that its<br>original meaning is pretty much gone. Churches focus on literally<br>nothing but the birth of Jesus, and ultimately that's all that matters.<br><br>Halloween, though, is a different story. There is still quite a lot of<br>less-than-savory stuff going on there. You should be careful of<br>Halloween. There is a "celebration of death" which is sometimes<br>associated with Halloween. Christians do not celebrate death, but we<br>celebrate life with Jesus. We don't *fear* death, but we also don't<br>*celebrate* it. Be cautious about this with Halloween festivals.<br><br>Is there anything spiritually wrong with dressing up in costumes of<br>superheroes and knocking on doors for candy? No, not really. We only<br>need to be cautious of celebrating the wrong things.<br><br>Plenty of churches remove all of the unsavory aspects of Halloween<br>(including the random door knocking) and instead hold *Trunk or Treat*,<br>where volunteers bring their cars to the church parking lot and decorate<br>the trunks with all manner of games and decorations and pass out candy.<br>In fact, in one church I attended when I lived in Colorado, our annual<br>Trunk or Treat was our largest outreach program, reaching literally<br>hundreds of new families, who just came for a safer alternative to<br>roaming the neighborhoods. We gave out free food and free candy to the<br>kids, they played games, and maybe learned a little bit about a person<br>who was named Jesus. We'd get more new members following Trunk or Treat<br>than at any other time of the year. So even Halloween can be used for<br>good.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
