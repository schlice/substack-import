<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Supreme Court can't "pick and choose" what to decide. They can only<br>decide the cases which are appealed to them.<br><br>The case in question was in regards to OSHA's vaccine mandate for<br>businesses and for healthcare workers. It did not have anything to do<br>with federal contractors.<br><br>*That* case was recently decided in Texas, and they decided to block the<br>federal employee vaccine mandate as well:<br><br>[https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/21/p\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d7bc5e&url=https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/21/politics/employee-vaccine-mandate/index.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cnn.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>It's kinda OBE at this point as something like 95% of federal workers<br>are already vaccinated, but at least the others won't face loss of their<br>job for remaining unvaccinated, or face the health risks of getting<br>vaccinated after already having COVID.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why didn't the Supreme Court decision also address the civilian federal<br>contractors besides the private employers and healthcare workers?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
