<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a really good question but you're not going to like the answer.<br><br>When you hear "a more scientific mind," what this generally means is<br>that such a person will only believe what they are hearing if it can be<br>proven scientifically.<br><br>God, who exists outside of time, space, and matter, can't be measured<br>scientifically.<br><br>So what someone with "a more scientific mind" will actually believe is<br>definitely in question.<br><br>However, if the person truly has a more scientific mind, they'll<br>understand the basics of the scientific method, which in essence tells<br>us that science is a search for causes. That's what scientists do: they<br>try to determine what caused what.<br><br>The Cosmological Argument is exactly that: a search for a cause for the<br>universe. It goes like this:<br><br>1.  Everything that has come into existence (or had a beginning) has a<br>    cause.<br>2.  The universe had a beginning.<br>3.  Therefore, the universe had a cause.<br><br>Premise 1 is the Law of Causality, one of the foundational laws of<br>science. Even the outspoken atheist David Hume said, "I never asserted<br>so absurd a proposition as that something should arise without a cause."<br>So Premise 1 is true.<br><br>Is Premise 2 true? We know from a tremendous amount of scientific<br>research that the universe (time, space, and matter) began at a single<br>point. We have colloquially called this the "Big Bang." There is a lot<br>of scientific data which supports the veracity of the Big Bang: the<br>second law of thermodynamics, the expanding (and accelerating) universe,<br>the radiation echo from the Big Bang, galaxy seeds, and the most<br>convincing of all, Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. All of this<br>data (and more) point unequivocally to the understanding that the<br>universe had a beginning.<br><br>Still, some deny that the Big Bang was actually the beginning of time,<br>space, and matter. Maybe matter began then, but time and space existed<br>before, they say without any evidence of this. And maybe they're right.<br>But when you have two maybe's, it's generally best to go with the<br>"maybe" that has the most proof. And right now, Einstein's Theory of<br>General Relativity (which has now been proven accurate to five decimal<br>places) states that *everything* began at a single point.<br><br>Einstein was an atheist, and he was greatly troubled by his own<br>findings, which were showing him that the universe was finite. In fact,<br>he was so troubled by this, that he introduced a *cosmological constant*<br>(think of it as a "fudge factor") into the theory, to show that the<br>universe was actually static and infinite.<br><br>However, his fudge factor didn't last long. In 1919, British cosmologist<br>Arthur Eddington conducted an experiment during a solar eclipse which<br>confirmed that the universe wasn't static, but indeed had a beginning.<br>Eddington, also an atheist, said of the discovery, "Philosophically, the<br>notion of the beginning of the present order of nature is repugnant to<br>me...I should like to find a genuine loophole." And by 1922, Russian<br>mathematician Alexander Friedmann had officially exposed Einstein's<br>fudge factor as a mathematical error. Einstein, in his haste to disprove<br>his own theory, *had actually divided by zero*.<br><br>Einstein was *so shook* by his own discovery that he became a theist! In<br>1929, he traveled to California to visit the Mount Wilson Observatory,<br>where he saw with his own eyes the red shift in the movement of<br>celestial objects indicative of them all moving away from a central<br>point. It was then that he knew: the universe must have a beginning, and<br>thus a Beginner. He subsequently described the cosmological constant as<br>"the greatest blunder of my life." He said that he wanted "to know how<br>God created the world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon,<br>in the spectrum of this or that element. I want to know His thought, the<br>rest are details."<br><br>So we know that everything that had a beginning had a cause, and that<br>the universe had a beginning. So therefore, the universe must have a<br>cause.<br><br>But what (or Who) caused the universe? It must be someone who exists<br>outside of the universe (because He created the universe and is<br>therefore not bound by it). It also must be someone who is timeless (as<br>He exists outside of time and is also not bound by it). So we are<br>looking for an infinite being who exists outside of the universe.<br><br>What else can we tell about Him from His creation?<br><br>- He must be supernatural in nature (as He created time and space).<br>- He must be powerful (incredibly).<br>- He must be necessary (the maker must be self-explanatory).<br>- He must be omnipresent (He created space and is not limited by it).<br>- He must be immaterial because He transcends space/physical.<br>- He must be personal (the impersonal cannot create personality).<br>- He must be infinite and singular as you cannot have two infinites.<br>- He must be diverse yet have unity as unity and diversity exist<br>  simultaneously in nature.<br>- He must be intelligent (supremely). Only cognitive being can produce<br>  cognitive being.<br>- He must be purposeful as He deliberately created everything.<br>- He must be moral (no moral law can be had without a giver).<br>- He must be caring (or no moral laws would have been given).<br><br>That said, does any religion of the world describe such a Creator? The<br>answer is yes, the Abrahamic God of the Bible does in fact fit these<br>criteria completely.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
