<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer, as is the answer to any legal question, is "it depends."<br><br>In all states, you can buy and sell mineral rights separate from the<br>property at the surface. In other words, mineral rights are *severable.*<br>So if you own a piece of property, if you have not severed the mineral<br>rights, then you own any of the minerals found under your land. That<br>means that if there is oil, gas, coal, or minerals under your land, you<br>own those and can contract to mine and sell them.<br><br>Clearly, this presents some practical issues if you own a house in<br>suburbia, but not if you own an isolated 50-acre tract in Piedmont.<br><br>As is previously noted, you can sell the mineral rights under your land<br>without selling your land (commonly called a "split estate"). This was a<br>common practice during the Homestead times, especially in Alaska.<br><br>You would have to authorize the extraction of those minerals. If you did<br>not, transverse drilling has gotten really technologically sound these<br>days.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
