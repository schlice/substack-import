<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ah, finally someone asking a Constitutional question about healthcare!<br><br>Well, sort of.<br><br>The 10th Amendment simply says that any powers not specifically given to<br>the government are given to the states or the people.<br><br>So what this basically says is that if we haven't *specifically told*<br>the Federal government that they can do something, they can't. The<br>Constitution, remember, is designed to tell the Federal government<br>*exactly* what it is allowed to do, and anything outside of what it has<br>been told is a right that is given to *the people.*<br><br>So by your *very example*, you have shown exactly *why* the Federal<br>government cannot provide healthcare as a right. It was *never told that<br>it can.* The rights in the first 9 Amendments are pretty clear, and<br>healthcare is not in there. Therefore, under the 10th Amendment you<br>cited, it's a right for the states respectively, or the people.<br><br>Therefore, if a state wanted to tax its people and provide healthcare to<br>all state citizens, it could do that (remember Romneycare in<br>Massachusetts?). But can the Federal government? According to a strict<br>interpretation of the Constitution, no.<br><br>So how did they get away with Obamacare?<br><br>What they did was to create a *marketplace* for healthcare, not actually<br>provide it. But what about the penalties for not buying insurance?<br>According to the Supreme Court, it wasn't a *penalty* so much as a<br>*tax.* It was collected by the IRS. It was collected on Tax Day. Along<br>with your taxes. If it walks like a duck... Therefore, since the<br>government *is* allowed to collect taxes, it is allowed to collect taxes<br>for anything it wants to, including raising your taxes if you don't have<br>health insurance. Don't like it? Vote out the Congresscritters who did<br>it. Which is exactly what happened. Along with voting out the party of<br>the president who pushed it, and lied to get it passed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
