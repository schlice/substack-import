<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Pre-sex contracts are unenforceable because there are two consenting<br>parties present and actively involved in the "transaction" and they<br>should be fully aware of what they are doing, along with the<br>consequences of those actions. Even when one of the parties does not<br>consent (i.e. rape), child support can still be ordered by the court<br>even though parental rights will likely be involuntarily terminated.<br>Even statutory rape does not alleviate the necessity to provide child<br>support once the participant is old enough to do so legally. Again,<br>parental rights are not terminated automatically in such a case.<br><br>Generally, divesting yourself of parental responsibility is difficult<br>because children are generally understood to have a right to a parental<br>relationship and, particularly, a right to receive financial support and<br>care from both parents. Child support is a state-level function, and the<br>state can mandate it, even in the presence of criminal activity, using<br>the "child's rights" argument.<br><br>The *only* time that you can really give up parental rights before<br>conception is when you *anonymously* donate to a sperm bank. Your<br>identity is technically known to the sperm bank, but you are anonymous<br>to the recipient.<br><br>Being a *participant* in the sex act implies consent to support<br>whatever children are produced from that union, according to the state.<br>A contract may not alleviate you of the obligation to care for that<br>child which you may create.<br><br>While it can be done, voluntary termination of parental rights is<br>difficult at best. More likely than not, it will more readily be<br>approved if the custody of the child goes to someone else who will care<br>for it. But that whole pesky "best interest of the child" thing means<br>that the state has a vested interest in ensuring children are cared for<br>by someone, and like I mentioned previously, it is generally understood<br>that children have a right to a parental relationship.<br><br>Finally, your argument about "you don't need two parents" is<br>biologically unsound. Unless you picked up sperm from a sperm bank and<br>were artificially inseminated, there was a male present who participated<br>and who is on the hook to provide parenting.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
