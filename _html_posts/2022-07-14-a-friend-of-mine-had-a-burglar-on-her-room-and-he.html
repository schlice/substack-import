<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a common law school question. Does the fact that a person was<br>trespassing alleviate the homeowner of addressing known hazards?<br><br>I mean, what if I was invited to a house party and I went into a hallway<br>or a room in which I was not permitted to go? Wouldn't I be just as<br>guilty of trespassing?<br><br>What if I was in a store looking for help from an employee and I<br>inadvertently went into an Employee Only area, wouldn't I be<br>trespassing?<br><br>My motives for being where I was don't change the fact that I was still<br>trespassing. Just like the burglar who fell through the skylight; at<br>that point, his only crime (like mine when I went into the Employees<br>Only area) was trespassing.<br><br>So what if I fell through an open hole in the floor in the Employees<br>Only area? Did the fact that I wasn't supposed to be there alleviate the<br>store of the responsibility of addressing the hazard? There was a hazard<br>and the store didn't address it.<br><br>The skylight faller fell on to a knife that was not properly secured.<br>That knife was a hazard. And the faller (whose only crime at that point<br>was trespassing) now has to deal with the physical repercussions of<br>rehab and medical treatments to address the cut on his leg from the<br>improperly stowed knife.<br><br>Bottom line: the fact that someone was trespassing doesn't alleviate the<br>homeowner of the responsibility to address known hazards.<br><br>Is that *fair*? No, probably not. But is it *just*? Actually, it is.<br><br>Remember, we have a system of justice, not a system of fairness.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>A friend of mine had a burglar on her room and he fell through the<br>skylight in the kitchen and landed on a knife cutting his leg. The<br>burglar sued my friend and he was awarded \$5,000. Is that Justice?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
