<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The crucifixion was just the means by which Christ died. The pivotal<br>moment in Christianity is the *Resurrection.*<br><br>*WITHOUT THE RESURRECTION, CHRISTIANITY IS FUTILE.*<br><br>> *But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has<br>> been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is<br>> in vain and your faith is in vain. We are even found to be<br>> misrepresenting God, because we testified about God that he raised<br>> Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not<br>> raised. \-- 1 Cor 15:13--15 ESV*<br><br>Without the Resurrection, all our preaching and all our teaching is<br>ultimately meaningless. We don't preach because it makes people feel<br>good. We preach because what we say is true. If it's not true, it's<br>not helpful.<br><br>Without the Resurrection, our faith has no power. We have faith in the<br>One who saves us. If He was not raised from the dead, then He has no<br>power to save us. True faith is possible because of *Who we believe in*,<br>not just *what we believe.*<br><br>Without the Resurrection, our sins have not been forgiven, and the power<br>of sin over us has not been broken. Ephesians 2 says that we are dead in<br>our sin, but God raised Christ from the dead to be a penal<br>substitute for us. Without that sacrifice and the Resurrection, we<br>remain dead in our sin, condemned to eternal separation from God. In<br>that case, there is no eternal life for us. If Christ didn't prevail<br>over death, then neither do we. Death is the *end*, not the *beginning*,<br>without the Resurrection.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
