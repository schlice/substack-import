<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My husband has revealing photos of his ex wife in his phone. I deleted<br>them when he left the room and he got upset. Wouldn\'t him getting upset<br>mean that he still has feelings for her?**<br><br>I'm sorry this happened to you.<br><br>HOW you were able to delete them (and how you saw them in the first<br>place) is a totally separate discussion. Additionally, whether or not he<br>has feelings for his ex is also probably not a productive discussion to<br>have.<br><br>If he's looking at the pictures, he's thinking about his ex and not you.<br>The fact of the matter is that if you don't agree with his retaining<br>those pictures, he shouldn't retain those pictures.<br><br>Maybe you have a very open marriage wherein you don't care whose<br>pictures are on his phone. Maybe you have some revealing pictures on<br>your own phone (whether or not they are of exes).<br><br>It doesn't matter.<br><br>The bottom line is that if you don't agree with his possession of the<br>pictures, he should not have them. Period.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
