<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>I think you need to qualify the question somewhat. *Criminal laws* do<br>not benefit or hurt anyone within the text of the law, in the context of<br>the law's applicability. Laws are required by the 14th Amendment to<br>apply equally to all people, rich or poor. So criminal laws themselves<br>do not apply unfairly to any one group in particular.<br><br>However, it is well known that people who are wealthy have an *easier<br>time* working with the law. Lawyers are expensive; good lawyers even<br>more so. The best, most expensive lawyers are better at protecting their<br>clients; judgments for rich people tend to be lighter because their<br>lawyers are better at negotiating settlements. Rich people also have it<br>easier when it comes to things like restitution. A \$10,000 judgement<br>against a rich person may be a drop in the bucket, whereas the same<br>judgement against a middle-class working family may be the death knell<br>in their finances, forcing them into bankruptcy.<br><br>Despite the universal applicability of criminal law, *tax* *law*<br>most definitely favors the wealthy. The richer you are, the more tax<br>avoidance strategies you are able to implement; while the same tax<br>avoidance strategies exist for everyone, you generally have to be rich<br>to take advantage of them. As an example, you can deduct medical costs<br>from your taxes, but only after your medical costs exceed 10% of your<br>Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). If your healthcare insurance is paying the<br>majority of your healthcare expenses, 10% of your AGI out of your pocket<br>for healthcare is a massive chunk of change. In some years, and with<br>some big out-of-pocket expenses, you might be able to deduct some of it,<br>but for most people, for most normal years, you'll never spend that much<br>out of your pocket. Unless you're rich, and you pay most of your<br>healthcare expenses without insurance. Then, you could easily spend 10%<br>of your AGI on healthcare, meaning you'd get a substantial tax break.<br>Another example is donations. The more money you have, the more money<br>you can donate, and every donation shaves off significant dollars from<br>your taxable income. Tax law, therefore, disproportionately benefits the<br>rich.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
