<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So I just want to clarify for you what I think I've understood from<br>everyone (as well as my own knowledge).<br><br>There are no violations of law here. If you're pulled over, and it's<br>your car, and you've authorized another licensed driver to drive it,<br>you're perfectly legal. If you get into an accident, you won't be<br>charged with unlawfully operating a motor vehicle. You have the right to<br>allow any licensed driver to operate your vehicle, and they don't need<br>to be listed on your policy to do it.<br><br>You may run into trouble with your insurance company if you get into an<br>accident or try to make a claim on your car, because of your<br>non-disclosure.<br><br>Your best bet: if you are living together and have been doing so for any<br>significant period of time, you should contact your insurance company<br>and advise them of the new living arrangements. If you ever drive his<br>car, he should do the same. It will be best for you if you tell them now<br>(sooner, rather than later), and certainly better to tell them now than<br>after you have a claim.<br><br>Again, as long as he's a good driver and you've been living together for<br>any significant period of time, it's not likely that the insurance<br>company would have changed your premium (much). So again, you should be<br>fine, and you get credit for doing the right thing **before you had<br>to**.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
