<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [As you\'ve already heard, murder is a form of homicide.<br>Homicide means specifically \"the killing of a person.\" Murder (first<br>degree murder, to be precise) is a form of homicide which involves three<br>elements:\<br>]<br><br>- The unlawful taking of a life<br>- with forethought<br>- and malice.<br><br>Second-degree murder is the unlawful taking of a life with forethought.<br>Malice is not required. Third-degree murder (also called voluntary<br>manslaughter) only involves the unlawful taking of a life. \"Crimes of<br>passion\" are considered to be voluntary manslaughter. So if you kill<br>someone in a bar fight, it\'s second-degree murder. If you killed that<br>person because you just found out he slept with your wife, the charge<br>may be reduced to voluntary manslaughter.\<br>\<br>Involuntary manslaughter involves some criminally negligent action (or<br>failure to act when required to do so) which leads to the death of a<br>person.\<br>\<br>The taking of a life by a soldier in wartime is covered by the Law of<br>Armed Conflict. The Law of Armed Conflict is part of the Geneva<br>Convention which covers the conduct of countries at war. Violations of<br>the Law of Armed Conflict are punishable under the Uniform Code of<br>Military Justice (UCMJ). There are rules regarding when and where you<br>can fire on the enemy (collectively called \"Rules of Engagement\"), and<br>when you cannot. For example, you generally cannot fire on a hospital or<br>a church. But if the enemy has set up anti-aircraft missiles in that<br>building, they have now made that building a legal target through their<br>own actions. If the enemy has taken civilians and placed them inside<br>sensitive military buildings to act as \"human shields,\" they have<br>actually turned those civilians into enemy combatants under the Law of<br>Armed Conflict, and they are now valid targets. Although in that case,<br>we\'d try to avoid that building if at all possible. If it\'s not<br>possible, those civilians become, unfortunately, casualties of war.<br>\"Collateral damage\" occurs when non-targets are accidentally killed<br>due to uncontrollable circumstances (i.e. impact of a bomb<br>weakening/collapsing a neighboring building). As long as our soldiers<br>were not targeting those non-combatants, collateral damage is another<br>unfortunate side-effect of armed conflict.\<br>\<br>Soldiers who operate appropriately under the Law of Armed Conflict are<br>most generally immune from legal action charging them as criminals.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
