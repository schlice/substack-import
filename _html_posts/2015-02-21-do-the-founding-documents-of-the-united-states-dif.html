<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [This is a great question, and the assignment of rights to<br>the states and to the people was done in the Bill of Rights, the<br>amendments to the Constitution.\<br>\<br>The Constitution itself does not enumerate rights. It defines the limits<br>of government. The tenth amendment specifically reaffirms this by saying<br>that any powers not expressly enumerated to the federal government being<br>to the states, or to the people.\<br>\<br>The use of the term \"the states\" indicates that a right is granted to<br>state and local government, and not to the federal government. This part<br>of the amendment has been used a number of times when the federal<br>government has tried to force states to enforce federal law.\<br>\<br>The term \"the people\" was used three times in the Bill of Rights and<br>it indicates an individual right given to each and every person in the<br>country individually. For example, the Second Amendment says that \"the<br>right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" The<br>courts reaffirmed this as an individual right, not a right gained by<br>participating in a group activity.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
