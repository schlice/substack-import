<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, the Bible has not listed *everything* that is going to happen in<br>the future. The Bible lists ***the most significant things to our<br>eternity*** that will happen in the future.<br><br>The book of Revelation is the last book in the Bible. It details a<br>period of time where the apostle John was exiled to the island of<br>Patmos, and while he was there, God showed him a vision of the future.,<br>the events which are to come, at the time when Christ returns.<br><br>The book details what will happen in the lead-up to this event, the<br>coming of the Antichrist, the "mark of the beast," and Jesus' return and<br>destruction of Satan.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
