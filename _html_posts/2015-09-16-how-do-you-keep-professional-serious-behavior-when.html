<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You learn the ability to \"switch it on\" and \"switch it<br>off.\"\<br>\<br>I did some television broadcasting in high school and in college. It<br>always amazed me that people would be caught saying inappropriate things<br>in front of the camera. We were always taught that you have to be able<br>to \"switch it off\" when you sat in front of the camera, and \"switch<br>it on\" when you get up from the table and your lavalier mic was<br>removed. I learned this ability at a young age; when I sit down in front<br>of the camera, a totally different person emerges, and the silliness is<br>still there, but I\'ve \"switched it off,\" and I never breathe a word<br>of it.\<br>\<br>When the show is over, and I stand up from the table, I can literally<br>bust out laughing at something that happened 20 minutes earlier, but I<br>couldn\'t express.\<br>\<br>The same holds true when you work at a big corporation and deal with V<br>and C level executives all the time. When you\'re in that situation, you<br>have to be able to \"switch it off\" and become your truly professional<br>self. Then when the coast is clear, and you\'re with your colleagues<br>again, you can \"switch it on\" and be your good-natured self.\<br>\<br>Acting, television, and Customer Service. It\'s all the<br>same.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
