<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a great question, and it's one that I've answered before. If<br>you're thinking about pursuing a military career, it's probably an<br>answer you'll want to read more than once.<br><br>I did the whole "college roadshow" thing when I was in high school. I<br>toured all the schools that I might be interested in. I saw Notre Dame<br>(my brother ended up going there), I saw Purdue, Georgetown, etc. Plus,<br>I saw all the service academies. The Coast Guard Academy told me that I<br>was already accepted and I hadn't even applied yet. All I needed was my<br>Congressional nomination and I was in. I toured West Point (old) and<br>Annapolis (better but still old) as well.<br><br>Then I toured the Air Force Academy. I was hooked. I already had a love<br>of flying. I had taken a glider ride over Long Island one time and I<br>caught the flying bug right then and there. Coast Guard would have been<br>pretty cool. New London, CT was about a two hour drive from my home and<br>I already knew I'd be in the top 10% of the class, but I also knew that<br>if I wanted to fly for the Coast Guard, I'd still have to command a<br>cutter for five years before I'd be eligible for flight school. Army and<br>Navy aviation is even more difficult to get into, with larger pools of<br>applicants. If I went Air Force, I was basically guaranteed a pilot<br>slot. Remember, this was in the late 80s/early 90s. At that time, if you<br>had your PQ (you were physically "pilot qualified") and you graduated,<br>and you hadn't washed out of Preliminary Flight Training at the Academy,<br>you were going to be a pilot. It was virtually guaranteed, although they<br>never "actually" guaranteed that we'd all get to fly.<br><br>And it's a good thing they didn't.<br><br>During my freshman and sophomore years at the Academy, the nation went<br>through Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. At the<br>conclusion of these operations (as is commonplace with any major<br>military operation), they scale back after the war. They reduced the<br>number of active aircraft in the Air Force inventory following Desert<br>Storm, and that left a massive overage of pilots with nothing to do.<br>People in the class before me would go through UPT (Undergraduate Pilot<br>Training) and then be crammed into career fields so they'd have<br>something to do until an airframe came available for them to fly. They<br>just had too many pilots. So they had to "close the spigot."<br><br>A week before classes started in my junior year (1992), the<br>Superintendent called my entire class into the theater (Arnold Hall) and<br>addressed us as a class. He basically said that they were reducing the<br>number of pilot slots that they were going to offer to my class. We had<br>over 1,000 PQ cadets, and they were going to give us 225 pilot slots.<br>Normally, when you begin classes on your first day as a junior, that's<br>when your military service commitment begins. You can do your entire<br>freshman and sophomore years, walk away and owe nothing, but once you<br>start classes as a junior, your Active Duty Service Commitment begins.<br>Because of this development, they gave us an extra week to decide if we<br>really wanted to stay.<br><br>We were devastated. But they then said that we should really take that<br>week to think about why we were really at USAFA. Was it just to be a<br>pilot? Or was the job secondary to the fact that we were training to<br>become the best Air Force officers that we could be, regardless of the<br>career field we served in? To our credit, less than 10 people left the<br>Academy during that week. The vast majority of my class recognized that<br>we weren't really there to become pilots. We were there to become<br>officers first, and \<insert_job_here\> second. In the end, about 1200<br>cadets graduated on June 1, 1994, and only 225 went to fly. The majority<br>of us went into career fields all across the Air Force. This ended up<br>creating problems for us down the road, but that's a story for another<br>answer.<br><br>We learned another lesson through all of that. Life happens. And rarely<br>does life happen in exactly the way you imagined it. We also knew coming<br>into the Academy that if we kept open minds and rolled with the punches,<br>we'd all do well.<br><br>So I joined because I wanted to fly. I stayed because serving my country<br>was more important than the career field in which I actually did so. And<br>they are all important, even if you are not flying.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-was-it-like-to-receive-an-appointment-to-a-service-academy/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
