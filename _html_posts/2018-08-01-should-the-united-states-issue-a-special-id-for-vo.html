<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should the United States issue a special ID for voting in state and<br>federal elections?**<br><br>I have never voted in a federal election. I don't know what that looks<br>like.<br><br>I only vote in state elections.<br><br>I already have a state ID card (it happens to be my driver's license,<br>but it also functions as a state ID card). But it's not required to<br>vote.<br><br>I think that's a little odd. Every other government assistance program<br>in existence requires some form of identification, but somehow voting<br>does not?<br><br>But whatever. That's an answer for a question you didn't ask.<br><br>The only issue I should address, since there is no such thing as a<br>federal election, is **Should the United States issue a special ID for<br>voting in state elections?**<br><br>And the answer to that is a resounding no. The federal government<br>has no business issuing ID cards for states to hold state elections.<br>That's a state function. States already issue ID cards which can<br>effectively be used in state elections, and even if you don't drive a<br>car, you can get a low-cost or no-cost ID card from the state. Instances<br>where someone does not have the requisite documentation or can't afford<br>a state ID card are very, very rare. Even for the elderly, who maybe<br>don't possess the documentation required to get an ID card, there are<br>methods by which they can still get a card. For example, if they have<br>children who have them listed on their own birth certificates as the<br>"parent," this, along with a written affidavit, is sometimes all that is<br>needed to get a state ID card to allow for voting.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
