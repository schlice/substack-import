For example, in the middle of a busy<br>city street or in the main hallway of the school, the parent may be<br>guilty of child abuse. In a strip club, the parent may additionally be<br>guilty of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. But in the<br>doctor's office? It is likely that no crime has been committed.<br><br>Details are key.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
