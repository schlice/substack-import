<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If Trump refuses to leave Jan 20th, who escorts him out, US Marshals,<br>Secret Service, Capitol Police, or someone else?**<br><br>We will have a clear, legally-declared winner by January 20th.<br><br>Trump will comply with this, as if he needs to leave, he has to move his<br>personal effects out of the private quarters, and the transition team<br>will be performing that function, not Trump himself.<br><br>There's a lot of people involved in the process, but this isn't about<br>some sort of intransigence on Trump's part, like the mainstream media<br>wants you to believe.<br><br>The election is not over yet. No state has officially declared a winner<br>of any state election. Not to mention, there are legal processes that<br>are ongoing in several states. Granted, Trump's lawyers have a tough row<br>to hoe here. They have to make the claim that not only were there<br>election irregularities (and they must be specific to the jurisdiction<br>where they are making the case), but those irregularities were of a<br>sufficient amount to make up the difference between the two candidates'<br>current vote totals. If they can make that case, then the results of the<br>election will change. If they cannot, then the results will be certified<br>by the states (which has not happened yet), and the election will stay<br>the same. If Trump's legal team has the evidence they need, they have<br>the right, and even Biden supporters should agree, they have the *duty*,<br>to ensure that the evidence is processed and that the elections are all<br>discharged in a fair manner. Until this process concludes, no one has<br>been declared the next president yet.<br><br>There are pre-defined timelines by which the legal challenges must be<br>concluded, the states must certify their elections, and they must<br>deliver their results to the Federal government. So there will indeed be<br>a known winner by then. But it hasn't happened yet.<br><br>The media does not have the power to declare a president. They can only<br>*project* a winner. Calling him "President-elect Biden" is<br>short-sighted. They may turn out to be right, but they may not. What<br>sort of message does that send if they have to walk that back, though?<br>Don't you think that causes more harm than good?<br><br>Regardless, as Yogi Berra famously said, "It ain't over 'till it's<br>over."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
