Even if there<br>was, there never was a study to collect DNA *AND* separate out<br>nucleotide sequences. And finally, even if there was, there never was a<br>study to collect DNA, separate out nucleotide sequences, *AND* make the<br>results publicly available.<br><br>Too many companies need to make money off of that data to make it<br>publicly available.<br><br>You're probably about 50 years too early. And by that point, who knows,<br>we could have a functional cure.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
