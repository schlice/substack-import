<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [I have seen this when I run and listen to music. I find<br/>that because of my former military background that I \"march to the<br/>music,\" and this seems to translate to my running. I\'ll tend to run in<br/>cadence with the music, and if I\'m not careful, I end up over-exerting<br/>myself. The music stops, and my first thought is, \"why in the world am<br/>I running so hard? This wasn\'t supposed to be a hard run!\" The music<br/>tends to mask the symptoms that I\'m usually so in tune with.\<br/>\<br/>Failing to listen to your body is the number one way you can over-exert<br/>yourself. I\'m reasonably certain that \"being reminded of the burn\"<br/>doesn\'t cause the body to respond differently. I am certain that you<br/>will fail to listen to your body and you can far more easily over-exert<br/>yourself when you are listening to music. Happens to me all the time.\<br/>\<br/>I just have to keep the music a little lower in my ears, so that I can<br/>\"hear\" my body. I also use workout programs that interrupt the music<br/>and let me know my pace, speed, distance covered, and heart rate. If<br/>those are noticeably different from what they should be (or what I<br/>expect them to be), I pause the music and run in silence to see how my<br/>body is responding.\<br/>\<br/>For reference, I use Endomondo on my Android phone to keep track of my<br/>run and me.]<br/><br/>*Disclaimer:*<br/><br/>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br/>substitute for professional medical advice.
