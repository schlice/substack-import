<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Perhaps another church might be a better fit for you. Have you ever<br>attended a non-denominational service? They are all Bible-based, but<br>they aren't so steeped in ceremony that they miss the forest for the<br>trees. They do a communal meal, but they don't believe that the bread is<br>*actually* Christ's body, and that the wine is *actually* Christ's<br>blood. They believe the Last Supper was symbolic, yet another example of<br>Jesus teaching his disciples through parable and stories. You might<br>consider looking into such a church. They are either labeled Bible<br>Churches or Nondenominational Churches or Christian Churches.<br><br>Nevertheless, your position is quite unjustifiable. You can't<br>simultaneously believe and be "unreligious." You either believe or you<br>don't. If you believe, you act like a believer. If you don't, you don't.<br>It's really quite that simple. You can't believe (affirming the tenets<br>of the faith) and then ignore those beliefs. Either you believe and you<br>consciously choose to violate your faith, or you don't believe.<br><br>I think maybe a change of scenery might do you some good.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
