<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So you're saying that the crown of thorns is representative of poverty,<br>because pain can be considered a communicable disease?<br><br>These questions are always so striking. I love the ones which ascribe<br>some hidden meaning to, say, the seventh word in every book of the<br>Bible, or something like that. I saw one on TikTok not too long ago; I<br>just sorta scrolled past it.<br><br>So when speaking of the number 7, it is very symbolic in the Bible. The<br>number 7 indicates *completeness,* where the number 6 indicates<br>incompleteness. *Three* 7's indicates the perfect completeness, while<br>three 6's indicates the perfect incompleteness (thus, when Revelation<br>says that the number 666 is the number of the beast, this is at least<br>partially what it is referring to).<br><br>But let's be honest. Sometimes in the Bible, a 7 is just a 7.<br><br>So while the crown of thorns which was placed on Jesus' head indeed<br>brought pain, it was more about *mockery* than pain. When they were<br>done flailing Him (and if you don't know what that is, look it up, but<br>beware, it's not for those with weak stomachs), along with the crown,<br>they put a reed in His hand, representing a king's staff, and put a<br>purple robe on Him, and then they mockingly bowed down to Him, laughing,<br>saying "All hail, the King of the Jews!" They thought it was quite<br>funny. The crown of thorns was the centerpiece of their mockery. They<br>took something which was a symbol of office, of royalty and majesty, and<br>turned it into a symbol of ridicule, derision, and contempt.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-33da7520d3e5447c52730c96634bf225){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-33da7520d3e5447c52730c96634bf225"<br>master_w="1000" master_h="792"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(Image courtesy*<br>[*Wikipedia*(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ad03a3&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus,_King_of_the_Jews%23/media/File:Dirk_van_Baburen_-_Kroning_met_de_doornenkroon.jpg){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br>So what *should* we take from the crown? Two things:<br><br>1.  Jesus is, and always will be, an *actual* King. Revelation 19:16<br>    says, "On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of<br>    kings and Lord of lords." One day, every knee will bow, and every<br>    tongue will confess that Jesus is Lord (Philippians 2:10--11).<br>2.  Jesus was willing to endure the pain and humiliation of the crown of<br>    thorns, for us.<br><br>The physical crown of thorns is now gone, but Jesus now has been given a<br>*new* crown, one which no one can ever usurp, and one which He shall<br>wear for all eternity.<br><br>> *But we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels,<br>> namely Jesus,* *crowned with glory and honor* *because of the<br>> suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death<br>> for everyone. \-- Hebrews 2:9 ESV,* *emphasis* *added*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
