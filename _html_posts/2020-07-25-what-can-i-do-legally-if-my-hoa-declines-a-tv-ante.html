<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What can I do legally if my HOA declines a TV antenna installation<br>(everyone else has satellite)?**<br><br>Today's modern HDTV antennas work as well inside an attic as they do on<br>your roof, considering it's a digital signal.<br><br>Install your HDTV antenna in your attic and run the wire down to your<br>TV.<br><br>You could also buy a powered HDTV antenna and plug it in right behind<br>your TV. It should work just as well.<br><br>The HOA can regulate the placement of the antenna so long as it is able<br>to receive the signal in both areas. If your installer tells you the<br>only place you can conceivably get the signal is on the roof, then it<br>has to go there. If there are multiple places on your roof that the<br>signal can still be received, the HOA can help you decide which area to<br>place the antenna.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
