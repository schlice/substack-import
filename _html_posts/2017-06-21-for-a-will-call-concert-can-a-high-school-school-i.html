<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you were allowed to buy a ticket at 13, they would have to accept<br>whatever ID would be common for a 13 year old to possess. A school ID<br>would be about the best you could have (and that's not even standard, so<br>if you have one, you're ahead of the game).<br><br>I would most definitely present my school ID card to pick up the<br>tickets.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
