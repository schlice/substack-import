<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is the United States committing terrorism by taking children from<br>their families with no plan for reuniting them?**<br><br>Nope. The United States is enforcing the laws as written by Congress.<br>Terrorism is a lawless act by its very nature, so the United States is<br>certainly not engaging in terrorism. The goal of separating parents from<br>their children is not to incite terror or fear, so again, the US is not<br>engaging in terrorism.<br><br>That's an example of *media sensationalism.* It certainly caught your<br>eye, didn't it? Ha, gotcha.<br><br>The law is very clear: illegal immigrant children (accompanied by their<br>parents or not) cannot be incarcerated for more than 20 days. If their<br>illegal immigrant parents are going to be incarcerated for more than 20<br>days, the law is clear: the children must be transferred.<br><br>People also fail to remember that *within this country, each and every<br>day, children are taken from their parents*. This happens to American<br>citizens! Every day! Parents who are arrested have their children taken<br>away each and every day in America, and in far greater numbers than what<br>is happening at the border.<br><br>But the one thing in common between American citizens and illegal<br>immigrants who have lost custody of their children: **they all broke the<br>law**. They all ended up in jail, and your kids can't stay with you in<br>jail.<br><br>So until we establish "family jails" where the whole family can stay<br>together in jail, we have no choice but to remove those children.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
