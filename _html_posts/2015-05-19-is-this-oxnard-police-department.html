Consider the<br>following \"thought-provoking\" comments from the article:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> The cop survival code will continue to trump everything, and community<br>> efforts to get the cops to clean house and reform will be ignored\<br><br>\<br>As Tim mentioned, nowhere in the police officer\'s job description does<br>it say \"gets killed when necessary.\" If you are presented with a<br>life-or-death situation, you\'re going to have to make a judgment call.<br>That call is simply, \"Am I going home at the end of my shift in my car,<br>or in a body bag?\" I think it\'s a pretty straightforward choice.\<br>\<br><br>> and any effort at community policing, CIT included, initiated by the<br>> cops is a fraud because the cops are at war with the American public.<br><br>\<br>When you enter the debate with the mindset that the police have<br>\"created\" the problem instead of \"responding\" to the problem,<br>you\'ve put the cart before the horse. It is a logical fallacy to ask<br>the police to respond to violence, and then condemn the police for doing<br>so.\<br>\<br><br>> So while it is tragic, it is not surprising that when cops respond to<br>> crisis calls in the community, far too often a human being (the enemy)<br>> is killed. The only way to change the current community crisis<br>> intervention protocol is to take the cops out of the equation as first<br>> responders.<br><br>\<br>So let me review this logic once again:\<br><br>- You deinstitutionalize the mentally ill.<br><br><!-- --><br><br>- You ask the police to handle the fallout when the mentally ill<br>  confront society.<br>- You condemn the police for doing ***exactly what you asked them to<br>  do***.<br>- Your \"solution\" is to send someone else in first on mental health<br>  calls.<br><br>All I can say is, \"good luck with that.\" I hope your first responders<br>have bulletproof vests and up-to-date organ donor cards. Because you<br>won\'t be preventing much death; you\'ll just be starting with one of<br>your SAVE volunteers dead first, then your EDP will be dead when the<br>police move in. So all you\'ll be doing is increasing the body count.<br>Was that really your goal?\<br>\<br>But if this is what the community wants, we can absolutely send a SAVE<br>team in first. The SAVE volunteer will have to specifically agree that<br>their families may not sue the police when they are killed. My only<br>requirement would be that we set a police perimeter so that the EDP<br>cannot escape. The police will NOT enter the area where the SAVE<br>volunteer is working unless specifically called. If the SAVE volunteer<br>fails or is killed and the EDP tries to escape, the police will prevent<br>any further loss of life or danger to the general public. And yes, that<br>will involve traditional police \"de-escalation\" tactics. But SAVE will<br>be in there first, just as the public wants. The SAVE team can then<br>recount, with vivid detail, what didn\'t work and what did. Or their<br>body-mount cameras will talk for them, when they\'re dead. Because we<br>will also send them in there with those.\<br>\<br>We could also send the SAVE team member in with a radio with a RD (radio<br>distress) button. It\'s kinda like a \"silent alarm\" for a person. It<br>can\'t be accidentally activated, but when it is activated, the police<br>can go in and take over, if the subject is too violent. The police can<br>attempt to subdue the person and take him into custody.\<br>\<br>The fallacy that the police have created the problem that they are<br>fighting to control is sad and sickening to me, but we can roll with it.<br>If there are volunteers brave enough to go into these situations to try<br>to de-escalate them, more power to them, but the police will not allow<br>the general public to be hurt when they fail.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
