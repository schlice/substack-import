<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What would happen to the United States if people were able to choose<br>how much they pay in taxes?**<br><br>Government revenue would go up, tax loopholes and evasion would go down,<br>and people would keep more of their own money.<br><br>I'm assuming that you're not talking about a voluntary tax system where<br>people simply choose whether or not they are going to contribute money<br>to the government at all. That would be more like a donation system, and<br>it would never ever work.<br><br>But there is a system where we can choose how much we pay in taxes. And<br>it is very real, and it is very achievable, **if we have the courage to<br>implement it.**<br><br>The simple answer: ***switch to a consumption tax instead of an income<br>tax.***<br><br>Now, it's not quite as simple as just switching to a consumption tax (in<br>other words, a Federal sales tax), because we still want to have<br>protections for the poor. We don't want the poor to pay taxes, so we<br>still want some form of a *progressive* tax system where the poor pay no<br>tax, and the rich pay more than everyone else.<br><br>The answer? [[The<br>FAIRtax](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cbc8ad&url=https://fairtax.org/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="fairtax.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>The idea behind the FAIRtax is simple: eliminate the Federal income tax<br>(by repealing the 16th Amendment) and implement a new taxation system.<br>It has two main features:<br><br>- A flat sales tax on new items<br>- A *prebate* to pre-refund all American citizens their tax payments<br>  up to the poverty line.<br><br>What makes the system progressive is the prebate. The prebate is<br>electronically delivered to a debit card (or bank account if you<br>choose), and provides a pre-rebate of all of the tax revenue a family of<br>your size would spend in a month up to the poverty line.<br><br>From FAIRtax:<br><br>> The FairTax is a national sales tax that treats every person equally<br>> and allows American businesses to thrive, while generating the same<br>> tax revenue as the current four-million-word-plus tax code. Under the<br>> FairTax, every person living in the United States pays a sales tax on<br>> purchases of new goods and services, excluding necessities due to the<br>> prebate. The FairTax rate after necessities is 23% compared to<br>> combining the 15% income tax bracket with the 7.65% of employee<br>> payroll taxes under the current system \-- both of which will be<br>> eliminated!<br>><br>> *Important to note: the FairTax is the only tax plan currently being<br>> proposed that includes the removal of the payroll tax.*<br>><br>> Keep Your Paycheck<br>><br>> For the first time in recent history, American workers will get to<br>> keep every dime they earn; including what would have been paid in<br>> federal income taxes and payroll taxes. You will get an instant raise<br>> in your pay!<br>><br>> Social Security & Medicare Funding<br>><br>> Benefits will not change. The FairTax actually puts these programs on<br>> a more solid funding foundation. Instead of being funded by taxes on<br>> workers' wages, which is a small pool, they'll be funded by taxes on<br>> overall consumption by all residents.<br>><br>> Get a Tax Refund in Advance on Purchases of Basic Necessities<br>><br>> The FairTax provides a progressive program called a prebate. This<br>> gives every legal resident household an "advance refund" at the<br>> beginning of each month so that purchases made up to the poverty level<br>> are tax-free. The prebate prevents an unfair burden on low-income<br>> families.<br>><br>> Pay Tax on Only What You Spend<br>><br>> Be in control of your financial destiny. You alone can control your<br>> tax burden. If you're thrifty, you'll pay lower taxes than somebody<br>> who is not. Most importantly, you'll be taxed fairly.<br>><br>> Everyone Pays Their Fair Share<br>><br>> Tax evasion and the underground economy cost each taxpayer an<br>> additional \$2,500 every year! But by taxing new products and services<br>> consumed, the FairTax puts everyone in the country at the same level<br>> at the cash register. Further, only legal residents are eligible for<br>> the prebate.<br>><br>> The IRS is No Longer Needed<br>><br>> No more complicated tax forms, individual audits, or intrusive federal<br>> bureaucracy. Retailers will collect the FairTax just as they do now<br>> with state sales taxes. All money will be collected and remitted to<br>> the U.S. Treasury, and both the retailers and states will be paid a<br>> fee for their collection service.\[1\](#XarCp){#cite-XarCp<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>As you can see, with the FairTax, **you only pay tax on what you<br>spend.** You control your tax burden. If you are a smart shopper, you<br>can pay less tax than others.<br><br>So what exactly would be taxable under the new system? The tax would be<br>paid once at the final retail sale for personal consumption on new<br>goods and services. Purchases of used items, exports and all business<br>transactions would not be taxed. Buying a used car? Not taxable, as the<br>tax was paid once when the car was sold as new. So if you choose to buy<br>a used car instead of a new one, you can choose to not pay tax on that<br>car.<br><br>Also excluded are investments, such as purchases of stock, corporate<br>mergers and acquisitions and capital investments. Savings and education<br>tuition expenses would be exempt as they would be considered an<br>investment (rather than final consumption).<br><br>A good would be considered \"used\" and not taxable if<br><br>- a consumer already owns it before the FairTax takes effect, or<br>- if the FairTax has been paid previously on the good (which may be<br>  different from the item being sold previously).<br><br>Personal services such as health care, legal services, financial<br>services, and auto repairs would be subject to the FairTax, as would<br>renting apartments and other real property.<br><br>Necessities like food, clothing, prescription drugs and medical services<br>would be taxed. The prebate would address the regressiveness of taxing<br>essentials, and everyone would have their taxes pre-refunded up to the<br>poverty line. To that end, the poor will still pay no tax on essentials.<br>Internet purchases would be taxed, as would retail international<br>purchases (such as a boat or car) that are imported to the United States<br>(collected by the U.S. Customs and Border<br>Protection).\[2\](#sCGrl){#cite-sCGrl .citation_link}<br><br>(EDIT) Comments are touching on the fact that this could be very simply<br>implemented *without repealing the 16th Amendment*. Indeed, you can<br>simply pass a Federal law implementing a Federal sales tax. Andrew Yang<br>has proposed as much by calling for a European-style Value-Added Tax<br>(VAT).<br><br>The problem is that doing so ***without repealing the 16th<br>Amendment* doesn't make anything better.**<br><br>In order to fix the problem, you must first get rid of the broken<br>system. We only need one source of Federal reveune, **either income or<br>consumption, not both. That's called double-taxation**. Your money<br>is taxed when you get it, and then it's taxed again when you spend it.<br><br>THIS CANNOT HAPPEN.<br><br>In order to properly implement this system, we must do a comprehensive<br>overhaul, including a repeal of the Federal income tax.<br><br>Which, as I mentioned, will take courage to do.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-XarCp){.citation_index} [[How FAIRtax Works \|<br>FAIRtax.org](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2bc9e6&url=https://fairtax.org/about/how-fairtax-works){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="fairtax.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-sCGrl){.citation_index} [[FairTax -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0f8906&url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairTax){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
