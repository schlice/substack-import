<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Where is the justification for the view that \"well regulated\" is just<br>describing the motivation for the Amendment? Could one not argue that<br>\"well regulated\<br>militia\" describes the condition under which one may bear arms? And\<br>thus a person who is not in a militia may not bear arms?*<br><br>Remember that *Heller* explained this (why the prefatory clause is not<br>limited by the operative clause):<br><br>*\"Reading the Second Amendment as protecting only the right to \'keep<br>and bear Arms\' in an organized militia therefore fits poorly with the<br>operative clause's description of the holder of that right as \'the<br>people\'\".*<br><br>If it was \"the militia\" that held that right, and not \"the people\"<br>as a whole, the Amendment would have said, \"the right of the militia to<br>keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" But remember that the<br>framers saw everyone as the militia. Even today, all citizens between 18<br>and 45 are still part of the unorganized militia under US Code (the<br>National Guard is considered the \"organized militia\"). We don\'t<br>perform general muster to check everyone\'s weapons because it\'s simply<br>too time-consuming and costly.<br><br>Also remember that the phrase \"the right of the people\" was used three<br>times in the Bill of Rights, and each time it referred to an individual<br>right, not a right gained by membership in a group.<br><br>It is for these reasons that we interpret that the operative clause is<br>not limited by the phrasing in the prefatory clause.<br><br>*Surely we can all agree that an Abrams tank is excessive for self<br>defense.*<br><br>Excessive for whom? And under what circumstances? If I live on 3,000<br>acres and I choose to defend myself with an Abrams tank, why is that<br>excessive? If someone is shooting at me with a rifle, I bet I\'d be<br>pretty well protected inside my Abrams tank. And I could choose to use<br>my top-mounted SAW instead of the main gun on the tank, no? Perhaps if I<br>lived in downtown Manhattan it might be a little bit of overkill (no pun<br>intended). But circumstances matter.<br><br>*But isn\'t the amendment, according to the Heller interpretation,<br>arguing that citizens must be able to have Hellfire missiles too?*<br><br>We understand that the weaponry employed by the military has vastly<br>outstripped the weaponry available to citizens for their own<br>self-defense. But there are two things to note:<br><br>1.  We have the National Guard to defend us against Federal military<br>    overreach.<br>2.  There were other potential prefatory clauses that could have been<br>    added, but the framers chose one that was most forefront on the<br>    minds of the people at the time: \"you\'re all part of the<br>    militia.\" They could have chosen the one that says, \"A firearm,<br>    being necessary to the personal self-defense\" but they assumed that<br>    *everyone already knew that they had a natural right to<br>    self-defense.* It is only in the modern day that such things are<br>    questioned.<br><br>Sometimes, things are known for so long that when we ask ourselves<br>\"why\", we often find it hard to explain.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-operative-phrase-in-the-second-amendment-assumed-to-be-bear-arms-rather-than-well-regulated/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
