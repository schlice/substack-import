<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is another situation where LGBT advocates used a logical fallacy<br>against common sense.<br><br>Since science is clear that there are only two genders, and you are<br>absolutely the gender which you were created in at the time of<br>conception, we know that transgenderism, or "gender dysphoria," is a<br>mental condition. Now, before you say that "it's not in the DSM V" it<br>absolutely is. Gender identity disorder (GID) was replaced with "gender<br>dysphoria" to kowtow to the pressure from the exceedingly small but very<br>vocal "cancel culture" crowd (whose grip is slipping today, thank God).<br><br>Gender identity disorder was previously treated just like any other<br>mental disease or deficiency: counseling, therapy, and medication.<br><br>However, there was a *very small subset* of niche therapists who<br>were trying some very radical therapy techniques that even conservatives<br>found to be very distasteful and a bit Draconian. This radical,<br>forceful, damaging practice was known as "conversion therapy."<br><br>The problem occurred when many medical groups and LGBT radicals co-opted<br>the accepted psychiatric counseling process for gender dysphoria and<br>make you believe that *any* therapy for gender dysphoria *is*<br>"conversion therapy" and is therefore bad.<br><br>This is a logical fallacy called \"Reductio ad Absurdum\" or the *appeal<br>to extremes.* The LGBT crowd got everyone to believe that because *a<br>very small subset* of therapists were attempting this radical, forceful<br>"conversion therapy" that *all* therapy for gender dysphoria was<br>therefore damaging and harmful.<br><br>In actuality, all therapy for gender dysphoria is not damaging or<br>harmful. The very small subset of niche therapists practicing very<br>controversial "conversion therapy" procedures *are indeed* harmful.<br><br>The world of psychiatric treatment is not well understood, even today.<br>The psychiatric drugs are very much a "trial and error" process. We try<br>you on one dose, see how your brain reacts, and adjust. We often kid<br>about the "medical practice," saying "wait a sec, I don't want them<br>*practicing* on me!" In the world of psychiatry, it is much closer to<br>practice than not.<br><br>And there have been some very high profile cases of abuse in the<br>psychiatric world. Psychiatry has developed quite a stigma, which<br>actually harms the real good that some therapy can do.<br><br>This is one of those cases.<br><br>\<br><br>This was quite a long and convoluted way to say the following:<br><br>Calling all gender dysphoria counseling "conversion therapy" unfairly<br>stigmatizes therapy which could do many people, especially young people,<br>a great deal of good.<br><br>**TL;DR: We should all oppose the very controversial practice of<br>"conversion therapy," but we should not call *all* gender<br>dysphoria counseling "conversion therapy."**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
