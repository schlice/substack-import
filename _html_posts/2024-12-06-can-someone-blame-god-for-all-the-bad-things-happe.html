<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No. I'll go even further and say that you cannot know that bad things<br>are even bad without God. The truth is that atheists borrow from theists<br>to make their arguments anyway.<br><br>The point is very simple. How do you know what is bad if you don't know<br>what is good? If there is no universal standard which applies to all<br>humans from which we all know what is good and what is bad, then you<br>cannot say that something is *objectively bad* or *objectively good.*<br>You must have an overarching standard of goodness to draw from in order<br>to say that something is bad, and that same bad thing is bad for all<br>people.<br><br>If there is no God, then there is no standard for goodness. What seems<br>bad to you may be good for someone else. If you think killing is wrong,<br>I may think that killing you and taking all of your stuff is good for<br>me.<br><br>Therefore, in order to say that anything in the world is bad means that<br>you have a standard of good. Since atheists have no overarching<br>universal standard for good, they must borrow from the theist's standard<br>of good in order to make their argument in the first place.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
