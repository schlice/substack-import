<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Short answer: no.\<br>\<br>Longer answer: detection of deception is as much art as it is science.<br>People deceive for many reasons, and the reasons span the emotional and<br>rational gamut. Whether or not there are physical ramifications (change<br>in sweating, tightening of the sphincter muscle, change in blood<br>pressure, change in heartbeat) to whether or not we actually tell a lie<br>is not a medical certainty. Polygraphers say they can accurately detect<br>lying, but under actual scientific scrutiny, the percentage of detection<br>of deception isn\'t much better than a coin toss.\<br>\<br>Because the odds aren\'t wonderful at actually being able to detect<br>deception, such tools are used to add to the body of evidence and to aid<br>investigators. They do not provide the final, definitive, and/or only<br>answer as to whether or not a person is truthful.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
