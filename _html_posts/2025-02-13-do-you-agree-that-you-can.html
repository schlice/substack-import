<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As always, with every legal question, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>In the United States, Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides<br>protection based on race, color, religion, or national origin, but it<br>doesn\'t explicitly include sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.<br>Because there is no national standard with respect to sex discrimination<br>in public accommodations, businesses must rely on state statutes in the<br>majority of cases.<br><br>State rules about sex-separated private venues vary depending upon what<br>each state considers a "public accommodation." Many cities and states<br>have laws which protect gender, as well as some states which protect<br>gender identity, in a place of public accommodation (like libraries,<br>movie theaters, shops, and other businesses which are open to the<br>public). But those laws vary widely by state.<br><br>And in most cases, private clubs, which are not open to the general<br>public, are not considered places of public accommodation, and are<br>usually exempt from public accommodation laws.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
