<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Apples and cars. The comparison between the US and Sweden is totally<br>unhelpful.<br><br>US police officers do not train for only 19 weeks. US police officers<br>only receive, on average (as all departments across the country are<br>different), about 21 weeks of classroom instruction *before they are<br>sworn and* can go out on patrol.<br><br>But that doesn't mean *solo* patrol taking calls for service.<br><br>This starts a multi-month period of *on-the-job training* (OJT)<br>which is overseen by a Field Training Officer (FTO). The rookie must<br>ride as part of a 2-man car until they have reached a certain level of<br>proficiency. Usually, field training under one or more FTOs takes about<br>six months, but this can vary from person to person, and from department<br>to department.<br><br>And we should recall that people in the US want to *cut* funding to<br>police departments, not increase it, so they are necessarily calling for<br>that training to be *reduced* due to budget cuts, not *increased*.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Should cops in the United States have to train for three years before<br>they start working as a cop just like they do in Sweden, or should the<br>US keep the current 19-week training before becoming a cop?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
