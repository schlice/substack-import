<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think that's a pretty short-sighted view of things.<br><br>Let's do "turnabout is fair play" today.<br><br>I say, **The lack of evidence for the existence of gravity should be<br>considered evidence for the non-existence of gravity.**<br><br>To which you would immediately say: *Nonsense! Without gravity, we'd all<br>just float off of the surface of the planet!*<br><br>True, but what is gravity made of? What is the atomic weight of gravity?<br>Gravity is not a thing, so gravity must not exist.<br><br>Clearly, the argument is nonsense, you'd reply, because we can see the<br>*effect* of gravity all around us, even if we can't see the *cause*.<br><br>Thank you for making my point for me, I would say.<br><br>Science cannot account for everything. In fact, there are many things<br>that scientific inquiry cannot explain, but we are all rational to<br>accept. For example:<br><br>1.  mathematics and logic (science can't prove them because science<br>    presupposes them)<br>2.  metaphysical truths (such as, there are minds that exist other than<br>    my own)<br>3.  ethical judgments (you can't prove by science that the Nazis were<br>    evil, because morality is not subject to the scientific method)<br>4.  aesthetic judgments (the beautiful, like the good, cannot be<br>    scientifically proven), and, ironically<br>5.  science itself (the belief that the scientific method discovers<br>    truth can't be proven by the scientific method itself)<br><br>So no, the lack of "evidence" which proves the existence of something<br>should not be considered evidence that something does not exist.<br><br>\<br><br>We should discuss whether or not you can actually *prove* that something<br>*does not* exist. Philosopher and scholar Mortimer Adler said, "An<br>affirmative existential proposition can be proven, but a negative<br>existential proposition---one which denies the existence of<br>something---cannot be proven." For example, I can tell you that red<br>eagles exist, and you can tell me that red eagles do not exist. I only<br>need to show you one example, at any point in history, to prove that red<br>eagles exist. You would need to be present at all places and at all<br>times to prove that red eagles do not, and have never, existed. This, of<br>course, is impossible to do.<br><br>\<br><br>Finally, I take issue with your statement regarding "evidence." What is<br>it that constitutes "evidence" of the existence of God? Is it the<br>material sciences? Because as I've already shown, there are plenty of<br>things which exist outside of the realm of material science which we are<br>all rational to accept (and we probably daily accept).<br><br>So if God cannot be proven through the use of the material sciences, how<br>can God be proven? We use the other methods of scientific inquiry:<br>logic, philosophy, and forensics. These are all valid methods of<br>scientific inquiry, even if they do not involve the material, physical<br>sciences. Science is, at its core, a search for causes. In fact, Francis<br>Bacon (the father of modern science) said, "True knowledge is knowledge<br>by causes." That's what scientists do---they try to discover what caused<br>what.<br><br>So we can use logic, philosophy, and forensics to prove that a creator<br>God exists. But you have to accept these lines of scientific inquiry as<br>valid before you can accept that a creator God exists. And most people<br>who say there is "no evidence" for the existence of God simply don't<br>accept logic or forensics as "evidence."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
