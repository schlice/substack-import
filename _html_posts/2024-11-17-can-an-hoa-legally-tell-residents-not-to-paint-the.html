<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer, as with all legal questions, is "it depends," and what it<br>depends on is your Governing Documents.<br><br>When it comes to paint, you can be required to submit your paint color<br>for approval, especially if the color is changing from what it was<br>originally painted. Even if you are painting the same color, you still<br>need to get approval (although it should be pretty straightforward to<br>say that you're repainting the same color). And yes, they can disapprove<br>of your choice of color.<br><br>Putting up Christmas decorations is a different story. I'm sure some<br>HOAs don't allow decorations, but you could be crossing into First<br>Amendment-protected territory if you disallow Christmas decorations, but<br>you permit, say, Diwali decorations or Kwanzaa decorations or Ramadan<br>decorations. You'd have to disallow *all* decorations outside of<br>houses in order to stay legally okay. Most HOAs don't want to pick that<br>fight when they disallow religious-based decorations, so they *regulate*<br>decorations, not outright *ban* them. They may regulate the timeframe<br>you can have them up, or how big they can be, or other details, but they<br>probably won't outright *ban* them.<br><br>Yes, the whole point of the Architecture Approval Authority (or whatever<br>your HOA calls it) is to maintain a specific look of the neighborhood.<br>It's literally written into your Governing Documents.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
