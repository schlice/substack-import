<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would it be illegal for me to put a device in someone\'s car to track<br>the car\'s movements?**<br><br>As with all legal answers, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>If it's *your car* and someone else is driving it, you absolutely can<br>add a device to track the car. If you have *joint* ownership of the car,<br>usually one owner can install a device in a car without the knowledge of<br>the other owner, assuming both owners drive the car regularly. You may<br>not be able to do this if the car is jointly owned but it is clear that<br>only one person drives that car (and you're not it).<br><br>It is generally illegal to apply a device to a car you do not own in<br>order to track it. This, of course, [[varies by<br>state](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6ff19e&url=https://privateinvestigator360.com/gps-tracking-laws-50-states/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="privateinvestigator360.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>In Texas, it is called "unlawful installation of a tracking device." It<br>is a Class A misdemeanor carrying penalties of up to one year in jail<br>and fines of up to \$4000. In most states, however, this is covered by<br>the state's *stalking* or *violation of privacy* laws.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
