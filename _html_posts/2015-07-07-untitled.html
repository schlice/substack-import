<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [I can\'t presume anything about your previous encounters<br>with police, but I can take some guesses, if you like.\<br>\<br>The first example could have been a few things:\<br>\<br>- Officers are always on the lookout for young, inexperienced drivers,<br>and are always trying to impart, in one way or another, the dangers of<br>exceeding the speed limit. He may have been trying to \"scare you<br>straight\" a little.\<br>\<br>The second example simply shows a lack of empathy, a lack of<br>professionalism, and an officer who thinks he missed his calling in<br>comedy. I\'m sorry that happened to you. If this was a major<br>metropolitan police department, I\'d be saddened at the state of affairs<br>in that place. If it was a big enough issue for you, perhaps you should<br>have taken the time to report it.\<br>\<br>However, for your reference, officers do not carry bottles of water for<br>people. Don\'t get me wrong, that doesn\'t give the officer permission<br>to insult or mock you. I\'m just telling you that the correct response<br>would have been, \"I\'m sorry, ma\'am, I don\'t have a bottle of water I<br>can get you. I\'ll try my best to finish this up quickly to get you on<br>your way.\"\<br>\<br>For me, the choice of agency for whom to work is important, because I\'m<br>a volunteer. I\'ll only work for an agency that respects people, shows<br>respect while on the job, and handles issues of disrespect quickly and<br>efficiently.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-safe-is-it-to-be-involved-in-a-relationship-with-a-police-officer/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
