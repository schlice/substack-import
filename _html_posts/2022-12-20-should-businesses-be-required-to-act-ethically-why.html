<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What are ethics? Who gets to determine what is ethical?<br><br>The answer is that ethics (as opposed to morals) are a system of rules<br>that define acceptable actions or correct behavior.<br><br>In fact, *legislators create ethical codes all the time*. They're called<br>*laws*.<br><br>We have chosen, in this country, to impart ethics to businesses through<br>the enactment of laws.<br><br>If we were to *remove laws*, what would organically spring up in its<br>place would be the rise of business groups. Things like the National<br>Federation of Independent Businesses, which is not only an advocacy<br>group, but also helps to define rules of conduct for member businesses.<br>Without business regulations in place, belonging to one of these<br>business groups or professional organizations would give you credit<br>above other businesses. People would look to your business to see if you<br>were a member before shopping there. We have simply chosen to do this<br>through law, and we impose these standards on all businesses using the<br>power of the state.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
