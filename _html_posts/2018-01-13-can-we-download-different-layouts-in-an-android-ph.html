<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Android, unlike iOS, can have different \"launchers\" applied, which<br>totally change the home screen. You can completely customize the home<br>screen and icons, backgrounds, animations, widgets, colors, themes, and<br>more!<br><br>There are many to choose from, but some favorites are Nova Launcher and<br>Action Launcher. They are highly customizable and a lot of fun. Search<br>for \"launchers\" in the Google Play Store, or search for a few of the<br>ones I mentioned.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
