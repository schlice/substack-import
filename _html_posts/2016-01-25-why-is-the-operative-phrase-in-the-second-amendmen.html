<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The operative phrase is the one that recognizes the right. The prefatory<br>phrase describes why the right needs to be recognized in the first<br>place. We can identify the operative phrase when we see the wording<br>which determines to whom the right belongs: \"the right of the people.\"<br><br>The court in *DC v Heller* explained all of this. Reading the *Heller<br>Law Brief* will give you very good insight into what the court was<br>thinking.<br><br>The court stated that the first part of the Second Amendment is called<br>the prefatory clause. This is the clause which explains the purpose<br>of the Amendment, the \"why\" this amendment is necessary. The prefatory<br>clause is \"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of<br>a free state\". This explains why we have a Second Amendment, but does<br>not limit or expand the scope of the second part.<br><br>The second part of the Second Amendment is called the **operative<br>clause:** \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be<br>infringed.\"<br><br>The *Brief* states it most succinctly: *\"Reading the Second Amendment<br>as protecting only the right to \'keep and bear Arms\' in an organized<br>militia therefore fits poorly with the operative clause's description of<br>the holder of that right as \'the people\'\"*. The phrase \"the right of<br>the people\" was used three times in the Bill of Rights, and each time<br>it was used to connote an individual right, not a right gained by<br>membership in a group. The rights are guaranteed to each individual.<br><br>That said, the framers saw \"all of the people\" as \"the militia.\"<br>They didn\'t see \"the militia\" and \"the citizens\" as two distinct<br>groups. They saw \"the militia\" as every able-bodied citizen who could<br>point a gun. Therefore, since any person could be called to defend their<br>country at any time, the right to keep and bear arms should be included<br>along with that.<br><br>So today, since not every person is a member of the militia (in<br>practice, if not in law), does that mean that the Second Amendment has<br>no relevance? Not at all. The Second Amendment listed only one prefatory<br>clause, but there were many that the framers were aware of at the time.<br>One of them was the \"natural right\" of self-defense, as defined by<br>Blackstone from England. The framers relied heavily on Blackstone\'s<br>definitions of \"natural rights\" when writing the Constitution. They<br>understood that we had a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of<br>happiness, not because the government granted those rights, but because<br>we were \"endowed by our Creator\" with those rights. The militia<br>prefatory clause was listed because it was the most forefront on the<br>minds of the colonists. In other words, they were saying \"Since it is<br>understood that we won this time, but you can be called at any time to<br>defend this new country, no one will ever abridge your rights to keep<br>and bear arms.\" There were plenty of other things that were also<br>understood, but none of those things needed to be listed. The necessity<br>of a militia was one of many things that precipitated the recognition of<br>that right.<br><br>Additionally, one of the other big contentions during the development of<br>the Constitution was the creation and authorization of a standing army.<br>People were (rightly) fearful of a standing army, because of the way<br>they were abused by the King in England. People really only wanted<br>armies stood up during wartime. The opposite view held that attempting<br>to stand up an army at the brink of war was not only foolish, but it<br>forced you to begin your war with untrained people who lacked the proper<br>technique and training to properly wage a war. The compromise was to<br>allow a standing army, but to give the people the right to keep and bear<br>arms to counter that standing army should the need arise. Additionally,<br>they passed the *Posse Comitatus Act*, one of the very first laws passed<br>by the first Congress. That act basically says that the military cannot<br>enforce civilian law. The military has no jurisdiction over civilians.<br>Together (the Second Amendment and the Posse Comitatus Act), these two<br>provisions were enacted to protect the citizens from the army. Today,<br>the weaponry of the army has far outstripped the weaponry available to<br>average citizens, but the military lives by the law, and you\'d be hard<br>pressed to find a Commander-in-Chief who would order the military to<br>attack civilians because of it. While we don\'t need to repel our own<br>army, there are plenty of other natural rights for which keeping arms<br>are nearly a requirement.<br><br>The Bill of Rights, therefore, is designed to enumerate the rights that<br>you already have as a human that the government may not take away. Your<br>right to self-defense and, by extension, your right to keep and bear<br>arms, is a natural right which the government did not give you, so the<br>government cannot take it away.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
