<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Police don\'t routinely just show up in neighborhoods with<br>nothing to do. The days of random patrol are long since gone. Budget<br>cuts mean fewer deputies on patrol, which means that we routinely have<br>more calls for service than we have deputies to service those calls.<br>There\'s not much we can do about that, it is what it is.\<br>\<br>What this means is that the number of police in a neighborhood is<br>directly proportional to the number of calls for service those people<br>place. If a neighborhood unilaterally decided they didn\'t want police<br>presence in their neighborhood any longer, the process would be very<br>simple: get everyone together and tell them never to call the police.<br>Done. Police will never be back unless they are investigating something<br>else, not responding to a call for service. Like I said, the days of<br>random patrol and officers with long periods of downtime between calls<br>is long gone.\<br>\<br>But they will then learn a very hard lesson: sometimes, the devil you<br>know is better than the devil you don\'t. They think the police are bad,<br>wait until the police are gone. The bad guys know the police are gone<br>just as much as the good guys do. That neighborhood will degenerate into<br>the worst hellhole of lawlessness ever. The police bring order; they<br>don\'t cause chaos. That\'s putting the cart before the horse.\<br>\<br>Neighborhoods have another option: they can *incorporate* as a township<br>or a city (if the size justifies it). Then they can hire their own<br>police force, levy their own taxes, maintain their own roads, and<br>essentially act autonomously (as long as they follow all laws for the<br>community organizations above them: city, county, state, etc). That way,<br>if they don\'t like the police force as it stands, they can make their<br>own. They can\'t be discriminatory in hiring practices, but they can<br>define the hiring practices for their own police force. If they could<br>define some test to ensure someone isn\'t biased against black people,<br>they could incorporate it into their hiring practices, assuming that<br>they could do so in a completely non-discriminatory way. It\'s not<br>likely that such a thing could happen, but I\'m throwing out the<br>possibilities here.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
