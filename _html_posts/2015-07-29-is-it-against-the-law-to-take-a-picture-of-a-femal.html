<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In general in the United States, in a public place like on<br>a sidewalk or in a park, the general rule is ***if you can see it, you<br>can shoot it***. There are certain exceptions, like pictures of certain<br>government installations (not monuments) and the like, and especially if<br>it is posted that you can\'t record there. For the most part, however,<br>if you can see it, you can record it. There is no reasonable expectation<br>of privacy on a public sidewalk.\<br>\<br>If a private property is open to the public, you can generally take<br>pictures there unless it is explicitly posted that you may not.\<br>\<br>You can post your recordings online. No consent is required from the<br>person who was recorded. If you wanted to show off your sidewalk<br>pictures on Quora, that is perfectly legal. However, you can\'t post<br>something that is *libelous*, or paints someone in a negative light. You<br>also can\'t expose secrets or private information about someone, like<br>your favorite movie star leaving an AA meeting.\<br>\<br>It\'s a decidedly gray area whether or not you can take pictures of<br>people who are inside buildings, if they are standing near open or<br>unblocked windows. State laws vary on this point. In general, you do not<br>have a reasonable expectation of privacy if you are standing in front of<br>an open window. But if you are in a location where you do have a<br>reasonable expectation of privacy, like a bathroom, some states still<br>say that the privacy expectation attaches, even if the window is open.\<br>\<br>What you cannot do:\<br>]<br><br>- You can\'t record/photograph people when they have a reasonable<br>  expectation of privacy, like while they are in a house with the blinds<br>  drawn, but there\'s a small crack between the blinds and using your<br>  telephoto lens you can see inside.<br>- You cannot charge for your pictures. If you do, you must have consent<br>  from everyone who you have photographed. If you\'re going to make a<br>  movie and sell it, everyone must have signed a release to use their<br>  likeness for commercial gain. You can sell your pictures to news<br>  organizations or use them for art, although you are highly encouraged<br>  to get releases anyway.<br>- You also can\'t take pictures of some landmarks and in National Parks<br>  and then sell those pictures without a permit (which costs money).<br><br>This is not an exhaustive list, and local rules vary, so always check<br>before you shoot.\<br>\<br>So can you take a picture of a woman\'s butt while she walks down the<br>sidewalk? Yep, perfectly legal. Albeit creepy and a bit stalker-ish, but<br>legal nonetheless. You can even post them to \"womensbutts.com\" if you<br>choose, as long as you don\'t reveal their identity or photograph their<br>faces (or get paid for posting), as that might be considered painting<br>someone in a negative light.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
