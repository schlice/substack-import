<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Have you ever thought about what it takes to join a gang? You gotta do<br>some pretty bad stuff to become a gang member. And if you *break* *the<br>rules* of the gang, you don't get a "stern talking-to." You get beaten,<br>usually within inches of your life.<br><br>So why would anyone in their right mind join a gang?<br><br>Because people want rules. They want stability. They want that<br>sense of belonging. They want purpose in life beyond eat, sleep,<br>and make babies.<br><br>Can you get that without a gang? If you're self-motivated. Not everyone<br>is. Some people simply require extrinsic motivation.<br><br>So why bring all this up?<br><br>Without religion, there are no rules, because **religion provides<br>morality.** Humans cannot have morality without religion. Even atheists<br>must borrow from religion in order to feign morality, because without<br>religion, there is no authority higher than humans which can be the<br>arbiter of moral standards. No one man is better than any other, and so<br>moral standards are individualized. In other words, without religion,<br>humanity is *self-referential.* Everything becomes "I do exactly what I<br>feel like doing, and I do it because I feel like doing it because it<br>helps me to eat, sleep, and make babies. It's all about me."<br><br>And predictably, right about now, the atheists are scrambling to hit the<br>"Comment" button because they can absolutely be moral without religion.<br>To which I say: *Poppycock*. *Bollocks*. *Mularkey.* If you say you can<br>have morals without religion, *whose* morals will you listen to? And<br>why? Will it be the moral standards of the person you *elect?* What<br>happens when you elect a new person with a new set of morals? Who says<br>you don't end up with *The Purge* in real life? If you can make the<br>rules, you can change the rules. Ultimately, every little society will<br>have its own set of morals because, lest I repeat myself, society<br>without religion is self-referential. Anyone claiming you can have moral<br>standards which apply to all people must borrow from religion (which<br>actually has a higher moral authority than humans) in order to do so,<br>full stop.<br><br>So would the world be a better place without religion? Decidedly not.<br>People need a moral standard outside of and greater than themselves upon<br>which to pattern their lives.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
