They knew of the complaint for months, they re-tooled<br>the whistleblower statute to allow it in, and they held on to the<br>complaint so that they could time its release (and the subsequent push<br>for impeachment) in the most appropriate way to serve their own ends.<br><br>Democrats published Articles of Impeachment, *without an impeachment<br>inquiry.*<br><br>Democrats will likely be the only ones voting for those articles, if<br>and when they make it to the floor of the House.<br><br>This isn't Congress impeaching the President, it's Democrats<br>impeaching the President. Everything they have done has not been for the<br>good of the country, but for the good of the Democrats, and at<br>the expense of the integrity of the Congress, and at the expense of any<br>non-partisan collaboration. They have done nothing to advance any<br>meaningful legislation. They are pandering to their base, plain and<br>simple.
