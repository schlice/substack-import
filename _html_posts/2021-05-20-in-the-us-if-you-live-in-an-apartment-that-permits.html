<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A dog barking is a natural thing. Even in an apartment complex.<br><br>And as everyone is aware, most cities and localities have noise<br>ordinances which prohibit excessive noise between certain hours (usually<br>11 PM and 7 AM local time, but may be different where you live).<br><br>That all said, *what about the times during the rest of the day?*<br><br>It's expected that you'll hear things in apartment complexes, including<br>barking dogs.<br><br>But a dog barking *constantly*, for four to six hours a day, is a<br>*disturbance*.<br><br>Start by addressing the tenant directly. Usually dogs bark like this<br>when no one is home. Perhaps they are bored. Perhaps they are nervous.<br>Regardless, the tenant may not know what is happening at home while he<br>or she is gone. So step one is to talk to them, calmly and<br>neighbor-like. There are interventions which can be implemented to help<br>fix whatever is causing the dog to bark. The tenant can check in with<br>the dog using technology. There are automated dog toys which can help to<br>entertain a bored dog. There's plenty which can be done. Maybe the<br>tenant may want to consider doggy day-care. It's actually very<br>reasonably priced.<br><br>If you get no joy from that, call the landlord. The landlord should take<br>action to minimize the issue.<br><br>If they do not, feel free to call Animal Control or your local police<br>department, and file a complaint for disturbing the peace.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**In the U.S., if you live in an apartment that permits dogs, does that<br>mean that they\'re allowed to disturb you with their barking and<br>howling?**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
