<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [She violated the law which states what her job duties are,<br>and that her job duties require her to certify marriage licenses.\<br>\<br>She refused to issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple because it<br>\"violated her conscience.\" When the petitioners asked the court to<br>intervene, she was then ordered by a judge to issue the license, and she<br>refused. She was then remanded into custody for contempt of court for<br>failing to comply with the judge\'s order to issue the license.\<br>\<br>She was released from jail today after the judge was satisfied that any<br>outstanding licenses were issued by her deputies. However, the judge<br>barred her from denying marriage licenses in the future. She still<br>claims she will not issue licenses to homosexual couples that bear her<br>name. Her attorney says that it is within the power of the court to have<br>her name removed from the license.\<br>\<br>Personally, I think that if someone is not going to do their job, they<br>should be removed from office. And since she is an elected official, a<br>recall election would be the next logical step.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
