<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Here's the problem.<br><br>The basic definition of rape is sexual intercourse without consent.<br>Consent is a conscious decision to approve of an activity, without<br>impaired judgement. If you are drunk, your judgement is impaired, so you<br>cannot give legal consent to sex.<br><br>The law says that if you know a person is drunk, and you press forward<br>with sex, it's considered rape. But it's decidedly less clear-cut if you<br>are *both* drunk. The details in any given situation vary, so it's<br>difficult to determine if anyone has consented.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is having drunk sex rape? My ex-boyfriend is trying to claim that I<br>wanted to get him drunk so we could have sex, but all I ever did is ask<br>if he would want to have drunk sex and if that would be something he's<br>interesting in.
