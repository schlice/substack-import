<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, no and no. In most states, even California, landlords in apartment<br>complexes *can* install cameras (with no audio) in common areas (such as<br>shared hallways), but they cannot install cameras inside of apartments.<br><br>In California, if you are renting a house, it becomes a little<br>trickier, as privacy laws are a little tougher.<br><br>If the entire house is being rented, you may not install cameras<br>anywhere inside the house. Since the tenant is renting the entire house,<br>they have a reasonable expectation of privacy inside the entire house.<br>You may install cameras on the outside of the house, and you can<br>even install a doorbell-style camera, but cameras cannot be installed<br>inside the house.<br><br>If you are just renting a room out to someone, or multiple rooms to<br>multiple someones, it is at least potentially legal to have cameras in<br>common areas (living rooms, kitchens, etc), but never in any area for<br>which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy (bedrooms, bathrooms,<br>etc). The cameras cannot record audio, and **notice must be posted<br>before entering the house that cameras are in use in the common areas**.<br>Even so, there are significant privacy concerns in California, so this<br>may present legal challenges.<br><br>While it *should be* legal in California to install a camera given the<br>above stipulations, I would strongly suggest that for this use case<br>specifically, if you are a landlord renting a house to multiple people,<br>you consult with an attorney in your area before installing cameras in<br>this way.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
