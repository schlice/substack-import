<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As a matter of law in almost every jurisdiction, an officer must be<br>trained on every piece of kit which rides on his official duty belt.<br><br>That means that if they have a canister of OC spray on their belt, they<br>have been trained in its use, have deployed it (sometimes into the<br>wind), and if they haven't deployed pepper spray into the wind, they may<br>have had some sprayed on their face so that they can experience what it<br>feels like. You don't want to have your first experience with pepper<br>spray to be when you're trying to spray a suspect and you get<br>backsplash. You need to know how to properly deploy the spray without<br>debilitating yourself in the process. That means you need to know what<br>to expect if you get hit with the spray. There is no simulation that can<br>accurately explain what OC feels like. You simply have to feel it.<br><br>TASERs are no different. The only difference in TASER training is that<br>you're not hit with the darts. It takes too long to extract the darts,<br>and medical crews are required to assist, etc. Just hitting everyone in<br>the class with the TASER would take all day. Training TASERs have a<br>special cartridge which consists of heavier-duty wires and alligator<br>clips instead of darts at the end. The wires do not deploy; there is no<br>compressed air charge inside the cartridge; the wires remain outside the<br>unit. The clips are attached to the officer's clothes and the TASER is<br>activated.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
