<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ah, you've fallen into a very common trap.<br><br>When you follow this policy, you become a permanent resident alien.<br>This means you are allowed to live and work in Australia for as long as<br>you like.<br><br>**But you are not a citizen. Therefore, this is not an "immigration<br>policy" since you are not "immigrating" to Australia. You simply remain<br>in the country as a permanent resident alien.**<br><br>We have a similar program in the United States, commonly referred to as<br>a "green card." It constitutes permanent residency, but not citizenship.<br><br>Non-citizenship carries some weighty caveats. For example, if you commit<br>a crime while you are in a foreign country (i.e. a country that is not<br>the one which correlates to your citizenship), you can be deported<br>as part of your punishment. You may have come to the country on a green<br>card (or a 189 visa in Australia), but that doesn\'t make you a<br>*citizen**.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
