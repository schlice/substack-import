<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are the limits on 1st amendment rights in regards to employees of<br>the federal government?**<br><br>First, let's correct your terminology. What you call "First Amendment<br>Rights" are actually natural rights you have as a human being. The First<br>Amendment simply prevents the government from making any law infringing<br>on your natural right. However, that's the government restricting a<br>private citizen. Employers retain the right to fire you if they don't<br>like your protected speech.<br><br>But the situation gets much more complicated if the government is the<br>employer. The government certainly has a legitimate need to maintain an<br>appropriate workplace and control speech, but it wouldn't be right if a<br>government employee had fewer rights than a private employee, either.<br><br>Courts currently apply a three-prong test to determine if a government<br>employee's speech has First Amendment protection:<br><br>1.  **Government employees are only protected by the First Amendment<br>    when they are speaking as *private citizens*.\<br>    \**<br>    If their speech is part of their official job duties, then they can<br>    be fired or disciplined for it.<br>2.  **If a government employee was speaking as a private citizen, was<br>    their speech regarding a matter of public concern?**\<br>    \<br>    If they weren't speaking on a matter of public concern, the First<br>    Amendment will *not* protect their speech.<br>3.  **If a government employee was speaking as a private citizen on a<br>    matter of public concern, is the government's interest in<br>    efficiently fulfilling its public services greater than the<br>    employee's interest in speaking freely?\<br>    \**<br>    Courts analyze the government's interest in efficiently fulfilling<br>    its public services using the following criteria:<br>    1.  Whether the speech would interfere with the employee's<br>        responsibilities;<br>    2.  The nature of the working relationship between the speaker and<br>        those at whom the criticism was directed;<br>    3.  Whether the relationship between the speaker and the person<br>        criticized was sufficiently close that the speech would create<br>        disharmonious relations in the workplace;<br>    4.  Whether the speech would undermine an immediate superior's<br>        discipline over the employee; and<br>    5.  Whether the speech would compromise the loyalty and confidence<br>        required of close working employees.\[1\](#CuAnO){#cite-CuAnO<br>        .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-CuAnO){.citation_index} [[Government Employees & First<br>Amendment<br>Overview](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=edbb06&url=https://www.freedomforuminstitute.org/first-amendment-center/topics/freedom-of-speech-2/free-speech-and-government-employees-overview/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="freedomforuminstitute.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
