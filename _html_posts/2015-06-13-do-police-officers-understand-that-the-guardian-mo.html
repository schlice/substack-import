<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [No officer has to be taught that he is a Guardian. They<br>all know it, from the second they step foot in the Academy. \"Why are<br>you here?\" \"To protect and serve.\" Easy. Rolls off the tongue.\<br>\<br>However, the flip side of that is that while no one has to be taught to<br>be a Guardian, within the breast of each officer must inexorably beat<br>the heart of a Warrior. That Warrior must be ready to defend the people<br>he is sworn to defend. The Warrior spirit must be taught, molded, and<br>shaped. The extent to which that is done correctly will determine how<br>well an officer can control the Warrior, call it out when needed, and<br>stow it when not. That Warrior is the one thing that will keep him<br>alive. The officer may be the Guardian on the outside, but he\'s still a<br>Warrior on the inside.\<br>\<br>This is why many departments don\'t wear their ballistic vests on the<br>outsides of their uniform; they wear them (the sign of the Warrior)<br>underneath a nice, button-down shirt (the sign of the Guardian). How you<br>see your officers dress is an indication of whether or not they believe<br>themselves to be Guardian-first, or Warrior-first. Believe me, it\'s<br>uncomfortable, but if that\'s the image your department wants to<br>portray, they\'ll have their officers wearing their ballistic vests<br>underneath their shirts.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
