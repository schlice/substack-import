They will do it in any way<br>that they can, because they want to be the one that snaps that one<br>picture that everyone wants to buy.\<br>\<br>But while any person is out in public, they can be photographed or<br>recorded. You have no expectation of privacy when you are outside your<br>home. Even if you\'re inside your home, if you\'re standing by an open<br>window, you can be photographed. You have no expectation of privacy when<br>your blinds are not drawn.\<br>\<br>Some things they do are clearly illegal: you can\'t obstruct someone\'s<br>movement in public. You can\'t incite a riot, either by your words or<br>your actions. That\'s why celebrities have bodyguards. They keep the<br>paparazzi on the right side of the law.\<br>\<br>As [[Crysti<br>Drake](https://www.quora.com/profile/Crysti-Drake-4)]{.qlink_container}<br>said, celebrities often must seclude when they want<br>privacy.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
