<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [\"Putting the past behind you\" is a phrase which means<br>that the past is history, so there is little we can do about it.\<br>\<br>We should be able to put the past behind us, but some have problems<br>with that. As [[Sara<br>Doubleday](https://www.quora.com/profile/Sara-Doubleday)]{.qlink_container}<br>said, some people get stuck in it, can\'t let it go. Sometimes, there is<br>a mental disease/defect that causes people to get stuck in the past.\<br>\<br>A phrase I heard, which reminds us to live in the now, is: \"The past is<br>history, tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift, that\'s why we call it<br>*the present*.\"]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
