<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, I want to commend you for making this comparison to the<br>parable of the Prodigal Son. Most people just ignore the fact that the<br>parable continued after the son came home, but you did not.<br><br>Josh Conrad from Vox Church wrote probably one of the best blog posts on<br>the (other) prodigal son---the one you're talking about. I want to quote<br>it in its entirety, and I really want you to read and understand it.<br>Take time to read this, it's really good.<br><br>> The older son never left home, yet he's as lost as his brother was.<br>><br>> Have you ever read Jesus' parable of The Prodigal Son in Luke 15 from<br>> the perspective of the older son? While the younger son gets most of<br>> the attention in the parable, the older son's heart is just as<br>> misguided and broken, and just as much in need of healing.<br>><br>> The younger son in Jesus' story makes clear to his father that he<br>> wishes to leave the family and wants his share of the inheritance. The<br>> older son, determined to out-shine his brother's selfish rejection of<br>> their father, begins to build his case to earn love and approval by<br>> working for his father year over year. The older son is even in the<br>> fields working when the younger son returns, and his pile of<br>> accomplishments meant to earn the father's love turns to resentment<br>> and bitterness as his father celebrates the younger son's long-awaited<br>> return. The older son has spent his life striving to earn the father's<br>> love, yet the father's indulgent welcome to the younger son disrupts<br>> everything the older son thought he understood about love and<br>> acceptance.<br>><br>> The older son is the (other) prodigal in the story. Where the younger<br>> son fled publicly, the older son fled privately. He may have<br>> physically stayed with his father, but his heart ran away long ago.<br>> The father, fresh from receiving the younger son back to the family<br>> and throwing him a 'Welcome Home' party, leaves the feast to win the<br>> heart of the older son. His soft correction at the end of the parable<br>> completely reframes the older son's perspective when he says "You've<br>> always stayed with me, and everything I have is yours."<br>><br>> That promise ("everything I have is yours") is for the (other)<br>> prodigals. It's for the older sons who have remained in the flesh but<br>> fled in the spirit. It's for those who have silently ached in the hope<br>> of earning their Father's love. It's for me, because I am the (other)<br>> prodigal. My heart has been won back by the Father's kindness time and<br>> time again, and so can yours. But you need to stop striving. Stop<br>> building your case. Ignore the instinct to earn what God has given to<br>> you freely, and find your greatest satisfaction in His undeserved,<br>> unmerited, and never-ending grace. Learn what He means when He says<br>> "everything I have is yours." Learn what it means to return, even<br>> though you never left.\[1\](#xenJK){#cite-xenJK .citation_link}<br><br>What a powerful reminder for us!<br><br>The most important pull quote: "Stop building your case. Ignore the<br>instinct to *earn* what God has given to you *freely*, and find your<br>greatest satisfaction in His undeserved, unmerited, and never-ending<br>grace."<br><br>I wish you all the best.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-xenJK){.citation_index} [[The (Other) Prodigal<br>Son](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3d60bc&url=https://voxchurch.org/page/688?Item%3D226){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="voxchurch.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
