<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the United States (and this is only applicable to the United States),<br>our Declaration of Independence actually spells this out fairly clearly<br>(emphasis mine):<br><br>*We hold these truths to be* *self-evident**: that all Men are<br>created Equal; that they are* *endowed by their Creator* *with<br>certain* *unalienable* *Rights; that among these are the right to<br>Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.*<br><br>Let's review the words I highlighted:<br><br>- self-evident: This word means the same as axiomatic.<br>- endowed by their Creator: This phrase means that man did not bestow<br>  these rights on their fellow Man. These rights did not come from Man,<br>  so they cannot be removed by Man.<br>- unalienable: This word means that there is no way that anyone can<br>  remove this right from a person, not even by the person themselves.<br>  Therefore, you couldn't give up your own right to life, even if you<br>  willingly chose to.<br><br>Therefore, in the United States, the right to life is based on our<br>belief that such a right was bestowed by our Creator.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
