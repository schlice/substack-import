<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In most states, when a landlord wants to access your apartment, he has<br>to have a reason. For example, Florida law lists a few reasons why a<br>landlord may want to access your apartment:<br><br>- in case of emergency, such as a fire or serious water leak<br>- to make needed inspections and repairs<br>- pursuant to a court order<br>- if the landlord has reasonable cause to believe the tenant has<br>  abandoned the premises<br>- when reasonably necessary during a tenant\'s extended absence, defined<br>  as one-half the time for periodic rental payments, given that that the<br>  tenant did not notify the landlord of the absence, or<br>- to show the property to prospective new tenants, purchasers or<br>  contractors.<br><br>If the landlord doesn't tell you why he needs access to your apartment,<br>you could rightly think that he could be not only violating the law<br>(accessing your apartment for a reason not permitted by law), which<br>would be considered trespassing, but violating your privacy and causing<br>you emotional distress. You would hate to misinterpret what he's doing<br>and begin legal action for the invasion of privacy and trespassing,<br>right? So he really ought to tell you why he's there.<br><br>Your lease should specify how much time your landlord must give you<br>before he accesses your apartment, and he can request that you not be<br>inside. But he treads on very thin ice (with warm boots) by doing this.<br>You have the right to have cameras in your apartment; put some small<br>cameras up and watch what he's doing.<br><br>If the landlord violates these terms in the lease, you should notify him<br>in writing of the violation of law, or the violation of the lease, if<br>he's not complying with the access requirements in the lease. The "big<br>stick" you have in your corner is that if the landlord is violating the<br>lease, you have the right to terminate the lease if he doesn't come into<br>compliance within seven days of the letter.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
