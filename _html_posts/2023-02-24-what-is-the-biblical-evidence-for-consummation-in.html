<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is none. Sex is not necessary to make a marriage. You can still be<br>married without sex.<br><br>But sex is designed to take place only *within* a marriage.<br><br>There was a period of time that Paul dealt with in the early church in<br>Corinth when married couples were binding themselves to asceticism,<br>or sexual purity, within their marriages. They were doing this so that<br>they could be *more pure* and become *more acceptable* to God, so they<br>were keeping themselves from each other.<br><br>Paul advises them that this is dangerous. It's in his first letter to<br>the Corinthians (7:2--5):<br><br>> *Each man should have sexual relations with his own wife, and each<br>> woman with her own husband. The husband should fulfill his marital<br>> duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. The wife does<br>> not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband.*<br>><br>> *In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own<br>> body but yields it to his wife. Do not deprive each other except<br>> perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote<br>> yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not<br>> tempt you because of your lack of self-control.*<br><br>That whole "authority over" thing tends to get very confused. The word<br>used is sort of *lazily* translated as "authority," but it is better<br>translated as "responsibility." In other words, the husband has the<br>responsibility for the needs of the wife, and the wife has the<br>responsibility for the needs of the husband.<br><br>And we already know that sex outside of marriage is a sin:<br><br>> Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be<br>> undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous. ---<br>> Hebrews 13:4<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
