<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because vaccines don't prevent COVID cases.<br><br>There really isn't much more to say than that. But if I don't put more,<br>my answer will simply be collapsed because it isn't long enough.<br><br>Vaccines help protect you against the worst outcomes from COVID<br>infection. They keep you out of the hospital. You're still going to get<br>COVID, but you're not likely to die from it. You'll end up home in bed<br>for a few days.<br><br>Vaccines do not prevent you from catching COVID. They also don't prevent<br>you from passing COVID on to other people. That's why you can have a<br>100% vaccination rate in a population yet people will still catch COVID<br>and will still pass it on to others.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why is 100% vaccinated Gibraltar having record high cases of COVID 19<br>(Jan 8 2022)?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
