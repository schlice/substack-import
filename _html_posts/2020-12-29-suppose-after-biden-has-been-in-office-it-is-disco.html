<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Suppose after Biden has been in office, it is discovered there was<br>massive voter fraud, what happens next? Is Biden impeached?**<br><br>Seems most folks are not answering the question.<br><br>Unless Biden was personally involved with the voter fraud which got him<br>into office, he would not be impeached. Impeachment is for high crimes<br>and misdemeanors. Unless Biden committed those crimes, impeachment would<br>not be a remedy.<br><br>If it was discovered that there was massive voter fraud, the first<br>questions would go to the states where that fraud was discovered. "You<br>certified your election results. How did you miss this massive voter<br>fraud?" Many years will be spent sorting out how the states allowed this<br>massive voter fraud to go undetected. I bet you'd also see some<br>complicit election officials going to jail as well. States will have to<br>show that they are rooting out the sources of the fraud. New laws will<br>be written, and my guess is that most of the laws will center around<br>mail-in voting. If there was massive voter fraud, the most likely vector<br>for such fraud would be mail-in voting. New security procedures will be<br>implemented, and (I suspect) most states will never do a massive mail-in<br>voting election like was done this year.<br><br>(EDIT) As of today (June, 2021), several states have passed laws<br>preventing exactly the kinds of vectors that opened the door to the<br>voter fraud we saw during Biden's election. Note that we haven't been<br>able to prove that there was *enough* voter fraud to sway the outcome,<br>but that doesn't change the fact that these liberal policies regarding<br>mail-in voting made it easier to effect this level of fraud. (/EDIT)<br><br>There may even be Federal rules for states that wish to participate in<br>federal elections. States which did not check signatures, states which<br>did not follow standard counting procedures, states which sent<br>unsolicited ballots to massive amounts of people on their voter rolls,<br>including dead people, etc., will all be highly scrutinized for the next<br>few years until voting is revamped. Remember Florida's 2000 voting<br>debacle during the Bush v. Gore election? Two words: hanging chads.<br>Well, Florida got a huge black eye over that, and they spent the next<br>few years cleaning up their voting systems. 2020 may not have been<br>perfect, but Florida was on top of it. Their election ran very smoothly.<br><br>Since the states certified their results in accordance with the<br>Constitution, the results would be allowed to stand, but the Biden<br>presidency would be marred by scandal, knowing that it's likely<br>(although never proven) that he was not the people's choice. He won't be<br>the only president ever accused of being seated under fraudulent<br>conditions, but he would be the latest.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for<br>everyone.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
