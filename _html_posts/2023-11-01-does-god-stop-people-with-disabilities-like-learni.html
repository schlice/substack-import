<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So there's really two questions here:<br><br>- Can God stop anyone from getting a driver's license?<br>- Does God routinely do so?<br><br>The answer to virtually¹ every "Can God" question is yes, God can.<br>God is *omnipotent*, which means unlimited power. He is also<br>*omnipresent*, which means that He exists outside of time. All time is<br>"now" for God: the past is now, the present is now, the future is now.<br>He sees it all as "now". So can God stop anyone (be it a person with<br>disabilities or otherwise) from getting a driver's license? Yes, He can.<br><br>As to the second question, the answer is no, God does not do this.<br>If a person with learning disabilities or special needs does not get a<br>driver's license, it's not God's doing, it's theirs. God never promised<br>to take driving tests for anyone, and He never promised to keep anyone<br>from driving a car.<br><br>Take care of the things you can control. Let God handle the things that<br>are outside of your control.<br><br>\<br><br>¹ God cannot deny His nature, so God cannot do things which deny His<br>nature. For example, God cannot be evil, so God cannot do evil things.<br><br>He also cannot do things which are impossible to do in the context in<br>which they are being done. The example given is "can God create a rock<br>so heavy that He cannot lift it?" God is omnipotent, which means<br>unlimited power. This does not mean "God can do anything," but instead<br>it means "God can do anything *which can be done*." God's omnipotence is<br>more like the power to effect change, the power to make an action.<br>Therefore, a rock which God cannot lift would have to be a rock which is<br>infinitely heavy, as God can apply an infinite lifting force. However,<br>within the constraints of this physical universe, a rock which is<br>infinitely heavy must have infinite mass, and would therefore be<br>infinitely large, and in practice, you cannot have an infinite thing in<br>this universe. Therefore, since this universe cannot contain a rock with<br>infinite mass, God cannot create a rock so heavy that He cannot lift it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
