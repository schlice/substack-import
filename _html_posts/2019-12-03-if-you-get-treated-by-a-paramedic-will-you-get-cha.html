<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(US Answer Only)*<br><br>The ambulance service will get your billing information from the<br>emergency room, including your insurance information. In this way, you<br>only need to provide all your information one time, and everyone who<br>needs to be paid will get the information from the one check-in.<br><br>Whether or not you get directly charged for any services you receive<br>depends on what insurance you have and how you pay for your portion of<br>the bill (i.e. copay, coinsurance, etc).<br><br>If you have insurance, the ambulance service will first bill your<br>insurance policy. If you have a copay structure for ambulance service in<br>your insurance policy, you will be charged the copay. If you have a<br>coinsurance structure for ambulance service, you will be charged your<br>portion of the total bill, adjusted to meet the insurance company's<br>billing agreement.<br><br>If you do not have insurance, the hospital will help you sign up for it<br>if you choose. They can assist you with signing up for Medicare or<br>Medicaid (if you qualify) or they can help you enroll in one of the<br>state-sponsored ACA exchanges (if they exist in your state).<br><br>If you choose not to enroll, or you do not qualify, you'll receive the<br>bill for all of your services.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
