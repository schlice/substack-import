<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*So let's lay the groundwork out first.*<br><br>*You are asking whether or not it is* *ethical* *to* *force*<br>*vaccinations on everyone. That is the question I will be answering. Not<br>whether or not* *mandates* *are* the right thing to do *or<br>whether or not* **it is good for you/others/the country/the medical<br>system/the planet/Mother Earth/our future** *or anything else. Clog up<br>my comments section with nonsense and I'll turn them off. I don't have<br>time for your debates, pro-vaxx, anti-vaxx, whatever. Leave your<br>commentary about anything besides ethics to yourself.*<br><br>*Also, this is not about me; I have no dog in this fight. I have MS and<br>my drugs cause me to be immunocompromised, so I am fully vaccinated by<br>choice. I'll probably also get a booster.*<br><br>*\<stepping off of soapbox\>*<br><br>\<br><br>Let's define terms for everyone. It is necessary to do this because it<br>appears that in most of these answers, people are confusing morals,<br>ethics, and societal goods.<br><br>Ethics are the set of principles and the rules of conduct defined by<br>society at large. In contrast, morals are internal principles of<br>right and wrong. Ethics are defined as they are because "society" says<br>that it's the right thing to do. Morals are defined as they are because<br>you personally believe that something is either right or wrong.<br><br>Ethics can vary by situation, but the foundation upon which you<br>build your ethical rules must be similar, or your ethics are useless.<br>Ethics are objective: rational, clear-cut, and impartial. In<br>opposition, morals are, basically, subjective. They are up to you,<br>personally, to define. They are not the same throughout a group in<br>society.\[1\](#qyWpU){#cite-qyWpU .citation_link}<br><br>One more definition in terms: forced vaccination. This is where we<br>round you up, tie you to a bed, and inject you with a vaccine, against<br>your will. This is different from mandated vaccination, where we<br>make it functionally impossible to exercise your right to participate in<br>modern society without being vaccinated.<br><br>Okay, let's get to the question.<br><br>**From a PURELY ETHICAL point of view, it is UNETHICAL to force<br>vaccination of the entire population.**<br><br>To determine this, we must look at similar situations in society and<br>find the ethical foundations of those decisions so that we can apply a<br>consistent standard. Normally, we look to the Supreme Court as the<br>ethical arbiter for us. We can't always do that, but in most cases, we<br>can.<br><br>You cannot apply *Jacobson v. Massachusetts* to the current debate, as<br>*Jacobson* discussed whether or not a state can mandate a vaccine using<br>its police powers (and the Court said it can). There is no concomitant<br>Federal police authority over the entire US population. Therefore, we<br>will look at the *abortion* standard, as it is the only applicable<br>federal standard when it comes to the question at hand.<br><br>Far from being unrelated, ethically-speaking, the foundation of the<br>abortion debate is what we call bodily autonomy, or who gets to<br>determine what happens to my body. The US Supreme Court has decided in<br>*Griswold v. Connecticut* that a right to privacy exists in the<br>Constitution, and in *Roe v. Wade*, that the principle of the right to<br>privacy extends to the human body, such that a woman's right to an<br>abortion cannot be infringed by the government, as it is an intrusion on<br>the aforementioned right to privacy within one's body.<br><br>Therefore, If it's okay for a woman to say that her bodily autonomy is<br>preeminent (and therefore, by extension, **everyone's bodily autonomy is<br>preeminent**), and it takes precedence over the life within her<br>(regardless of its stage of development), then it's okay for *me* to say<br>that *my* bodily autonomy is preeminent*,* and it takes precedence over<br>the lives around me. Ethically, you can't have one without the other, or<br>you are ethically inconsistent. While your ethics can vary from<br>situation to situation, the foundations underpinning your ethics must<br>remain consistent, objective, rational, clear-cut, and impartial.<br><br>*But*, you may say, *your decision to remain unvaccinated affects me!*<br>To which I reply: You are vaccinated, are you not? Then what I do is<br>completely independent of what you do. You are protected from both the<br>vaccinated and the unvaccinated. My decision to not vaccinate does not<br>harm you. The only people who should fear the unvaccinated are the<br>unvaccinated. But more importantly, my right to bodily autonomy is not<br>impacted by your desires or needs.<br><br>*But*, you may say, *you can harbor the virus and create mutations!* To<br>which I reply: So can you. The vaccinated can still contract COVID-19,<br>which also means they can create mutations. Granted, the possibility<br>that they could is slimmer, but it is not zero. And to force<br>vaccinations on a population to prevent a hypothetical variant from<br>happening in one person is also ethically inconsistent. My bodily<br>autonomy is not defined by a hypothetical possibility of creating a<br>viral mutation.<br><br>*But,* you may say, *you'll clog up* *my* *emergency room!* To which<br>I say, Fine! Charge me more for my emergency room stay! Hire more<br>doctors! Make bigger emergency departments, and fund it on the backs of<br>the unvaccinated! But denying me care due to a choice I am legally<br>allowed to make is a slippery slope we definitely don't want to begin<br>sliding down. My bodily autonomy is not defined by your emergency room's<br>capacity.<br><br>Therefore, it is 100% unethical, by the bodily autonomy standard,<br>to *force* people to be vaccinated.<br><br>\<br><br>That is *not* to say that it is unethical to *mandate* vaccination.<br><br>There is a difference between forcing vaccination and mandating<br>vaccination.<br><br>- Forced vaccination is where we round you up, handcuff you, chain<br>  you to a bed, and inject you with a vaccine, against your will.<br>- Mandated vaccination is where we set rules in society such that if<br>  you want to participate in any activity outside of your home, you must<br>  be vaccinated. You basically can't leave your house unless you are<br>  going to the hospital to be vaccinated; otherwise, you cannot<br>  participate in society.<br><br>While it is entirely unethical to force vaccinations, it can be<br>ethical to mandate vaccinations.<br><br>If the situation were *so dire* that normal society could not function<br>without a vaccine mandate, then yes, mandated vaccinations could indeed<br>be a thing.<br><br>**But we don't actually have that situation today, do we. If we're<br>honest with ourselves, we really don't.**<br><br>In the US, we have near-total vaccine availability (which means you can<br>protect yourself if you choose). The vaccines are free-to-you, so cost<br>at the vaccination center is not an issue. We have social distancing. We<br>have masks which you are free to wear to help protect yourself against<br>the virus in the air. And while the *infection rate* is still somewhat<br>higher than I'd like to see it, the *death rate* from COVID-19 has been<br>precipitously falling, and continues to fall every single day. We have<br>*effective treatments* for COVID-19 infection, thanks to the Herculean<br>efforts of doctors and medical staffs across the country, and we have<br>cut down the time of active infection from *weeks* to *days.*<br><br>So do we *really need* a vaccine mandate? Certainly not, at this stage<br>of the game.<br><br>Your ability to protect yourself is high, your risk of contracting<br>COVID-19 is low, and the risk of a bad outcome (unless you are in a<br>known risk group) is *vanishingly* low.<br><br>And *none of this* even begins to discuss what happens to those who have<br>already been infected with COVID-19 and have recovered. Study after<br>study worldwide have proven and re-proven that previous COVID-19<br>infection provides durable, long-lasting immunity from re-infection.<br>Therefore, the choice for someone who has already had COVID-19 should be<br>even more scrupulously weighed.<br><br>All of this taken together **does not equate to the necessity for a<br>vaccine mandate.**<br><br>But that's beside the point. We weren't talking about a *mandate*, we<br>were talking about the ethics of forcing vaccination, which is<br>completely unethical by society's own standards.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>From a purely ethical point of view, would it be right to force the<br>vaccine on everyone (except those with relevant medical conditions)?<br>Hypothetically, what would the result be? (assuming there won\'t be a<br>slippery slope into a totalitarian dystopia)<br><br>\<br><br>*This is a contentious and emotionally-charged topic. I have taken the<br>(unusual for me) step of leaving comments open.*<br><br>*Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner. But do not misunderstand, I take this step very<br>cautiously, and I have no tolerance for harassing or inane behavior.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you are simply<br>commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised<br>if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything vaguely harassing in<br>there, and your deletion will be followed by a block/mute, and a BNBR<br>report. I will do this immediately and with no compunction. You have<br>been warned. Be nice.*<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-qyWpU){.citation_index}<br>[https://youtu.be/drxrd2LSydY(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c4a419&url=https://youtu.be/drxrd2LSydY){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
