<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How quickly can police be at the location of a 911 call?<br><br>This is highly dependent on where you are, and how far away they are. In<br>some cases, police can be to you within seconds, if you're within<br>seconds of them. In others, if you're more rural, it can take them<br>upwards of 30 minutes to get to you.<br><br>And that's only if they start rolling as soon as you call. If they<br>triage your call, it could take them a half hour before they even start<br>coming to see you, because you're queued up behind other calls for<br>service.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
