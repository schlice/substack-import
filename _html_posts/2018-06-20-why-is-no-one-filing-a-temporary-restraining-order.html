<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Thank you for letting me write an answer, [[Corley<br>Swopes](https://www.quora.com/profile/Corley-Swopes)]{.qlink_container}.<br>I know you're not my biggest fan, and I appreciate you giving me an<br>opportunity to answer your question, dispassionately, even though I rage<br>inside. For that, I thank you.<br><br>**Why is no one filing a temporary restraining order to stop the family<br>separation operation (at least for a brief time) at the border until the<br>issue can be adjudicated?**<br><br>A TRO can not direct any organization or agency to act unlawfully. A TRO<br>also cannot "restrain" a federal organization from following the law.<br><br>From the [[US Attorney's<br>Manual](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b189c2&url=https://www.justice.gov/usam/civil-resource-manual-214-injunctions){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="justice.gov"}]{.qlink_container}:<br><br>> *No injunction will issued if there is an adequate remedy at law. See<br>> Matthews v. Rodgers, 284 U.S. 521, 525 (1932); Aircraft & Diesel<br>> Equipment Corp. v. Hirsch, 331 U.S. 752 (1947); Porto Rico Telephone<br>> Co. v. P.R. Communications Auth., 189 F.2d 39 (1st Cir.), cert.<br>> denied, 342 U.S. 830 (1951). Irreparable injury is an essential<br>> prerequisite to the issuance of a preliminary injunction. County of<br>> Santa Barbara v. Hickel, 426 F.2d 164 (9th Cir. 1970), cert. denied,<br>> 400 U.S. 499 (1971).*<br><br>The question will be asked whether or not there is adequate remedy at<br>law, and whether or not "irreparable injury" will occur if the<br>implementation of the law continues. We currently have a law on the<br>books which requires that children not be incarcerated for more than 20<br>days. It's difficult to argue that "irreparable injury" would result if<br>we allow the law to continue and we not incarcerate children with adults<br>for longer than 20 days.<br><br>*Even if the law is unjust.*<br><br>*Even if the law is morally questionable.*<br><br>*Even if the law says or does something you don't like.*<br><br>You cannot file a restraining order to prevent the government from<br>enforcing the law.<br><br>And there's nothing to adjudicate. The 9th Circuit already heard<br>arguments about the law (see the *Flores* decision) and they found that<br>*both accompanied and unaccompanied minors* are subject to the 20 day<br>restriction on incarceration.<br><br>What we had in the past was several administrations who flagrantly and<br>unconstitutionally disregarded the law and simply didn't enforce it.<br>What they did instead is to release the illegal immigrant and the child<br>*into the country* and telling them to come back for their immigration<br>hearing. Guess how many of them did that.<br><br>What we have *now* is a president who is determined to enforce the law<br>despite the cost.<br><br>Neither approach is ideal, in my opinion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
