<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>They *can*, but they *won't*. They'll only ask for your consent if they<br>don't have probable cause to search. If you consent, it's an immediate<br>waiver of your 4th Amendment rights, and the police can search with<br>impunity.<br><br>If they have probable cause, they will ask you to step out of the<br>vehicle, and then they will conduct their search. Probable cause may be,<br>among other things, "evidence in plain sight," such as seeing drug<br>paraphernalia, or the smell of marijuana (the "plain smell" test is a<br>subset of the "plain sight" test).<br><br>The police can search your vehicle with nothing more than probable cause<br>in 49 states (in the state of Washington, the police must use their<br>probable cause to obtain a warrant).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
