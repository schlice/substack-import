<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If a phone is actually \"powered off\", the GPS chip and<br>the cellular radio are off. The phone cannot be tracked.\<br>\<br>Some people confuse \"powering off\" the phone with putting the phone in<br>\"standby,\" which also involves the power button (which is where the<br>confusion comes from).\<br>]<br><br>- If you simply \"click\" the power button, the display will go out.<br>  This is *standby mode*. The phone is still on. It is still capable of<br>  transmitting and receiving. If you \"click\" the power button again,<br>  the phone will \"wake up.\" To test it out, click the power button so<br>  the display turns off and then try to call the phone number of the<br>  phone. The display will light up and the phone will ring.<br>- If you hold down the power button until the display says either<br>  \"Slide to power off\" or a dialog box pops up which includes a<br>  \"Power Off\" function and you do it (slide or click), the phone will<br>  *power off*. In this state, the software shuts down, the radios turn<br>  off, and the phone stops drawing power from the battery. To turn the<br>  phone back on, you will have to hold the power button momentarily. You<br>  will see the software of the phone restarting (on iOS, you will see<br>  the white apple, on Android, you will see the hardware manufacturer\'s<br>  start screen first, then probably a carrier logo screen) before the<br>  home screen appears again. To test it out, turn the phone off in this<br>  manner and then try to call the number. The call should proceed<br>  directly to the carrier\'s voicemail system, as the phone is not<br>  contactable on any cell tower.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
