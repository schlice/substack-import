<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You'll be arrested at the police station and charged with theft of<br>property (self-reported). What level of crime that turns out to be will<br>depend on how expensive the gun is that you stole.<br><br>Oh, in case I didn't make that clear: you would be a thief. Taking<br>someone's property that doesn't belong to you is theft, and you go to<br>jail.<br><br>And the gun owner will get his gun back.<br><br>So probably not the outcome you were hoping for. Maybe you ought to look<br>for a more productive way to channel your fear of guns.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What\'s going to happen if I take a gun owner\'s gun for the police?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
