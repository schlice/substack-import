<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Which weapons are not covered by the second amendment?<br><br>The Second Amendment does not specify weapon types. Laws would do that,<br>not the Constitution. The Second Amendment specifies what types of laws<br>government *cannot* write, namely any law that might infringe on a<br>citizen's right to keep and bear arms.<br><br>So to answer your question, no weapons are covered, nor are any weapons<br>not covered, by the Second Amendment. Only government is affected by the<br>Second Amendment, being specifically prevented from passing laws which<br>might restrict a citizen from keeping or bearing arms.<br><br>> Am I guaranteed the right to own and use an RPG?<br><br>The answer is, as with all legal questions, it depends.<br><br>Since the Second Amendment does not address any specific weapons<br>platform, there is nothing in the Constitution which guarantees you the<br>right to own any particular weapon. State law does that. And there are<br>some pretty stringent state laws when it comes to certain weapons types<br>(namely, anything covered in the National Firearms Act, colloquially<br>called "NFA weapons," under which your RPG would qualify). Most states<br>regulate, but not prohibit, NFA weapons. Many states require special<br>permits to own them. Some states require permits from the chief of<br>police or the sheriff where you live, and not all of those are "shall<br>issue" permits.<br><br>And in case you were wondering, using an RPG against a person is just as<br>illegal as using a gun against a person. Murder is still illegal<br>everywhere in the United States.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
