<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What does it mean when they say a California judge yesterday dismissed<br>the Stormy Daniels defamation suit against Michael Cohen and Donald<br>Trump \"with prejudice\"?**<br><br>A dismissal with prejudice means that the court is dismissing the case<br>based on its merits. This means that a court has looked at the merits of<br>the case and has made a decision based on the merits.<br><br>Dismissal with prejudice is a *final judgement*. This means that the<br>case cannot be brought again. The case is permanently dismissed; the<br>plaintiff cannot bring this action again.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
