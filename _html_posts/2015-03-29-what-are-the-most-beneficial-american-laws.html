<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [One of the most impactful pieces of legislation in our<br>time is the Americans with Disabilities Act. This massive law affected<br>many different aspects of our society, including the availability of<br>handicapped parking spaces, accessible bathroom facilities, ramps and<br>elevators, automatic doors, and related items.\<br>\<br>It also changed the way businesses hire employees, to allow for more<br>fairness in hiring the disabled. It changed what businesses are allowed<br>to ask when hiring an individual; they can only list the requirements of<br>the job and can ask the prospective employee whether or not they can<br>perform those essential job functions \"with or without reasonable<br>accommodations.\" If they answer yes, the prospective employee is<br>affirming that they physically and mentally meet the requirements of the<br>job.\<br>\<br>An employee does not have to disclose to his/her employer that he/she is<br>disabled. That information stays between the doctor, the patient, and<br>the insurance company. The employee will have to disclose if they seek<br>accommodations, but otherwise, they can keep their disability to<br>themselves. There is a presumption, of course, that the disability does<br>not preclude the individual from actually performing the job. The<br>requirements of the job should list what is required in order to ensure<br>that the disabled person can actually accomplish the requirements.\<br>\<br>This was one of the biggest advances for the disabled in recent years,<br>and has led to many more people with disabilities being valued in the<br>workplace not because of their disability, but in spite of it; for their<br>ability.\<br>\<br>Of course, with all of the upsides, there are downsides. The presumption<br>that disabled people are telling the truth about their disability leads<br>to some abuse of the system. If you claim to have a disability, you<br>can\'t be asked to provide proof that you actually have that disability.<br>If you bring a dog into a restaurant and claim that it is a service dog,<br>you don\'t have to show proof that the service dog is actually trained<br>to perform any specific function; you have to take the disabled<br>person\'s word for it. And there is very little that can be done if<br>someone abuses the system, claiming a disability and receiving<br>accommodations when they don\'t actually have a disability. One big<br>exception is in parking spaces and claiming to have a disability when<br>you don\'t. This can result in fines and suspension/revocation of your<br>license. But since in most business cases the accommodations provided<br>are not onerous, there\'s not much that the business can do to redress<br>those grievances against someone who lies about having a<br>disability.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
