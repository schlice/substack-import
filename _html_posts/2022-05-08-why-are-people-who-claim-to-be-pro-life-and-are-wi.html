<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>They're not. For the most part, we already have those things, so it's<br>really hard to claim that you want more. And we must be cautious when<br>trying to add more.<br><br>Let's look at what you listed:<br><br>Free healthcare: Since our focus is on newborn babies and young<br>children, you already have free healthcare. It's in a program called the<br>Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). CHIP is health insurance<br>that covers uninsured children in families which make a modest income<br>but too much to meet the requirement for Medicaid. The biggest reason<br>that uninsured children still exist is because families make more than<br>200% of the poverty level (higher than the CHIP limit) but the family's<br>employer doesn't pay for dependents, because annual premiums for family<br>coverage are simply too high. So the problem here is not that we're not<br>providing a program. It's that people outside of the program are not<br>being covered. While we'd love to cover health insurance for every child<br>in America, regardless of how much money their family makes, we have to<br>spend our tax dollars wisely. We spend our healthcare dollars where it<br>makes the most sense.<br><br>Food assistance: We have this too. It's programs called the<br>Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the older (but<br>still kicking) program called Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). WIC<br>provides free basic food staples: milk, cheese, butter, bread, etc, and<br>SNAP allows families to buy nutritious foods to keep their families fed.<br>According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), in a<br>typical month of 2017, "SNAP helped about 42 million low-income<br>Americans afford a nutritious diet." These programs work.<br><br>Free daycare: Yep, you guessed it, we have that too. Every state<br>gets money from the federal government to pay for child assistance<br>programs. They have different names in different states, like vouchers,<br>fee assistance, subsidies, etc. These programs help families who qualify<br>pay for child care so they can work or go to school. Every state also<br>has Head Start programs which are federally funded, and some states have<br>fully funded pre-K for ages 3 through 5.<br><br>Now, I bet you're going to say, "but I don't qualify for X because my<br>family makes too much money, what about us?" Interestingly, the<br>Brookings Institute did a study. They framed their study with the<br>following paragraph:<br><br>> Policy aimed at promoting economic opportunity for poor children must<br>> be framed within three stark realities. First, many poor children come<br>> from families that do not give them the kind of support that<br>> middle-class children get from their families. Second, as a result,<br>> these children enter kindergarten far behind their more advantaged<br>> peers and, on average, never catch up and even fall further behind.<br>> Third, in addition to the education deficit, poor children are more<br>> likely to make bad decisions that lead them to drop out of school,<br>> become teen parents, join gangs and break the law.<br><br>With this in mind, they found the formula for success: the three things<br>teens and young adults can do to virtually guarantee themselves entry<br>into the middle class:<br><br>- Finish high school<br>- Get a full time job<br>- Wait until you turn 21 before you get married and have children.<br><br>> Our research shows that of American adults who followed these three<br>> simple rules, only about 2 percent are in poverty and nearly<br>> 75 percent have joined the middle class (defined as earning around<br>> \$55,000 or more per year). There are surely influences other than<br>> these principles at play, but following them guides a young adult away<br>> from poverty and toward the middle class.\[1\](#Aqxvc){#cite-Aqxvc<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>Finally, if you can't afford to support a family right now, maybe<br>abortion is not the only choice. Instead of killing your baby, why not<br>give it up for adoption? There are so many families who cannot have<br>children who are adopting kids from overseas because there just aren't<br>enough babies here in the US available for adoption. You can literally<br>have your baby and walk out of the hospital with no baby. You just tell<br>them that you want to give your baby up for adoption, and they'll take<br>care of the rest. In all states, there are programs where you can give<br>your baby up for adoption within the first three days at any fire<br>station, no questions asked. It's easier to give up a newborn baby for<br>adoption than it is to break your iPhone. And it's okay to say, "I got<br>pregnant, but I'm not ready to have a family yet, because I'm not in a<br>good financial position." That's okay! Let's stop stigmatizing these<br>things. Let's instead call that "smart family planning."<br><br>Abortion is not the only answer.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why are people who claim to be pro-life and are willing to end all<br>abortions against social programs that help children such as free<br>healthcare, food assistance, and free daycare programs?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-Aqxvc){.citation_index} [[Three Simple Rules Poor Teens<br>Should Follow to Join the Middle<br>Class](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8e75a4&url=https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/three-simple-rules-poor-teens-should-follow-to-join-the-middle-class/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="brookings.edu"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
