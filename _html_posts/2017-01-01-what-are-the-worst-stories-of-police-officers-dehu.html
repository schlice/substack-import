<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I was seated in the squad room of a detective's squad in a precinct and<br>department which shall remain nameless to protect the reputation of the<br>department. My dad was a squad detective in this precinct, which is why<br>I was there. I spent a lot of time there as a kid. They had a drunk in<br>the holding room. He was sleeping off a terrible bender, handcuffed to<br>the bench in the room. The room didn't have one of those massive picture<br>windows with the two-way mirrors. It instead had a small teller-style<br>window, also two-way, but you could slide it sideways to open it. It was<br>almost drive-thru window size.<br><br>Anyway, the detectives decided to mess with the drunk. One detective got<br>a coffee mug from the break room and urinated into it in the hallway<br>next to the holding room. He then quietly opened the window, reached his<br>arm in up to his shoulder while holding the mug, and proceeded to throw<br>the entire mug of urine onto the drunk. The drunk awoke violently and<br>flailed at the end of his tether, until he finally got his senses about<br>him and probably thought that he had pissed himself. After a minute or<br>two, he was asleep again.<br><br>The squad had a great laugh over this. I was in high school and was<br>still na√Øve to many of the ways of the world, so I was quietly in shock.<br><br>Is messing with drunks dehumanizing? To the drunk, probably not. He<br>likely didn't remember a thing. To the detectives? I think that in order<br>to throw a mug of urine onto a person, you have to believe you are<br>somehow better than them, even if not at a conscious level.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
