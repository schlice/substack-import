<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In short, yes, a sitting president can legally be impeached for<br>something he did as a citizen. Impeachment is a *political* process, not<br>a *criminal* one, so the usual standards of evidence and strict legal<br>liability do not apply to impeachment.<br><br>However, the Constitutional standard for impeachment is "high crimes and<br>misdemeanors," and this is generally recognized as things which happened<br>while in the course of entering, or after one had entered, office. These<br>are generally considered to be actions taken under color of office. It<br>is generally recognized that "things which happened while as a citizen"<br>would be outside the scope of what the Constitution would likely cover<br>as president, and are generally left to the legal system after the<br>president has completed his term.<br><br>In all of the 19 impeachments we have had so far, the allegations have<br>been for actions which have seriously undermined the public trust in one<br>way or another. It would be quite a stretch to allege that conduct which<br>took place before the person was president undermined the public trust<br>after the person was freely elected by the people, *even if that conduct<br>was unknown at the time of the election.*<br><br>[[User-10101980509374502950\'s answer to What would constitute \"High<br>Crimes and Misdemeanors\" which would cause a president to be<br>impeached?](https://www.quora.com/What-would-constitute-High-Crimes-and-Misdemeanors-which-would-cause-a-president-to-be-impeached/answer/User-10101980509374502950)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>(EDIT) Also, following the same line of thought, it is presupposed that<br>the voters are well aware of what a candidate did or did not do before<br>becoming the nominee. Therefore, if we presume that voters are aware of<br>the conduct *and still vote for the candidate anyway,* impeachment for<br>such activities is likely to be frowned upon, as it would be seen as<br>controverting the will of the voters.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
