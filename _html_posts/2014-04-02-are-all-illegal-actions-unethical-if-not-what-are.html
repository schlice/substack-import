<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Laws do not dictate morals or ethics. Morals can dictate<br/>law, but laws based on morality often make bad law. Morality is borne of<br/>the whole of society, so what is morally or ethically acceptable to one<br/>may not be ethically acceptable to another.\<br/>\<br/>For some, all illegal actions are unethical. Some people may never break<br/>the law even if the situation dictated that a law may need to be broken<br/>in order to fulfill an ethical requirement. Their own moral code tells<br/>them that it is wrong to break the law in any situation, so therefore,<br/>for them, their ethical code is violated every time the law is broken.<br/>Others will break the law if it is morally right to do so in that<br/>situation, because following one\'s moral and ethical code is more<br/>important than following the law at that particular moment. In order for<br/>this to happen, your personal moral code has to tell you that the law is<br/>not all-encompassing; the law is breakable if it meets a moral<br/>imperative.\<br/>\<br/>The example that was given was speeding (or safely bypassing a red light<br/>after coming to a full and complete stop and clearing for cross-traffic,<br/>which I may have done once or twice in my life) when racing to the<br/>emergency room with a critically ill or injured person (I have<br/>transported one of each in my lifetime). Can you be cited for breaking<br/>the law? Yes, absolutely. The law does not provide exceptions for<br/>speeding to a hospital. But ethically, it\'s the right thing to do to<br/>save someone\'s life, so when you break the law, you accept the<br/>consequences of doing so.\<br/>\<br/>If ethically, you can accept the consequences of breaking the law in<br/>order to meet a moral imperative, then the morality wins. For those who<br/>are guided by a solid moral compass, these decisions, while painful to<br/>make, can be made easily.\<br/>\<br/>Concealing a handgun on school property is one that would probably evoke<br/>more emotional responses from people. It is currently illegal for anyone<br/>with a concealed handgun permit to conceal their weapon in a school. But<br/>that\'s exactly what the \"active shooter\" wants: a place where no one<br/>is armed and they can kill as many people as possible before they are<br/>killed or kill themselves (active shooters are mentally unstable and<br/>have severely impaired judgement). If I carried my concealed handgun<br/>into a school and was able to stop an active shooter bent on killing as<br/>many people as he could, would I be wrong? Legally, I would be<br/>absolutely wrong for concealing my handgun on school property. But<br/>morally, I would have saved potentially many lives by breaking the law.<br/>I would have to accept the consequences of breaking the law in order to<br/>meet a moral imperative. Some would tell me that the moral imperative<br/>doesn\'t matter; breaking the law is unethical, period. Others would say<br/>that you do what you must to meet the moral imperative and you accept<br/>the consequences. It would be up to a judge to determine whether or not<br/>the moral imperative was enough of a mitigating circumstance to overcome<br/>the violation of the law. It may not, it may simply provide for a lesser<br/>consequence. But I would be responsible for my own actions and the<br/>consequences of those actions.\<br/>\<br/>This is the quandary we face when trying to balance following the law<br/>(which we know is important for a properly-functioning society) and<br/>following our moral and ethical code.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
