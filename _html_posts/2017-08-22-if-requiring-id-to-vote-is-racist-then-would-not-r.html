<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *If Requiring ID to Vote Is Racist, Then Would Not Requiring an ID to<br>> Purchase a Firearm Also Be Racist?*<br><br>Short answer, no. Slightly longer answer: the logic does not follow.<br>Logically, you have a Constitutional right to vote. You have a<br>Constitutional right to keep and bear arms; you don't have a<br>Constitutional right to buy a gun, or even afford a gun. No<br>money needs to be expended in order to cast your vote.<br><br>The idea that voter ID laws are racist comes from the fact that many low<br>income people (who are disproportionately minorities) do not have<br>government-issued ID cards, and thus voter ID laws unfairly target<br>minorities. This is also an incorrect assertion, as many elderly people<br>are not able to obtain government-issued ID cards because they can't<br>gather the required documentation, or simply don't possess it.<br><br>Requiring ID for firearms purchases fulfills a long-accepted requirement<br>that we keep firearms out of the hands of felons and the adjudicated<br>mentally defective. In order to determine ones identity before<br>purchasing a gun, we must positively identify the person, which involves<br>reviewing ID.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
