<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Considering that the US is an actual rogue nation as it sponsors<br>Kurdish terrorism, should Turkey end its alliance with the US?**<br><br>I'll ignore the fact that this is a clearly inflammatory question, and<br>I'll ignore the fact that you are begging the question, and I'll ignore<br>the fact that this is likely a troll question that you have asked,<br>[Mohammad(https://www.quora.com/profile/Omar-Al-Khurasani)]{.qlink_container},<br>but it's Monday. I'll address your points.<br><br>> ***Considering that the US is an actual rogue nation as it sponsors<br>> Kurdish terrorism***<br><br>Supporting the Kurds in their fight against ISIS does not make the<br>United States a "rogue nation." Beside the fact that "rogue nation" or<br>"rogue state" is not a legal definition of anything, the generally<br>accepted definition of a "rogue nation" is one which is ruled by an<br>authoritarian government that severely restricts human rights, is a<br>state sponsor of terrorism, and actively seeks to proliferate weapons of<br>mass destruction.\[1\](#OxPlp){#cite-OxPlp .citation_link} By that<br>definition, it is nations like Cuba, North Korea, and Iran which would<br>qualify. It is also important to note that the United States officially<br>stopped using the term "rogue nation" or "rogue state" 18 years ago.<br><br>You may believe that the United States supporting Kurdish freedom<br>fighters is state sponsorship of terrorism, but the Kurds have a better<br>record on human rights than the Turks. In fact, Turkey's direct actions<br>against the Kurds show quite clearly which people is more supportive of<br>human rights.\[2\](#DdvbA){#cite-DdvbA .citation_link}<br><br>> *\S\hould Turkey end its alliance with the US?*<br><br>Turkey should do whatever Turkey chooses to do, as it is a sovereign<br>nation. If its foreign policy does not align with that of the US, then<br>yes, it should end its alliance with the US.<br><br>But doing so brings its own challenges, and being on the wrong side of<br>relations with the strongest military power in the world is not<br>generally the place any nation voluntarily chooses to place itself<br>(unless you're bat-shit crazy like the Kims in North Korea). If Turkey<br>decides to end its alliance with the United States, that means that<br>Turkey declares that it no longer needs a*nything* from the US. So if<br>Somali pirates attack ships flying Turkish flags in the Red Sea, the US<br>Navy might not come to their aid. Hey, they don't need US assistance any<br>more, right? And as I'm sure you're aware, Russia is no friend to Turkey<br>these days, basically declaring the Turks as "accomplices of<br>terrorists\[3\](#wUsrX){#cite-wUsrX .citation_link}" as late as 2015.<br>I'm sure Turkey doesn't need US assistance in dealing with Russia, does<br>it?<br><br>Now, I won't go so far as to say that Turkey is actually the rogue<br>nation in this equation, but on balance, it's hard to see how supporting<br>Kurds in their fight against ISIS, or backing Kurds against Turkish<br>aggression and human rights violations makes the United States a "rogue<br>nation."<br><br>But go ahead Turkey, you do you.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-OxPlp){.citation_index} [[Rogue state -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f03fa1&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_state){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-DdvbA){.citation_index} [[Human rights of Kurdish people<br>in Turkey -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=633bf5&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_of_Kurdish_people_in_Turkey){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[3\](#cite-wUsrX){.citation_index} [[Russia--Turkey relations -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4b6bb6&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia%25E2%2580%2593Turkey_relations%23Recent_developments){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
