<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is Trump trying to change our government (tariffs, removing EPA<br>protections, etc.) as quickly as possible before Mueller, the emolument<br>clause or the T. Foundation indictments remove him from the office?**<br><br>No. Trump is moving quickly because *this is what efficient government<br>looks like.* I know it's unusual to see administrations actually<br>*accomplishing something*, but this is actually what it looks like.<br><br>Trump is doing exactly what he was elected to do, and he's not wasting<br>any time doing it.<br><br>The Mueller probe or any other cause of action you can think of won't<br>actually remove him from office. Only Congress has that power. The House<br>must pass Articles of Impeachment, and the Senate must hold a trial<br>where, if he is found guilty, he can be removed from office. This<br>process is in the Constitution and it is the only way a sitting<br>President can be removed from office.<br><br>None of the causes of action you have listed would even move the needle<br>in the House. Even when Clinton was impeached, it wasn't because he had<br>an affair or had sex in the Oval Office or any of it. It was because he<br>lied to Congress, under oath. None of the causes of action against Trump<br>comes close to rising to that level, so don't expect Articles of<br>Impeachment to come out of the House any time soon.<br><br>Additionally, what happens if Trump is impeached? Pence becomes<br>president. Do you think this frenetic pace or the Trump agenda is going<br>to cease under President Pence? Hardly. The only thing you'll notice is<br>fewer speeches without a speechwriter, and fewer tweets. Everything else<br>will stay the same.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
