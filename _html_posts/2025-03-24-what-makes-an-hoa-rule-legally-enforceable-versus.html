<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Applicability.<br><br>The HOA rule in question must apply equally to all homeowners.<br><br>Without some compelling reason, if the HOA crafts a rule which only<br>applies to certain homeowners, there is a better than average chance<br>that the rule is discriminatory.<br><br>Additionally, a legally enforceable rule which, in practice, is<br>applied unequally (i.e. two homeowners, in exactly the same scenarios,<br>and the HOA applies the rule to one homeowner and not to another), may<br>also be discriminatory.<br><br>\<br><br>There are some situations which *appear* discriminatory, but which are<br>not.<br><br>One of these is in the practice of enforcing architectural design<br>standards. The Architecture Review Committee (or whatever your HOA calls<br>it) has sole authority to determine whether to approve any<br>particular change, and *just because they approved another homeowner's<br>similar change is* *not a guarantee* *that they will approve yours.*<br>Perhaps the placement of the change in your unique situation is<br>different, or the position of your lot is different, or any number of<br>additional factors may dissuade the ARC from approving your change.<br><br>A second HOA practice which may appear discriminatory but is not is the<br>practice of *uniformly* failing to enforce a particular CC&R provision.<br>For example, I served on a Board which had a rule that said basically<br>"no street parking ever." In our HOA, we chose to not enforce that rule,<br>in part, because the County already had *single side of the street<br>parking* set up, and they used county enforcement (the local sheriff's<br>department) to handle parking violations. They had county No Parking<br>signs set up on one side of the street, and you could call the Sheriff's<br>Office to have a deputy come out and ticket/tow illegally parked<br>vehicles. Therefore, the Board chose to not enforce the "no street<br>parking ever" provision of our CC&Rs, and this was perfectly legal and<br>not discriminatory, because we uniformly enforced (or in this case,<br>didn't enforce) that rule. In other words, it's just as<br>non-discriminatory to uniformly not enforce a rule as it is to uniformly<br>enforce a rule.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
