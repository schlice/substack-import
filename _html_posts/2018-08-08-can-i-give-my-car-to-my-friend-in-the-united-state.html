<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can I give my car to my friend in the United States for a few months<br>and ask him to take the insurance on my car for a few months? Is it<br>legal? I am not getting any cash in return.**<br><br>What would probably work better is to ask your friend to reimburse you<br>for your insurance during the time that he's borrowing your car.<br><br>Also, I'd get the whole thing in writing. Find a generic auto lease<br>agreement online and fill it out. Make sure it specifies the terms, like<br>when he's going to give it back (or when you need to re-do the<br>agreement) and whether or not he's going to reimburse you for insurance.<br><br>Believe me, it's better to cause the minor inconvenience up front by<br>signing a lease agreement than the major headache down the road when<br>confusion over the exact terms of the agreement causes major problems<br>(like he leaves the state with your car and doesn't come back for three<br>years). You say it will never happen, but it happens every day. Just get<br>it in writing. Save yourself the headache.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
