<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **Why are more women considering permanent female surgical<br>> sterilization after the overturning of Roe v Wade?**<br><br>Because despite what they will openly tell you, the pro-choice movement<br>is about babies, not about women.<br><br>***The pro-choice movement isn't about choosing when a woman is pregnant<br>or not. It's about never producing unwanted babies.***<br><br>And I can prove it.<br><br>The solution to the abortion debate is viability, and the solution to<br>viability is science. [[**Artificial<br>uteri**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=af7770&url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/12/1241895501/artificial-womb-premature-birth){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="npr.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>They are already being tested and the science is making great progress.<br>So instead of killing the baby (which is the entire *raison d\'Ãªtre* of<br>the pro-life movement), you can transfer the baby to an artificial womb,<br>which "terminates the pregnancy." That is, the woman is no longer<br>pregnant.<br><br>Isn't that the goal?<br><br>Not if you listen to the supposed "smart people" on the ethics of the<br>situation.<br><br>> \"I am absolutely pro the technology because I think it has great<br>> potential to save babies,\" says [[Vardit<br>> Ravitsky](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bedcf2&url=https://www.thehastingscenter.org/hastings-center-names-vardit-ravitsky-new-president/){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="thehastingscenter.org"}]{.qlink_container}, president and<br>> CEO of The Hastings Center, a bioethics think tank.<br>><br>> But there are particular issues raised by the current political and<br>> legal environment.<br>><br>> \"My concern is that pregnant people will be forced to allow fetuses<br>> to be taken out of their bodies and put into an artificial womb<br>> **rather than being allowed to terminate their pregnancies ---<br>> basically, a new way of taking away abortion rights,\"** Ravitsky<br>> says.\[1\](#bTJjR){#cite-bTJjR .citation_link}<br><br>But waitaminute, I thought that removing the baby from the mother *was*<br>terminating the pregnancy. But you can see what Ravitsky says here: the<br>comparison is either put the baby in an artificial womb, saving the<br>baby; or "terminate the pregnancy," which means that the definition of<br>"terminate the pregnancy" is the opposite of "save the baby".<br><br>In case you think that I'm misinterpreting what she said, she then<br>doubles down, saying that "\Artificial wombs are\ a new way of taking<br>away abortion rights."<br><br>So what she's saying here is that "abortion rights" means *the right to<br>"terminate your pregnancy,"* which she has already defined as the<br>opposite of whatever happens when you put your baby in an artificial<br>womb. In other words, you kill your baby.<br><br>She would rather kill the baby than let it grow *completely independent<br>of her* and go on to have its own life. She's arguing that "terminating<br>the pregnancy" and "abortion rights" means the right to kill the baby.<br><br>\<br><br>What's happening here is that some in the pro-choice movement still<br>falsely believe that *if you can't kill your baby, you must* *raise*<br>*it.* And this is completely untrue. Ravitsky, along with many others in<br>the pro-choice camp, still falsely believe that **the government wants<br>to force you to become a mother**, and that is simply completely untrue.<br>How do I know? There are Safe Haven laws in **every state in the<br>country.** You can usually walk out of the hospital after you give birth<br>and not take your baby, no questions asked. Or you could take your baby,<br>walk across the street to the fire station, and give it up, no questions<br>asked. *Every state in the country allows you to do this.* Why do<br>pro-choice people still believe that the government is desiring to force<br>you to keep your baby?<br><br>They're not.<br><br>They simply don't want you to kill your baby. In other words, you<br>don't have to keep your baby, but you really shouldn't have to<br>kill your baby. It's that simple. It's a *human rights* issue, and<br>the baby is most definitely scientifically human from the moment of<br>conception. We know it's human because it has two human parents and it<br>is producing human enzymes, not carrot or frog enzymes. And we know it's<br>alive because it is growing and consuming energy. And we believe that<br>all living humans have the equal right to life, regardless of what stage<br>of life they are in.<br><br>Of course, we acknowledge that women have the right to bodily autonomy,<br>and that right is important. But we simply believe that in this<br>particular conflict of rights, the right to bodily autonomy of the<br>mother does not outweigh the right to life of the baby.<br><br>Those in the pro-choice camp also place ***differential value on life<br>depending on its temporal locality*** (basically, its position in space<br>and time). Basically, if it's less than nine months old and it is living<br>in a uterus, its life has less value than after it is nine months old<br>and not living in a uterus. Alongside this temporal locality value of<br>life, they also believe that the life only has value insofar as it is<br>*wanted*. The reasoning they employ goes thusly:<br><br>*What if the baby has a birth defect? Who will adopt that baby? No one<br>will choose to adopt that baby, so it will go into the foster care<br>system, which is a hard life for a baby. Why would we willingly create<br>children who could end up in the foster care system?*<br><br>\<br><br>When you apply this understanding to the statement that more women are<br>turning to sterilization following the overturning of *Roe v. Wade*,<br>then it makes complete sense. If I am pro-choice, and the goal of the<br>pro-choice movement is actually to have the freedom to kill a baby for<br>whatever reason, and the state won't allow me to do that, then I simply<br>can't get pregnant, ever.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-bTJjR){.citation_index}<br>[https://www.npr.org/sections/hea\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7b4a08&url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/12/1241895501/artificial-womb-premature-birth/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="npr.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
