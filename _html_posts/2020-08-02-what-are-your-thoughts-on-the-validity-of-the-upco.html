<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are your thoughts on the validity of the upcoming Tik Tok ban<br>from Donald Trump?**<br><br>The only way this would be allowed would be if they found a "smoking<br>gun" inside the app that was actually collecting user information and<br>delivering it directly to the Chinese government. Fear that the app, or<br>its parent corporation, are feeding user information to the Chinese is<br>not enough to ban an app. The 1st Amendment is still a thing. I can't<br>see the courts supporting a ban on an app simply because it is owned by<br>a Chinese company and we don't trust the Chinese. I mean, we don't,<br>because past behavior is generally a good indication of future actions,<br>but it's still not enough.<br><br>We have some history here, before the digital age. Banning books was a<br>popular pastime, but has largely been stopped here. For example, *The<br>Anarchist Cookbook* was banned in Australia and was highly restricted in<br>other places, but not here. It\'s still available for purchase. Amazon<br>sells it in digital format for Kindle.<br><br>That said, you've seen lately the unprecedented ability of a government<br>to literally stop capitalism in its tracks because of the threat of a<br>virus. Tens of thousands of small businesses, the lifeblood of this<br>country, will close permanently as a result, and we as a nation will be<br>worse for it. Trump could issue an Executive Order and ban the app,<br>forcing Google and Apple to remove it from their respective app stores<br>so that only those who root or jailbreak their devices would be able to<br>use it. This, obviously, would lead immediately to a lawsuit, but the<br>ban would stay in place until that suit is decided. Placing a nationwide<br>injunction on a national security matter is horribly bad optics. A<br>prosecutor who would do such a thing either has cojones the size of cue<br>balls, or is incredibly short-sighted.<br><br>As far as what he's going to do, it's hard to tell. It's a complex<br>issue.<br><br>But it does more than spread fear among 15 year olds that they are going<br>to have a lot more free time on their hands. It sends a much more<br>powerful message to China than it does to anyone in the US. To China, it<br>says that we can take your most powerful moneymaker in the US and shut<br>it down with the stroke of a pen. And that hits China where it hits<br>anyone and hurts the most: in the wallet. If it brings them to the<br>bargaining table, then maybe this power play isn't such a bad thing.<br><br>We shall see.<br><br>\<grabs popcorn\><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
