<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The HOA can make whatever rules they choose, so long as they follow<br>their procedure for modifying the rules in the particular area of the<br>Governing Documents they are modifying.<br><br>The question you are apparently asking is "can the HOA make a rule that<br>doesn't respect my right to freedom of speech?"<br><br>And the unfortunate answer is yes.<br><br>Homeowner's associations are generally regarded as private<br>organizations. The HOA is, in most places, a 501(c)(4) non-profit<br>corporation. And while the First Amendment prohibits the government from<br>making rules that curtail your freedom of speech, this does not apply to<br>private corporations. There are indeed some aspects of the Constitution<br>that apply to HOAs (since they maintain property, collect "taxes", and<br>are responsible for other municipal-style duties), but that's where the<br>similarity ends. The HOA is a private corporation that you join by<br>contract.<br><br>Unless there is some state-level restriction on HOAs in California that<br>I am unaware of, generally HOAs are considered private corporations, and<br>they can indeed limit your freedom of speech, including at HOA meetings.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
