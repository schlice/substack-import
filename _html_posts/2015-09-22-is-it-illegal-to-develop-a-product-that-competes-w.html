<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Most of the time, if you work on a project on company<br>time, using company property, the project belongs to the company. Most<br>employment agreements state that what you develop on company time is the<br>intellectual property of the company, not you.\<br>\<br>If you want to develop something that competes with your own company,<br>you will need to do it on your own time, using your own property.\<br>\<br>Also, you may have a non-compete clause that forbids you from competing<br>with the company, since working at the comany, you have inside knowledge<br>about how the company makes the product, which would give you an unfair<br>market advantage.\<br>\<br>Basically, the company wants you using your talents to improve their<br>product, not going out and trying to undercut them. So they\'re going to<br>contractually protect that.\<br>\<br>If you\'re really interested in doing this, you should have your<br>employment agreement and any non-compete clauses you signed reviewed by<br>an attorney who specializes in employment law.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
