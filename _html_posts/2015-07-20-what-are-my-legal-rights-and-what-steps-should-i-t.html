<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Remember that we can\'t give you specific legal advice on<br>Quora. You need to retain an attorney to get specific legal advice.<br>Therefore, I can\'t tell you what to do in your situation. I can\'t tell<br>you what charges you should look into pursuing, as these are things that<br>your lawyer should advise you on. By the way, you should get a lawyer.\<br>\<br>Locking you in a room is either called kidnapping or imprisonment,<br>depending on where you are located.\<br>\<br>Throwing a chair at you causing a bruise is called assault, or assault<br>and battery, depending on where you live.\<br>\<br>Either one of those two scenarios would have warranted a call to the<br>police.\<br>\<br>Facebook, along with many large online sites, offers **two-factor<br>authentication**, which requires you to enter a code that is either sent<br>by text message or provided by the Code Generator page in the Facebook<br>app of your phone. If you have the means, I strongly suggest you enable<br>two-factor authentication in as many of your online accounts as you<br>can.\<br>\<br>You can absolutely get a restraining order in most jurisdictions with<br>less evidence than you currently have. Talk to your lawyer about getting<br>a restraining order.\<br>\<br>Good luck!]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
