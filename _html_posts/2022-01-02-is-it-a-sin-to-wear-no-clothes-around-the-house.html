<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let me try to give you a *complete* answer, or as complete as I can.<br><br>Nakedness, on its own, is not a sin. The only reason we are clothed at<br>all is due to Adam and Eve's sin in the first place. We were naked in<br>the Garden until Adam sinned, and then the first blood shed in the Bible<br>was God killing an animal to make clothes for them, because they were<br>naked (just as they were before), except this time, they knew it.<br><br>So it's not the nakedness that constitutes the sin. So then, what is it?<br><br>In the Western world, nakedness is often associated with sex and<br>sexuality. And this is the problem.<br><br>Whether you are alone or with someone else in the house, nakedness is<br>still associated with sexuality. Nakedness can lead others who visualize<br>you to have impure thoughts, even if they have no intention of having<br>them. They don't have to actively think about sex in order to experience<br>the impure thoughts. Nakedness could even lead *you* to have your own<br>impure thoughts, if you think about yourself naked or if you see<br>yourself naked.<br><br>Maybe you don't think like that, ever. Maybe your mind doesn't work that<br>way. You're lucky.<br><br>So while it is not directly a sin to simply be naked, nakedness could<br>lead *others* to impure thoughts; and at worst, nakedness could lead<br>*you* to impure thoughts.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it a sin to wear no clothes around the house?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
