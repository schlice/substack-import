<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would you be in favour of having a \"reluctant\" option on voting<br>ballots so that the stats show how many people reluctantly voted for a<br>candidate (such as Joe Biden, someone who is not popular but many would<br>reluctantly vote for him to get Trump out)?**<br><br>To what end? Does your vote count differently if you voted for someone<br>but your reasoning was different?<br><br>Are we going to decide that someone was unpopular and then go decide<br>whether or not we're going to count the votes of "reluctant" voters?<br><br>No. The answer is no. We have a hard enough time getting registered<br>voters to go vote. Adding more options is probably not adviseable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
