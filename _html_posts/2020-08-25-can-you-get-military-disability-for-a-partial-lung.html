<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you get military disability for a partial lung removal due to<br>cancer?**<br><br>The Veteran's Administration would have to determine that the cancer was<br>caused by your military service. In order to be something which the VA<br>will treat, there is a component of "service connection" that must be<br>determined.<br><br>If the cancer is considered a "service-connected disability," the VA<br>will rate it. Service connection for a disability may be established in<br>the following ways:<br><br>- DIRECT: Service medical records show that the disabling condition was<br>  diagnosed during military service and the condition has continued to<br>  affect the veteran.<br>- AGGRAVATION: Evidence demonstrates that the disabling condition which<br>  existed prior to service was aggravated beyond normal progression<br>  during military service.<br>- PRESUMPTIVE: Evidence demonstrates that the disability is one<br>  predetermined by the VA to be presumed for service connection by time,<br>  place and type of service.<br>- SECONDARY: Evidence demonstrates that the disability developed as a<br>  result of, or residual of, another service connected disability.<br>- INJURY AS A RESULT OF VA MEDICAL TREATMENT: This is a disability that<br>  the veteran incurred, had aggravated or died from because of medical<br>  treatment at a VA Facility.<br><br>The easiest way to get started in pursuing a claim for disability is to<br>visit your local Veterans Service Office (VSO). These organizations are<br>funded by your state and exist solely to help veterans navigate the VA<br>system. They can assist veterans with many facets of veterans benefits.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
