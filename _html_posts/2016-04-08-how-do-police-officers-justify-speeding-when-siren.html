<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So if I understand the question, you\'re saying that police officers are<br>only allowed to exceed the speed limit by 10% if their sirens are not<br>on.<br><br>The statement, as written, does not match the law. Unless you can show<br>me a state law which restricts the speed of emergency vehicles, I will<br>have to say that your question is not based in fact.<br><br>You might be confusing this with *military police*, who are not allowed<br>to exceed the speed limit by more than 10 mph, even when running code 3<br>(full lights and siren). And even that rule is somewhat ignored<br>depending on the circumstances. This restriction is part of that unit\'s<br>Operating Instructions for the facility at which they are assigned.<br><br>There is no similar restriction for police emergency vehicles. Emergency<br>vehicles are not subject to speed limits. Period. That said, does that<br>mean an officer has the legal authority to act recklessly? That he can<br>place civilian lives at risk by driving unsafely? Certainly not.<br>Usually, department policy still requires things like clearing<br>intersections before proceeding through them, and using speeds<br>commensurate with the surrounding environment (city center vs open<br>highway, etc)<br><br>If you ever see an officer driving in a manner which you believe to be<br>reckless, take the time to fill out a complaint with the officer\'s<br>department.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
