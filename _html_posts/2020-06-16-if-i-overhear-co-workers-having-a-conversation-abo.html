<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If I overhear co-workers having a conversation about sexual content on<br>another co-worker\'s Instagram (not in her presence) , does this count<br>as sexual harassment? She had explicit Boudoir photography.**<br><br>In general, such talk violates company harassment guidelines, and is by<br>itself reportable directly to HR. Just by you overhearing their<br>discussion, they have committed the harassing behavior.<br><br>If you were an exceedingly nice person (and assuming your workplace also<br>explicitly bans this behavior), you could approach them and advise them<br>that such talk is unacceptable under HR rules and they need to stop. You<br>are under no obligation to do so, especially if they are making an<br>uncomfortable work environment for you. If you do, and they do not stop,<br>don\'t bother with any other intervention, go straight to HR. They will<br>be out the door by the end of the week.<br><br>In this day and age, companies don\'t take kindly to harassment in the<br>workplace. It\'s as close to zero tolerance as you can get. Companies<br>don\'t want the liability or the bad press of harassment lawsuits, so<br>they nip that in the bud right quick.<br><br>Oh, and tell the other girl to clean up her IG, as that too can get her<br>fired. People have been fired for less.<br><br>Note that not all companies share the same policy on workplace<br>harassment, so YMMV. Check with HR if you have questions. My employer<br>has a very strong workplace harassment policy, and we fight hard to make<br>a safe, inclusive workplace for everyone.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
