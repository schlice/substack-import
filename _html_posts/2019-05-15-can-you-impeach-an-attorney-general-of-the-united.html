<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can you impeach an attorney general of the United States?<br><br>Absolutely yes. And I'm assuming you're talking about the<br>"constitutional crisis" that Congress is currently whining about (there<br>isn't), so I'll frame my answer around that.<br><br>In fact, the Constitution designed the ability to impeach appointed<br>officials as an important check against the power of the executive.<br>However, to check Congress' power, they vested all law enforcement power<br>in a single Chief Executive (the President). All three government<br>agencies, with some level of power against the others.<br><br>Ben Shapiro wrote about this today in [[his<br>piece](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2ffdc5&url=https://www.dailywire.com/news/47220/manufactured-constitutional-crisis-ben-shapiro){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="dailywire.com"}]{.qlink_container} at the *Daily Wire:*<br><br>> Our system of checks and balances is working just fine. Our<br>> politicians proclaim that the messy friction between the legislative,<br>> executive and judicial branches demonstrates that our politics is<br>> unworkable. But that friction is a feature of the system, not a bug.<br>> As James Madison explained in Federalist No. 51: \"the great security<br>> against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same<br>> department, consists in giving to those who administer each department<br>> the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist<br>> encroachments of the others. \\...\ Ambition must be made to<br>> counteract ambition.\"<br>><br>> The founders worried greatly that the supremacy of the legislature<br>> would make the executive a mere footstool, propping up legislative<br>> authority. To that end, they created a unitary executive with control<br>> over law enforcement. And they gave a check against the power of the<br>> executive to Congress, which has the ability to defund departments or<br>> impeach officials.<br>><br>> Democrats know this. They have the power to impeach William Barr.<br>> They\'re choosing not to do so, because they recognize that their<br>> complaint is itself corrupt. Democrats have the power to impeach<br>> Donald Trump. They\'re choosing not to do so, because they recognize<br>> that their grounds for such activity are weak in the extreme.<br><br>Understand that Congress can impeach Barr or the President if they<br>choose. They won't because a court battle in the Senate will expose<br>their misdeeds in exactly the same way as it will expose their target,<br>and they can't afford that before 2020. It would be a guaranteed<br>re-election victory for Trump, and a likely change of House power back<br>to Republicans, and they won't risk that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
