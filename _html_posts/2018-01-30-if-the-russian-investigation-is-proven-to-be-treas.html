<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If the Russian investigation is proven to be treason, then would<br>impeachment and prison time be a fair form of justice?**<br><br>It is virtually impossible that the Russia probe would settle on treason<br>as a charge.<br><br>Under British rule, political dissidents were considered to be traitors,<br>and were charged with treason and summarily executed. When the colonies<br>established the Constitution, they narrowly defined treason to be only<br>for the worst acts committed against a nation, and only during wartime:<br><br>> Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War<br>> against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and<br>> Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the<br>> Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in<br>> open Court.<br><br>The Constitution doesn't define the crime, it only defines the limits of<br>the crime. Thus, the treason law reads:<br><br>> Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against<br>> them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within<br>> the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer<br>> death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under<br>> this title but not less than \$10,000; and shall be incapable of<br>> holding any office under the United States.<br><br>Treason, therefore, is really a crime limited to wartime (i.e. giving<br>aid and comfort to the enemy). Even the only remaining crime related to<br>sedition in US law, seditious conspiracy, still requires the person<br>to engage in conduct designed to overthrow the government by some means<br>of force. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that Trump could be<br>charged with treason or any related charge.<br><br>As we've said numerous times on this thread, Constitutionally-speaking,<br>Trump also cannot be charged with obstruction of justice by firing<br>people who work for him. Trump is the head of the executive branch, and<br>is responsible for the actions of the people who work for him. He<br>therefore is authorized to make personnel decisions, including hiring<br>and firing decisions. A law (the law regarding obstruction of justice)<br>cannot override the Constitution: if a law is in opposition to the<br>Constitution, then the law is wrong, not the Constitution. Attempting to<br>charge the President with obstruction of justice for fulfilling a<br>Constitutionally-permitted operation would simply be a non-starter in<br>court.<br><br>Would Pence be in possession of stolen goods?<br><br>If you're referring to "stolen goods" as the Presidency, then the answer<br>is no. A political office is not considered a "good" or "commodity" in<br>the traditional sense. Additionally, in order for the President to have<br>"stolen" the election, it would have to be alleged that he manipulated<br>votes, or committed some form of voter suppression, or somehow forced an<br>Elector to vote against how his state told him to vote, and there is no<br>evidence whatsoever that any of this happened. Therefore, the election<br>was not "stolen" at all. The President was, indeed, lawfully elected by<br>the people, and can only be removed from office by Congressional action.<br>The only way for Pence to be removed from office would be to investigate<br>and charge him separately with a "high crime or misdemeanor," and not<br>only has this not been discussed, but he's not the President yet, so<br>it's hard to remove him from the office when he hasn't been *in* the<br>office yet.<br><br>**What would be the logical course of action (Not strictly the legal<br>limitations)?**<br><br>The only logical course of action would be for the House of<br>Representatives to vote to impeach the President, and for the Senate to<br>vote to remove him from office. What grounds the House uses is entirely<br>up to the House, as impeachment is not a legal process, but a political<br>one. Therefore, the Mueller probe does not need to find any evidence of<br>criminal wrongdoing in order for impeachment to proceed; they simply<br>need to find enough evidence of "high crimes and misdemeanors" in order<br>to impeach. If the House finds enough evidence of this, they can vote to<br>impeach him. It is then up to the Senate to get enough votes together to<br>remove him from office. In my personal opinion, this is the sole purpose<br>of the Mueller probe: to collect enough "dirt" to substantiate a charge<br>of "high crimes and misdemeanors" against the President so that he can<br>be impeached. They know he hasn't done anything criminal, but they don't<br>care; they just want him removed from office. If he were to fire Mueller<br>or someone else investigating him, while it wouldn't be obstruction of<br>justice, it could easily be seen as an "abuse of office" or an "abuse of<br>power" and if enough Representatives agree, it could be an impeachable<br>offense. The House could even allege that the firing was done solely to<br>attempt to derail the investigation, in which case the House could<br>allege that the "high crime" was obstruction of justice, even though<br>Trump was not charged with that crime. In other words, he could be<br>impeached for obstruction of justice even if he cannot be legally<br>charged with that offense as a crime, since again, impeachment is a<br>political process, not a legal one.<br><br>If that happens, the Vice President becomes President. If the House and<br>the Senate can repeat the process against the Vice President, then he<br>would be removed from office, and the Speaker of the House (currently<br>Paul Ryan) would become President.<br><br>That is the only logical course of action.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
