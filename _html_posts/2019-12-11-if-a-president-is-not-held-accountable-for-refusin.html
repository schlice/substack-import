<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a president is not held accountable for refusing to comply with<br>congressional subpoenas, do we still have a president or do we have a<br>king?**<br><br>If a President is not held accountable for refusing to comply with a<br>Congressional subpoena, then we have a Congress that is not following<br>through with its demands.<br><br>Presumably, Congress is requesting documents to further its<br>Constitutional duty to investigate whether or not the President should<br>be impeached.<br><br>The President, on the other hand, is making a Constitutional claim of<br>executive privilege over the information requested by that subpoena.<br><br>In case you were unaware, we happen to have a third branch of government<br>which is designed to resolve disputes between the first two: the<br>Judicial Branch.<br><br>So, the \$64,000 question: ***Why hasn't Congress requested the courts<br>enforce their subpoenas?***<br><br>There is really only one reasonable answer why Congress wouldn't take<br>the time to enforce their subpoenas in court.<br><br>Congress is not really interested in finding out the truth.<br><br>Congress is really only interested in hanging a big sign around the<br>President's neck that says "The House Impeached This President" before<br>an election. They are not really interested in learning the truth. They<br>are not really interested in whether or not the President actually<br>committed high crimes or misdemeanors. They are only interested in<br>fulfilling their own campaign promises and impeaching the President<br>before the end of his first term. They will use whatever thin "evidence"<br>they can gin up to do so. And as of this writing, it appears that this<br>is exactly what they intend to do. You should expect to see the<br>President impeached by the House before Christmas.<br><br>But this impeachment is different than every other impeachment that has<br>ever taken place in the United States. This impeachment is a partisan<br>dog-and-pony show. Every other impeachment had bipartisan support in the<br>House; this one is wholly partisan. My crystal ball says that no<br>Republicans will vote for any of the articles of impeachment, and even a<br>few Democrats will vote against some or all of them.<br><br>Impeachments require broad, bipartisan support in order to be taken<br>seriously.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
