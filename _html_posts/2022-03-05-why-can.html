<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's very simple.<br><br>**Banning guns means automatic rule by the strong, the young, and the<br>many.**<br><br>Fights, even ones where martial arts are involved, are won by the<br>stronger party inflicting massive damage on the weaker party.<br><br>Or, by the younger opponent outlasting the older opponent.<br><br>Or, if it's three against one, the three win every time. It's not even a<br>contest. Doesn't matter how well trained the one is. One person whipping<br>a roomful of thugs? Only in the movies. No martial artist can dig<br>himself out of 2000 pounds of humans laying on top of him. "Hey, I've<br>got a great idea! Let's take our numerical advantage and *throw it out<br>the window* by attacking this guy one at a time!" said no one ever,<br>except in the movies.<br><br>Fights where two guys pummel the hell out of each other and they both<br>walk away with no worse than a bloody lip and maybe a black eye is the<br>stuff of movies and TV. Reality is much, much worse.<br><br>\<br><br>Guns level the playing field. Guns put the octogenarian on the same<br>level as the twentysomething mugger with a knife. Guns put the average<br>Joe on par with the 300-pound bruiser. And guns give the single gay guy<br>a fighting chance against a carload of drunk frat boys with baseball<br>bats.<br><br>Guns are the *great equalizer*. Guns are equally as effective in the<br>hands of the powerlifter or the martial artist as they are in the hands<br>of the octogenarian. In order to provide that level of equality, guns<br>must be both lethal and easy to use.<br><br>It's said that "God made man, but Sam Colt made them equal." Guns level<br>the playing field.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why can\'t gun owners just learn martial arts instead of buying<br>dangerous weapons?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
