<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Matthew 17:21 is a bit of an odd duck, because it is not included in the<br>best translations of the Bible. Most Bible scholars think that it wasn't<br>actually part of Matthew's gospel, but was an addition in some<br>translations and was actually inserted from Mark's gospel (specifically,<br>Mark 9:29).<br><br>Nevertheless, that statement about whether or not it should have been<br>included in Matthew's gospel doesn't change the fact that some<br>translations do have it in there, and others just have it as a footnote,<br>noting that it was probably inserted by a translator from Mark's gospel.<br>We can still discuss it.<br><br>And what it *does* say is not related to performing praise and worship<br>during fasting. So let's discuss the context around this passage. **For<br>a text, without a context, is just a pretext.**<br><br>Matthew 10:5-8 tells us that Jesus had given His disciples power to cast<br>out demons. But sometime later in Matthew 17, we are told that they<br>could not cast out a demon that was causing a man to be a "lunatic." We<br>are told in this passage that consequently, Jesus cast out the demon and<br>then explained to the disciples why they could not. There is an<br>important lesson for us here. Some will say the disciples lacked faith,<br>but Jesus explained that the faith they had was not enough to perform an<br>instantaneous exorcism. They needed to fast and pray.<br><br>Jesus\' words (even if they came from Mark) imply that some demons<br>require additional effort to exorcise. Jesus explained that faith was<br>the cause of the disciples\' failure to cast the demon out (Matthew<br>17:17), not a lack of prayer and fasting. The true failure was that<br>they did not sufficiently trust the power of God to work through them.<br>Jesus was clear that if they had faith even as small as a mustard seed,<br>nothing would be impossible for them (Matthew 13:31--32; 17:20).<br><br>Still, prayer and fasting are just expressions of faith. It would not be<br>wrong for a Christian to pray or even to fast when trying to accomplish<br>the will of God. It *would* be wrong, however, to believe that prayer<br>and fasting are *themselves* sources of power. Those things are merely<br>expressions of faith in God. His power is what accomplishes His will.<br>Prayer and fasting have no power in and of themselves.<br><br>It is also important to note that worship and prayer are synonymous.<br>When we worship, we are praying, but it is a particular prayer praising<br>God. Worship, praise, prayer, and fasting are all expressions of faith.<br>There is no biblical reason why they cannot be done together.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
