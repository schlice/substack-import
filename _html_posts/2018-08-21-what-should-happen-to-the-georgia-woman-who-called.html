<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What should happen to the Georgia woman who called police on herself<br>after accidentally leaving her 3 yr old son in a hot car for three<br>hours? (The child has been checked out by a hospital and is fine)**<br><br>You're asking what "should happen" as if it's up to us to decide.<br>However, you know that something has already happened. She was arrested<br>and charged with second-degree cruelty to children. Her bond is set at<br>\$5,700.<br><br>So maybe you're asking what would be the right thing for police to do in<br>this situation. Therefore, it could either be something other than what<br>they did, or exactly what they did.<br><br>The story is missing a lot of details. When someone calls police and<br>reports themselves, generally that leads to a little bit of leniency.<br>The story (as well as [[the story on the local news<br>channel](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7462bd&url=http://www.cbs46.com/story/38922097/woman-arrested-after-leaving-child-in-locked-hot-car){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cbs46.com"}]{.qlink_container} about the incident) do not<br>provide the extra details about what prompted the police to arrest her<br>after she self-reported.<br><br>I would like to provide an answer as to what I think the police and the<br>DA should have done in this scenario, but the lack of supporting details<br>makes me think that there is more to this story than we are being told,<br>and it's difficult to render an opinion without those details.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
