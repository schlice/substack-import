<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can a police officer search your house if someone else signs a paper,<br>giving them permission, who doesn\'t reside with you when you\'re in<br>jail?**<br><br>In the vast majority of jurisdictions, any person over 18 who is in the<br>house can give permission for police to search the house. The homeowner<br>listed on the deed does not need to be the person who admits the police.<br>It merely needs to be the person who is in control of the property.<br><br>Consent is legal when police wish to search a house.<br><br>If the house is shared (i.e. you have a roommate), the police can search<br>*common areas* and any areas controlled by the grantor, but he cannot<br>allow access into your locked areas. If the whole house is a common<br>area, then the person in control of the property can authorize the<br>search of the whole house.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
