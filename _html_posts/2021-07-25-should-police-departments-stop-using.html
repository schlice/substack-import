<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Tasers are "less-than-lethal" devices. On most healthy individuals, when<br>employed correctly, they do not cause any serious or lasting harm.<br><br>But some people, especially those with pre-existing medical conditions,<br>can have those conditions exacerbated by the Taser, and in some cases,<br>people have died from its use.<br><br>That's not a reason to stop using it.<br><br>Think about it. You're advocating removing a "less-than-lethal" force<br>implement, and replacing it with...?<br><br>Nothing?<br><br>Meaning that if the police must escalate their level of force above<br>pepper spray, they move to *lethal force* which is called that because<br>it is designed to kill.<br><br>Removing something from the force continuum and not replacing it with<br>anything is never a smart idea. Leaving officers with fewer options will<br>only result in more deaths, not less.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Should police departments stop using \'stun guns\' as non-lethal<br>deterrents due to the deaths caused by them?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
