<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you believe obese people should be forced to pay for an extra seat<br>when flying?**<br><br>The problem with obesity is that it sometimes is uncontrollable, and it<br>is sometimes behavioral but controllable. So it's difficult to talk<br>about what obese people must do, because it seems to be intrinsically<br>unfair to the obese people who have no control over their weight.<br><br>So let's change the terminology a little and see if we can understand<br>what needs to be done.<br><br>What do *extremely tall people* do to fly?<br><br>Your height is completely out of your control, so it's less of a<br>controversial topic than your weight. And tall people have just as many<br>issues these days as obese people, with rapidly declining seat pitch<br>(the distance between seats) and seemingly no way to stop it from<br>continuing without government intervention.<br><br>So what do extremely tall people do? They either buy seat upgrades to<br>seats with more legroom, avoid flying altogether (some will take the<br>train or a bus), or wedge themselves into a standard seat.<br><br>But we don't hear calls to *force* them to purchase a premium seat,<br>because in general, a tall person, while personally uncomfortable,<br>doesn't impact the comfort of his surrounding passengers.<br><br>We only hear calls to force obese passengers to purchase an upgrade<br>because it impacts the comfort of surrounding passengers.<br><br>I can vouch for that discomfort: I was squished between two obese<br>passengers in the last row of a 737. It was the most claustrophobic,<br>worst flight I have ever taken, and I've flown in aircraft which<br>couldn't land because the turbulence was so bad (and we tried three<br>times). And these two gentlemen felt bad for me. They were very<br>accommodating; they allowed me a few moments of reprieve to get out and<br>air my head during the flight, but getting into and out of those seats<br>was a chore for them too.<br><br>However, this doesn't change my opinion that *forcing* an obese customer<br>to purchase two seats is not right.<br><br>If you can fit into the seat and buckle your seatbelt (even with an<br>extender), you can sit there. If you are personally inconvenienced by an<br>obese passenger next to you, talk to a flight attendant. If there is<br>room, the flight attendants have far more flexibility to re-seat you<br>once the doors close than the gate agents. If there isn't room, be<br>certain to express your inconvenience. They'll do what they can to<br>either offer you vouchers or whatever they have the ability to do to<br>make up for your inconvenience. Despite their sometimes uncaring fa√ßade,<br>they know that they have to do everything they can to retain passenger<br>loyalty. Margins in the airline industry are razor thin; I saw a report<br>that said that airlines make around \$4/passenger in profit. The only<br>way they can sustain that sort of business is volume, and for that, you<br>need passengers. They simply can't afford to lose passengers to poor<br>customer service.<br><br>Now, back to the obese customer. *If they can't fit in the seat,* they<br>will either need to buy an upgraded seat in a section where they can fit<br>into the seats, buy two seats next to each other, or avoid flying.<br><br>We can always inform the flight crew if we are inconvenienced by another<br>passenger, but we certainly should not be demanding that *others* pay<br>more to aid in *our* comfort.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
