<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Nope. There is nowhere in the Bible where it says that God will protect<br>His people from harm. As if God would skip along ahead of us with his<br>great cosmic leaf blower, sweeping all of our troubles away.<br><br>In fact, exactly the opposite is true. The Bible is explicitly clear<br>that in this world, you will have hardships. I think the evidence from<br>this world is pretty clear that hardship is a fact of life. Jesus even<br>said it. John 16:33:<br><br>> "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In<br>> this world you will have trouble..."<br><br>But the key is the second part of that verse:<br><br>> "...But take heart! I have overcome the world."<br><br>God doesn't promise us an easy life. *Because He promises something*<br>*infinitely better**.* Instead of a good life, He promises us an<br>incredible eternity.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
