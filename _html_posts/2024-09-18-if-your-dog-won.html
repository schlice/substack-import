After a particularly<br>devastating episode (where he was so distraught because of his overfull<br>bladder), at the emergency vet, he was catheterized to allow the urine<br>to escape. Changing his diet solved the FUS, but he was permanently<br>traumatized.<br><br>Vets had a hard time examining him. There were some cases where he would<br>have to be sedated in order to examine him, but in others, they would<br>put him in the "bad kitty" box, which is literally a Plexiglass box with<br>holes in it so they could examine him. It pretty much form-fit to the<br>size of his body (think of the size of a bread box with a lid that fits<br>just inside the walls of the box and slides up and down to make a space<br>not much larger than the size of the cat). He would clearly be (vocally)<br>upset by being in the box, but they could at least partially examine him<br>if they had to.<br><br>Some vets (for a premium) will visit you at your home if your cat or dog<br>is inconsolable at the vet's office, which is great for general exams,<br>but more specialized work still requires a visit to the office and<br>probably some other interventions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
