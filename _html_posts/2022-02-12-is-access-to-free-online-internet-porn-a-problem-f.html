<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's take these one at a time.<br><br>> Is access to free online internet porn a problem for children?<br><br>Emphatically, yes. Pornography use can shape sexual practices<br>and is associated with unsafe sexual health practices such as not using<br>condoms and unsafe anal and vaginal sex. Many studies have linked porn<br>usage to higher instances of depression, anxiety, sexual aggression,<br>sexual dysfunction, and other mental health conditions. Children receive<br>unhealthy sexual images from adult pornography, which normalizes sexual<br>harm by portraying a lack of emotional relationship between consensual<br>partners, unprotected sexual contact, and, in some instances, violence<br>and rape. For the mind of a child, which does not have the area of the<br>brain needed to rationally parse reality from fictionalized content on<br>the screen, this is developmentally bad.<br><br>> Can we at least ban free pornography so that it is not so easily<br>> accessible and make it available only for people willing to pay for<br>> it?<br><br>While this seems like an easy fix, there are no easy fixes for this<br>problem. Removing free pornography just kicks the problem down the road.<br>Children can get access to money in a variety of ways. Simply relegating<br>all pornographic content behind a paywall is not the answer.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is access to free online internet porn a problem for children?
