<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>YES!!!<br><br>You should absolutely regulate gun permits in exactly the same way you<br>regulate driver's licenses!<br><br>That is:<br><br>- You don't need a background check or a permit to buy a car, so you<br>  shouldn't need one to buy a gun<br>- If you're not taking your gun off of your property, no license is<br>  required. You only need a license if you intend on carrying your gun<br>  off of your property.<br>- The state issues licenses to everyone (unless you can't possess a<br>  gun, like if you're a convicted violent felon, etc) who can pass a<br>  simple usage test and pay a small processing fee, and the license<br>  covers all usage scenarios and all carry conditions (concealed, open,<br>  etc), since you don't need special licenses to drive in the rain, or<br>  on paved vs. dirt roads.<br>- Licenses issued by one state are recognized as legal and are honored<br>  in all 50 states<br>- You don't need special licenses to add features to your car (like<br>  turbochargers, spoilers, specialized exhausts, rims, etc), so no<br>  special licenses should be required to add features to a firearm<br>- Police would need reasonable suspicion before they could question you<br>  about your gun license. So if you're open carrying and minding your<br>  own business, police won't hassle you.<br><br>I could go on, but I think you might not have truly considered what<br>licensing guns in the same way we license drivers would actually look<br>like.<br><br>Be careful what you wish for...<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
