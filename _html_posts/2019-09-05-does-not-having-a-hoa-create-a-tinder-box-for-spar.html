You mean like where one person starts bad habits and then<br>the whole neighborhood catches on?<br><br>No.<br><br>Because *most* people have pride of ownership. Most people will take<br>pride in the home that they own, and they'll take care of it.<br><br>But there are always those who don't. They don't care about the upkeep<br>of the exterior of their home, and they don't care that their ugly<br>exterior negatively impacts your property value. And it is abundantly<br>clear that home values are lower in ugly neighborhoods, where there is a<br>choice in neighborhoods.<br><br>Sure, you can go to Code Enforcement to try to get him back in line, but<br>then it's him vs you. He'll hate you and blame you for every dime in<br>fines that Code Enforcement levies on him. Does it work? Most of the<br>time. *But at what cost?*<br><br>In an HOA-controlled neighborhood, ***everyone voluntarily joined the<br>HOA.*** *But that's not true! Some people didn't want the HOA!* They may<br>not have wanted it, but they still voluntarily joined it **by purchasing<br>a home in an HOA-controlled neighborhood**. They signed on the dotted<br>line, being of sound mind and fully in control of their faculties. They<br>actively joined the HOA, and in doing so, agreed to follow the<br>collective rules in order to maintain everyone's home values. Then, if<br>they choose to violate the rules, it's the HOA that takes action against<br>them, not the individual homeowner. And the HOA can go so far as to<br>place a lien on their home for failing to pay their fines, and then<br>foreclose on that lien. The HOA can remove the violator from the<br>neighborhood. Can Code Enforcement do that?<br><br>Let's be clear: HOAs are voluntarily joined, and the HOA can foreclose<br>on your house if you don't participate. Without the HOA, it's you versus<br>your non-caring neighbor, and no amount of visitations by Code<br>Enforcement will make them care more.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
