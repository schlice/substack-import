<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Given this study showing that there is no evidence the US government<br>represents its people, what arguments are there for its legitimacy?**<br><br>Whether or not a government is representative of its people, or even<br>performs "the will of the people" as it was elected to do, has nothing<br>to do with the legitimacy of that elected government.<br><br>Legitimacy of a US government is solely determined by the legality of<br>the election. If the election was legal, and the election results were<br>certified, the government is legitimate. Period. There is no guarantee<br>of results when electing US government officials.<br><br>The way to handle governments which "do not represent their people" is<br>to elect a new government that does during the next election cycle, and<br>to be smarter voters next time.<br><br>Representation and legitimacy are two totally separate things in the<br>United States.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
