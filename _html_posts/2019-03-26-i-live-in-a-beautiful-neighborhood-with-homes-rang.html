<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I live in a beautiful neighborhood with homes ranging in price from<br>\$500k to over million. The owners of one home have neglected to<br>maintain their home and it's an eyesore. We have an HOA. What can we<br>do?**<br><br>That is squarely in the ballpark of the HOA.<br><br>The only thing you can do: contact your HOA and let them handle it.<br><br>If your HOA does not address the exterior maintenance of homes, there's<br>nothing you can do. Only an HOA would have control over the external<br>appearance of someone else's home. Without them, you don't have any<br>other recourse.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
