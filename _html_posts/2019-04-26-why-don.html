<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why don\'t people demand the right to own serious military weapons, if<br>the Second Amendment is about countering government tyranny?**<br><br>1.  We already can own "serious military weapons," or haven't you heard<br>    that the AR-15 is still legal?\<br>    \<br>    There's really very little difference between the rifles the<br>    military can use and the rifles civilians can use.\<br>    \<br>    Maybe I'm unclear on what you mean by "serious military weapons."<br>    You mean tanks? [[Yes, we can own<br>    those](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c6ad9b&url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324432004578302480951570270){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="wsj.com"}]{.qlink_container}. You mean fighter jets?<br>    [[Yes, we can own those<br>    too](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=11c10b&url=https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/9311/can-civilians-buy-military-aircraft){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="stackexchange.com"}]{.qlink_container}. Maybe if you<br>    quantified "serious military weapons," we could better answer what<br>    you're thinking, instead of just assuming that because it's labeled<br>    "military," we can't buy it.\<br>    \<br>    We've also accepted the fact that certain weapons which were *not*<br>    routinely used by the military, could be outlawed, such as<br>    short-barreled shotguns.\<br>    \<br>    In summary, I think we already can own the vast majority of weapons<br>    which are in regular use by the military.<br>2.  While the 2nd Amendment includes the ability to defend ourselves<br>    against tyranny, that's not all it is there for. Yes, the 2nd<br>    Amendment recognizes the fact that the first thing a tyrannical<br>    government does is disarm its populace. Go ahead, check your history<br>    texts and see what Hitler and Mussolini and Stalin did first when<br>    assuming power.\<br>    \<br>    Remember too that it was civilians who owned military weapons<br>    who bought and paid for the freedom in the United States we enjoy<br>    today, with their blood. The framers of our new government wanted to<br>    ensure that no government would ever have the ability to remove that<br>    right from the people.\<br>    \<br>    So why else, then, do we have a 2nd Amendment? Because besides<br>    recognizing our right to never be enslaved by a tyrannical<br>    government, we also recognize the natural right to self defense.<br>    This is one of the natural rights on which the Bill of Rights was<br>    written. Remember that the Bill of Rights does not *grant* rights.<br>    It recognizes that rights have existed long before the Constitution<br>    was written, and the Bill of Rights exists to *prevent government<br>    from infringing* those rights. The natural right to self defense is<br>    one of those rights. Remember the logic: you have the absolute right<br>    to life. If you have the right to life, you have the right to not<br>    have your life unjustly taken. If you have the right to not have<br>    your life unjustly taken, you have the right to defend your life. If<br>    you have the right to defend your life, you have the right to use<br>    whatever tools you choose in order to do so.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
