<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**President Trump is threatening to cut federal funding to several<br>cities where BLM demonstrations are happening. Can he legally do this?**<br><br>No. He knows this. But many in his base don't, so if it gets him brownie<br>points with them, he'll say it anyway. He cannot "cut funding" to<br>existing Federal programs because something unrelated happened.<br><br>However, he *can* offer Federal grant money to states which behave<br>the way he wants. In other words, he can offer Federal grant program<br>money to states which crack down on violence erupting from protests. And<br>if a state does nothing to stop violence from protests, that grant money<br>would be unavailable to that state.<br><br>But can he "cut federal funding" to states which don't act the way he<br>wants? No, he can't do that. Plenty of court decisions have already<br>affirmed this.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
