<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What SCOTUS did was to determine the constitutionality of the "fine"<br>which is imposed if you don\'t buy health insurance. To do this, they<br>looked at case law and basically found that the fine is not really a<br>fine, but a tax, regardless of what the government wants to call it. It<br>is collected with your taxes, it is collected by the IRS, therefore it<br>is a tax. I think from now on we call that the "walks like a duck" test.<br><br>Understanding that it is a tax and not a fee, fine, or penalty, Congress<br>has the authority to levy taxes, and Congress can use taxes to influence<br>behavior, including to get you to not buy something (i.e. "sin taxes"),<br>so they can also use taxes to get you to buy something.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
