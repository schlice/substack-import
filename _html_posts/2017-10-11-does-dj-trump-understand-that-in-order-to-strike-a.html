He's about ready<br>to drop a fire album...<br><br>You have only cited one half of the Constitutional issue, the War Powers<br>Clause, which states that Congress has the power to declare war.<br><br>The other side of the Constitutional issue is Article I, Section 2,<br>Clause 1: "The President is Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, of<br>the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called<br>into the actual Service of the United States ." This means that the<br>President is in charge of the military, not Congress, and the President<br>can issue orders to the military, including orders to strike another<br>nation. Presidents have used this authority with impunity for some time,<br>committing troops without Congressional approval.<br><br>Congress, after the Korean conflict, drew up the [[War Powers<br>Resolution](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c9fc07&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} (also called the "War<br>Powers Act").<br><br>> The War Powers Resolution requires the President to notify Congress<br>> within 48 hours of committing armed forces to military action and<br>> forbids armed forces from remaining for more than 60 days, with a<br>> further 30-day withdrawal period, without a Congressional<br>> authorization for use of military force (AUMF) or a declaration of war<br>> by the United States. The resolution was passed by two-thirds of<br>> Congress, overriding the veto of the bill from President<br>> Nixon.\[1\](#qphKC){#cite-qphKC .citation_link}<br><br>This means, dear questioner, that the President *can* commit troops,<br>but he has to get authorization from Congress in order to *keep them<br>there.* Congress has drafted *Authorizations of the Use of Military<br>Force (AUMF)* in the past (most recently for the Global War on Terror)<br>which the Supreme Court has ruled are a valid substitute for a<br>declaration of war, and fulfill the requirements of the War Powers<br>Resolution as "approval" by Congress.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-qphKC){.citation_index} [[War Powers Resolution -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c9fc07&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
