<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You definitely touched on a few key points:\<br>]<br><br>- One or more perceived injustices<br>- Feelings of social and societal marginalization and isolation\<br><br>As well as a few others you didn\'t touch on\<br><br>- Media over-coverage of these incidents<br>- And one other big reason that we\'ll get to in a minute.\<br><br>We need to be cautious in discussing the correlation between these<br>incidents and particular use of a technology (be it a social media<br>platform or a gun). We don\'t want the standard conflation between<br>correlation and causation to hinder our line of thinking. We\'ve spent<br>too much time already focusing on the fact that these shooters used<br>guns. Remember that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold actually wanted<br>Columbine to be a mass-*bombing*, not a mass shooting. It only turned<br>into a mass shooting when their bombs failed to detonate and flatten the<br>school as they envisioned.\<br>\<br>The social media platform simply allows them to connect more easily and<br>more anonymously to like-minded individuals, and in some cases, those<br>individuals *encouraged* the aggressor toward his eventual end goal. But<br>the technology did not cause the offender to do what he did. They may<br>have acted as an echo chamber, but the grievance and the perceived<br>injustice was already there.\<br>\<br>The shooters universally felt aggrieved and had nowhere to turn. They<br>almost universally felt as if life had no meaning. This is certainly an<br>issue, as most people feel aggrieved at one time or another in their<br>lives. Most people do not shoot up college campuses. What\'s the<br>difference?\<br>\<br>**We fail to recognize these shooters for what they really are:<br>terrorists.**\<br>\<br>It\'s easy to miss the correlation. When you think of *terrorist,* you<br>think of ISIS: some guy in a turban and a long knife about to behead<br>someone on camera in a desert half a world away. Because he\'s out of<br>sight/out of mind, he could be *anywhere*, hiding behind every bush,<br>concealed in every shadow. And so we over-react: we nearly strip at the<br>airport to get through security. We talk about terrorism incessantly in<br>public buildings, worried about some phantom in the shadow who is never<br>really there. And yet we miss that mass shootings are exactly the same<br>thing: terrorism, albeit non-political, but terrorism nevertheless. *The<br>terrorist uses fear to advance a goal.* We gloss over the fact that this<br>is also terrorism because the shooter is our neighbor. He\'s a college<br>kid. He doesn\'t at all look like the bearded goat herder in the desert.<br>So we try to explain away his actions: easy access to guns did it. Lack<br>of appropriate mental health care did it. White privilege did it. The<br>War on Christianity did it.\<br>\<br>**International terror groups use fear to exact political goals. Mass<br>shooters (non-political terrorists) use fear to promote and glamorize<br>their grievances.**\<br>\<br>And it works. But it doesn\'t sell newspapers or television ad time.<br>Gun control sells newspapers. The War on Christianity sells airtime.<br>Just having empathy for someone who is hurting is Page 7 news. We don\'t<br>take the time to physically go check in with the widow down the block<br>and just see what\'s going on and make sure she\'s okay, because that\'s<br>intrusive, and people deserve their privacy. But at what cost? We\'ve<br>lost basic empathy in our society. And because *WE* marginalize the<br>\"weird\" \"loner\" kid who is maybe a bit socially awkward and<br>introverted, we create the very conditions which cause these types of<br>incidents.\<br>\<br>So what can stop it? Basic human kindness is a great place to start.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
