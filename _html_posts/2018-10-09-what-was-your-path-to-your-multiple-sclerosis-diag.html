<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I wrote this blog post about 10 months after I was diagnosed. It's<br>pretty good. I'll reproduce it for you here, since I had closed my blog<br>and it effectively died.<br><br>\<br><br>Dateline: December, 2005. I wake up one morning and rub my eyes only to<br>realize that I can\'t rub the sleep out of one eye. It\'s still blurry,<br>and it hurts when I look around. Huh, I think. Sinuses and allergies<br>must be bad today. Shower doesn\'t help much (in fact, it makes it<br>worse), and I notice that when I walk into the dark of the closet, I see<br>what appears to be sparklers (รก la the 4th of July kind) around the<br>outside of my field of vision in my right eye. I explain all of this to<br>DW, who immediately freaks out because she\'s real cautious about eyes<br>(she's had bad eyes since she was a teen). She hears \"sparklers\" and<br>she thinks \"retinal detachment.\" And I have a trip coming up, like in<br>a day, which she promptly makes me cancel and sets me up with her<br>ophthalmologist.<br><br>I explain my symptoms to him, and as I start talking, he knows exactly<br>what\'s wrong. Optic neuritis, a transient condition caused by swelling<br>of the optic nerve behind the eye. The sparklers and blurry vision are<br>caused by the degraded electrical signal flowing down the optic nerve,<br>and the pain is from the swelling. The condition will right itself in a<br>few weeks to a few months. The more nefarious problem, however, is what<br>causes it. In about half of the people who present with this condition,<br>there is no cause at all, and it just passes. In about the other half,<br>it is caused by MS. To find out, I need to go get an MRI. I was<br>scheduled for an MRI a few days later, and got a call back from my<br>doctor the same day (that just can\'t be good). He says that I should<br>see a neurologist, because the MRI shows all the signs of someone with<br>MS.<br><br>MS is the common abbreviation for Multiple Sclerosis, an autoimmune<br>disease which, according to the [[National MS<br>Society](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=201541&url=http://www.nmss.org/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nmss.org"}]{.qlink_container}, affects almost half a million<br>people in the United States, and millions more worldwide. It hits women<br>twice as frequently as men, and usually presents between 20 and 40 years<br>of age. It is characterized by the immune system attacking the nerve<br>cells of the central nervous system, and destroying the myelin sheath<br>surrounding the nerve fibers. These areas of \"demyelination\" are<br>replaced by hard, scar-like lesions (called scleroses, thus the term<br>\"Multiple Sclerosis\" meaning \"many scars\"). Symptoms are different<br>for every person who get it, but they can include motor control issues,<br>bowel/bladder control problems, vision loss, memory and balance issues,<br>numbness or loss of feeling in the extremities. Usually, the disease is<br>characterized by periods of disease worsening (relapses) followed by<br>longer periods of wellness (remission). Eventually, the disease will get<br>more progressive, causing more permanent disability.<br><br>I spend the next month going through all the emotions that someone in my<br>position would go through: anger, fear, sadness, depression, grieving<br>over the loss, etc. When I finally came around, I realized that I was<br>given this illness for a reason. I don\'t know what it is yet. But I do<br>know that God doesn\'t give you what you can\'t handle.<br><br>\<br><br>Hope this helps a little. Feel free to ask questions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
