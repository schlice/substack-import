<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>> *Original question details:*<br>><br>> *I live in Europe and I\'m going on a family trip to New York in a few<br>> weeks. My dad has just told us that they can check if we\'ve done any<br>> illegal downloading at the airport and that they can fine us for it or<br>> that they won\'t even let us go to New York anymore. Is this true?*<br><br>You don\'t get arrested for using Torrent. Torrent (or BitTorrent, to be<br>more precise), is just a file copy protocol which very efficiently moves<br>files around the Internet.<br><br>You get arrested for downloading licensed content for which you do not<br>have a license.<br><br>For example, if a Torrent site offers you free movies and free music<br>(which are not part of the public domain), and other sites charge for<br>those, either through subscription fees or per-song fees, then it\'s<br>likely that the site is *stealing* the content. It would be illegal<br>for you to download that content, either through BitTorrent, FTP, HTTP,<br>or whatever file transfer protocol you choose.<br><br>Is it likely that they will go after you? No. And it\'s also not likely<br>that they would be able to tell from a file on your computer from where<br>you got it. For example, I have several hundred movies ripped from DVDs<br>and saved on a hard drive which I take with me when I travel. It\'s very<br>convenient. But you\'ll note that I have all of the originals boxed up<br>in my basement. This would constitute *fair use* since I am only using<br>one copy of the movie at a time, and I only breached the copy protection<br>to convert the movie to a format that fit my specific hardware. Yes, I<br>had to circumvent copy protection in order to copy the movie which is<br>technically illegal, but I am protected by fair use, and I doubt anyone<br>will go after me directly anyway. If they did, I am certain that I could<br>make a strong argument for fair use.<br><br>As for you, if you have movies or music on your laptop, I think you\'ll<br>be just fine bringing them anywhere you choose. The legality of those<br>movies may be in question (I have no way of knowing), but your personal<br>use of those movies or music shouldn\'t raise any red flags.<br><br>I would avoid using BitTorrent to download illegally copied content<br>while you are stateside. I\'d also avoid using BitTorrent to download<br>illegally copied content *any time*, but I\'ll leave that judgment call<br>to you.<br><br>Finally, no, they will not stop you at the airport to check your laptop<br>for illegal content. They are not the content police, they are the TSA.<br>Not to mention, they can\'t check your laptop without a warrant. You\'ll<br>be just fine. Have fun in New York; I grew up there. The phrase \"the<br>city that never sleeps\" is absolutely true.<br><br>(EDIT) A commenter posted that US Customs and Border Patrol (USCBP) can<br>actually check your laptop, and while I was talking about TSA<br>domestically around the US, the commenter is correct in saying that<br>USCBP can check your laptop, including all of the data on it, as you<br>cross the border. They can also seize your laptop. But just having a<br>digital copy of a movie on your laptop doesn't mean that you illegally<br>obtained it. As I indicated above, I would be covered under "fair use"<br>if I was ever stopped with my movies going through Customs. But the CBP<br>agents don't know that, so I'd have a hard time believing that I'd be<br>stopped or have my laptop seized because of those movies.<br><br>Honestly, it's going to be up to you. If you legally obtained the media<br>on your laptop, then go for it. But if you didn't, you probably<br>shouldn't carry it through Customs into any foreign country, as their<br>laws are different from your home laws. They can indeed search your<br>laptop at the border, and they can seize it as well. And as a foreigner,<br>if they see you as being uncooperative, they can deny you entry into the<br>US. Don't risk that.<br><br>\<br><br>Hi readers! I'm moving! No, not my house, my column!
