Perhaps they want to send you email and they want you to open<br>that content while you're on the phone.<br><br>So your call will clearly come in on the device they told you, they<br>probably want you near the computer so you can do something else during<br>your interview.<br><br>I recommend you do what you're asked.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
