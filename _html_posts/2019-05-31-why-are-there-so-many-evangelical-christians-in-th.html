<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why are there so many evangelical Christians in the U.S. military when<br>their Jesus wouldn\'t have bombed countless foreign nations to expand<br>U.S. corporations\' access to foreign markets?**<br><br>It is interesting, isn't it? Why are there so many religious people in<br>the military, which in a nutshell exists to kill people and blow stuff<br>up?<br><br>The bottom line is that God places people into government in order to<br>rule over nations. Part of government's responsibility is defense. There<br>are plenty of examples in the Bible which show that it is indeed<br>Biblical for a nation to defend itself using warfare.<br><br>If you're thinking, "But the Bible says 'Thou shalt not kill,'" you're<br>probably thinking of the King James Version. The more appropriate<br>translation of that phrase is "Thou shalt not murder." Most situations<br>in warfare are not murder.<br><br>As for your accusation that the US military is nothing more than a<br>political tool, you're absolutely right. The military is indeed a<br>projection of the political will of the United States. But when you say<br>that we've literally slaughtered people just to somehow make other<br>nations do business with us, you're slightly hyperbolic and really off<br>the mark. It's like the one I hear all the time: "The Iraq War was all<br>about oil!" In a way, it was. Oil is part of the US economy, a very big<br>part. Indeed, oil is a big part of the world economy. Disrupting that<br>flow of oil, especially through an illegal incursion of one country into<br>another, would have had a major impact on our own economy. It's one of<br>the reasons the US Navy is keeping shipping lanes open throughout the<br>world and helping to defend against pirates: it benefits our economy. So<br>yes, keeping oil flowing is a major benefit to the US economy, and is<br>therefore something we're going to ensure continues.<br><br>And it's okay for a religious person to do those things.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
