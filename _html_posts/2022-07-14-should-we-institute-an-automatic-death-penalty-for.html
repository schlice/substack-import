<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You're on the right track, but not for the right reasons.<br><br>First, getaway drivers are "slammed" with murder because of what's known<br>as the "[[Felony<br>Murder](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=455f4f&url=https://www.justia.com/criminal/offenses/homicide/felony-murder/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="justia.com"}]{.qlink_container} rule." If, while a group is<br>in the commission of a felony, a murder occurs, then everyone involved<br>in the felony is equally eligible for the murder. It's a part of<br>"transferred intent."<br><br>But aside from felony murder, mandatory charges are a great idea for<br>anyone who commits a crime involving a firearm. For example, a mandatory<br>gun charge which is not subject to plea bargain or parole. Add to<br>that a mandatory sentence (say 5 years to run consecutively to any other<br>sentence), and anyone committing any crime in which a gun is involved is<br>*automatically* going away for a minimum of 5 years, and it can't be<br>plea bargained away, and you have to do the whole five, no parole.<br><br>Take the ability to remove the gun charge out of the hands of the<br>prosecutors and the judges and see how many criminals are willing to do<br>the mandatory time.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
