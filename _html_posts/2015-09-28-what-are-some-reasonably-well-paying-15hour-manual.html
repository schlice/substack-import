<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Here\'s the rub: most manual labor jobs don\'t require<br>four-year degrees. But they do require some level of training and/or<br>experience. And they all pay more than minimum wage. According to the<br>Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are about three million unfilled jobs<br>which require some level of training, and most don\'t require four-year<br>degrees.\<br>\<br>I do know that garbage collectors make around \$15/hr, and they don\'t<br>require any specific skillset, nor do they require a four-year degree.\<br>\<br>If you\'re looking for well-paying manual labor jobs, I\'d be looking to<br>vocational tech school. [[Mike<br>Rowe](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=382d4f&url=https://www.facebook.com/TheRealMikeRowe/posts/938382126171931:0){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="facebook.com"}]{.qlink_container} points out that a<br>particular construction manager would be willing to pay \$40/hour to a<br>reliable welder, but he just can\'t find one.\<br>\<br>My advice: look for some manual labor job that you\'re willing to do,<br>but requires some technical training, then go get that training. Many<br>technical training institutes offer job assistance at the conclusion of<br>your training, and offer financial aid as well.\<br>\<br>As an aside, we in the United States need to do better at offering<br>vocational technical training to students. By removing this from<br>schools, we seem to have \"devalued\" manual labor in the eyes of<br>students. To them, only a degree matters. And what of the millions of<br>skilled labor jobs which go unfilled? Many find them \"unsuitable\" for<br>their tastes. Oh well, better for those who actually get the training<br>and go after those jobs, eh?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
