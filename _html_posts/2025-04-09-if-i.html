<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with any legal answer, this one is also "it depends."<br><br>Depending on your jurisdiction, the rules of your parole *may* allow<br>police officers to search your home without a warrant. But in nearly<br>every jurisdiction, parole officers and/or probation officers<br>can search your house without a warrant.<br><br>Typically, when you are paroled, you sign what is known as a "Fourth<br>Amendment Waiver." This means that for the duration of your parole, you<br>give up your Fourth Amendment rights regarding search and seizure. In<br>practice, in most jurisdictions, this means that any police officer or<br>parole officer can walk up to you any time they have a suspicion you are<br>engaging in criminal activity and search you. Periodic random house<br>checks conducted by your Probation Officer (PO) are often part of the<br>terms of parole as well. And if you refuse or resist in any way, or in<br>the case of probation fail to notify your PO of the contact, they can<br>not only arrest you for violating your probation or parole, but they can<br>also charge you with whatever they found.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
