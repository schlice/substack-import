<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, he can't stop Biden from nominating a replacement.<br><br>But he *can* make it virtually impossible for that replacement (who is<br>likely to be a black woman) to get a vote on the floor.<br><br>The Senate Judiciary Committee is split 11--11 between Republicans and<br>Democrats in a deal brokered between McConnell and Schumer. And the<br>nominee can only go to the floor for a vote if the Judiciary Committee<br>passes her on. If all 11 Republicans vote no to pass the nominee along,<br>and all 11 Democrats do, the nomination goes *inert*. The nomination<br>doesn't die, it just gets parked until a lawmaker brings it to the floor<br>for four hours of debate.<br><br>A majority of the Senate can then put debate about the issue on the<br>calendar for the next day. But this isn't a debate about the nomination,<br>it's a motion to discharge. It's a *cloture* motion which requires 60<br>Senators to approve. In other words, 10 Republicans would need to agree<br>to resurrect a nomination of someone who was already *effectively<br>blocked* by the Judiciary Committee.<br><br>So Republicans can indeed basically kill the nomination if they so<br>desire. And given that more than half of the 11 Republicans on the<br>Judiciary Committee have Presidential aspirations themselves, there's a<br>good chance that they will do just that.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it possible for Mitch McConnell to somehow prevent Joe Biden from<br>appointing the replacement for Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
