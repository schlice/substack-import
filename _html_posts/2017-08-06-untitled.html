<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Really? Alarmist much?<br><br>From the article YOU quoted:<br><br>> *No one disputes that the 1972 Clean Water Act allows federal agencies<br>> to regulate navigable rivers and lakes. Less certain is the status of<br>> some two million miles of headwaters and streams that flow only part<br>> of the year --- 60% of the river and stream miles in the lower 48<br>> states --- plus 20 million acres of wetlands that aren\'t directly<br>> connected to large waterways.*<br>><br>> *Under the Obama interpretation, those waters are protected. Business<br>> groups and some Republican state officials --- including then-Oklahoma<br>> Attorney General Scott Pruitt, now Trump\'s EPA chief --- filed suit,<br>> contending the regulation gave federal officials too much authority<br>> over waters that don\'t cross state lines or have a clear link to<br>> waters that are covered.*<br>><br>> *The regulation was in effect for a short period in 2015 before the<br>> appeals court issued a stay. Those legal challenges are still<br>> pending.*<br><br>So not only were the regulations which were corrected overly broad,<br>covering waterways which have no connection to navigable rivers and<br>lakes, and have no connection to manufacturing pollution, but those very<br>same regulations have been in limbo since a stay was issued by the<br>appeals court in 2015. So farmers were unable to use those waters for<br>their farms without Federal government approval.<br><br>Also, no one wants to see the regulations simply disappear. This is<br>simply a Federalist attitude (if the EPA isn't playing "Big Brother,"<br>states won't be able to care for their own waterways). This would simply<br>return control of about 60% of river and stream miles in the lower 48 to<br>states, especially for waterways which do not cross state lines and the<br>Federal government should not rightly have control over. That's called<br>"Federal overreach."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-a-terrorist-group-put-Anthrax-or-Poison-into-the-Great-Lakes-in-the-United-States/answer/Frank-U-19<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
