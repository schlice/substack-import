<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I assume you're talking about "historians" from around the time Jesus<br>lived, right? And I also assume you're talking about others who weren't<br>included in the Bible hundreds of years later, because those writings<br>were pretty close. Regardless, I'll discuss both.<br><br>From the Bible, the earliest *undisputed* writing is the John Rylands<br>fragment, which was written between AD 117 and 138. There are also nine<br>*disputed* fragments that date from A.D. 50 to 70, found with the Dead<br>Sea Scrolls. Some scholars believe these fragments are parts of six New<br>Testament books including Mark, Acts, Romans, 1 Timothy, 2 Peter, and<br>James. While other scholars resist this conclusion (perhaps because its<br>admission would undermine their liberal leanings that the New Testament<br>was written later), they have not found any other non--New Testament<br>texts that these fragments could be.<br><br>*Outside* of the Bible, there are ten non-Christian authors who wrote of<br>Jesus within 150 years of His life:<br><br>- Flavius Josephus, a historian;<br>- Tacitus, the Roman historian;<br>- Pliny the Younger, a Roman politician;<br>- Phlegon, a freed slave who wrote histories;<br>- Thallus, a first-century historian;<br>- Seutonius, a Roman historian;<br>- Lucian, a Greek satirist;<br>- Celsus, a Roman philosopher;<br>- Mara Bar-Serapion, a private citizen who wrote to his son;<br>- the Jewish Talmud<br><br>Whether you doubt the truth of those particular authors, or whatever<br>your personal issues with them are, these authors collectively<br>acknowledged certain facts about Jesus. These non-Christian authors<br>admit facts about early Christianity that help us piece together a<br>storyline that is surprisingly congruent with the New Testament. These<br>are the facts which come out of those authors' stories:<br><br>1.  Jesus lived during time of Tiberius Caesar.<br>2.  He lived a virtuous life.<br>3.  He was a wonder-worker.<br>4.  He had a brother named James.<br>5.  He was acclaimed to be the Messiah.<br>6.  He was crucified under Pontius Pilate.<br>7.  He was crucified on the eve of the Jewish Passover.<br>8.  Darkness and an earthquake occurred when he died.<br>9.  His disciples believed he rose from the dead.<br>10. His disciples were willing to die for their belief.<br>11. Christianity spread rapidly as far as Rome.<br>12. His disciples denied the Roman gods and worshiped Jesus as God.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
