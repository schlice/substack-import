<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You know yourself, that\'s a good thing.<br><br>The military is, in my opinion, a great career option. You learn<br>valuable life skills, generally have marketable skills should you choose<br>to get out (or you have to get out for one reason or another), you have<br>educational opportunities and opportunities for personal growth. And,<br>not the least of which, you will be serving your country and will join a<br>long line of brave Americans who wore that same uniform before you did.<br>When you do get out, you will be a veteran. You will always be a<br>veteran; no one can ever take that away from you.<br><br>Here\'s another interesting tidbit about today\'s military: as an NCO<br>(Non-Commissioned Officer, or enlisted member), you will be *expected*<br>to earn your degree. To be fair, it\'s not a written requirement, but if<br>you want to advance to senior NCO ranks, you will be expected to earn a<br>degree (at least an Associate\'s degree, if not a Bachelor\'s degree).<br><br>The military is not a bunch of brainless rifle operators as many people<br>envision. Today\'s military is intelligent, motivated, and fiercely<br>loyal to this nation and the foundations on which it was built. You will<br>never find a more highly motivated, truly dedicated, hard-charging team<br>of professionals anywhere in the world.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
