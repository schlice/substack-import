<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's because there is a difference between loving someone and accepting<br>their behavior.<br><br>Christians do love everyone. Yes, even LGBTQ people. However, and this<br>part is important, we are under no obligation to condone sinful<br>*behavior*. God does not approve of sinful behavior, and neither do<br>I.<br><br>Note that the only thing we do not have to condone (that means: approve<br>of) is *sinful behavior*. Not condoning sinful behavior **has zero<br>impact** on whether or not I love my brother or sister. And this truth<br>does not just apply to the LGBTQ community. It applies to *anyone*. It<br>doesn't matter what the sin is. I don't have to condone the sin<br><br>"Love the sinner, hate the sin." Or better, "Hate the sin, *because*<br>you love the sinner." Sin is contrary to our good, so if I am to love<br>everyone, then I want what's good for them. Therefore, I should hate<br>whatever is contrary to their good, and sin is contrary to their good.<br><br>The hard truth is: **no person should try to force anyone else to<br>condone their sinful behavior, either**. Again, doesn't matter what the<br>sin is. It is up to the *sinner* to repent; it is not up to the others<br>around the sinner to accept their sinful behavior as valid. Doesn't<br>matter what the sin is. We could easily substitute adulterers, thieves,<br>murderers, or those caught in the vice of sexual immorality of any kind,<br>into this bucket. It certainly isn't limited to the sins which are<br>committed within the LGBTQ community.<br><br>Yes, it is true that some Christians do not understand that difference,<br>and they fail to love their neighbor as we are commanded to do. That<br>doesn't change the fact that the difference exists.<br><br>It is now up to you to discover the difference, too. Remember, the truth<br>is still the truth, regardless of our belief about the truth. Our belief<br>doesn't change the truth. And it doesn't matter how sincerely we believe<br>it. If I believe the earth is flat, but I really sincerely believe it,<br>it doesn't change the shape of the earth, it just makes me sincerely<br>mistaken.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If in Christianity you are to love anyone, then why not people who are<br>LGBTQ?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
