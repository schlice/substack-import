<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [No, a right does not have to apply to any other right in<br>order to be passed. An amendment to the Constitution (we won\'t actually<br>amend the Bill of Rights, since that is simply the first 10 amendments<br>to the Constitution) stands or falls on its own. There should be no<br>requirement that it be applicable to any other right already granted by<br>the Constitution.\<br>\<br>The OP then added the following question details:\<br>*In my view changing the Bill of Rights is a very big deal and should be<br>done with great care. I have been thinking that a litmus test can be<br>applied to see if public opinion would support a change to the Bill of<br>rights if you could apply the basic change to all rights. This is just a<br>thought, I would enjoy reading good discussions on this idea.*\<br>\<br>Perhaps you are unclear on how the Constitution is amended.\<br>\<br>In order to amend the Constitution, first someone has to write an<br>amendment. The amendment can either alter the understanding of an<br>existing amendment, or propose a new rule altogether. There are two<br>methods by which an amendment can be proposed:\<br>]<br><br>1.  Congress can write the amendment. The amendment will have to pass<br>    both houses of Congress with a 2/3 majority (a supermajority, as<br>    opposed to \"more than half,\" which is a simple majority).<br>2.  2/3 of the states, or 34 states, can ratify a *Constitutional<br>    Convention* whereby they can propose an amendment to the<br>    Constitution, which can then be submitted to Congress to pass the<br>    process as listed in Step 1. In the entire history of amendments to<br>    the Constitution (17 times), the Constitutional Convention has never<br>    been used.<br><br>Once the amendment is approved by 2/3 majority in Congress, it is added<br>to the Constitution when it is *ratified* by 3/4ths of the states (38<br>states). This means that all states will have to have statewide voting<br>to determine whether or not that state will vote to ratify that<br>amendment. It is likely that states will use a simple majority of state<br>voters to determine whether or not they will support or reject<br>ratification of an amendment.\<br>\<br>People will all have an opportunity to vote on a proposed amendment.<br>Their mental machinations to determine whether or not they *should* vote<br>for or against a particular amendment were never made into law, nor<br>should they be. How people believe about one particular issue is a<br>fundamental right of the voter.\<br>\<br>That said, I understand what you\'re getting at. Unfortunately, when the<br>voting rules were originally put into place, the Founders believed that<br>voters would be *intelligent.* They believed that voters would be<br>well-schooled on Constitutional issues and fully understand what it was<br>they were voting for. All too often, however, voters are uninformed,<br>usually getting their opinions from the particular talking heads on the<br>little black screen in their living rooms. The colloquial term for these<br>people is *low-information voters.* Since, by law, you cannot deny any<br>US citizen the right to vote, there can be no intelligence test to<br>ensure that people possess a minimum fundamental understanding of an<br>issue before they vote on it. Therefore, you get what you get. Make sure<br>if you\'re going to push a Constitutional amendment, your biggest<br>department in your campaign headquarters is your PR department.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
