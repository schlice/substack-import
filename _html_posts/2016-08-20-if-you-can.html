<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The prison system in the United States is indeed rehabilitative, but it<br>is also a form of punishment. Restricting your freedom in a free society<br>is one of the most profound punishments you can receive.<br><br>Some people, however, don't mind.<br><br>As a matter of fact, during my senior level Criminal Justice class, I<br>spoke to a few inmates in our medium-security prison in the mid 90's who<br>were able to tell me exactly what crime they were planning on<br>committing, at exactly what age, so that they would be sent back to<br>medium-security for the remainder of their days. Basically, since they<br>didn't find medium-security prison all that objectionable, they decided<br>that it would be their retirement plan. Get arrested, get thrown in<br>medium-security, and live comfortably the rest of your days, at the<br>expense of the taxpayer.<br><br>If they succeeded, they should be cooling their senior-citizen heels in<br>there right now.<br><br>If you can do the time, the crime becomes nothing more than a means to<br>an end.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
