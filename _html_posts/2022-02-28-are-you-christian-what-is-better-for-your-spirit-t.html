<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I can't answer who between those two makes a better human. There have<br>been wonderful humans who didn't believe in God at all. So simply<br>believing in God or following his commands does not automatically make<br>you a better human.<br><br>But what is better for your *spirit* is to do both, not either/or.<br>You must believe in God, love God, and repent of your sins, and live by<br>his teachings.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Are you Christian? What is better for your spirit, to live practicing<br>the Christ\'s doctrine or believing in God, in the Virgin, etc.? Who is<br>a better human: s/he who practices the Christ\'s teachings or s/he<br>believer in God who do not practice them?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
