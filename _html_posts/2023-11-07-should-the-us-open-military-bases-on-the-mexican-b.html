<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I like the way you think. But there are a few notable problems with your<br>idea.<br><br>1.  Military base locations are picked to assist the military with<br>    its core function. Military base locations are not picked based on<br>    helping the local community.<br>2.  It is not the military's job to "secure the border." That's the job<br>    of the Department of Homeland Security, not the Department of<br>    Defense. I know it sounds like splitting hairs, but the federal<br>    government has already taken states to court over this issue (and<br>    won), claiming that it is solely within their purview to determine<br>    how best to secure (or not) the border. The federal government has<br>    designated the authority to secure the border to DHS, not to DOD.<br>3.  If it were a task assigned to the Department of Defense by the<br>    President and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the military can absolutely<br>    go teach border security. But the construction of a base is not<br>    necessary to accomplish that task.<br><br>Ultimately, the problem here is that the military is the political arm<br>of the government, it is not an entity of its own. Clausewitz said,<br>"Politics is war without bloodshed. War is politics with bloodshed."<br>He's right. War is politics. The military is just a physical<br>manifestation of US foreign policy. It's the global "teeth" behind US<br>foreign policy.<br><br>Even though they can do it, and it might be a good idea, it's never<br>going to happen. The government would rather continue using the southern<br>border as a wedge issue in elections rather than doing what's best for<br>the country and its people.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
