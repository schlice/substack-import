<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So first, let's clarify a few things.<br><br>Oklahoma, as with most states in the US, has a strong "castle doctrine."<br>This moniker comes from the phrase, "a man's home is his castle." The<br>state legislature recognizes that Oklahomans have an absolute right to<br>feel safe within the confines of their home. To that end, **they have<br>the right to use force, up to and including deadly force, to defend<br>themselves within that home, from unauthorized entrants wishing to do<br>harm.**<br><br>In states with strong castle doctrines:<br><br>- don't enter a home unauthorized<br>  - and don't do so armed<br>  - and don't do so while threatening the occupants.<br><br>Doing so may evoke an accurate, high-velocity response.<br><br>Let's clarify another misconception you have about the US. **The police<br>do not exist to protect you from crime.** The police exist to bring<br>criminals to justice, not to defend citizens from crime. Numerous<br>Supreme Court decisions have been handed down which clarify and cement<br>this fact.<br><br>So with that in mind, let's review:<br><br>- Three armed assailants enter a home in Oklahoma.<br>- The homeowner shoots and kills them.<br><br>This is consistent with Oklahoma law. No reason for the homeowner to<br>have waited for police response before taking action to defend himself<br>and others in the home.<br><br>Remember, *when seconds count, the police are only minutes away.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
