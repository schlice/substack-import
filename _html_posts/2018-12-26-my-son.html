<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My son\'s girlfriend\'s parents are seriously concerned that their<br>girl is dating a boy from a broken family. What should I do/say to allow<br>their girl to date my son?**<br><br>How does this affect your son? Are they literally forbidding the girl<br>from dating your son because of bad information? I would think that if I<br>was going to step in on my child's dating, I'd need some pretty solid<br>information before I made that move.<br><br>And I think that would inform my ultimate decision. I think your best<br>course of action is to tell your son to move on. If the girl is *that<br>interested* in your son, perhaps she'll get on board and convince her<br>own parents to let her date him, since it's her problem, not you son's,<br>and certainly not yours. If the girl's parents are this controlling<br>*now*, imagine how they'd be as *in-laws.*<br><br>No frackin' way. Tell your son that there are other fish in the sea, and<br>he should just abide by her (and her parents') decision and not date.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
