<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I get a popup ad on my Samsung Galaxy S8+. It pops up no matter what I<br>am doing and even on a locked screen and I hear sudden sounds from my<br>phone. How do I get rid of it?**<br><br>You downloaded an app which places popup ads on your screen. It doesn't<br>necessarily have to be a "hacked" app; some apps just do this as a<br>matter of course. By downloading and installing the app, you agreed to<br>allow it to place ads on your phone. That's part of that End User<br>Agreement that no one ever reads before just clicking OK.<br><br>While you can't directly find which app is causing the popup, you can<br>examine all of your apps and see the kind of ad services they use, and<br>which ones might be causing full-screen ads to appear. I would suggest<br>downloading<br>[Anti-Adware(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8f2205&url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Dcom.keerby.adaware%26hl%3Den_US){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container} from the Google Play Store<br>and performing a full system scan. Once it's complete, examine each of<br>the apps which can show ads and look for the "High-Risk" apps (they will<br>show up in red) which can show ads outside of the app itself, such as in<br>the notification area and full-screen ads outside of the app. I'd start<br>by uninstalling those, and see if the situation improves.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
