<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do you consider breaking unjust law as a crime?<br><br>Oh yes, breaking unjust laws is indeed a crime. Your moral judgement<br>about a law doesn't change the law's criminality.<br><br>However, if I find a law to be immoral (which is why it would be<br>unjust), I have to make the mental calculation that says that it is more<br>important for me to act *morally* than it is for me to act *legally*.<br><br>This means (and this is the *really* important part) that my moral code,<br>which *insists* that I act unlawfully, informs me that **I will accept<br>the consequences of my actions.**<br><br>Yes, you can be charged with a crime for breaking an unjust law. But<br>morally, you know that you did the right thing, even if the law says<br>otherwise.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
