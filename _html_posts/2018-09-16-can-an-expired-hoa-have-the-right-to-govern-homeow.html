<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can an expired HOA have the right to govern homeowners association<br>members?**<br><br>I don't understand what an "expired HOA" is.<br><br>HOAs are governed by covenants and governing documents, and the<br>covenants are incorporated by the City and become part of City Charter.<br><br>Like a Constitutional Amendment, the only way to terminate an HOA is by<br>filing another amendment to the covenants with the city, and the only<br>way to do that is through (usually) unanimous vote of the homeowners<br>(although some cities and states have different rules about that, it<br>could be a supermajority of homeowners).<br><br>So there is either an HOA, or there is no HOA. HOAs do not "expire."<br><br>It sounds like you're looking for a loophole to invalidate something the<br>HOA told you to do. Bottom line: if you live in an area controlled by an<br>HOA, the HOA has a "controlling interest" in your property, and you<br>gotta do what they tell you or they can fine you. Don't pay the fine and<br>they can put a lien on your house. Let it go long enough, and they can<br>foreclose on your lien. That means they sell your house out from under<br>you, and you're no longer a homeowner.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
