<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can you resist a citizen arrest?<br><br>Sure you can! You can resist *any* arrest! Although I'd advise you to<br>not resist the arrest of a peace officer. Not only does a peace officer<br>in uniform acting under color of law have a presumption of lawful<br>action, they have *numbers* that you don't have. They can bring<br>overwhelming force in a very short amount of time. In short, you won't<br>win.<br><br>Regardless of who is making the arrest, what happens later depends<br>entirely on whether or not the arrest had merit.<br><br>*If it did*, then you'd still be arrested for the original charge, and<br>you'd also have a resisting arrest charge added.<br><br>*If it did not*, you would be filing charges against the person who<br>arrested you for unlawful detention, and if it was a citizen's arrest,<br>you'd be adding assault to that list as well. If they moved you from the<br>location of the incident, you'd also be adding kidnapping.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
