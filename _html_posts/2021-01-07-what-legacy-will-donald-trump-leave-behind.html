<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What will be the legacy of President Donald J. Trump?<br><br>*"One ahshit will wipe out ten attaboys."*<br><br>That's what my boss used to tell me. What does that mean? You can get<br>congratulated up and down, but if you screw up because you're an idiot,<br>that's what people will remember.<br><br>Jan 6, 2021 will be the day that people remember. They won't remember<br>Russia, or his historic victory over Hillary Clinton when literally<br>everyone said he'd lose by double-digits, or his tax cuts, or even<br>Coronavirus and the chorus on both sides of the aisle that alternatively<br>said that he saved millions or he killed millions.<br><br>This is what they'll remember.<br><br>They'll remember the whiny, petulant little boy who couldn't lose with<br>dignity. Even after the voters, the states, and the courts all weighed<br>in and certified that he lost (if only by the narrowest of margins, but<br>an L is still an L), this is what they'll remember.<br><br>They'll remember the guy who didn't condemn violence until later.<br>They'll remember the guy who some claim incited the violence with his<br>speech. Whether you believe that he did or not, you can't deny the<br>timing. Speech in the morning, storming the castle in the evening.<br><br>This is what they'll remember.<br><br>(EDIT) And if Democrats in Congress have their way, they may impeach him<br>again before he leaves office. Then, his legacy will be the only<br>president to be impeached twice while in office.<br><br>This will go down in history, and this will be the Trump legacy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
