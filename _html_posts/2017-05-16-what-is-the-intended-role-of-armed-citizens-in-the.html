<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Be a good witness.<br><br>Beyond that, armed citizens are armed to defend their own rights. They<br>are not armed to intercede in the affairs of others.<br><br>The reason that I don't advocate stepping in in defense of others is<br>because this is a very tenuous legal area. No one wants to see anyone<br>else hurt, but juries hate vigilante justice as much as they hate bad<br>guys, and sometimes juries fear that they will be condoning vigilantes<br>if they let you go free.<br><br>That said, "defense of others" is an affirmative legal defense, which<br>means you have to provide evidence to support the defense before the<br>jury will be allowed to consider it. It is not an immunity from charges.<br>As others have stated, you will likely be disarmed and arrested if you<br>intercede. You will then be required to present a defense which has at<br>its core "defense of others."<br><br>Defense of others, as with all laws in the United States, varies greatly<br>by state. Each state has its own requirements for when defense of others<br>applies. Especially in "duty to retreat" states, defense of others may<br>not even be a viable legal defense. In general though, there are three<br>elements to the affirmative defense of "defense of others:"<br><br>- You must believe another person is in imminent danger of death or<br>  grave bodily harm<br>- Your belief must be reasonable<br>- You can only use as much force as a reasonable person would have used<br>  to stop the threat.<br><br>A few states still retain the "alter-ego" rule, which means that they<br>don't have a "reasonableness" standard. In an "alter-ego" state, you can<br>only use force if the victim could have used force, and you can only use<br>as much force as the victim could have used. If you were wrong about how<br>much force to use, or whether the victim could have used force at all,<br>your "defense of others" defense vanishes.<br><br>Still other states require that a "special relationship" be present<br>between the victim and the defendant, such as a family member or an<br>extended family member (i.e. in-laws).<br><br>There are even further restrictions on defense of others, primarily the<br>fact that it can't be used in all circumstances at all times. It's<br>legally really sketchy.<br><br>So I don't advocate doing it. Armed citizens are armed to protect<br>themselves and their families. Your best bet is to be a good witness.<br>Record if you can. Otherwise, commit to memory as much as you see. Don't<br>forget to answer the who/what/when/where/why questions when you're<br>committing details to memory.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
