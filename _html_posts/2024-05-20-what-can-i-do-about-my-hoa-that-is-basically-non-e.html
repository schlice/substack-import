<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There could be several reasons for this.<br><br>1.  The HOA may still be managed by the builder. In neighborhoods which<br>    are still under construction, the HOA is managed by the builder. The<br>    HOA is not transitioned to the homeowners until after the builder<br>    leaves the neighborhood.<br>2.  You may have a version of a "no-contact HOA" which is supposed to be<br>    super-simple and hands-free for the homeowners. Some builders in the<br>    2000s were trying to implement these HOA structures. They don't have<br>    a Board of homeowners; they are completely managed by a managing<br>    agent. The managing agent takes care of maintaining insurance on the<br>    common areas, maintaining contracts for lawn maintenance, paying the<br>    water bill, snow removal (if your area needs it), etc. It's all<br>    hands-free for the homeowners.<br><br>We had one of these in Colorado. The builder was trying to make it as<br>easy as possible for the homeowners. No Board to manage, nothing to do,<br>just pay the money and the HOA stuff is all taken care of. He had the<br>best of intentions when he put it in.<br><br>But it didn't work as well as he probably envisioned. The managing agent<br>who ran the HOA was a real ass. We'd tried to ask him questions, like<br>"which companies did you compare when contracting landscaping?" and<br>"what areas are cleared when we pay for 'snow removal'?" Not only did he<br>not answer us, he was downright *nasty* when he did. A real<br>people-person, that one.<br><br>So we talked to our builder about it (he still owned about half the lots<br>in the neighborhood), and he said that if we wanted a homeowner-managed<br>HOA, we could have one. He even volunteered to foot the bill for the<br>lawyer to make the change. All we had to do was get the requisite<br>signatures from the current owners to make it so.<br><br>\<br><br>So how do you know what you have? Get hold of your Governing Documents<br>for your HOA. If you can't get them from the HOA themselves, get them<br>from your city or county (depending on where your HOA is located). The<br>CC&R will explain the structure of the HOA and who you can contact.<br><br>If your HOA actually exists and is unresponsive, I would highly suggest<br>contacting a real estate attorney in your area who specializes in HOA<br>law. For a small fee, they can probably assist with sending some<br>certified mail to the HOA demanding responses to communications. If they<br>refuse to respond, usually the CC&R and your local laws will have a<br>procedure to restructure a non-functioning HOA to one that does<br>function.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
