<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will any of the International Galaxy S8\'s work with the cell service<br>in the USA?**<br><br>As far as I can tell, the international version of the S8 should work<br>just fine on US carriers. However, your mileage may vary, as radios and<br>coverage vary around the country, and not all radio bands are supported<br>on non-US phones. So there may be some area of the country where the<br>international version of the S8 won't work. It could happen. We can't be<br>sure.<br><br>But on paper (and from testimony of others), they do. There was [[an<br>interesting thread over at Android<br>Central](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=83384a&url=https://forums.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-and-s8-plus/850482-us-model-samsung-s8-plus-better-than-international-version.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="androidcentral.com"}]{.qlink_container} where there was<br>disagreement over whether or not the international version of the S8<br>does work in the US, but the general story seems to be yes.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
