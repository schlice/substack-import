<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, aircraft noise, first of all, is controlled by the FAA, not the<br>local police.<br><br>Aircraft must fly at a minimum above 500 feet AGL, so in general, noise<br>shouldn\'t be a terrible concern. But if it is, try to get the tail<br>number of the aircraft and contact your local FAA office. They can check<br>to ensure that the aircraft meets noise regulations.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
