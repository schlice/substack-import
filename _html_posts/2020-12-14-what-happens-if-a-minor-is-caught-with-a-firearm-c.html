Also<br>what if a minor carries concealed on private property when the owner<br>gave the minor permission to carry?**<br><br>*(Firearms question --- answers apply to the US only)*<br><br>Regardless of whether in public or in private, concealed or not, local<br>laws regarding possession of a firearm by a juvenile will take<br>precedence. These laws will dictate when and where a juvenile may<br>possess a firearm in all instances.<br><br>Since all states are different, I'll give you the details for Florida,<br>since I happen to have those in front of me. Here, a juvenile (under 18<br>years old) is not allowed to possess a firearm other than an unloaded<br>firearm in the juvenile's home. "Possess" means "to have in one's<br>possession" which means to hold or carry, concealed or open.<br><br>One exception to this general rule is that a juvenile can usually<br>possess a firearm under one of the following conditions:<br><br>1.  The juvenile is engaged in a lawful hunting activity and is:<br>    1.  At least 16 years of age; or<br>    2.  Under 16 years of age and supervised by an adult.<br>2.  The juvenile is engaged in a lawful marksmanship competition or<br>    practice or other lawful recreational shooting activity and is:<br>    1.  At least 16 years of age; or<br>    2.  Under 16 years of age and supervised by an adult who is acting<br>        with the consent of the juvenile's parent or guardian.<br>3.  The firearm is unloaded and is being transported by the minor<br>    directly to or from an event authorized in bullets 1 or 2.<br><br>(Source: Fl Stat 790.22)<br><br>Possessing a firearm by a juvenile in Florida is a first-degree<br>misdemeanor. Harsher penalties apply to a second or subsequent violation<br>of the same statute, which then are classified as a third-degree felony.<br><br>These crimes are handled by the juvenile justice system. For a first<br>offense, the juvenile can be ordered to serve a period of detention of<br>up to three days in a secure juvenile detention facility, and the<br>juvenile must perform 100 hours of community service.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
