<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In America, we also have pay-as-you-go wireless. It also<br>consists of \"loading\" or \"reloading\" your phone with certain numbers<br>of \"minutes\" or \"days\" depending on the carrier.\<br>\<br>People like the convenience of pay-as-you-go phones. No contracts, no<br>long-term service agreements, just fill the phone as you need it and<br>nothing more. You can even buy the refill cards with cash, so there\'s<br>no paper trail. A popular choice for criminal activities (in the<br>vernacular, these would be called \"burner\" phones). However, even<br>those phones can be traced back to the store from which they were<br>purchased, and if a credit card was used, that information can also be<br>retrieved, and the purchaser can be found.\<br>\<br>However, if you compute out the cost per minute, you find that the<br>pay-as-you-go plans are much more expensive than contract plans,<br>especially now that most US-based carriers have switched to charging for<br>MBs of data instead of minutes; most plans that charge per MB have<br>unlimited voice and SMS included.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
