<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I don't understand your question. What a criminal does to my mother has<br>no bearing on the existence of God.<br><br>Yes, bad things happen to good people. No, I don't understand where<br>everyone has gotten the crazy idea that believing in God makes all bad<br>things go away. I don't understand where people have gotten the idea<br>that God is supposed to make all bad things stop. I don't understand the<br>idea that God is somehow beholden to act in the way people think he<br>should act, or expect him to act. And I have no idea how you think that<br>this is logical:<br><br>- If I were God, I'd make all bad things go away.<br>- Therefore, if God exists, all bad things should go away.<br>- Bad things happen.<br>- Therefore, God does not exist.<br><br>God acts as God acts. Man acts as man acts. Don't hold God to man's<br>rules. God doesn't hold you to his. He gives you the choice to follow<br>his rules. That's called "free will," by the way.<br><br>But he offers something way better than anything you can possibly<br>imagine if you do.<br><br>Eternal life.<br><br>It's something worth considering before you do whatever you were<br>planning on doing next.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Imagine someone raped your mother and killed her brutally. Would you<br>wish that God exists?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
