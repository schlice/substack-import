For<br>example, the facility still must provide basic security measures like<br>lockable doors, and if they failed to do this, they can still be held to<br>account for that failure. If they have a lockable lobby which is only<br>accessible to tenants, and someone besides a tenant gained access to<br>that lobby, they can be held responsible for that failure.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
