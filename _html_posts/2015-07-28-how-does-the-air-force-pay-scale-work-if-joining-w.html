<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Basically, everyone of any particular rank and time in<br>service is paid the same. You can look up the military officer pay scale<br>online. It changes annually with COLA (Cost Of Living Allowance)<br>changes.\<br>\<br>Your degree would probably cause you to be placed in a specific AFSC<br>(Air Force Speciality Code), which is your job function. Your job<br>function may have certain extra pay categories, and potential bonuses.\<br>\<br>Talk to your recruiter to get more specifics about what job you would<br>likely be doing and what bonuses or extra pay are<br>offered.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
