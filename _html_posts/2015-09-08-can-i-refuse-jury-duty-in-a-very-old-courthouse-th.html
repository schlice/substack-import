<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I get where you\'re going. Understand it\'s activism, and<br>regardless of what you\'re trying to accomplish, you\'re still refusing<br>to go to jury duty.\<br>\<br>You won\'t be excused. You will be cited (which is what you\'re going<br>for), and you can raise the affirmative defense of substandard<br>conditions in the courthouse and make the case something not about jury<br>duty, but more about the conditions in the courthouse.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
