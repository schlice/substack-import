<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: Trump is wrong, but so is Kaepernick.<br><br>Longer answer: Trump is wrong. This country welcomes free speech, even<br>if it's speech you don't agree with. That includes both Kaepernick's<br>speech and Trump's speech as well. If you allow Kaepernick to express<br>his views, you have to allow Trump to do the same. However, the US is<br>the most inclusive, most welcoming country in the world. No other<br>country is quite as easy to become a citizen as ours is. We (used to)<br>welcome dissenting speech, and people who question and think generally<br>seek out those with whom they disagree to engage in healthy,<br>thought-provoking debate. We have become so sensitive in this country,<br>we can no longer engage in debate because we fear upsetting someone. We<br>have done our children a disservice by teaching them that they have the<br>right to never be offended. Nevertheless, Trump, in trying to spin up<br>his base, is actually portraying the wrong message to the nation, and to<br>the world. I'm sorry Trumpers, but he's wrong on this one.<br><br>Kaepernick is wrong as well.<br><br>1.  While he has the right to express his opinion, it is disrespectful<br>    and based on lies.<br>2.  Also, the NFL is wrong in allowing this nonsense to go on during a<br>    football game.<br><br>Let's address point 1. Kaepernick is sitting during the National Anthem<br>to protest police treatment of blacks in this country. Groups like the<br>ACLU, Black Lives Matter, and the Obama administration parrot this<br>narrative.<br><br>*EXCEPT IT'S COMPLETELY WRONG*.<br><br>The chief conceit of the Black Lives Matter movement is that the most<br>dangerous thing in the life of a young black man is a racist police<br>officer. This is a lie. To be clear, this is not a factual error, or<br>a misstatement. A lie is *intentionally misrepresenting the truth to<br>gain some advantage or express an opinion that would not otherwise be<br>served by the truth.* That is what we have here.<br><br>If you do not believe that Black Lives Matter is lying to you, take<br>literally five minutes out of your day and get the facts:<br><br>[https://youtu.be/UQCQFH5wOJo(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=deeb13&url=https://youtu.be/UQCQFH5wOJo){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>As you can see, there is no government agency in this country that is<br>more dedicated to the lives of black people than the police. When a 911<br>call comes in, the operator does not ask the color of the person's skin<br>before dispatching officers. Officers go towards the gunshots,<br>regardless of who fired them. The whole foundation of the Black Lives<br>Matter movement is a lie. And Kaepernick is wasting his stage<br>protesting *that?* This is, indeed, sad.<br><br>If you want to protest something, protest the fact that illegal<br>immigrants *do* take jobs from honest American citizens, because<br>employers get away with hiring them, and then underpaying them because<br>they don't take taxes out of their pay. The government does nothing<br>about this. Protest the fact that Americans step on and burn the flag as<br>a form of "protest" and "free speech." "If you want a symbolic gesture,<br>don\'t *burn* the flag; *wash* it."\[1\](#xezzw){#cite-xezzw<br>.citation_link} In other words, *be the change you want to see in the<br>world. Protests are great, but get off your butt and* ***do something<br>about it.***<br><br>William McRaven, Chancellor of the University of Texas System (a former<br>Navy SEAL) sent the following regarding Kaepernick's actions (emphasis<br>mine):<br><br>> Honoring the flag does not imply that the republic for which it stands<br>> is perfect. Far from it, honoring the flag is our collective<br>> commitment that we will constantly attempt to get better as a nation,<br>> to improve as a people, and to use the freedoms we have been given to<br>> make the earth a better place.<br>><br>> I spent 37 years defending freedom of speech and freedom of<br>> expression. Nothing is more important to this democracy. Nothing!<br>> However, while no one should be compelled to stand, **they should<br>> recognize that by sitting in protest to the flag they are<br>> disrespecting everyone who sacrificed to make this country what it is<br>> today --- as imperfect as it might be.**<br>><br>> Those that believe the flag represents oppression should remember all<br>> the Americans who fought to eliminate bigotry, racism, sexism,<br>> imperialism, communism, and terrorism. The flag rode with the Buffalo<br>> Soldiers of the 9th, 10th, 24th and 25th Calvary and Infantry<br>> Regiments. It was carried by the suffragists down the streets of New<br>> York City. It flew with the Tuskegee Airmen of WWII. It was planted in<br>> the fields where Cesar Chavez spoke. It marched with Martin Luther<br>> King Jr. It rocketed into space on the shoulder patches of women,<br>> gays, Hispanic, Asian and African American astronauts. Today it waves<br>> high over the White House. **It is a flag for everyone, of every<br>> color, of every race, of every creed, and of every orientation, but<br>> the privilege of living under this flag does not come without cost.<br>> Nor should it come without respect.**<br>><br>> The nation and everything it strives for is embodied in the American<br>> flag. We strive to be more inclusive. We strive to be more<br>> understanding. We strive to fix the problems that plague our society.<br>><br>> But in striving to do so, we must have a common bond; some symbol that<br>> reminds us of our past struggles and propels us to a brighter, more<br>> enlightened future.\[2\](#nrRbP){#cite-nrRbP .citation_link}<br><br>Sitting to protest the flag disrespects everyone who has ever fought for<br>the ideals for which it stands. Sitting to protest ideas which are wrong<br>just makes you look stupid as well as disrespectful. No one is saying<br>you don't have the right to do it. We're just saying that doing so is<br>not without consequence.<br><br>And speaking of allowing you to do it, let's talk about the NFL. People<br>tune in to the NFL because they want to watch *football*. They tune<br>in to Monday Night Football (and now Sunday and Thursday) because they<br>want to be *entertained*. They want to escape from the stresses of the<br>day and relax watching a non-political sporting match. They really don't<br>want to see political protests during a football game. Yes, players are<br>entitled to their free speech, **but there are consequences for every<br>action you take**. I've taught my kids that since they were very little.<br>Some consequences are good (get good grades and maybe get to go out for<br>ice cream), and some are bad (get bad grades and lose screen time). But<br>there are always consequences for every action. Just because you make<br>political speech does not shield you from consequences. I know plenty of<br>people who will no longer watch football because of this nonsense, and I<br>am included in that bunch. I'll watch *theScore* on my phone and get<br>score updates over Twitter. I don't need to watch even more political<br>drama on TV.<br><br>The NFL, by allowing these charades to go on *during a football game,*<br>risks alienating the very people who pay the salaries that allow<br>people like Kaepernick to have the stage to make those protests. In<br>other words, the NFL risks losing customers over this. If they are<br>more interested in being politically correct than increasing market<br>share and keeping happy customers, then I am more interested in ***DOING<br>ANYTHING ELSE BESIDES WASTING BRAIN CELLS WATCHING THEIR SHOW.***<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-xezzw){.citation_index} [[Norman Thomas Quotes at<br>BrainyQuote.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=41147e&url=http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/n/normanthom101644.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="brainyquote.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-nrRbP){.citation_index}<br>[http://www.allenbwest.com/wp-con\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=614db2&url=http://www.allenbwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Memo-to-ADs-and-Presidents_US-flag.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="allenbwest.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
