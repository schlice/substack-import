<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I believe the draft is unconstitutional because of the 13th Amendment.<br>Is this fair?**<br><br>You are welcome to your opinion. But the Supreme Court disagrees.<br><br>Basically, the court already weighed this decision and balanced the 13th<br>Amendment against Article I, Section 8, which gives Congress the power<br>to "raise and support armies" (Clause 12)<br><br>Additionally, the Necessary and Proper clause (Clause 18) permits the<br>government to "make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for<br>carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers\.\"<br><br>The court has interpreted these two clauses together to find that<br>conscription (i.e. the draft) is Constitutional and is part of Congress'<br>enumerated powers. The intent of the 13th Amendment was never to abolish<br>the draft, and serving in the military, even against your will, is not<br>involuntary servitude. In [[*Butler v<br>Perry*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=db5b73&url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/240/328/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="justia.com"}]{.qlink_container} (240 US 328 \1916\), the<br>Supreme Court wrote:<br><br>> \The 13th Amendment\ introduced no novel doctrine with respect of<br>> services always treated as exceptional, and certainly was not intended<br>> to interdict enforcement of those duties which individuals owe to the<br>> state, such as services in the army, militia, on the jury, etc. The<br>> great purpose in view was liberty under the protection of effective<br>> government, not the destruction of the latter by depriving it of<br>> essential powers.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
