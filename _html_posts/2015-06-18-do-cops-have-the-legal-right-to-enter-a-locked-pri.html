<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The police have the need to enter the building to ensure<br>everyone is safe. The police can even claim exigent circumstances and<br>forcibly enter into the building if they feel that someone\'s life may<br>be in danger, if they say they heard someone screaming or they say they<br>heard someone calling for help. Exigent circumstances allow the police<br>to enter places that they normally would not, so it is used<br>judiciously.\<br>\<br>In this case, an agent of the compay allowed them entrance. The doors<br>opened, the agent of the company left, and the police walked in. No one<br>stopped them. The police can rightly claim that an agent of the company<br>opened the doors and did not stop them from entering. This, along with<br>the obvious public safety concern of ensuring that the 911 call was<br>actually an accident and not someone seriously in trouble, is enough<br>legal basis for the police to enter the building.\<br>\<br>If the employee who opened the doors and did not stop the officers from<br>entering is at fault according to company policy, the company is within<br>its rights to terminate him.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
