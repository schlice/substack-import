<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do all black lives matter? While on the outside BLM appears to be a<br>social justice organization for the African-American, they also support<br>the choice to abort African-American babies! Are they not important<br>black lives?**<br><br>*(Prepare yourself for the unpopular, but correct, answer)*<br><br>This is the problem when you have an organization whose name is also a<br>slogan, an idea. You can *conflate* the organization with the slogan.<br><br>Like the disingenuous question asked of Johnathan Isaac during one of<br>the first NBA games played in the Disney World bubble, when he did not<br>kneel or wear a BLM T-shirt: "We noticed you didn't kneel or wear a BLM<br>shirt. Do black lives matter?"<br><br>He answered, "Absolutely I believe Black lives matter. Kneeling while<br>wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt doesn't go hand in hand with<br>supporting Black lives. \...\ I don't think kneeling or putting on a<br>T-shirt for me personally is the answer. I feel like for me Black lives<br>are supported through the gospel. All lives are supported through the<br>gospel. We all have things that we do wrong. Sometimes it gets into a<br>place of pointing fingers. We all fall short of God's glory. Whoever<br>will humble themselves and seek God and repent of their sins, we can see<br>our mistakes and people's mistakes and evil in a different light. Racism<br>isn't the only thing that plagues our society, our nation, our world."<br><br>You can believe in the *slogan* that "Black lives matter" **while<br>simultaneously believing that the *organization* Black Lives<br>Matter does not care about Black lives at all.**<br><br>You might think you're supporting an organization that believes in<br>social justice for Blacks, and on the outside, they do appear that way.<br>But you would be wrong. Black Lives Matter, the organization, has<br>one overriding goal: the destruction of America. And they'll be the<br>first ones to tell you.<br><br>> Co-founder Patrisse Cullors has been surprisingly open about the<br>> group\'s real agenda for years. \"We are trained Marxists,\" she<br>> warned. \"We are super-versed on ideological theories.\" During a<br>> candid interview in 2015, [[Cullors<br>> explained](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d314eb&url=https://nypost.com/2020/06/25/blm-co-founder-describes-herself-as-trained-marxist/){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="nypost.com"}]{.qlink_container} that BLM has \"really<br>> clear direction as to where we want to take this movement. I don\'t<br>> believe it\'s going to fizzle out,\" she said, somewhat prophetically.<br>> \"It just gets stronger\...\" And violence is just one way they intend<br>> to be heard.<br>><br>> \"If this country doesn\'t give us what we want,\" Greater New York<br>> Black Lives Matter [[President Hawk Newsome<br>> warned](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8baf69&url=https://www.foxnews.com/media/black-lives-matter-leader-burn-down-system){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="foxnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}, \"then we will burn down<br>> this system and replace it.\" But it might surprise the majority of<br>> Americans to know that \"what they want\" isn\'t an end to police<br>> brutality or racism. It\'s an end to freedom, speech, religion, and<br>> true equality. \"All you shopkeepers putting signs in your stores, you<br>> schoolteachers programming your students to lock arms, you men and<br>> women of the cloth preaching about unity, you civic leaders urging<br>> community action\... \beware\,\" [[Brent Bozell<br>> writes](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=32d1a8&url=https://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/l-brent-bozell-iii/bozell-real-story-black-lives-matter-marxist-anti-family-radicals){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="cnsnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}.

My mental well-being<br>isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I<br>wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is<br>un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m<br>wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,<br>not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,<br>you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.<br>Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be<br>followed by a block and a mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this<br>immediately and with no compunction. You have been warned.
