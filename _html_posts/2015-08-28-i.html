<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If your ultimate goal is to be part of NCIS, you have a<br>few options.\<br>\<br>As [[Al<br>Saibini](https://www.quora.com/profile/Al-Saibini)]{.qlink_container}<br>already told you, NCIS is mostly civilians. There really isn\'t a need<br>to have military members staff that organization, as it operates outside<br>of typical military channels (to maintain objectivity, this is<br>necessary). It reports up through the Director of NCIS, directly to the<br>Secretary of the Navy.\<br>\<br>You can get that real-world police experience in civilian law<br>enforcement. You can absolutely go to college, join a police department,<br>serve there for a few years, and if you\'re still interested, apply for<br>NCIS.\<br>\<br>You can also get that real-world experience in the military, which<br>allows you to combine some of your efforts. The military has a few<br>advantages here, as Al also mentioned. If you enlist, you can use your<br>GI Bill benefits to put you through college while you serve. If you<br>enlist in the Navy, you may be able to work somewhere in NCIS while<br>you\'re active duty, which would only bolster your chances of making it<br>in as an investigator.\<br>\<br>If you decide to enlist in the Air Force, you can be assigned as an Air<br>Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) agent while on Active Duty.<br>The bulk of AFOSI agents are active duty. The second largest group of<br>AFOSI agents is civilians, just as in NCIS. AFOSI agents train at the<br>Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Quantico,<br>VA.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
