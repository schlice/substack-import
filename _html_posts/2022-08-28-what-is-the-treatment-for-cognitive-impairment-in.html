<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>"Cognitive impairment" is an umbrella term which means changes to a wide<br>variety of high-level brain functions including your ability to learn<br>and remember information, organize, plan and problem-solve, focus,<br>maintain and shift attention, understand and use language, accurately<br>perceive the environment, and perform calculations.<br><br>Certain functions including general intellect, long-term (remote)<br>memory, conversational skill and reading comprehension are not likely to<br>change due to MS.<br><br>For most people with MS, cognitive changes (should they occur) will be<br>mild and will only affect one or two of these brain functions. For some<br>people, the cognitive changes will affect more brain functions and will<br>be more severe.<br><br>There aren't really medications to treat cognitive impairment, though<br>some medications can help with some specific cognitive functions.<br>Generally, treatment for cognitive impairment is *therapy*, called<br>cognitive rehabilitation. This includes a number of disciplines, but<br>generally grouped into two categories: *restorative* activities to help<br>restore lost cognitive function, and *compensatory* activities to "work<br>around" the lost cognition:<br><br>> Restorative activities can include learning and memory exercises:<br>><br>> - Combine modes of learning: You will be more likely to remember<br>>   something if you "see it, say it, hear it, write it, do it." It's<br>>   okay to give yourself extra time.<br>> - Repeat & verify: Repeat what you hear and verify that it is<br>>   correct to improve your attention and memory.<br>> - Spaced rehearsal: Repeat and practice information at intervals<br>>   spread out over time to improve your ability to store information.<br>> - Build associations: Use memory aids! For example, to remember<br>>   the name of someone you just met, associate her/his name with a<br>>   friend or family member of the same name, or with a place, color or<br>>   event that sounds like the new name.<br>><br>> **Compensatory activities that help make up for functions that are no<br>> longer working well may include:**<br>><br>> - Consolidate and centralize! Designate one place in your home as<br>>   the "Grand Central" information center. Include your master<br>>   calendar, mail, bills, phone messages, to-do lists, keys, wallet,<br>>   shopping lists and more.<br>> - Plan: Post a calendar large enough to display everyone's<br>>   appointments, activities and social engagements, and reminders! Keep<br>>   pens or markers hanging right beside it. Or use a computer program<br>>   set up with reminders for routine tasks (synchronize it with your<br>>   mobile devices so you have your appointments with you while on the<br>>   go).<br>> - Record: Dictate your to-do list, notes or other things to<br>>   remember on a digital voice recorder (available on many phones).<br>> - Remind: Use checklists, the alarm on your watch or phone, your<br>>   kitchen timer, and more.<br>> - Eliminate or remove yourself from distractions. Turn off the TV,<br>>   music and whatever else is "on" when speaking with someone in person<br>>   or on the phone. Background visual and noise distractions can make<br>>   learning or remembering more difficult. If you can't eliminate the<br>>   distraction (for example, people talking at a party) then ask, "Can<br>>   we talk in a quieter place?"<br>> - Take a break. If you are having difficulty concentrating, take a<br>>   breath and refresh.<br>> - Do one thing at a time. Avoid switching back and forth from one<br>>   topic or task to another. Finish or find an appropriate stopping<br>>   place in what you're working on before you switch to something<br>>   else.\[1\](#Feeip){#cite-Feeip .citation_link}<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What is the treatment for cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-Feeip){.citation_index} [[Cognitive<br>Changes](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=869adf&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms/Cognitive-Changes){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
