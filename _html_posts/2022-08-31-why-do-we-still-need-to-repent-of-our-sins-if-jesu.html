<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is an excellent question!<br><br>I think part of the explanation comes from *point of view.*<br><br>- From God's point of view, our justification has forgiven all of our<br>  sins, *past, present,* and *future*, as He is timeless and sees our<br>  entire life before Him, all at once. For God, everything is *now*.<br>- But for us, we haven't sinned in the future yet. So God's<br>  justification, *from our perspective*, is forgiveness of our past and<br>  present sin, and something like the legal grounds upon which our<br>  future sins can be forgiven.<br><br>When we sin in the future, we return to God and ask again for<br>forgiveness. However, it's not a new justification. We've been justified<br>once, but we're *re-applying* our justification to our new present.<br><br>We therefore approach the sin with a different heart. When the unsaved<br>confess their sins, they do so with the longing and desperation of<br>someone seeking justification. But a *believer* confesses sin as someone<br>who retains the assurance of justification, and who comes *gladly* to<br>Christ, knowing that our salvation is assured, and that His love and<br>forgiveness is everlasting. Even in our confession of sin, we glorify<br>God.<br><br>Let's take that a step further, because John actually discusses this<br>"future justification" thing:<br><br>> But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship<br>> with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from<br>> all sin.<br>><br>> If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is<br>> not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will<br>> forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. --- 1 John<br>> 1:7--9 NIV<br><br>So let's break this down. He starts by saying that if we walk in the<br>light, the blood of Jesus purifies us from all sin. So therefore, if we<br>walk in the light, Jesus' blood continually cleanses us from our sin.<br>This is that "future justification" we were discussing.<br><br>But what does it mean to "walk in the light?" He goes on to explain it.<br>He says that if we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves. In<br>other words, "walking in the light" does not mean that we are without<br>sin. Walking in the light, therefore, means that you are aware of your<br>sin. The "light" illuminates your sin, and you see it. Christ's<br>forgiveness doesn't inoculate us against sin, nor is it a<br>"pre-forgiveness" for all sin, or we could then sin with abandon and we<br>would be automatically forgiven, and this doesn't seem like what the<br>Biblical writers were saying at all. Clearly here, there is a<br>recognition that we are sinners and that *we repent* of that sin (we<br>turn away). Yet, we are still human, and we still sin. "Walking in the<br>light" shows us our sin.<br><br>So what do we do with what we see? He goes on to say that if we confess<br>our sins, God is faithful and forgives our sins. Therefore, "walking in<br>the light" must also include recognition that we're sinners and<br>confession of that sin.<br><br>So I think the message here is pretty clear. In order to "walk in the<br>light" of the salvation we have been given, we need to continually<br>recognize that we are sinners, and acknowledge that Christ died for our<br>sin and His blood washes us clean. I think a little gratitude in that<br>prayer is probably a good thing as well, as I don't think I could ever<br>thank God enough for rescuing me from where I was and offering His<br>salvation to me.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why do we still need to repent of our sins if Jesus died for our sins?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
