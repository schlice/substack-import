<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**When the police states that they are using an EXIF Viewer to analyze a<br>video then report the data, how accurate is the information as it is<br>presented in a criminal case and can it be questioned?**<br><br>To answer this question, you have to know what EXIF data is. EXIF is<br>Exchangeable Information File Format and is what we refer to as<br>"metadata." Metadata is "data about data."<br><br>There are two types of video EXIF data:<br><br>> 1.  Automatically collected video metadata from software or a device<br>>     like your video camera. It stores camera-created information such<br>>     as aperture, shutter speed, GPS coordinates and more in the video<br>>     file. Most EXIF data cannot be \easily\ edited after capture.<br>>     Two exceptions are correcting a camera's date/time setting and<br>>     adding GPS data.<br>> 2.  Manually written video metadata which provides information about<br>>     the video content. This can be transcripts of dialogue or<br>>     conversations and other text<br>>     descriptions.\[1\](#IDSdW){#cite-IDSdW .citation_link}<br><br>The EXIF data is exactly as accurate as it was when the police saw it.<br>Unless they're using digital forensic specialists, they would not know<br>whether or not the EXIF data was altered.<br><br>Any evidence can be questioned. The defense attorney would want the<br>video data examined by his or her own digital forensic specialist to<br>look for signs that the EXIF data (or the video itself) was tampered<br>with or edited.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-IDSdW){.citation_index} [[Metadata For Video -<br>VideoUniversity](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ee8f22&url=https://www.videouniversity.com/articles/metadata-for-video/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="videouniversity.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
