<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it possible to sue Trump for the deaths caused by his delayed<br>actions regarding Coronavirus?**<br><br>In the United States, you can sue anyone for anything. The question now<br>comes down to whether or not you have a snowball's chance in The Hot<br>Place of prevailing.<br><br>And the answer to that question is it's pretty unlikely.<br><br>You would likely sue for something along the lines of wrongful death or<br>something similar. However, in order to prove wrongful death, **you have<br>to show that Trump wrongfully caused someone's death** by intentionally<br>delaying actions regarding Coronavirus. You would have to show that his<br>delays actually caused death, and that the death was *proximate* to the<br>delay (in other words, if it couldn't have been likely that he could<br>have imagined that his actions would directly have resulted in the<br>death, then it's probably too far down the causal chain in order to be<br>actionable).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
