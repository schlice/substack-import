<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Jail? I'm pretty sure that not reporting a change in income is not a<br>criminal offense.<br><br>However, reporting your new job will trigger a review. As a participant<br>in the Housing Choice Voucger Program (formerly Section 8), you are<br>required to fill out a "Family Reporting Form" within 10 days of an<br>income change. Five months is a bit long. Your residential coordinator<br>will review your Family Reporting Form and determine if and when a<br>change in rent is required, and what you owe for the five months you<br>didn't report.<br><br>At worst, you may lose eligibility for the program, but that's about the<br>worst that would happen. I don't think you're going to jail. Did you<br>fail to report because you *intended to defraud the state*? No, I didn't<br>think so. So since there is no criminal intent, I don't think that a<br>criminal charge would stick, in my opinion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
