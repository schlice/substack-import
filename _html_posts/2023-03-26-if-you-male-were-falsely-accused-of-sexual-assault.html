<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let me first answer the question as it was asked, and then I'll answer<br>the hypothetical you were *trying* to ask.<br><br>\<br><br>If I was falsely accused, you'd still have to prove beyond a reasonable<br>doubt that I did what I was arrested and charged with doing, and that's<br>a tall order if it didn't really happen. A false accusation isn't<br>getting me sent to jail; it's most likely going to get me fired from my<br>job, but won't get me sent to jail, and certainly not for ten years. So<br>this particular scenario (a false accusation leads to jail time) is<br>really unlikely. The false accusation would have to have enough credible<br>evidence to get me arrested, and if the accusation is truly false, there<br>wouldn't be enough evidence to arrest me.<br><br>\<br><br>Now, you were probably trying to ask if a false accusation that did get<br>me arrested and convicted were to happen, which would I prefer. So<br>as I already said, this is going to be a really unlikely hypothetical,<br>but I'll play along to answer the question.<br><br>Clearly, since testicles produce bodily hormones, removal of the<br>testicles would sentence me to a lifetime of hormone replacement<br>therapy, but on the upside I wouldn't have to do TSEs anymore. If you<br>don't know what I mean by that, then you probably don't have testicles<br>of your own.<br><br>So yeah, much better to go to prison; considering the prisons are so<br>overcrowded, with my good behavior I'd probably only do a third of that<br>sentence inside, and the rest at home.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
