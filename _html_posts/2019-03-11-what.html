<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What\'s the worst that can happen if I run for president at 31 years<br>old? Can I challenge the constitution?**<br><br>Perhaps you're unaware of what "run for president" means.<br><br>While it does involve a lot of public announcements that you're running<br>for president, in order to "officially" enter the race, you have to<br>register as a candidate with the Federal Election Commission.<br><br>When the FEC denies your registration because you don't meet the basic<br>Constitutional requirements, you can sue them claiming that the 35 year<br>age limit is unconstitutional (even though it's in the Constitution, but<br>I digress).<br><br>It will probably take years before your case fully makes it through the<br>court system, and by the time it's all said and done, you'll probably be<br>35 anyway, so you won't have standing any more.<br><br>Or you can just work on your personal brand for the next four years and<br>by the time you're 35, you'll be ready to roll.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
