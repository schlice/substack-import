<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>An excellent question! I wonder if there's any historical document which<br>records just such an event...<br><br>Oh wait...<br><br>Let us turn to the book of Jonah, please, Chapter 1, Verse 1. To try to<br>make this a little easier for the reader to follow along, I won't quote<br>from a Bible version full of thee's and thou's. Instead, I'll quote from<br>the New International Reader's Version.<br><br>This, by the way, is the entirety of Chapter 1.<br><br>> 1 A message from the Lord came to Jonah, the son of Amittai. The Lord<br>> said, 2 "Go to the great city of Nineveh. Preach against it. The sins<br>> of its people have come to my attention."<br>><br>> 3 But Jonah ran away from the Lord. He headed for Tarshish. So he went<br>> down to the port of Joppa. There he found a ship that was going to<br>> Tarshish. He paid the fare and went on board. Then he sailed for<br>> Tarshish. He was running away from the Lord.<br>><br>> 4 But the Lord sent a strong wind over the Mediterranean Sea. A wild<br>> storm came up. It was so wild that the ship was in danger of breaking<br>> apart. 5 All the sailors were afraid. Each one cried out to his own<br>> god for help. They threw the ship's contents into the sea. They were<br>> trying to make the ship lighter.<br>><br>> But Jonah had gone below deck. There he lay down and fell into a deep<br>> sleep. 6 The captain went down to him and said, "How can you sleep?<br>> Get up and call out to your god for help! Maybe he'll pay attention to<br>> what's happening to us. Then we won't die."<br>><br>> 7 Here is what the sailors said to one another. "Someone is to blame<br>> for getting us into all this trouble. Come. Let's cast lots to find<br>> out who it is." So they did. And Jonah was picked. 8 They asked him,<br>> "What terrible thing have you done to bring all this trouble on us?<br>> Tell us. What do you do for a living? Where do you come from? What is<br>> your country? What people do you belong to?"<br>><br>> 9 He answered, "I'm a Hebrew. I worship the Lord. He is the God of<br>> heaven. He made the sea and the dry land."<br>><br>> 10 They found out he was running away from the Lord. That's because he<br>> had told them. Then they became terrified. So they asked him, "How<br>> could you do a thing like that?"<br>><br>> 11 The sea was getting rougher and rougher. So they asked him, "What<br>> should we do to you to make the sea calm down?"<br>><br>> 12 "Pick me up and throw me into the sea," he replied. "Then it will<br>> become calm. I know it's my fault that this terrible storm has come on<br>> you."<br>><br>> 13 But the men didn't do what he said. Instead, they did their best to<br>> row back to land. But they couldn't. The sea got even rougher than<br>> before. 14 Then they cried out to the Lord. They prayed, "Please,<br>> Lord, don't let us die for taking this man's life. After all, he might<br>> not be guilty of doing anything wrong. So don't hold us responsible<br>> for killing him. Lord, you always do what you want to." 15 Then they<br>> took Jonah and threw him overboard. And the stormy sea became calm. 16<br>> The men saw what had happened. Then they began to have great respect<br>> for the Lord. They offered a sacrifice to him. And they made promises<br>> to him.<br>><br>> 17 Now the Lord sent a huge fish to swallow Jonah. And Jonah was in<br>> the belly of the fish for three days and three nights. --- Jonah<br>> 1:1--17 NIRV<br><br>So yes, if you take the Bible at face-value, sometimes God calls you to<br>do things you don't want to do. In Jonah's case, it was to go to the<br>city of Nineveh and preach against their wickedness.<br><br>Think about that. It's like today, God told you to go to Vegas and<br>preach against their sin and vice. Would you want to do that? Yeah, me<br>neither. But God told Jonah to go to Nineveh and do just that.<br><br>And Jonah said, "Yeah, thanks but no thanks." And so he ran down to the<br>wharf at the Port of Joppa and boarded a ship bound for Tarshish (clear<br>on the other side of the Mediterranean). In other words (and as<br>illuminated by the text), Jonah was trying to run away from God.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-4c03a1e6677e0e39a1eb762b88b653ac){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-4c03a1e6677e0e39a1eb762b88b653ac" master_w="234"<br>master_h="151"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Except for the pesky fact that *you can't run away from God.* There's<br>nowhere that you can go that is "away" from God.<br><br>While God may not be causing giant fish to swallow us up for three days<br>or storms to suddenly pick up and then subside just as suddenly in the<br>middle of the Mediterranean, He still is displeased when we do not<br>follow Him. But He doesn't routinely punish us that way any longer, as<br>we are all saved by the blood of Christ. Our sins already have their<br>forgiveness through Christ. He does punish us (what good father doesn't<br>discipline their child?), just not in the same way as He used to, before<br>Christ came.<br><br>The Bible says this about our current discipline:<br><br>> As you endure this divine discipline, remember that God is treating<br>> you as his own children. Whoever heard of a child who was never<br>> disciplined? If God doesn't discipline you as He does all of His<br>> children, it means that you are illegitimate and are not really His<br>> child after all. Since we respect our earthly fathers who disciplined<br>> us, should we not all the more cheerfully submit to the discipline of<br>> our heavenly Father and live forever? For our earthly fathers<br>> disciplined us for a few years, doing the best they knew how. But<br>> God's discipline is always right and good for us because it means we<br>> will share in his holiness. No discipline is enjoyable while it is<br>> happening---it is painful! But afterward there will be a quiet harvest<br>> of right living for those who are trained in this way. --- Hebrews<br>> 12:7--11 ESV<br><br>Note that God does not discipline *everyone*, but He disciplines *His<br>children*. Notice what the passage says: "If God doesn't discipline you<br>as He does all of His children, it means that you are illegitimate and<br>are not really His child after all." In other words, if you are not<br>being disciplined by God, you may not be one of His children. It says<br>that He disciplines all of His children, and some are not His children.<br><br>It also says that God's discipline is not eternal. There is a period of<br>not-enjoyable discipline, but then there is "a quiet harvest of right<br>living" for believers. This passage thus tells us that hope abounds,<br>even through suffering.<br><br>If I could sum it up, I'd use the lyrics of the song *Sunday's On The<br>Way* by Take 6:<br><br>> *So when problems try to bury you (six feet deep),\<br>> And make it hard for you to pray,\<br>> It may seem like that Friday night,\<br>> But Sunday's on the way.*<br><br>It may be tough while you're going through it, but believers have the<br>hope that our redemption is not far off. God is near to those who love<br>Him.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
