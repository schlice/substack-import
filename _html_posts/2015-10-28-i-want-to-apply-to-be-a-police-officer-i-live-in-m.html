<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If it\'s legal within the jurisdiction in which you are<br>applying and if it was legal for you to use it, it\'s not likely that<br>the organization would not hire you because of it.\<br>\<br>However, they can refuse if that\'s the decision they wish to make.\<br>\<br>It\'s entirely up to them. Even if it is legal, it is still illegal<br>under Federal law. Therefore, the organization, if it does any work<br>outside of that jurisdiction, can legally disqualify you under Federal<br>law.\<br>\<br>Ultimately, it\'s up to the department.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
