<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There's no way that someone with the wide array of businesses that Trump<br>has would ever be able to disentangle himself enough to avoid even the<br>appearance of potential conflicts of interest. And asking him to<br>liquidate all of his assets into a blind trust, in a buyer's market, is<br>something that no one would do. That would mean you'd be forcing Trump<br>to take a massive financial loss, and there is nothing in the<br>Constitution that requires blind trusts, nor requires business owners to<br>divest themselves of their businesses, nor requires them to lose<br>substantial sums of money, in order to become president.<br><br>I can't answer whether or not he would talk to his kids about his<br>businesses. None of us know that. And even if he did divest himself<br>completely from all of his businesses, liquidating them into a blind<br>trust, that trust would be run by his family. He'd never be able to<br>remove every shred of doubt that he would be completely out of the loop.<br><br>So for now, yes, you have to take him at his word. We elected him<br>president, so we should give him "enough rope to hang himself," as the<br>expression goes (relax, Secret Service, I didn't threaten the president,<br>nor did I suggest he hang himself. It's an expression, jeez).<br><br>And why didn't he provide his tax returns? Perhaps the question you<br>should be asking yourself is *why do other politicians provide theirs?*<br>Why are they so willing to provide tax returns? Is it because they're<br>"totally transparent" and want to show the American people just how<br>"honest" they are?<br><br>Ha, please.<br><br>How is it possible that Hillary can make a couple hundred thousand a<br>year from speaking engagements, but still have a personal net worth in<br>the millions? She's not supposed to be personally enriched by her<br>foundation, but yet there it is. Now I'm no Calculus teacher, but I<br>think someone isn't being completely honest. Not all of her assets are<br>accounted for.<br><br>In fact, politicians structure their personal finances so that they look<br>good on a 1040. They use tax-sheltered investments and other<br>non-reportable investment vehicles to "hide" their other sources of<br>income. They hire teams of tax attorneys and CPAs to assist them with<br>shuffling their assets so that the ultimate goal will be a squeaky-clean<br>1040. They provide just enough of their 1040 to satisfy the gullible<br>population. "See? I pay my taxes just like every other average<br>hard-working American."<br><br>Trump, being in business his whole life and not in politics, has never<br>done this. He has structured his finances to maximize profit and<br>minimize the amount of tax he was required to pay. Therefore, his tax<br>returns show all the cool tricks that rich people play to avoid paying<br>taxes. All perfectly legal, and when the IRS is asked, that's exactly<br>what they'll say (and they did). But not very flattering to your average<br>SJW out there. They already had enough ammo on him with the whole pussy<br>thing; did he really need to give them more when he was under no<br>obligation to do so? I think not. And so did a majority of states, since<br>they elected him without ever seeing his tax returns. Notice I didn't<br>say "a majority of people," because states elect the President, not<br>people.<br><br>He also shows things like hundreds of thousands of dollars of financial<br>losses, which also minimizes his tax burden (or on his one leaked 1040,<br>almost no tax at all). Even though that's the way the tax system works,<br>he was incorrectly accused of "dodging taxes," "not paying his fair<br>share," and worse, "being a bad businessman; I mean, look at those<br>losses!" There were explanations for the losses, and they checked out,<br>but that doesn't stop people from forming negative opinions based on<br>perfectly legal activity. Why would you intentionally inflict that on<br>yourself? He's going to have to live with the Orange Cheeto thing for<br>the rest of his life, and every reference to GHRITP will be associated<br>with him, and he underwent that willingly.<br><br>You gotta admit, the guy's got a pair if he's going to put himself<br>through that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-do-you-support-Donald-Trump-1/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
