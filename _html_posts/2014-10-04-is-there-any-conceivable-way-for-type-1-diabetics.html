<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> I\'m a university student diagnosed as a T1D at 7 years old & bothered<br>> by this question ever since. I\'ve been dead-set on joining the Navy<br>> for years. I\'m going to feel pretty purposeless if I have to finally<br>> give up completely what I\'ve always been so dedicated towards.<br><br>Unfortunately, diabetes is a [[disqualifying medical<br>condition](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3a3953&url=http://navy.army.com/info/join/medical){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="army.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>However, your drive and dedication can be put to other uses. You can<br>hire on with a government contractor who contracts with the Navy, still<br>do Navy work, but just not in uniform. The government has increasingly<br>been turning formerly military-only duties over to civilians following<br>the A-76 Outsourcing and Privatization cost-cutting measures implemented<br>several years ago.<br><br>And even if medical conditions disqualify you from military service (as<br>mine did after I joined), your life is not purposeless; you must believe<br>this. Even this has a purpose. You just don\'t see it yet. Please don\'t<br>feel like you\'re giving up your dream, just know that your purpose lies<br>elsewhere. You will still be fulfilled in life, it will just look a<br>little different.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
