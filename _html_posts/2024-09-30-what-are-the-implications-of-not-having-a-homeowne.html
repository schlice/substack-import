<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You could end up with "that neighbor."<br><br>You know the one. He has seven cars in front of his house, and only two<br>of them have wheels. He painted his house electric blue because he likes<br>blue, even though it totally looks out of place with the rest of the<br>houses in the neighborhood. And while I'm certain that the stuff he's<br>cooking is delicious to him, the smell is just God-awful.<br><br>In most cases, what he's doing is not illegal, so no one from the city<br>or county will help you address it.<br><br>But now, try to sell your house.<br><br>What's going to happen? *Fewer* people will want to buy your house<br>(especially for the price you're asking) because you live next door to<br>one of "those neighbors." So you'll have to reduce the price of your<br>house to get someone to buy it.<br><br>Congratulations, your "neighbor" just reduced the value of your house.<br><br>And for an investment which is usually the largest single investment any<br>American typically makes, no one wants the stupidity of their neighbors<br>to cost them money.<br><br>The HOA can address these issues quickly.<br><br>So the HOA doesn't preserve the value of your home by controlling what<br>you do. The HOA preserves the value of your home by controlling what<br>your *neighbors* do.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
