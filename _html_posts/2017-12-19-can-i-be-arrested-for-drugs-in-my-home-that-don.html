<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can I be arrested for drugs in my home that don\'t belong to me?<br><br>Laws vary by state, but in general, if no one fesses up to owning the<br>drugs, then yes, you can be arrested for illegal drugs in your home,<br>even if they don't belong to you.<br><br>You might find this surprising, but even people who are caught with<br>their own drugs in their own home will claim that the drugs do not<br>belong to them. As you can then imagine, most arresting officers are<br>unmoved by this claim. They will let the evidence stand as it is.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
