<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Cameras don't prevent people from doing anything. Cameras merely show<br>you what people are doing.<br><br>Legally, you can't prevent people from walking up your driveway. *But,<br>but, it's private property!* Yes it is. But you have a front door with a<br>walkway, a "Welcome" mat and a doorbell, so there is at least a<br>presumption that someone may approach your door and explain to you why<br>they are present on your property. They may have a legitimate need to be<br>present on your property. For example, police officers, while engaged in<br>their lawful duties, can approach and knock on your door. Delivery<br>drivers may do the same. Politicians or their agents, and religious<br>organizations, all have First Amendment protections allowing them to<br>knock on your door.<br><br>Certain facilities have expectations that visitors will never be<br>present. For example, warehouses likely are only visited by employees.<br>Warehouses have gated fences all around them, and only employees are<br>permitted to enter.<br><br>But houses, in neighborhoods, have at least a presumption that people<br>may enter the property to knock on the door or ring the doorbell so that<br>the property owner may determine whether or not there is a valid need<br>for them to be present on the property.<br><br>Once you have ascertained why they are present on your property, you can<br>determine if you want them to *remain* on your property. If you choose<br>to no longer permit them on your property, you may tell them to leave,<br>and they must vacate your property *poste haste*. Failing to do so is<br>considered trespassing and can be legally enforced.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
