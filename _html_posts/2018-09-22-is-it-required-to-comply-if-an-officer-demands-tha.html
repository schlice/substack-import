<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it required to comply if an officer demands that you step out of<br>your car at a traffic stop? What is the purpose of this command?**<br><br>The answer is yes; if an officer demands you exit the vehicle, you must<br>comply. If you fail to comply, you may find you end up with a shattered<br>driver's side window, a cut seat belt and various bruises from being<br>dragged out of your vehicle, but if you have to be dragged out of your<br>vehicle, you're going to jail, not just getting a ticket and going on<br>about your way.<br><br>> In [[Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U.S. 106<br>> (1977)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=215a5b&url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?as_sdt%3D4%252C33%26case%3D16533225265380952768%26hl%3Den%26q%3Dpolice%2Bmay%2Brequest%2Ba%2Bsuspect%2Bto%2Bstep%2Bout%2Bof%2Btheir%2Bvehicle%2Bduring%2Ba%2Blawful%2Btraffic%2Bstop){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container}, the Supreme Court of the<br>> United States held that where a driver commits a traffic offense and<br>> is subsequently pulled over by the police, the police may order the<br>> driver (and any occupants in the vehicle) to step out of the vehicle<br>> at *any*time - no questions asked. The rationale for this decision is<br>> best articulated by the New York Court of Appeals in [[People v.<br>> Robinson, 74 N.Y.2d 773, 774<br>> (1989)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a95d16&url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?as_sdt%3D4%252C33%26case%3D11492072550395741286%26hl%3Den%26q%3Dpolice%2Bmay%2Brequest%2Ba%2Bsuspect%2Bto%2Bstep%2Bout%2Bof%2Btheir%2Bvehicle%2Bduring%2Ba%2Blawful%2Btraffic%2Bstop){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container}, which held that<br>> constitutional rights are not violated where \"a driver is directed to<br>> step out briefly from a lawfully stopped and detained vehicle because<br>> the inherent and inordinate danger to investigating police officers in<br>> completing their authorized official responsibilities in such<br>> circumstances justifies that precautionary action.\"<br>><br>> In layman\'s terms, what all of this means, is that courts have sided<br>> with police officers and their ambiguous fears about their safety as<br>> compared to any constitutional rights that you may have to be free<br>> from police officers\' often times humiliating requests to step out of<br>> your car for seemingly no reason.\[1\](#YMWat){#cite-YMWat<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>The purpose, clearly, is not necessary to articulate. It could be<br>because you're acting cagey. It could be because you appear to be acting<br>unsafely. It could be because the officer thinks you may have been<br>drinking and wants to test you. It could be because he thinks you may be<br>a flight risk and it's safer to just take you out of the car. It could<br>be for *any reason at all*, but courts have clearly stated that the<br>police have the right to remove you from your vehicle at any time for<br>any reason at a traffic stop.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-YMWat){.citation_index} [[Phillip C.
