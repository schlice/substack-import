<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There is actually a very big difference between the<br>Air National Guard and the Air Force Reserve. The difference is not in<br>the job they do, since they both fly, fight, and win. The difference is<br>who they work for.\<br>\<br>The Air Force Reserve is the Reserve branch for the United States Air<br>Force. They work for the Commander-in-Chief. These reservists are in<br>different mission categories which allow them to \"drill\" one weekend a<br>month, and a few weeks over the summer with their active units. There<br>are some Reserve units that are full-time, which does make things<br>confusing.\<br>\<br>The Air National Guard is actually not a part of the active US Air<br>Force. The National Guard (all branches) works for the Governor of<br>the state in which they serve. The Air National Guard defends the<br>residents of that state.\<br>\<br>When I was in the USAFR, I was an Individual Mobility Augmentee (IMA),<br>which means that I filled in for an active-duty billet when that person<br>was deployed. If the person for whom I was covering were to be deployed,<br>I would be brought onto temporary active duty to fill that slot full<br>time until that person returned. This is done in critical-manned billets<br>that have to have a person filling that slot at all times. I still<br>trained with my unit, but I would have been brought to active duty had<br>my billet needed backfill.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
