<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I can answer this from the perspective of someone who went through that<br>situation, and I turned out...well, we probably shouldn't use me as an<br>example here...<br><br>Anyway, what does it mean to "honor" your father and mother? Does this<br>mean you must love them? Does this mean you must always have a<br>relationship with them? Does this mean you have to like them? Does this<br>mean you always have to be best friends? In other words, *how* do you<br>honor your father and your mother?<br><br>Before you can answer, you have to understand what it took to get you to<br>the point at which you can even ask the question about what it means to<br>"honor" your parents. Despite their current level of abusiveness, they<br>still had to work hard to raise you. They likely had to make personal<br>sacrifices (giving up things they wanted to do, giving up things they<br>wanted to buy, etc) in order to provide for you.<br><br>In other words, despite how they treat you *now*, they did actually have<br>to care about you in order to *raise* you\*. *THIS* is what you<br>should honor. Honor the fact that they sacrificed to get you to where<br>you are today. Honor their commitment to raising you. Thank them for<br>providing a house where you could live (such that it may be) and food to<br>eat (also, such that it may be). That act alone takes personal<br>commitment and sacrifice, and it is this commitment and sacrifice that<br>you "honor." You do not have to appreciate how you are being treated.<br>You do not have to respect *how* they treat you (if you're under 18, you<br>still have to respect the fact that they are your parents and you still<br>have to listen to them, though). And you absolutely do not have to<br>respect them as people for their treatment. Respect is *earned*, not<br>*given*. They do not automatically command respect just because they are<br>your parents.<br><br>You can respect them as *parents* without respecting them as *people*.<br><br>Hopefully you can see the difference.<br><br>\*The truth is, they probably still do care about you, even though they<br>don't quite know how to express it.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How do I react when my emotionally abusive parent (without boundaries)<br>uses the Bible verse "Honor thy father and mother." against me?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
