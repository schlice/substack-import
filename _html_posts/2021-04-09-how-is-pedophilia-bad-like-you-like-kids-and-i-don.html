<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How is Pedophilia bad? Like you like kids and? I don\'t see it as bad<br>if you aren\'t being a predator or molester.**<br><br>Let's be crystal clear. Pedophilia is not a crime. But it is a mental<br>disorder.<br><br>Pedophilia is the mental condition which causes an adult to be sexually<br>attracted to a pre-pubescent child.<br><br>So pedophilia, by itself, is not a crime because it is simply a<br>condition whereby an adult finds his or herself sexually attracted to<br>children who have not yet reached puberty. It is a mental condition and<br>should be treated by a psychiatrist and a therapist.<br><br>Pedophilia, however, can lead to crime if it is not treated. We should<br>encourage pedophiles to get treatment before they engage in damaging<br>criminal activity.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
