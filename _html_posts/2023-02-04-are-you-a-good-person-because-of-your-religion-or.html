<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Religion doesn't make you good. Religion makes you *saved*.<br><br>How "good" or "bad" you are is all part of your nature. Ultimately,<br>we're all bad people. We're all sinful people, living in broken, sinful<br>bodies, in a fallen, sinful world. Every last one of us is "bad,"<br>because we're sinners. God has every right to wipe us all out of<br>existence, and He'd be perfectly justified in doing so.<br><br>But He didn't.<br><br>Instead, He gave us a gift. He gave us *a way out* of this sinful life<br>and an ultimate destination of hell. He took the punishment for our sin<br>upon Himself, so that we could be *justified*. Christ's sacrifice on the<br>cross paid the debt for our sin. By accepting Christ, our sin debt is<br>paid, and we can enter the kingdom of Heaven.<br><br>But it means turning away from our sin nature. It means turning away<br>from the "bad" that we constantly do, and desiring to be better.<br><br>In other words, living for God means that I know I'm bad, and I choose<br>to be better. It doesn't make me good. I choose good, and God rewards me<br>for my repentance.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
