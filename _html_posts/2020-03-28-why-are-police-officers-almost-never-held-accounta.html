<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why is it so hard to hold the police accountable for their actions?<br><br>How have the police not been held to account?<br><br>Police officers face far more investigation in a shooting than any<br>average citizen. For example, if I shoot someone, the District Attorney<br>will investigate and determine whether or not I committed a crime. If he<br>determines I did not, case closed. If a police officer shoots someone in<br>the line of duty, he faces the same DA investigation, but he also faces<br>an internal Use Of Force (UOF) review by his chain of command, looking<br>to ensure that his use of force was conducted in accordance with<br>department policy and if not, whether or not he needs more training, or<br>if he needs disciplinary action taken, up to and including termination.<br>Note that this review is independent of the DA's determination of<br>whether or not a crime was committed. Additionally (and wholly separate<br>from the other two), the US Department of Justice can investigate the<br>officer to see if the civil rights of the victim were violated. In other<br>words, a police officer faces no less than three times the amount of<br>investigation than a citizen would in the same situation.<br><br>Are you certain that the "accountability" you're looking for is not<br>"retribution?" Are you sure you're not just looking for "someone to pay"<br>for what happened? Or are you simply concerned that police officers are<br>offered more leniency because of what they do for a living, for you, day<br>in an day out, to keep you safe? Oftentimes, people erroneously equate<br>"going to jail" with "accountability," and if no one lost their jobs or<br>went to jail, then they believe that no one has been held accountable.<br>That doesn't sound like accountability. That sounds like vengeance.<br><br>Be careful that you don't confuse "justice" with "vengeance."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
