<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Every organization is different, and every organization uses different<br>radios and different alerts. Most digital trunked radios have RD (Radio<br>Distress) buttons which send a signal to dispatch with the officer's<br>radio number. On some models, the mic is held open for 10--15 seconds<br>when the RD is activated.<br><br>Since every radio is different, I can't tell you where each and every RD<br>button is on the radio, nor would that be a wise thing to do, as it is<br>generally accepted to be "close-hold" information, so that you don't<br>spook a potential attacker by pressing what they know to be the RD<br>button.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-15aab7a300e9450fc0e9f395f9764133){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-15aab7a300e9450fc0e9f395f9764133" master_w="586"<br>master_h="401"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(This is an example of a RD button on an older digital radio; the last<br>agency I worked at where we had functioning RD buttons used one that<br>looked similar to this, including the mic extender)*<br><br>At one military base at which I worked, the RD button was on top of the<br>radio. It was recessed below the surface of the radio so that it could<br>not accidentally be bumped. It was off to the side of the upper part of<br>the handheld radio, next to the volume and channel knobs. You would have<br>to work pretty hard to push the button; it wasn't something you could<br>bump with your elbow. At the beginning of the shift, each post and<br>patrol would call out their status and then press their RD. This allowed<br>dispatch to record the RD number for each radio, since they were issued<br>at the beginning of the shift. We would let it broadcast for a few<br>seconds, then power-cycle the radio to stop it (that was the only way to<br>stop the RD from broadcasting). It took less than a second for the radio<br>number of the radio broadcasting the distress to appear on the display<br>in dispatch.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
