<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In any building in any type of active shooter situation, there are three<br>things that you should do, every time. Do these in order. Oh, and while<br>you do these things, you should be on your cell phone with 911.<br><br>1.  Run. If you can get out, then go. If you can get out a back door<br>    (or if you're on a ground floor, a window), go. Take as many people<br>    with you as you can. Run at least a block away and then wait for<br>    police.<br>2.  Hide. If you can't run, hide. Try to find a location that is<br>    easily defensible, one that you have full view in the direction of<br>    the shooter, but the shooter may not be able to see you clearly. An<br>    office with one door might be a good place to hide, or a classroom.<br>    Barricade the one door with whatever is in that room: desks, filing<br>    cabinets, etc. Then stay away from that door and hunker down. Make<br>    sure the 911 operator knows where you are.<br>3.  Fight. If the shooter tries to breach your position, don't<br>    hesitate just because he has a gun. He can't shoot everyone at once.<br>    Fight back! Use whatever tools are at your disposal: a phone<br>    receiver, a fire extinguisher, a desk chair, a book, a letter<br>    opener, *whatever you can find* can be used as a weapon. But don't<br>    sit passively and allow yourself to become a victim. Remember, **the<br>    shooter is the threat, not the weapon**. Neutralize the<br>    shooter and the threat is ended. Don't focus on the gun, focus on<br>    the shooter.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
