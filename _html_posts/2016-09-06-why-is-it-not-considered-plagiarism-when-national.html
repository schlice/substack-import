<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Since running a government typically isn't done for a grade, or held to<br>academic standards, whether or not another nation's constitution mimics<br>ours is somewhat entertaining but mostly irrelevant.<br><br>Look at it this way: "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery." In<br>layman's terms: they looked at our constitution and they liked it so<br>much that they decided to pattern their own after ours.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
