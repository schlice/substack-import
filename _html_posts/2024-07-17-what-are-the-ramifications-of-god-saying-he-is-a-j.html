<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **What are the ramifications of God saying he is a jealous God yet<br>> tells us not to covet our neighbor?**<br><br>1.  There is a great difference between God's ability to be jealous and<br>    ours. *God can be perfectly jealous, whereas we cannot*. God's<br>    jealousy is perfectly holy and perfectly righteous in protecting His<br>    honor and His glory. We, as fallible humans, cannot be perfectly<br>    jealous, because of our sin nature. Our jealousy is rooted in<br>    weakness and feelings of inadequacy.<br>2.  Jealousy is not why we should not "covet our neighbor's wife"<br>    (commit adultery). That's a false comparison. Adultery is a sin<br>    because it undermines the institution of marriage, it breaks the<br>    covenant you made before God, and it violates the rights of the<br>    other spouse.<br><br>> He gets jealous if we worship other Gods. How many are there?<br><br>Of course He does. He is God alone. The First Commandment says "I am the<br>Lord Your God. You shall have no other gods before me." But if He is the<br>only God, why does He have to tell people to have no other gods before<br>Him?<br><br>Because people create their own gods all the time. Money is probably the<br>biggest one, which is why Scripture says that the love of money is the<br>root of all evil. People devote their entire lives to acquiring money,<br>growing money, and keeping money. Money becomes a god for them.<br><br>We can turn anything into a god when we focus more on it rather than<br>Him.<br><br>So how many are there? As many as you can invent. But you shouldn't<br>invent any of them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
