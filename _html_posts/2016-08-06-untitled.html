<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So your take here is that because you didn\'t see her do anything<br>\"wrong,\" she shouldn\'t be charged with resisting arrest, because she<br>shouldn\'t have been arrested in the first place.<br><br>What you are describing is a potential legal defense against a false<br>arrest. If the original arrest is thrown out, then you believe that the<br>resisting charge should also be thrown out because there was no legal<br>basis for the original arrest.<br><br>The problem here is with who is responsible for determining validity of<br>arrest. At the scene, the officer is presumed to be right. Whether or<br>not the original arrest charge gets thrown out is up to a judge. So at<br>the scene, the law still requires you to follow the lawful orders of a<br>police officer. Therefore, if we presume the officer is right, you have<br>no right to resist arrest. Besides, it is a separate law which covers<br>resisting arrest, and that law does not hinge on the validity of the<br>arrest, since it cannot be known at the scene whether or not the arrest<br>charge is valid.<br><br>So while the original charge (failure to follow orders and failure to<br>produce identification) may get thrown out, the resisting charge can<br>still stand on its own. It\'s a question of safety.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-should-the-charge-of-resisting-arrest-be-prosecuted-even-when-there-was-no-cause-for-arrest/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
