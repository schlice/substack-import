<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, Trump has not been found guilty of using someone's music<br>without their permission. The issue is that the artists don't even know<br>how their music is licensed, and they have no personal control over who<br>gets to purchase a license.<br><br>Artists license their music to a collective licensing company like<br>[BMI(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2e9079&url=https://www.bmi.com/licensing){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bmi.com"}]{.qlink_container}. The artist gets paid, and BMI<br>handles providing the license for that music.<br><br>When Trump holds a convention in a venue, it is the *venue* who<br>contracts with BMI to license the music.<br><br>So there are literally two layers between the artist and the RNC: the<br>collective licensing company, and the venue. Trump doesn't usually<br>choose the bumper music; usually the details are hammered out when the<br>RNC contracts with the venue to host the event. The venue provides the<br>music, and it's all contracted and perfectly legal.<br><br>The event happens, and suddenly basement-dwellers start railing away on<br>X about how some artist "endorses" Trump because his music was played<br>during a Trump rally.<br><br>The artist, to avoid losing face, gets his lawyer to gin up a cease and<br>desist letter, but in doing so, this violates the terms of his agreement<br>with BMI.<br><br>So the cease and desist letter goes out to the RNC, the RNC reaches out<br>to the venue, the venue reaches out to BMI, and BMI reaches out to the<br>artist, just to let them all know that the artist gave blanket<br>permission to license their music to anyone who meets BMI's standards to<br>be a customer (and that's just about anyone, including convention and<br>concert venues), and the artist got paid for the use of that music. If<br>they had specific restrictions they wanted to place on the use of that<br>music, they needed to do it when they negotiated their contract with<br>BMI, not after.<br><br>And the bottom line is that they got paid for that use. And now they<br>want to complain?<br><br>\<br><br>Second, Trump hasn't committed any felonies while he was in office,<br>despite what New York wants you to believe. But "totally honest and<br>upstanding?" What absolute moron would ever think that any political<br>candidate has *ever* been "totally honest and upstanding?" You couldn't<br>name one if you tried.<br><br>Politics is a messy, dirty business. And no one in it is completely,<br>"totally honest and upstanding." Sorry, not a single one. And if you<br>think they are, you have been hoodwinked. You've been lied to.<br><br>Look, that doesn't mean we don't call out injustice when we find it.<br>It's just that we don't expect our politicians to be angels. We expect<br>them to have good policy. We know they are flawed, as all of us are<br>flawed. We call out the flaws when they are within the politician's<br>control to address, but we don't throw out the baby with the bathwater.<br>Politics isn't a popularity contest. We don't vote for the "nicest"<br>candidate. That's not how life works. If you think that, you probably<br>should move out of your parent's basement and join the real world before<br>you comment about how real life works.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
