<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [First off, I don\'t hate anyone. I strongly dislike some<br>people, but hate is reserved for things like the Holocaust and Pearl<br>Harbor.\<br>\<br>Second, don\'t ever assume anything. When you ASSUME, you make an ASS<br>out of U and ME.\<br>\<br>*It is easy to assume that if one cop is power hungry, the others<br>aren\'t far off in a department (common sense, when one part of an<br>organization becomes corrupt, it\'s usually not long until the rest<br>does)*\<br>What I have found is that departments are very \"top-down\" driven<br>organizations, as most large organizations are. The attitudes and<br>fundamentals demonstrated in the boss\' office are going to be the<br>attitudes reflected by the rest of the folks in the organization. Police<br>departments are no different. The attitude that the sheriff portrays is<br>the attitude his deputies are going to portray. If he shows an attitude<br>of inclusion and tolerance, his deputies will portray that attitude.<br>Conversely, if he maintains an attitude of hostility and fear, his<br>deputies will portray that to the community as well.\<br>\<br>The same, however, does not work in a \"bottom-up\" direction. If you<br>have one bad cop, for example, he won\'t make the rest bad. And it\'s<br>not fair to assume that if you see one bad cop, the entire organization<br>is infected with a lecherous attitude. If you get inside that<br>organization, you really get to see how those cops react when they are<br>not being watched by other cops or by the brass. It\'s nearly impossible<br>to get the feel of organizational climate from interactions with only<br>one person in that organization.\<br>\<br>All of that said, I do believe that cops who consistently use excessive<br>force need retraining and disciplinary actions taken. I believe cops<br>should be concerned when an officer consistently violates policy and<br>consistently uses force that is deemed to be in excess of what was<br>needed. This is why departments review *every* use of force<br>incident, and ensure the force was justified and not<br>excessive.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
