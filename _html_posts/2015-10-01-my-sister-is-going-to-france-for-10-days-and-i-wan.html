<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [This is an inherent problem with the CDMA network. If you<br>want to use your Verizon phone overseas, you have no choice but to use<br>Verizon\'s international rate plans.\<br>\<br>Verizon is a domestic carrier which runs on the CDMA network. It is much<br>less available overseas than GSM, which is in use nearly worldwide<br>(AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint use GSM networks). Verizon\'s phones don\'t<br>use SIM cards, so you can\'t just pop in a temporary SIM and use that.<br>Yes, it\'s true that you have to \"unlock\" your GSM phone to use<br>another SIM in it, as most GSM carriers \"SIM-lock\" their phones to<br>work only on their networks with their SIMs until you\'ve completely<br>paid for your phone. Don\'t worry, for a small fee any GSM phone can be<br>unlocked to be used on other networks at any time. Just Google \"SIM<br>unlock\" and you\'ll get tons of links to companies that do it for just<br>a small fee.\<br>\<br>Best advice: rent a phone. Don\'t pay Verizon\'s international rates.\<br>\<br>I do also suggest bringing your phone with you and using it in airplane<br>mode or with the cellular radio turned off. That way, you can still use<br>it to take pictures and surf the Internet over Wi-Fi. Therefore, when<br>you rent a phone, you only need a cheaper phone to make phone calls and<br>send texts.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
