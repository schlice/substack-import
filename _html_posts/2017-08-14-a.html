<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm reasonably certain that this question stems from [[the proposed<br>"Eric's Law" in<br>Colorado](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a70557&url=https://www.change.org/p/support-eric-s-law-a-law-that-requires-people-to-report-life-threatening-situations/nftexp3/fb_share_post_dynamic/671863199?recruiter%3D671863199%26utm_source%3Dshare_petition%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook%26utm_campaign%3Dshare_petition.guest_form_reduction%26utm_term%3Dshare_petition%26utm_content%3Dfb_share_post_copy_6%253Afb_share_post_dynamic){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="change.org"}]{.qlink_container}. The petition says that<br>"nine other states have such laws," but I have been unable to find many<br>states that require anyone to report *crimes*, let alone situations<br>which are not crimes but in which someone is in danger.<br><br>Existing duty to report laws, where they do exist, make it a crime in<br>itself to fail to report *a crime*. Reporting any time someone's life is<br>in danger would overwhelm 911 switchboards, as stupid people put their<br>own lives in their hands every day doing stupid things, and the casual<br>observer can't separate the personally incompetent from the situation<br>which really requires someone's assistance. Technically, any time you<br>see someone riding a motorcycle without a helmet, you would be required<br>to report it or face charges yourself, as this is a situation in which<br>someone's life is in danger. In the case which inspired the proposed<br>"Eric's Law," the raft in which he and his raftmates were travelling in<br>capsized. The raftmates returned to Eric's car without him, and left.<br>This law would put the onus on not only those raftmates, but on anyone<br>passing by and seeing a capsized raft to call police every time, or face<br>criminal prosecution.<br><br>Also, who's job is it to determine when someone's life is in danger? How<br>do you know? From an outside observation, there are a scant few<br>scenarios in which there is no reporting requirement, but it is clear<br>that someone's life is in danger. Prosecuting someone under this law<br>would be challenging, because you would have to prove beyond a<br>reasonable doubt that the person *knew* that the victim's life was in<br>danger, and knowingly, with intent, failed to report it. Unless you're<br>planning on making this a strict liability crime, you would also have to<br>show some *mens rea* showing that the person recklessly or knowingly<br>failed to report what he or she *knew* was a life-threatening situation.<br><br>Actual "duty to report" laws require reporting of crimes, not<br>reporting when someone puts themselves in danger, or when someone is<br>personally in danger.<br><br>To make a complete analysis, let's examine some actual duty to report<br>laws.<br><br>Misprision of felony is a crime under US law (18 USC 4):<br><br>> Whoever, having knowledge of the actual commission of a felony<br>> cognizable by a court of the United States, conceals and does not as<br>> soon as possible make known the same to some judge or other person in<br>> civil or military authority under the United States, shall be fined<br>> under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.<br><br>However, you might note that this offense is for concealing a known<br>felony, rather than reporting it.<br><br>As far as the states go, the vast majority of states do not have duty to<br>report laws, and in general, the public has no duty to report a crime,<br>nor to do anything to stop one. For the few that do, you are only liable<br>if you fail to report a *crime*, which means that failing to report<br>anything else is still not a crime in and of itself.<br><br>Texas has a state statute which makes failing to report a crime which<br>results in grievous bodily injury or death a class A misdemeanor. Ohio<br>also has a law which makes it illegal to knowingly fail to report a<br>felony. However, while these states have these laws, rarely is anyone<br>charged under them.<br><br>Some professions have an affirmative duty to report, even if the general<br>public does not. For example those who work with children or the elderly<br>are under mandatory reporting rules as part of their profession. In some<br>states, anyone who learns of child abuse of any kind is required to<br>report it.<br><br>However, reporting as the OP is asking (and as Eric's Law is proposing)<br>is not required anywhere in the United States (as far as I can tell),<br>and in the few states in which there is a duty to report crimes, it is<br>very rarely prosecuted.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
