You look in your rear-view mirror, and<br>you see a police car with its lights on.<br><br>How do I know if this cop intends to pull me over?<br><br>You apply your right turn signal and move one lane right.<br><br>One of two things happens.<br><br>1.  The officer speeds by you. From this, you can conclude that **the<br>    officer did not intend to pull you over.**<br>2.  The officer follows your lane change right behind you. So you do<br>    another one. He follows again. Finally, you pull your car to the<br>    side of the road and stop, and the officer pulls behind you.
