<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If the FDA says marijuana is illegal, can Congress actually vote to<br>make it legal or does the FDA have final say?**<br><br>First off, the FDA works for Congress. Congress built that agency (along<br>with all Federal agencies) for their convenience.<br><br>Secondly, it's the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which was passed<br>by Congress, which makes marijuana illegal. A Federal agency did not<br>implement a random rule which made marijuana illegal, and even if they<br>did, Congress can still override it. Congress can simply vote to change<br>the Controlled Substances Act to move marijuana either to a different<br>schedule, or remove it altogether.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
