<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's somewhat more nuanced than that.<br><br>First, Eve indeed committed the first sin, but it wasn't "trying to be<br>like God." The first sin was disobeying God.<br><br>*The reason why* she committed the first sin is related to Eve "trying<br>to be like God," but that wasn't her motivation. The serpent used Eve's<br>*humanity* to trick her into thinking that God was holding something<br>desirable back from her and Adam.<br><br>Let's look more closely at Genesis 3:<br><br>> Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord<br>> God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God really say, 'You must not<br>> eat from any tree in the garden'?"<br>><br>> The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat fruit from the trees in the<br>> garden, but God did say, 'You must not eat fruit from the tree that is<br>> in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will<br>> die.'"<br>><br>> "You will not certainly die," the serpent said to the woman. "For God<br>> knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will<br>> be like God, knowing good and evil." (1--5 NIV)<br><br>The first thing to note is how Eve responded when the serpent asked his<br>question. She said that you must not eat from the tree in the middle of<br>the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die. *But God<br>didn't say that*. So what we learn first is that Eve didn't really know<br>what God had commanded. *And the serpent,* ***who did know exactly what<br>God had commanded, used that knowledge to his advantage.*<br><br>The serpent pushed on and told Eve that she wouldn't die, but instead<br>would gain the ability to know good and evil. And she then desired that<br>ability. The serpent played on her emotions, evoking *jealousy* out of<br>Eve, making her feel like God was "holding back" something from her.<br><br>And this is what tricked her into committing the sin: she disobeyed<br>God's command and ate from the fruit of the tree which God commanded to<br>not eat from.<br><br>\<br><br>More importantly, "trying to be like God" is not necessarily sinful. In<br>fact, we should all be striving to be more like God in some ways. Jesus<br>lived a perfect, sinless life, and His example is how we should pattern<br>our lives.<br><br>But we should not be like God in other ways. The Bible is clear about<br>this. For example, God rebukes Isaiah for wanting to be great like Him.<br><br>> I will ascend above the tops of the clouds;\<br>> I will make myself like the Most High. --- Isaiah 14:14 NIV<br><br>But then, Paul tells us to be like God when he says we should<br>"\f\ollow God's example, therefore, as dearly loved children"<br>(Ephesians 5:1 NIV).<br><br>What we see here is that the Bible tells us to be like God in His love<br>and forgiveness, but not in His sovereignty or glory. If we seek to run<br>our own lives instead of submitting to His will, we are taking His<br>authority. Or if we serve others for our glory instead of God's glory,<br>we take that which does not belong to us. We should strive to be like<br>God in the ways He wants us to be, but to not take that which does not<br>belong to us.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
