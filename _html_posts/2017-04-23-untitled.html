<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because income inequality should not be a thing.<br><br>And here's the next big doozie of a line:<br><br>Income inequality is good.<br><br>*WHAT???????????!?!?!?!?!?!?!!??????*<br><br>Yep. I'll say it again. Income inequality is a good thing.<br><br>If you are at all curious, take literally four and a half minutes of<br>your life and watch this short video; you might learn something:<br><br>[https://youtu.be/1e35Vf-9n8E(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a300b1&url=https://youtu.be/1e35Vf-9n8E){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>My boss, Michael Dell, is highlighted in this video. Please watch<br>carefully, it's literally less than five minutes. Before you post that<br>negative, disparaging comment about me, please watch the video. And yes,<br>#IWork4Dell.<br><br>(EDIT) So let me address these comments.<br><br>1.  Nothing about income inequality has anything whatsoever to do with<br>    poverty. If you look at poverty and your answer is "we have poverty<br>    because we have income inequality" then you probably failed<br>    Economics in college. Income inequality does not drive poverty.<br>2.  The rich do not keep the poor poor. As it said in the video, the<br>    door to the 1% club is always open, and new members are always<br>    welcome. You have to get yourself there. In this country, we still<br>    have what we call opportunity. There are over a million jobs<br>    that go unfilled in this country every year. None of them require a<br>    4-year degree, but almost all of them require some sort of<br>    vocational education. The jobs are there. It's up to the individual<br>    to get the education to take the jobs.<br>3.  In a free nation, you are welcome to give as much money as you want<br>    to the poor. In a free nation, you cannot force me to do the same.<br>    either through taxes or welfare programs (which are just taxes which<br>    specifically benefit the poor). Now don't misunderstand, this<br>    doesn't mean that welfare is a bad thing in and of itself. But in<br>    this country, we expect you to take advantage of the vast<br>    opportunities in vocational training laid out before you to make<br>    yourself useful. And if you say, "the vocational opportunities are<br>    not vast enough," maybe you should stop taking money from the rich<br>    and simply giving it to the poor and instead take money from the<br>    rich and improve vocational education for the poor so they can<br>    improve themselves.<br>4.  Laws do not make the rich, rich. Laws do not keep the rich, rich. I<br>    will concede, however, that tax law is heavily tilted in favor of<br>    the rich, but in a progressive tax system, your biggest customers<br>    get the lions share of the benefits. And when the top tier pays more<br>    than half of the tax revenue, they get the majority of the benefits.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-do-conservatives-believe-was-so-terrible-about-Obamas-presidency/answer/Mark-Mathers-1<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
