<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [[[Better technology to track planes exists so why don\'t<br>more airlines use<br>it?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=79bf41&url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/better-technology-to-track-planes-exists-so-why-dont-more-airlines-use-it/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cbsnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>\<br>ADFRs, or Automatically Deployable Flight Recorders, eject from the<br>aircraft just before a crash. They float on water and send their<br>location to satellites for retrieval. This gives searchers a better idea<br>of where the aircraft actually went down, even in water.\<br>\<br>The ADFRs have been in use by the US Navy since the 60\'s (since their<br>aircraft generally fly over water more often than others). Most models<br>of F/A-18 Hornets have ADFRs installed.\<br>\<br>Governmental grants could fully fund ADFRs in commercial aircraft in the<br>US, but Congress has failed to act in getting that funding to the<br>aviation industry to implement the new system. The United States has<br>been trying to get them installed since 1999, when the NTSB began<br>recommending upgrades to the CVR/FDR units in commercial<br>aircraft.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
