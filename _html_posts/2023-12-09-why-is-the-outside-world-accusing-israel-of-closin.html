<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The "outside world" is utterly irrelevant to the sovereignty of the<br>nation of Israel. Israel gets to make its own decisions about its own<br>country and the safety and security of its own people.<br><br>So the "outside world" can say whatever it likes about what it thinks<br>Israel is or is not doing. Makes no difference to Israel. Israel is<br>going to do what is best for Israel. The "outside world" can go kick<br>rocks.<br><br>The fact is that **no Arab country in the region will accept Palestinian<br>refugees**. When you can answer *why that is*, you'll understand what<br>Israel is really up against in the region.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
