<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Helicopters very rarely have ejection seats, as it\'s<br>challenging to get a person up and out through the arc of spinning<br>blades waiting to chop them to pieces. However, the Ka-50 \"Black<br>Shark\" and the Ka-52 \"Alligator\", with their distinctive<br>counter-rotating blades, is one model of helicopter with ejection seats.<br>When the ejection handles are pulled, the blades are blown away from the<br>central rotor disc by explosive charges, and then the canopy is blown<br>off, also by explosive charges. Finally, the crew is ejected.\<br>\<br>Some work was done in the US in fitting a similar system to the Russian<br>ejectors in the AH-1 Cobra attack helo, but this was never<br>completed.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
