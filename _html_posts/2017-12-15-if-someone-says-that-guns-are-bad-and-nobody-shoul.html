It's simply an opinion.<br><br>If you were to say instead, "Guns are bad; everyone knows that, so<br>therefore no one should own them," that's what we call an **appeal to<br>omniscience**, because you are claiming that "everyone" knows something,<br>but in order to claim that, you have to know what "everyone" knows.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
