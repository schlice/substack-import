<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If I understand your question correctly, you are asking whether or not a<br>writer on Quora can be prosecuted by recommending that someone do<br>something or not do something, and when that someone does or does not do<br>that thing, they get arrested, and then attempt to lay blame on the<br>Quora writer for recommending that action.<br><br>Whether or not someone admits to a crime on Quora is a different<br>question altogether.<br><br>Quora is governed by the laws of the United States. My speech is<br>protected by the First Amendment.<br><br>I can tell you to go kill someone. I can even suggest that you do it<br>(unless I suggest you kill a dignitary, like the president, which could<br>possibly be illegal just for saying it). My speech may be a directive to<br>commit a crime, but I am not complicit in your crime unless I have<br>conspired with you to commit a crime. Conspiracy is an agreement between<br>persons to break the law. By my suggesting *you* break the law, I am<br>not engaging in conspiracy. I am merely suggesting what you should do,<br>which is protected free speech. Whether or not you accept my suggestion<br>is entirely up to you. You are responsible for your own actions, and you<br>are responsible for ensuring that your actions are legal before you do<br>them, which requires the advice of a licensed attorney, not a random<br>person on the Internet.<br><br>If I were a police officer (an agent of the state) and I recommend you<br>break a law, and you then do it and I arrest you for doing it, I may be<br>guilty of the offense of \"entrapment.\" However, that does not apply in<br>the scenario you listed.<br><br>It\'s possible that my speech could be considered \"fighting words,\" or<br>words that cause imminent danger or imminent breach of the peace, just<br>by my saying them, but it is unlikely in this medium, and nothing in my<br>suggestion is so inflammatory that it places anyone in imminent danger<br>of harm.<br><br>Besides the \"fighting words\" example, you also cannot say anything<br>that is untrue about someone that causes them harm (also known as<br>slander or libel).<br><br>Outside of those limitations on free speech, I can say what I like. I<br>can even suggest you should break the law. I can even suggest you do<br>something I think is legal. If you do it, and you haven\'t confirmed<br>that it is actually legal in your jurisdiction, the responsibility for<br>what you have done rests on you. You would be laughed out of court if<br>you say, \"I got advice from some random person on the Internet.\"<br><br>Beyond that, people who answer legal questions on Quora (and questions<br>about whether or not something is legal is, by definition, a legal<br>question) are protected by the \"Intended Third-Party Beneficiary\"<br>clause in Quora\'s Terms of Service.<br><br>> In no event shall Quora or Legal & Medical Contributors be liable for<br>> any damages (including, without limitation, incidental and<br>> consequential damages, personal injury / wrongful death, lost profits,<br>> or damages resulting from lost data or business interruption)<br>> resulting from the use of or inability to use the Site or the Content,<br>> whether based on warranty, contract, tort, or any other legal theory,<br>> and whether or not Quora or its Legal & Medical Contributors is<br>> advised of the possibility of such damages. Neither Quora nor the<br>> Legal & Medical Contributors are liable for any personal injury,<br>> including death, caused by your use or misuse of the Site or Content.<br><br>So if you use, or misuse, the content that someone posted on this site,<br>then neither Quora nor the contributor can be held liable.<br><br>Basically, legal advice can only legally be dispensed by a lawyer.<br>That\'s why legal advice given on Quora is for general informational use<br>only, it is not genuine legal advice. If you tell someone what you think<br>is legal and they act on that, they are misusing the information on the<br>website.<br><br>Disclaimers are there to remind people that they shouldn\'t be using<br>advice they get on the Internet as bona-fide legal or medical advice.<br>The actual teeth of the rules are contained in Quora\'s TOS.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
