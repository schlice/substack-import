This includes personal property such as cell phones,<br>> laptop, etc. and the company did not notify you in any way or ask for<br>> permission.**<br><br>I would start with a lawsuit, and possibly criminal investigation.<br><br>My employer has no authority to place anything at all on my personal<br>devices without my permission. My employer can do whatever it likes on<br>employer-owned devices. They can set whatever restrictions they like on<br>their own hardware. They can also set whatever restrictions they like on<br>accessing their networks.<br><br>But they can't install spyware (or any software packages that I do not<br>approve or am unaware of) on any of my personal devices without my<br>consent. And I must affirmatively consent --- that means, I need to know<br>what is being installed, why it is being installed, what I get with it<br>installed, and what I lose if it's not installed.<br><br>Companies have the absolute right to protect their assets, and that<br>includes their hardware, software, and networks. Companies do not have<br>the right to invade my privacy or otherwise violate the law in order to<br>do so.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
