<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Interesting case here, considering that the prosecution also found there<br>was no intent (which was the FBI's contention in Mrs. Clinton's case as<br>well). In this case, the person was convicted to prison and fined for<br>releasing classified materials, and there was no evidence that the<br>materials were compromised. In Mrs. Clinton's case, there is evidence<br>that the materials were compromised, and she was not prosecuted.<br><br>This may have more to do with DOJ's written guidance which states that<br>we don't prosecute candidates because we don't criminalize politics, nor<br>do we want to give the appearance that we criminalize politics. That<br>kind of stuff happens in third world countries, not in the US.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Hillary-Clinton-has-been-let-off-the-hook-due-to-not-intending-to-commit-a-crime-Does-this-mean-that-lack-of-intent-is-now-a-criminal-defense/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
