<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can sue anyone for anything. The question remains how likely you<br>would be to prevail.<br><br>If you can show clear monetary damages that you suffered by the trimming<br>(like if the "branches" were massive and you needed to hire a company to<br>come cut them down to size and haul them away), you might be able to<br>file suit in small claims court to recover what you had to spend in<br>order to clean up the mess.<br><br>But what's concerning to me is that the branches your neighbor trimmed<br>ended up in your property. Did the neighbor trim the branches and then<br>throw them on to your property, in a sort of twisted "they're from your<br>tree, you get them" thought process? Or did they cut branches which were<br>inside of your property lines, and those branches fell straight down?<br><br>If it's the latter, then the person trimming the tree was wrong for<br>doing the trimming. They should only be trimming the part of the tree<br>that is over their own property. If it was the former, the person is<br>guilty of littering. While you could make a case out of it, it's<br>probably not worth anyone's time to do so. Just realize that your<br>neighbor is a fool, throw the branches away, and leave it at that. File<br>that little tidbit away in the "Information I Know About My Neighbors"<br>file, and keep it so you can build a profile of who your neighbors truly<br>are. Then, you will know how to properly deal with them in the future.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
