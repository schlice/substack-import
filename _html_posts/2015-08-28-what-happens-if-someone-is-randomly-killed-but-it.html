<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Legally, conspiracy to commit (or having intent to<br>commit) does not rise to the same level as the actual commission of the<br>crime. So even if someone was killed but then it is later learned that<br>the victim had plans to kill someone else that day, the crimes are<br>unequal. Also, the victim can\'t be charged with a crime because in<br>order to prove an \"attempted\" murder, you would have to make more than<br>plans. You would have to take a \"substantial step\" towards the<br>commission of that crime (i.e. driving to the victim\'s house). Here<br>again, the murder and the attempt do not match up.\<br>\<br>Additionally, we\'re talking about defending a murder because the victim<br>had plans to kill others. This is not a suitable line of reasoning to<br>satisfy the \"self-defense/defense of others\" defense, as there was no<br>one in fear for their lives when the first murder happened. The victim<br>was not in the throes of the commission of a murder, so there are no<br>grounds to satisfy a self-defense/defense of others claim.\<br>\<br>Ethically/morally, it may help to relieve some of the burden on the<br>original killer to know that he may have helped to save another life<br>through his actions. It may help the intended victim of the first<br>victim, and their family, to know that they are alive because the first<br>killer did what he did.\<br>\<br>But *justification*? Nope, not at all.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
