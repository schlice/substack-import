<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If protesters block access to an airport is that a criminal offense?<br><br>While the First Amendment guarantees you the right to protest, the state<br>can reasonably restrict the time, place and manner of your protest.<br>Courts have found these restrictions to be reasonable and to not unduly<br>restrict your right to protest.<br><br>If you want to block the road into the airport, don't. Most states<br>have laws which prevent obstructing a road or highway. The offenses are<br>not serious (mostly misdemeanors) but they are criminal offenses. The<br>road into an airport is indeed a city road, and you can be arrested for<br>obstructing a road. The same law also holds you responsible for any<br>monetary damages caused by your obstruction. So if you obstructed a road<br>and a businessman missed a meeting causing a contract to fall though,<br>you could be sued and held liable for the lost revenue. If you obstruct<br>a road and cause a car to divert around your roadblock and the car gets<br>damaged, you can be held liable for the damages.<br><br>But let's say you're simply staging a standing protest outside of the<br>airport, with picket signs and protesters with bullhorns. If you are<br>impeding the normal flow of passengers into and out of the airport, you<br>can be "asked" to move (which means the police order you to move and<br>arrest you if you fail to comply). If you're simply standing on an<br>exterior sidewalk but people can still get around you, you might be<br>allowed to stay.<br><br>Your best bet, as always, is to get permission for your protest first.<br>This generally entails applying for a permit to hold a protest, which<br>you can do at your City Hall. The airport can ensure that normal airport<br>traffic continues unimpeded, and you can hold your protest.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
