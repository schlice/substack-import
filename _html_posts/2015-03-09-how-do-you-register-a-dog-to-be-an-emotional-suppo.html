<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>(EDIT: This question changed. This is my original answer, which was<br>geared towards a trained service animal:<br><br>> The ADA says that no business can ask you for credentials for your<br>> service animal. They also can\'t require the animal wear a vest, but<br>> it is helpful in identifying a service animal, and it causes less<br>> stress to business owners when they see an animal accompanying a<br>> person. From court rulings on the ADA, business owners may ask two<br>> questions about service animals:<br>><br>> \(1\) is the dog a trained service animal required because of a<br>> disability, and\<br>> (2) what work or task has the animal been trained to perform.<br>><br>> Businesses cannot ask about the person's disability, they cannot<br>> require that a disabled person present medical documentation, they<br>> cannot require a special identification card or training documentation<br>> (or a vest) for the dog, or ask that the dog demonstrate its ability<br>> to perform the work or task.<br>><br>> So \"doing it properly\" means that the dog is appropriately trained<br>> to perform a specific task. If the dog is trained to perform a<br>> specific task for her, then it is ready to act as a service dog. The<br>> vest is optional, but it helps alleviate confusion when she is out in<br>> public with the dog. The ADA also says that the dog is allowed in any<br>> public place that people are allowed. The dog cannot be treated in the<br>> same way as \"pets\" are treated by the establishment.<br><br>Now, you're asking about "emotional support animals." Emotional support<br>animals are not trained to perform a specific function to assist<br>with a disability. A trained animal is not an "emotional support<br>animal," it is a "service animal." The law is very clear about what a<br>service animal is as opposed to an emotional support animal. To that<br>end, **emotional support animals are not covered by the Americans with<br>Disabilities Act (ADA).** They do not have the same rights as service<br>animals like seeing eye dogs or seizure dogs which have been<br>specifically trained to perform a *service.* **Emotional support<br>animals, therefore, are not covered by the same rules as service dogs.<br>Businesses have the right to restrict emotional support animals from<br>their premises, although frequently, they do not.**<br><br>Keep in mind that businesses retain the right to restrict emotional<br>service animals at any time, even if they initially allow the animal. At<br>any time, they can ask you and the animal to leave.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
