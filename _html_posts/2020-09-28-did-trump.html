<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No. There is no need to shelve your faith. Accepting the appointment<br>does not require putting aside faith. It requires faith to accept the<br>appointment in the first place.<br><br>Trump\'s sins are between him and God, just as mine are, and just as<br>Judge Coney Barret\'s are.<br><br>We are warned in the Bible that judgement is the exclusive remedy of<br>God. Not us.<br><br>Treating someone differently because of their sins is exactly the<br>opposite of Christian love. I wouldn\'t treat Trump any differently than<br>any other flawed human. We are all sinners. We are all undeserving of<br>the gift we have been given.<br><br>Shelving your faith says "I know that God had a hand in this<br>appointment, but I know better than God, and Trump is ***LITERALLY MORE<br>EVIL THAN HITLER*** so I will turn down this appointment because of it."<br><br>Do you see how crazy that sounds?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
