<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How is police entrapment a real thing?<br><br>Entrapment steps over the line when it convinces an *otherwise<br>law-abiding person* to commit a crime. Police engaging in undercover<br>stings must be extremely careful to not cross that line.<br><br>Let's say, for example, you live in an area where marijuana is illegal.<br>An undercover police officer approaches a suspected drug dealer and asks<br>to buy marijuana. At this point, if the person sells the marijuana, it's<br>not entrapment, because normal non-criminals are expected to resist<br>doing something illegal when they are simply asked to do so.<br><br>But let's say that the undercover police officer tells the suspected<br>drug dealer that he needs the marijuana to treat a medical condition.<br>This might sway an otherwise law-abiding citizen to violate the law in<br>order to ease the suffering of his fellow man. This behavior could be<br>considered entrapment, because it could be argued that an otherwise<br>law-abiding person could be persuaded to break a law by the desire to<br>ease someone's pain and suffering.<br><br>This is just one example of how police entrapment could be a real thing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
