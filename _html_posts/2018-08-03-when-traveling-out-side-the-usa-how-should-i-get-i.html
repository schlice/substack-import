<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**When traveling out side the USA, how should I get internet for my<br>phone (T-Mobile)?**<br><br>There are several things you can do, depending on whether or not your<br>phone is locked to T-Mobile.<br><br>If you're still paying for your phone, there's a good chance it's locked<br>to T-Mobile's network. Check out [[this<br>answer](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-know-which-network-my-phone-is-locked-to/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}<br>for more information on how to find out if your handset is<br>carrier-locked.<br><br>- If your handset is carrier-locked to T-Mobile, your best bet is to<br>  add International Data to your plan. Good news: if your plan is<br>  T-Mobile ONE, you already have International data and texting in over<br>  140 countries around the world. Check the T-Mobile website to see if<br>  the country you are going to is included. If you're not on T-Mobile<br>  ONE, you can still easily add international data and texting to your<br>  plan. Just call Customer Service (611 from your phone) and ask to add<br>  international text and data to your existing plan.<br>- If your handset is not carrier-locked to T-Mobile, you have even more<br>  options. You could use the same option above, or you could buy a<br>  pre-paid GSM SIM card at the airport when you arrive at your<br>  destination. Pop it in and you have pre-paid data. Make sure you buy<br>  enough data. Remember though, if you keep refilling your data, this<br>  can get pricey. But you won't have to worry about any international<br>  roaming charges if you're not on a T-Mobile ONE plan.<br><br>There are other options, but they are more complex and arguably more<br>expensive (i.e. buying a pre-paid phone at the airport, etc).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
