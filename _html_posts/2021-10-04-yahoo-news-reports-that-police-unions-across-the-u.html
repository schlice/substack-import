<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>At this point in time, no one should be disputing the fact that the<br>vaccine can protect a person against severe COVID-19 infection. In other<br>words, the vaccine can save your life.<br><br>However, [[people who have been vaccinated can still get<br>COVID-19](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=983422&url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/why-measure-effectiveness/breakthrough-cases.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cdc.gov"}]{.qlink_container}. And [[people who have been<br>vaccinated can transmit COVID-19 to<br>others](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=dd2687&url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cdc.gov"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>So this tells us two things:<br><br>1.  The vaccine only protects you from severe COVID-19 infection.<br>    This is the infection which can lead to your death. So it behooves<br>    you to get the vaccine to protect yourself.<br>2.  Even if you are fully vaccinated, you can still get **mild COVID-19<br>    infection**, and you can still pass it on to others. So the vaccine<br>    does not prevent you from infecting other people, So if you want to<br>    protect yourself, the only way to do that is to be vaccinated<br>    yourself.<br><br>The bottom line from those two facts: **the vaccine only protects you,<br>not the people around you, and the only way you can benefit from<br>vaccination is if you are vaccinated, not the people around you.**<br><br>Therefore, *vaccine mandates are pointless.*<br><br>Additionally, they fail to take into account some other things:<br><br>1.  Some people have valid religious objections.<br>2.  Some people cannot take vaccines.<br>3.  Some people (you know, around 100 million or so) have already<br>    contracted COVID-19 and have recovered, and therefore have no *need*<br>    for a vaccine.<br><br>And I'm old enough to remember "my body, my choice." But that seems to<br>have fallen out of favor. I guess if we can mandate what you put in to<br>your body, we can mandate what you keep in your body until it naturally<br>comes out. Sound good? Sound like a valid compromise?<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Yahoo news reports that police unions across the United States look to<br>stop mandatory vaccinations amongst officers. If the Biden<br>administration does a mandate for the general population how enforceable<br>will it be if the police are disputing it?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
