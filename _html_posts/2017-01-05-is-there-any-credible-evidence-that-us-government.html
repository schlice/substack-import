<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is as much "credible evidence" that the US government regularly<br>hacks into Russia as there is that the Russian government hacks into the<br>US.<br><br>But let me reassure you right now. Yes, we are hacking into Russia.<br><br>Oh, and also, Russia is hacking us.<br><br>The Chinese are hacking us.<br><br>We are hacking the Chinese.<br><br>We are hacking the North Koreans.<br><br>The North Koreans are hacking us.<br><br>Every country with an intelligence-gathering capability is attempting to<br>get intelligence from wherever they can, including computer networks.<br><br>That said, please don't believe the media spin. Remember, they're trying<br>to sell airtime/newspapers/etc. Whatever story they can concoct that has<br>even the slightest bit of truth to it, no matter how much they must<br>embellish that truth, will be written.<br><br>In this case, it's all second-hand, third-hand accounts that even<br>acknowledge that the Russian government had no involvement with the<br>actual hack. Who is "Russia?" Russia's a pretty big place, you know. Is<br>it the Kremlin? Is it the KGB? Is it the GRU? Is it a Russian civilian<br>hacker group? Just saying "Russia" doesn't mean that the Kremlin<br>directed it, or that Putin had any knowledge of it, or that he even<br>sanctioned it.<br><br>Second, what does "hacked the election" mean? Did they tamper with<br>voting machines? That's been checked and found to be inaccurate. Did<br>they engage in voter suppression through hacks? Nope, no evidence of<br>voter suppression has even been attempted to be shown, and voter<br>suppression through the Internet is a tough thing to do. So what are<br>they purported to have done? Apparently, they hacked the DNC and<br>released the emails to Wikileaks.<br><br>And to that I say, so what?<br><br>Because if Edward Snowden can "hack" the military (which essentially he<br>did by taking information which he did not have the rights to --- hacks<br>don't have to be computerized, mind you) and release them to Wikileaks<br>and be heralded as some sort of cult hero, then Russia (even if they<br>did) can do the same thing to a private organization (not the<br>government) and release those to Wikileaks and suddenly they're<br>demonized for it? It's all very Machiavellian, if you ask me. Which you<br>did.<br><br>And how is this any different from the DNC hacking the election? Because<br>it has been shown that they did this as well! Remember how they<br>intentionally made it so that Bernie Sanders had no chance of winning<br>the primary? This is *direct election tampering* (because they are<br>actually interfering directly in the election process), not Russia<br>releasing emails from a private organization to another private<br>organization. It's all the same, and if one's okay, then so is the<br>other.<br><br>Either denounce them all, or denounce none. One or the other.<br><br>*(DISCLAIMER: While I am a former military officer, I have no direct<br>knowledge of any intelligence-gathering operations. I get my information<br>from the news.)*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
