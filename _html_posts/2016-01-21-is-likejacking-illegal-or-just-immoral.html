<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>\"Likejacking\" is neither illegal nor immoral. It is a<br>Facebook-specific form of the attack known as \"clickjacking.\"<br><br>In \"likejacking,\" users are presented with a web article. The article<br>is dual-layered. The back layer is designed with a Facebook \"like\"<br>button which follows your mouse cursor. The front layer is whatever ad<br>that got you to look in the first place. It doesn\'t matter where on the<br>ad you click, even if you think you are just clicking through to an<br>article, you are actually clicking a Facebook \"like\" button, posting<br>that like to your own wall, and further spreading the spam. Perhaps the<br>Facebook business you liked was offering a scam promotion, and you<br>surreptitiously liked it.<br><br>This has become a moneymaking scheme through the use of \"affiliate<br>marketing\" which pays the affiliate for every person who clicks an ad,<br>or signs up for a service, or whatever else the marketer wants you to<br>do.<br><br>Part of the reason that \"likejacking\" works is that Facebook does not<br>require any confirmation when you click the \"like\" button.<br>Confirmation of Facebook \"likes\" might help cut down on<br>\"likejacking.\"<br><br>At worst, \"likejacking\" is a violation of Facebook Terms of Service in<br>using the \"like\" button, and is enough to get the malicious ad poster<br>kicked off of Facebook, but that\'s about it, It\'s not illegal, and<br>it\'s not immoral.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
