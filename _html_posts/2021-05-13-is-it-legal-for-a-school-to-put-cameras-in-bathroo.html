<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(US Answer Only)*<br><br>This is a really tricky question.<br><br>In general, you cannot legally record someone in an area in which there<br>exists a reasonable expectation of privacy. Bathrooms are one of those<br>places.<br><br>However, you still find schools putting cameras in bathrooms, to protect<br>students and to reduce vandalism.<br><br>In most cases, cameras in school bathrooms is completely illegal. The<br>school *may* have an out if all of their stalls have floor-to-ceiling<br>doors within which the camera may not see. However, it's still possible<br>that a student could use the bathroom, not the stall, for changing<br>clothes, and the camera would still constitute an invasion of privacy.<br><br>It's a very tenuous legal question, and one in which the school would<br>easily find itself defending against charges of invasion of privacy, and<br>you just have to wonder if the school is willing to risk such legal<br>trouble, and if the camera is worth the effort.<br><br>Also, state and local laws must be followed, and some states have banned<br>cameras in bathrooms completely. Check your state and local laws for<br>more specific rules.<br><br>It's far more beneficial to put cameras just outside the bathroom to<br>catalog who goes in and out, and when.<br><br>**TL;DR: There are very few exceptions to the "no cameras in bathrooms"<br>rule that would overcome a legal challenge to an invasion of privacy<br>charge. A student using the bathroom or changing in there has a very<br>strong expectation of privacy, and it's unlikely the school has a<br>substantial enough need to record students during the course of these<br>activities to justify it.**<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it legal for a school to put cameras in bathrooms?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
