<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Simply "not being the owner of the vehicle" by itself does not provide<br>reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed, or that a crime<br>will be committed. It certainly does not alleviate the requirement for<br>having probable cause or obtaining permission to search the vehicle.<br><br>Remember though, if an officer demands you exit the vehicle and then<br>proceeds to search without a warrant, feel free to protest by saying,<br>"Just reminding you that I did not consent to a search," and then leave<br>it at that. The officer can continue searching if he so chooses. You<br>will fight this later on, not while he's searching. You let your lawyer<br>handle it at that point.<br><br>Also remember that the officer is not required to explain his basis for<br>search to you, he's required to explain his basis for search to<br>the court. If he fails to do this to the legal standard and the<br>search is ruled unlawful, anything found during the search is<br>inadmissible in court.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
