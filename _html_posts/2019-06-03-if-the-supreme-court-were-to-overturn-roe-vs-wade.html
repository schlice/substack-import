<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If the Supreme court were to overturn Roe vs Wade, how would that<br>decision affect a person\'s right to privacy?**<br><br>Hopefully it would eliminate the notion that a Constitutional right to<br>privacy exists.<br><br>Because it doesn't. Unless you can find the words "The right of the<br>people to privacy shall not be infringed" in the Constitution, it<br>doesn't exist. *Griswold v. Connecticut* made it up, out of the<br>"emanations and penumbras" of the Constitution, not its "text."<br>*Griswold* is the decision upon which *Roe* was built.<br><br>It would be left to states to enact laws which protect your privacy.<br>Sort of like the Privacy Act of 1974, still in force today. Along with<br>privacy in healthcare (guaranteed by the Health Insurance Portability<br>and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996) and other privacy laws, Federal<br>and state law should protect privacy. There is no Constitutional right<br>to privacy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
