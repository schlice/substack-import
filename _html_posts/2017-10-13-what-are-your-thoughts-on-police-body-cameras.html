<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I am all for them. 100%. Body Worn Cameras (BWCs) are the next big wave<br>in policing.<br><br>So long as they are implemented properly. And that, I'm sure, will be<br>the sticking point. Some of the issues we will face when implementing<br>these devices:<br><br>- Activation: Officers should be allowed the flexibility to start and<br>  stop recording. I know, the conspiracy theorists will claim that this<br>  will allow police to "selectively" fail to record abuses, but this<br>  ability to start and stop recordings will not only save money, but it<br>  will allow officers to maintain privacy in sensitive situations (i.e.<br>  interviewing a domestic violence or rape victim or a child crime<br>  victim), or situations when the officer is allowed to have privacy<br>  (i.e. in the bathroom). Department policy would dictate that all<br>  official contacts with the public be recorded except for the<br>  aforementioned sensitive situations. Failure to do so could be grounds<br>  for termination. Budgetary restraints would likely not make continuous<br>  recording feasible.<br>- Storage space: The biggest obstacle to implementing BWCs is storage<br>  space. I know, my full time job is with Dell EMC, one of the biggest<br>  storage vendors on the planet. The amount of data that these cameras<br>  will be generating will be immense, and the amount of space required<br>  to store all of that video data will also depend on how long<br>  departments are required to keep the video. We're talking about<br>  "non-evidentiary video" that is not actively being used in an<br>  investigation; evidentiary video will be kept until it is archived at<br>  the conclusion of proceedings. So for non-evidentiary video, do we<br>  keep it for three months? Six months? The longer the data must be<br>  retained, the more space will be consumed overall. Storage policy will<br>  dictate how much storage space we will need.<br>- More IT guys: Back to point 1, if you do not give officers the<br>  flexibility to stop the cameras from recording, you guarantee that<br>  each officer will produce 8 full hours of video which all must be<br>  maintained, since you don't have definite start/stop times to<br>  distinguish the videos. You have to keep the entire 8-hour video and<br>  presume it is all evidentiary, and if evidence is required, someone<br>  will have to parse through that (mostly useless) video. This will<br>  require more IT personnel to handle the data. This will require more<br>  storage space. And ultimately, this will require a bigger budget for<br>  the police department.<br>- Privacy: Since non-evidentiary video is government information not<br>  protected during an investigation, it can be released to the public.<br>  The default method is through a FOIA request, but there could be other<br>  methods. I'm not sure that John Q. Public is going to want his drunken<br>  tirade with police to end up on YouTube, or it could basically ruin<br>  his life. So there are privacy concerns with releasing BWC video to<br>  the public, and those concerns will have to be addressed before the<br>  system goes live<br><br>So how many cameras, how much recording can be done, how long it can be<br>maintained, the policies surrounding the video, and how it is to be<br>managed, are all dependent on the one long pole in the tent: budget.<br><br>If people want BWCs, people will have to increase police department<br>budgets, or they will not be happy with the results. If people want<br>police to continuously record, they will have to *seriously* increase<br>police department budgets before they can even *consider* whether or not<br>continuous recording is even feasible.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
