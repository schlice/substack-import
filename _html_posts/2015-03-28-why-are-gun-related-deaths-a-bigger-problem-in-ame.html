<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Question Details:*<br>><br>> *Gun laws are stricter today in America than they were during the<br>> 1950's. Yet guns seem to be a bigger problem. What has changed?*<br><br>Let\'s break down what you said.<br><br>*Gun laws are stricter today in America than they were during the<br>1950's*<br><br>This is actually *not true**.* Gun laws have been steadily getting<br>more relaxed since the 50\'s. More states now have \"shall issue\" laws<br>for concealed carry than ever before, and unless guns are magically<br>disappearing, we have more guns in society than we have ever had before.<br><br>*Yet guns seem to be a bigger problem*<br><br>The key word in your sentence is \"seem\". It *appears* that guns are a<br>bigger problem, when in actuality, gun crime is *down* since its<br>peak in the 80\'s.<br><br>So that\'s an odd contradiction, isn\'t it? We have more lax gun laws,<br>we have more guns (legal and illegal) in circulation, yet gun crime has<br>been steadily falling since the 80\'s. So why then do you, and so many<br>others, believe that it\'s a bigger problem? Why does it *appear*<br>bigger than it actually is?<br><br>Some of the factors that contribute to gun crime appearing to be worse<br>than it is:<br><br>1.  Mass media and biased reporting. We hear about every mass shooting<br>    incessantly until we can\'t stand it any more, but during the time<br>    we\'re being drilled about some mass shooting, many more murders are<br>    taking place which we never hear about on the national news. Why is<br>    that? Because we sensationalize mass shootings while we ignore<br>    others. This is a disturbing trend which causes us to miss the big<br>    picture: while guns are often the tools used to commit such crimes,<br>    they aren\'t always. Yet you only hear about the worst gun crimes.<br>    Murders are being committed every day with tools other than guns,<br>    but guns are the target of the discussion because they are the tool<br>    that is purpose-built for killing. If you take the gun away, people<br>    will still kill, but they will use other tools to do it. To<br>    illustrate that point, let me make a comparison. Let\'s say you\'re<br>    going to dig a hole. You could use a shovel. You could also use a<br>    cereal bowl or a bucket, but those things are not really designed<br>    for digging holes and it would probably be harder to do. You use the<br>    tool that is best designed for the task you are trying to<br>    accomplish. If you are trying to kill someone, you use a gun. You<br>    could also use a baseball bat, a knife, a frying pan, a chair, or a<br>    car, but those things aren\'t really designed for killing and it<br>    would probably be harder to do. The gun is just the tool. We focus<br>    on the gun because it\'s tangible. It\'s something we (think we) can<br>    regulate. But in actuality, the gun is just the scapegoat in a<br>    discussion about why people commit murder. The gun is not the<br>    problem, the person who chose it as his tool is the real. This is<br>    the source of that quote \"Guns don\'t kill people, people kill<br>    people\". Which leads me to the next factor:<br>2.  Downplaying of mental illness in the US. We have a mental health<br>    crisis in this country. We need to recognize that mental illness is<br>    a bigger problem in this country than it ever has been, and<br>    deinstitutionalization was not the way to handle it. We need more<br>    comprehensive mental health treatment in this country if we are ever<br>    going to get a handle on mass murder.<br>3.  Race relations. Did you know that homicide is the leading cause of<br>    death for young black men? And around 90% of the shooters are other<br>    young black men. But the narrative that the race-baiters have pushed<br>    (and the media happily picked up) is that young black men are dying<br>    because cops are shooting them. In fact, around 98% of black<br>    shooting deaths do not involve the police at all. Cops are around<br>    six times more likely to be shot by a young black man than the<br>    opposite. Pushing the narrative just allows the real problem to go<br>    unnoticed and allows the criminals to walk.<br><br>Until we start having real, candid discussions about race relations,<br>mental illness, and the role of mass media in our culture, people will<br>still believe that gun crime is a pandemic and that cops are out there<br>killing black kids because they\'re black.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
