<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are your thoughts on the new allegations against Brett Kavanaugh<br>(September 2019)?**<br><br>I'm literally falling out of my chair laughing at the people who believe<br>this is actually *credible*.<br><br>Several points about this "new" allegation:<br><br>1.  The FBI was notified about this allegation. They didn't "fail to<br>    investigate," and the President didn't order them to not<br>    investigate. *They determined, all on their own, that there wasn't<br>    enough evidence,* and so they did not investigate further. They,<br>    apparently, saw how thin the evidence was, and let it go. Good thing<br>    we have the NYT to investigate things that the FBI won't touch with<br>    a 10-foot pole.<br>2.  Max Stier, the man who gave the story to the NYT, won't confirm the<br>    story publicly, but don't you worry, your intrepid authors<br>    "confirmed the account with two officials who have communicated with<br>    him." That's good, glad you got your double-hearsay quota in there.<br>3.  Stier, Stier, that name sounds familiar. Wasn't he a defense<br>    attorney for the Clinton's? Why yes, yes he was. Hmm, the plot<br>    thickens.<br>4.  Probably the most damning thing conveniently omitted from the<br>    *Times* article: the woman Stier accuses Kavanaugh of assaulting<br>    denies any memory of the incident. You'll note that the *Times*<br>    (that paragon of ethical reporting with integrity and stuff) did<br>    correct their article and included this little tidbit, but as we say<br>    in legal circles, you can't un-ring a bell.<br><br>So, the grand question: *why now*? Wasn't this story thoroughly<br>debunked and buried a long time ago? Isn't Kavanaugh a bona fide Supreme<br>Court Justice now?<br><br>Just when we're scratching our collective heads wondering why this is<br>happening now, this shows up in everyone's Twitter feeds:<br><br>[https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1daa23&url=https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1173250953103007745?ref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Etweet){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="twitter.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>[https://twitter.com/ewarren/stat\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1fb8a8&url=https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1173290967773982722?ref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Etweet){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="twitter.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>[https://twitter.com/JulianCastro\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ca38b5&url=https://twitter.com/JulianCastro/status/1173075279687929856?ref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Etweet){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="twitter.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>[https://twitter.com/BetoORourke/\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1322a3&url=https://twitter.com/BetoORourke/status/1173311095416639488?ref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Etweet){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="twitter.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>And here it is.<br><br>This article is what is known as *political cover.* The article allows<br>politicians (and in this case, Democratic Presidential candidates) to<br>take a position popular with their base, and win some free brownie<br>points. They can then point back to the article (as you see several of<br>them have), and use it as the basis to support their position. "SEE?<br>THERE'S ANOTHER ALLEGATION! IMPEACH IMPEACH IMPEACH!"<br><br>Regardless that this particular accusation is *EVEN THINNER* than<br>the previous one (at least in that one, it was the alleged victim who<br>came forward; in this case, it's bad hearsay and the alleged victim<br>denies it even happened).<br><br>It's not even worth the fishwrap it was printed on. But that never<br>stopped the *Times* from printing it anyway. It's absolute trash. But<br>that's what we have come to expect from them these days. And Democratic<br>Presidential candidates are all too happy to grab it and lean on it,<br>despite the fact that it is utter feces.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
