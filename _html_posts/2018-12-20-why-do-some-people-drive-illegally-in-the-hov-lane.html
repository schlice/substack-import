<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why do some people drive illegally in the HOV lane with no passenger<br>during traffic knowing that they will be fined if caught?**<br><br>Risking fines is what you would call a "calculated risk." On the plus<br>side, you get to completely bypass traffic. On the minus side, you could<br>face a \$500 fine (in some places, may be higher or lower in your neck<br>of the woods).<br><br>This is a risk/reward calculation that people make. Should I *risk*<br>losing \$500 so that I can reap the *reward* of bypassing traffic<br>without having a passenger in my car? If the risk is too great (i.e. the<br>fine is not money you're willing to throw away), you don't break the<br>law. If the risk is acceptable to you (you're willing to lose the \$500<br>to pay for the privilege of illegally driving in the HOV lane), you do<br>it.<br><br>If you want to curb illegal HOV lane usage, you must simultaneously<br>increase patrols and monitoring of HOV lanes, and you must increase<br>fines to make it financially unwise to break that law. When it becomes<br>*more costly* to break the law than it does to follow it, then the law<br>breaking will stop.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
