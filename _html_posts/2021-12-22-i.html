<br><br><h2>Space Submission</h2><br><div><br><br>Space name: Christians & Christianity<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You are free to pray to God for whatever you want. He doesn't have to<br>give it to you.<br><br>So let's look at what you are praying for, and let's see if God will<br>answer you.<br><br>You are praying for God to abolish evil. As other answerers have said,<br>Revelations explains that when the day of judgement comes, Satan will be<br>cast into the lake of fire. In other words, he's already going to<br>abolish evil.<br><br>But what about today? Why doesn't God just wipe away all of the evil<br>today? Right now? There's so much pain and suffering and outright evil<br>in the world. Why can't we pray for God to just come down and eliminate<br>all the evil?<br><br>The answer may surprise you.<br><br>*He's not going to eliminate part of his creation.*<br><br>Evil has a time limit, an expiration date. Once the day of judgement<br>comes, evil will be vanquished. *But until then, evil is*<br>*permitted* *to operate.*<br><br>Look at Job 1:6--12. It helps to explain how God allows evil:<br><br>> Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves<br>> before the Lord, and Satan also came among them. The Lord said to<br>> Satan, "From where do you come?" Then Satan answered the Lord and<br>> said, "From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it." The<br>> Lord said to Satan, "Have you considered My servant Job? For there is<br>> no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, fearing God<br>> and turning away from evil." Then Satan answered the Lord, "Does Job<br>> fear God for nothing? Have You not made a hedge about him and his<br>> house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of<br>> his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. But put<br>> forth Your hand now and touch all that he has; he will surely curse<br>> You to Your face." Then the Lord said to Satan, "Behold, all that he<br>> has is in your power, only do not put forth your hand on him." So<br>> Satan departed from the presence of the Lord. --- Job 1:6--12 NASB1995<br><br>Note that God gave Satan permission to torment Job. As the story<br>continues, Satan did this, and Job was placed into extreme agony and<br>torture, but was not killed (as God commanded). **Through it all, Job<br>remained faithful**.<br><br>Now look at Joseph. His entire life was in shambles. He was hated by his<br>brothers who considered killing him before agreeing instead to sell him<br>as a slave. While in Egypt, he was imprisoned, falsely accused by<br>Potiphar's wife of attempted rape, and threatened with execution. There<br>is no indication that God explained to Joseph what He was doing through<br>those many years of heartache or how the pieces would eventually fit<br>together. Nevertheless, throughout all of his trouble, **Joseph remained<br>faithful.**<br><br>There's a lesson to be learned here. And that lesson is not to hope that<br>evil will be vanquished in our lifetime. The lesson of Job and Joseph is<br>this: God is pleased with us when we are faithful ***despite the<br>evil.* Our faithfulness to God is pleasing to him *even when<br>nothing makes sense.***<br><br>So perhaps a better prayer would be to ask God to keep us faithful<br>*despite* the evil. Perhaps God can help us to remain strong *in the<br>face of evil*. Perhaps we can learn to rely on God instead of "leaning<br>on our own understanding" (Proverbs 3:5).<br><br>I would also pray that those who are affected by evil could also hear<br>this message and learn to trust God, and know that God allows these<br>things to happen because he has a plan for us, and his plans are always<br>good, and we don't always know what those plans are. God doesn't always<br>explain to us why we are experiencing bad times. But we rely on the fact<br>that God has a plan, and it is good.<br><br>That, to me, is likely to be a more effective prayer.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I\'m praying God would abolish the power of evil. Would you pray with<br>me?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
