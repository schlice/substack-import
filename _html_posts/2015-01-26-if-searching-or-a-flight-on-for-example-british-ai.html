<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I didn\'t know that there were laws that governed airline<br>pricing practices. I wasn\'t aware that as a matter of law, a vendor<br>could not arbitrarily raise or lower prices at will. To his own<br>detriment, of course, but I wasn\'t aware that there were laws against<br>being able to set your own prices in your own business.\<br>\<br>I\'m being slightly facetious there. A business has every right to<br>change the prices of whatever it is they are offering at any time. Of<br>course, if what you say is true, then if your passengers don\'t buy a<br>ticket on the first site visit (if they actually shop around), you\'ll<br>end up losing customers as they will then be forced to continue to shop<br>around to find the cheaper fare.\<br>\<br>What\'s more likely happening is that as you approach the actual<br>time/date of the flight, the price increases, usually automatically<br>based on pricing algorithms.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
