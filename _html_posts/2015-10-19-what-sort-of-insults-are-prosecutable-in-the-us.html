<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Question Details:*<br>><br>> *By this I want to know what are the boundaries of acceptable<br>> constitutional free speech right against a person. So for example,<br>> I\'m wondering if I call someone \'son of a bitch\', can he sue me for<br>> false accusation/defamation? If not, when an insult becomes sue-able?*<br><br>A2A<br><br>Speaking like an asshat is absolutely protected by the First Amendment.<br>You have the right to make as big a fool of yourself as you like.<br>Calling names, cursing, and generally being a foul human being is<br>Constitutionally protected in the United States.<br><br>Once you cross the line into threatening speech, or speech that incites<br>a riot, or speech that incites others to illegal or dangerous action,<br>you start crossing into territory which can be prosecuted simply for<br>speaking.<br><br>\"Son of a bitch\" is an opinion, but simply stating your opinion about<br>someone does not rise to an actionable level unless the speech causes<br>some harm. In order to be sued for slander, your speech must cause<br>demonstrable harm to someone else. For example, if you called Donald<br>Trump a philanderer and it cost him the election, he could sue you for<br>slander and defamation of character, because the lie had a demonstrable<br>harm that can be proved.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
