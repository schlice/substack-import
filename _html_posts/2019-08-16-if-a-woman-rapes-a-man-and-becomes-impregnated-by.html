THAT'S SO WRONG! HE WAS RAPED! WHY DOES HE HAVE TO PAY CHILD<br>SUPPORT???*<br><br>You're all spun up about this because you have the wrong idea about<br>child support.<br><br>Child support is not a punishment for an aggressor, or a way to enrich a<br>single mother.<br><br>Child support is about the child.<br><br>The state mandates child support. Child support amounts are determined<br>by the state using a formula. Child support is not imposed by a court.<br>The state has a compelling interest in caring for children, and both of<br>the people who created that child are responsible for financially<br>supporting the child. *How* the child was created, and *under what<br>conditions* that child were created, are the realm of the courts.<br><br>If you think this is wrong, you might consider having a law passed in<br>your state which raises taxes so that a rape victim does not have to pay<br>child support. Then the parent can apply to the state for child support<br>from them instead of from the victim. In that way, everyone pays, not<br>just the victim. Maybe that seems more fair to you. Maybe your state<br>agrees.<br><br>So far, no state has decided to pass such a law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
