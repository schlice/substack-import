<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It may seem scary, but statistically speaking, flying in a<br>plane is the safest form of travel. Cars kill millions more than<br>airplanes do. The newness of the sensations is usually the scary part.<br>Here\'s some tips for the first time flyer:\<br>]<br><br>1.  Listen to the flight attendants and do what they tell you. Besides,<br>    it\'s required under Federal law.<br>2.  The flight may be bumpy. The bumps may sometimes feel like a rough<br>    road, or rarely will feel like big stinking potholes that would<br>    break a car or a bus. Don\'t worry. The plane can handle far more<br>    than you can.<br>3.  If you\'re at all prone to motion sickness, grab some Dramamine<br>    before you go. You\'ll be glad you did. Very few people ever need to<br>    use the air sickness bags located in the seat pocket in front of<br>    you, but if it\'s your first time and you are not used to the<br>    sensations of flight, it might be a little disorienting. PRO TIP: If<br>    you feel nautious during turning maneuvers, look out the window at<br>    the wing. Seeing something stable while the plane turns will assist<br>    your brain. Looking down the aisle toward the nose of the airplane<br>    will be disorienting as the plane will be turning about its<br>    horizontal axis while you look at an area which, for all intents and<br>    purposes, is supposed to be still.\<br>4.  Under most circumstances, the flight will take off and will<br>    eventually level off at cruising altitude. It will be mostly smooth.<br>    Sometimes, flights experience unexpected turbulence, and sometimes<br>    flights experience continuous chop throughout. While annoying, it\'s<br>    not dangerous. Pilots will try to avoid the chop in the air by<br>    increasing or decreasing altitude to get around it. Normally, there<br>    is some turbulence on takeoff and climb as well as on descent and<br>    landing. If the landing location is extremely windy or is<br>    experiencing highly shifting winds, the pilot may have to \"come in<br>    hot\" and land fast and (sometimes) hard. Note that this does not<br>    often happen, but if winds are about to become out of limits for<br>    landing, but they\'re not yet, it may. On one very turbulent<br>    descent, I remember telling my son, \"it\'s okay \[that we\'re<br>    rolling around during descent\], but the pilot is going to have to<br>    come in hot\" and at that exact moment, we touched down. I say<br>    \"touched down\" because that\'s the term, but there was no touching<br>    about that landing. It was a bang. Hard landing. Sometimes it<br>    happens. Like I said, the plane can take far more abuse than you<br>    can.\<br>5.  The air pressure will change in the cabin during the flight. The<br>    cabin is pressurized so you won\'t pass out, but there are<br>    differences in cabin pressure. Your ears will pop on the way up and<br>    will pop on the way down. If you don\'t equalize pressure on your<br>    ears easily, try chewing gum, yawning or swallowing, or look into<br>    the [[Valsalva<br>    maneuver](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=523f14&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valsalva_maneuver){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br>6.  TSA. Security screenings. Annoying! Check your airline\'s website<br>    and the [[Transportation Security<br>    Administration](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=acf0b6&url=http://www.TSA.gov){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="tsa.gov"}]{.qlink_container} website for information on<br>    what you can bring through a security checkpoint and what you<br>    cannot, along with how security screenings work. It should go<br>    without saying that weapons of any kind cannot be brought on to an<br>    airplane. Also, no liquids, aerosols or gels in any quantity of over<br>    three ounces can come with you through the checkpoint. You can buy<br>    them once on the concourse, but they can\'t come through security.<br>    Details for how to pack your liquids to go through security on the<br>    TSA website. If you\'re going to pack liquids in your checked<br>    luggage, don\'t forget that pressure will change and liquids can<br>    leak from their containers. I\'d suggest packing them inside some<br>    plastic wrap. Don\'t lock your bags unless you have TSA-approved<br>    security locks. The TSA-approved locks have one of these symbols on<br>    them:\<br><br>    :::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>    ::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>    !(images/qimg-34b1e63ab9a13b56f2adf2264a460bb4){.landscape<br>    .qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>    master_src="images/qimg-34b1e63ab9a13b56f2adf2264a460bb4"<br>    master_w="200" master_h="103"}<br>    :::<br>    ::::<br><br>    \<br>    Make sure that if you\'re going to lock your checked bags, the lock<br>    has one of those symbols on them. TSA has special \"keys\" that open<br>    those locks so they can search your bags. Locks without that symbol<br>    will be cut.\<br>7.  If you can stand it, sit in a window seat. On most wide-body jets<br>    with six seats across (three and three), it will be seat A or<br>    seat F. You have to see the view. Enjoy it, it\'s a total blast, and<br>    it is simply beautiful.<br>8.  While you\'re picking your seat online (when you buy your tickets),<br>    use a website like<br>    [SeatGuru.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=004fee&url=http://www.seatguru.com){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="seatguru.com"}]{.qlink_container} to help you find the<br>    best seats.<br>9.  If you happen to chat up a flight attendant while you\'re stowing<br>    your gear and getting in your seat, tell him/her that this is your<br>    first real flight ever. I bet you\'ll be pleasantly surprised.<br>    Please report back after your flight and let us know how it went.\<br><br>Most importantly, be patient with everyone (remember, there are roughly<br>300 people on that plane, and two thirds of them are in a hurry to get<br>somewhere, so relax, go with the flow) and most importantly, don\'t fret<br>your flight, enjoy it! It will be all new experiences, so have fun with<br>it!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
