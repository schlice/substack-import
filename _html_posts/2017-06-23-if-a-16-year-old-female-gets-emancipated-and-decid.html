<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Great question!<br><br>Emancipation only affects your minor status when it comes to parental<br>supervision requirements. Your parents are responsible for your<br>well-being until you turn 18. Emancipated minors can sign documents on<br>their own behalf and can make decisions on their own behalf without<br>needing a parent or guardian.<br><br>However, other "age-restricted" functions of the state still remain: the<br>drinking age, the driving age, the age of consent, etc. Emancipation<br>pertains to anything which might require a parent or guardian's<br>signature, such as entering into a rental agreement for an apartment,<br>getting a job, etc. It also alleviates the parents of responsibility for<br>your actions.<br><br>Finally, you can date anyone you like. You just can't have sex with<br>them. That's illegal. Even states with "close-in-age" clauses to their<br>statutory rape laws require you to be within only a few years. An 8-year<br>difference is probably too much. Check your state's statutory rape laws<br>to be sure.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
