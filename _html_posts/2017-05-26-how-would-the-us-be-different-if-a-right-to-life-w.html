<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We don't need a right to life in the Bill of Rights. We already declared<br>in the Declaration of Independence that we have an unalienable right to<br>life:<br><br>> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created<br>> equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable<br>> Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of<br>> Happiness<br><br>I know what you're thinking. If we have this right to life in the<br>Declaration of Independence and we acknowledge that it is *unalienable*<br>(which means that we cannot divest ourselves of this right even if we<br>choose to do so), how were we able to allow abortion?<br><br>Note that nothing in the Declaration of Independence discusses *when<br>life begins*.<br><br>*Roe v. Wade* unequivocally determined that life begins at birth. In<br>allowing abortions as it does, it declared that fetuses are not<br>guaranteed the right to life that other citizens are. This means that<br>until they are born, they do not possess "life" as it is defined in the<br>Declaration, and therefore are not endowed with that right until then.<br><br>Perhaps you should re-word your question to ask, "How would the US be<br>different if a declaration of when life begins was in the Bill of<br>Rights?" That question would pose an entirely different set of<br>circumstances, and would be an interesting thought experiment.<br><br>But repeating what we already have in the Declaration of Independence<br>would be redundant and unnecessary in the framework of the Bill of<br>Rights.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
