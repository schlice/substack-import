Just tell your<br>Realtor the neighborhood and they can acquire the Covenants and the<br>Rules for your review. Even if you're not ready to move on a house, it's<br>still a good idea to be represented by a local Realtor.<br><br>Many HOAs post their Governing Documents online, as most HOAs have some<br>form of web presence by this point in time. You may be able to find the<br>documents with a simple search for the neighborhood.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
