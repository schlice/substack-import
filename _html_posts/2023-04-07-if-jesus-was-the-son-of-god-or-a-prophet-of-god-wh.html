<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> If Jesus was the son of God (or a prophet of God), why on Earth did he<br>> not write down the word of God?<br><br>Because it was already written down, thousands of years before He got<br>there.<br><br>Jesus, being a Jew, read from the Hebrew Bible. He actually came to<br>fulfill the prophesies which were already written.<br><br>After He died and was resurrected, others wrote about what He did.<br>Clearly, He wouldn't be writing about His own life. Others did that for<br>Him.<br><br>> If you answer that he was illiterate, would that not reflect badly on<br>> his own divine power?<br><br>The *hypostatic union* describes the person of Jesus: *fully human, and<br>fully God*, at the same time. He isn't some sort of superhuman, and He<br>isn't some sort of demi-God. He is fully human and fully divine.<br><br>But His divinity did not influence His humanity, and His humanity did<br>not influence His divinity. There are examples throughout the Bible of<br>both His humanity and His divinity, and neither were limited or<br>influenced by the other.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
