<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Bylaws controls how the HOA functions as a non-profit corporation,<br>along with the Articles of Incorporation. Those documents are necessary<br>for any corporation; they do not necessarily direct what happens at your<br>home. They do bind you in certain things, like voting for Directors or<br>Assessments payments.<br><br>What binds you as a homeowner to do or not do certain things is the<br>Declaration of Covenants (sometimes just called the "covenants" or the<br>"declaration").<br><br>Here's an example from my neighborhood's covenants:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-14824387acfbbef74859a02c385873f7){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-14824387acfbbef74859a02c385873f7" master_w="852"<br>master_h="253"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>That's a pretty broad definition of what comprises a "nuisance," isn't<br>it? And not everything that the Board might consider a "nuisance" is<br>actually listed there. It also says pretty clearly that the Board has<br>the authority to determine whether or not something is, or may become, a<br>nuisance.<br><br>The Declaration also usually allows the Board to make other rules and<br>regulations and update them as they see fit.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-4d26d30b021ef9f7897644e616873eb1){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-4d26d30b021ef9f7897644e616873eb1" master_w="843"<br>master_h="132"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>This says that the Board may develop, on their own, a "Rules and<br>Regulations" document, and you are bound by those rules as well. It also<br>says the Board can modify this document whenever they choose, but those<br>changes must be voted in during a Board meeting, which is open to<br>homeowners.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
