<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Of course he should not be dropped from the team *because* he<br>exercised his right to stand or sit during the National Anthem. He would<br>do well to realize that the men and women in uniform have fought and<br>died to preserve his right to make that choice. His refusal to honor the<br>nation because he believes in a totally false cause is disturbing, but<br>is still his choice. Military members remember Voltaire's famous quote:<br>"I may disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your<br>right to say it." Military members do not take it as disrespect if<br>someone chooses to make a political statement. In fact, that means the<br>ideals we fought for are still in place, and that's a heartening<br>feeling.<br><br>The 49ers should be worried about losing something else: fans.<br>People watch Monday Night Football (and now Sunday and Thursday) because<br>they want to *escape*. They want to get away from the turmoil of the<br>political sphere for a few hours, and escape into a simpler world which<br>involves nothing more than moving a ball. They want *entertainment.*<br>When players choose to use that platform and *politicize* it, they risk<br>alienating the very people who fund the leagues which pay him those<br>hefty salaries to use his athletic talents. If you start losing your<br>primary customers over your actions (regardless of how legal or proper<br>they are), you run the risk that your continued employment may<br>jeopardize the bottom line, and you can be dropped for that reason.<br><br>If you start distracting too much from the game, you can indeed be fired<br>for that. Kaepernick is a third-string quarterback, hardly the big draw<br>that the first and second string QBs are. He can be cut without too much<br>pain to the team. Making himself a distraction from *the game* does<br>not help strengthen the case for continued employment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
