<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The problem you are experiencing is one of *frame of reference.* The<br>reason you have a frame of reference problem is because ***morals are<br>relative***.<br><br>Unless we all hold to the same ultimate moral standard (which we do<br>not), everyone's morals can be different. We all are not Christian. We<br>all do not hold to the same ultimate moral authority (for Christians, it<br>is God). Therefore, if we do not all share the same ultimate moral<br>authority, morals are relative.<br><br>*But if everyone has their own ultimate moral authority, how do we<br>create civil society?*<br><br>The answer is law.<br><br>In a society of laws, the law becomes the base level of morals to which<br>everyone must adhere, regardless of their own personal moral standards.<br>Therefore, what is "civilised" is to *follow the law.*<br><br>Therefore, if capital punishment is *legal*, it is therefore *moral.*<br>Whether or not it is moral for *you* is not relevant. In society, the<br>only moral standard we can have is the law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
