<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said that two important ways to fix pay gap<br>are to stop asking for salary history and allow salary info to be shared<br>at work. What do you think about this proposal?**<br><br>It would do absolutely nothing to fix the gender pay gap.<br><br>First of all, it's already illegal to discriminate on the basis of sex.<br>The Equal Pay Act of 1963 ensured that men and women with equal skills<br>will get equal pay.<br><br>But the *Paycheck Fairness Act*, which AOC is pushing, won't do anything<br>to improve pay equality. Instead, it will tightly regulate how employers<br>compensate their employees (in the name of ensuring "fairness"), which<br>will do little more than eliminate things like the employer's ability to<br>tie your compensation with the quality of your work, or your time in<br>service. It will regulate what employers are allowed to pay employees,<br>which will only reduce workplace flexibility in pay, which will make pay<br>worse for everyone.<br><br>But hey, if you're a lawyer, you'll love this legislation, because it<br>will make it much easier for an employee to file a lawsuit alleging<br>unfair pay practices. So the bill is certainly good for one group of<br>employees.<br><br>So why are we still talking about these things?<br><br>Because the "women make 77 cents for every dollar a man makes" trope is<br>still out there, even though it's been debunked hundreds of times over.<br><br>Now, I'm not saying that there aren't dishonest employers who will seek<br>to underpay their employees every step of the way They do exist, and no<br>one who logically engages in this discussion supports that. No one truly<br>believes that a woman should make less than a man simply based on what's<br>between their legs. That is patently ridiculous.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
