<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Considering the risk of pregnancy and that only women's bodies are<br>being politicized around the US abortion debate, should it be considered<br>assault to ejaculate inside another person without their consent?**<br><br>No, for several reasons.<br><br>First, I'll ignore your "consideration" because it's a red herring, and<br>there's a lot we could say about the "risks" of pregnancy and<br>politicization of the abortion debate, and none of it has anything to do<br>with crime.<br><br>The only time that consent is required is before sex starts. Sex with<br>consent is legal, sex without consent is illegal. It's usually called<br>*rape*. (EDIT) Because people are misinterpreting that last sentence as<br>meaning *only* the first consent counts (which is not what I meant),<br>let me clarify: a woman can withdraw that initial consent at any time.<br>But that's really not what we're talking about.<br><br>Even without ejaculation, the seminal fluid at the tip of the penis<br>contains enough sperm to successfully inseminate a woman. So the risk of<br>pregnancy is still non-zero any time you engage in sex, ejaculation or<br>not.<br><br>This highlights the fact (which everyone seems to be missing) that **the<br>whole point of sex is to make babies**. If you don't consent to the<br>possibility that you may make a baby, you should probably avoid sex.<br>Because *each and every time you consent to sex, both initially and<br>ongoing, you imply that you consent to making a baby, because, as<br>previously mentioned,* ***consent to sex implies consent to making a<br>baby. These consents are not, and cannot, be separated.***<br><br>Otherwise, this scenario becomes a crime:<br><br>*\<sex ongoing\>*\<br>"Don't cum in me, okay?"\<br>"M'kay"\<br>*\<sex continues\>*\<br>"Don't cum in me, okay?"\<br>"M'kay"\<br>*\<sex continues\>*\<br>"Don't cum in me, okay?"\<br>"..............oops"<br><br>Are you proposing that *this* becomes a crime?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
