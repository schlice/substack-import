<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Florida is considered a "stop and ID" state. This means that if you are<br>stopped by law enforcement on suspicion of a crime or traffic violation,<br>you are expected to identify yourself. This also means that if the<br>officer does not have reasonable suspicion that you are involved in a<br>crime or a traffic violation, you do not have to identify yourself, but<br>that is the only time you are not obligated to positively identify<br>yourself.<br><br>The "stop and ID" law means you do have to identify yourself correctly<br>(about this, you cannot lie; lying about your identity would be a<br>separate offense). Usually your name and address are sufficient for an<br>officer to identify you.<br><br>The officer can ask you to *confirm* your identity. This means you must<br>present a valid form of identification if you have one on you. If you<br>are not driving a car, you do not have to have one on you. You don't<br>have to agree that the suspicion is reasonable before you confirm your<br>identity. Reasonableness is a matter of law to be decided by a judge.<br><br>Some other related rights you retain (especially important for<br>naturalized citizens or lawful permanent residents):<br><br>- You do not have to answer questions about where you were born, whether<br>  you're a U.S. citizen, or how you entered the country. (Separate rules<br>  apply at international borders and airports.)<br>- You are only expected to identify yourself to Florida law enforcement<br>  officers (police officers and Sheriff's deputies, not immigration or<br>  FBI agents) when you are stopped on suspicion of a crime or a traffic<br>  violation. If you don't have identification documents, you may choose<br>  to remain silent.<br>- You have zero obligation to provide your name or "show your papers" to<br>  an ICE officer for any reason.<br>- If you choose to volunteer information about your legal immigration<br>  status (i.e. "I am a permanent resident" or "I am here on a temporary<br>  visa,"), you only have the option to do so when you are carrying your<br>  papers and ready to show them.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice grearding specific facts.
