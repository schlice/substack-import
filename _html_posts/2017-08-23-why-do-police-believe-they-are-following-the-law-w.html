<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is actually only one question here:<br><br>> *Why do police they believe they are following the law, when they are<br>> enforcing state laws that violate the constitution?*<br><br>Police enforce state law. If a law is part of state law, the police<br>enforce it. The question presumes that police are allowed to selectively<br>enforce the law based on their view of the law's constitutionality, and<br>this is not the case. The police are required to enforce the law as it<br>is written until a court invalidates the law.<br><br>In actuality, a law may violate the Constitution, and be fully<br>enforceable, but it is only invalidated when the courts say that it<br>violates the Constitution.<br><br>In other words, a city or a state can enact a law which is in violation<br>of the Constitution. That law is valid until a court says that it is<br>unconstitutional. This means that someone must be charged under the law,<br>and that person must challenge the charge on the grounds that the law<br>violates the Constitution. If the courts find that the law does indeed<br>violate the Constitution, the law becomes unenforceable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
