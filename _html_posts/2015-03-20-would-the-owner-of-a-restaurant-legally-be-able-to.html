<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It\'s a tricky gray area. Being homosexual is not a<br>protected class under Federal law, but it may be protected under state<br>law, so depending on the state the restaurant is in, they *may* be able<br>to deny service to the couple if their presence hurts his business.\<br>\<br>But because this would generate a lot of controversy, the act itself may<br>be more damaging to the business than their presence anyway.\<br>\<br>I think he should close his restaurant. Then people won\'t have to worry<br>about eating in the same building as gays. For the life of me, I don\'t<br>understand what difference it makes, but I guess if this is the course<br>of action the restaurant owner is pursuing, he should probably just<br>close up shop now, or sell his restaurant to an owner who is more<br>compassionate.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
