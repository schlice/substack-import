<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Woody Allen once said, "If you want to make God laugh, tell Him about<br>your plans."<br><br>I'm curious. You say you broke a vow to God. So what you did is you<br>said, "God, I promise I will never do X," and you consider that a vow to<br>God?<br><br>Yep, I can hear Him laughing too.<br><br>News flash: *You didn't make a vow to God.* You told God your plans,<br>and He laughed. In order to be a true vow, you would have to make a<br>promise to someone, and they would have to agree to accept your promise.<br>Like in marriage, I pledge myself to my wife, and she pledges herself to<br>me, and we do this in front of witnesses, where we make a vow to each<br>other. You can't really do that with God.<br><br>It doesn't really matter what you think you're going to do. It doesn't<br>really matter what you say you're going to do. And it doesn't really<br>matter what you promise God you're going to do. **God is going to<br>fulfill His plans through you**. Not your plans, His plans.<br><br>He has a plan for you, to give you a hope and a future (cf Jeremiah<br>29:11). And God does not "change His mind" just because you "made a vow"<br>to Him. He's still going to fulfill His plans through you.<br><br>So instead of making promises to God that you simply do not have the<br>power of keeping, maybe you should instead ask God to show you His<br>plans, and allow you to come alongside Him and assist Him with<br>fulfilling His plan for your life *with Him*. It's much easier to work<br>together with God than to try to do your own thing, even if you promised<br>to do it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
