<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Nope. And Kennedy didn't make me proud to be American, either. He didn't<br>make me sad to be American, but he didn't make me proud.<br><br>Presidents don't make me proud to be an American. Ever. They can say<br>great words, but those come from speechwriters. Obama had masterful<br>speechwriters and he was a great orator, so he could evoke a great deal<br>of emotion. Good for him; he'll have a great career as a public speaker<br>now that he's left office.<br><br>I am proud to be an American because I have what the rest of the world<br>can only imagine, and some actively dream of: freedom. And there is<br>no one who will change that. No president will be able to take it away.<br>No one person will change it. My destiny is in my hands. Whether I<br>become a bzillionaire or whether I'll be a client at the soup kitchen<br>instead of a server is entirely up to me.<br><br>But we have to be vigilant, and *maintain* that freedom, or one day,<br>"...we will spend our sunset years telling our children, and our<br>children's children, what it was once like in the United States when men<br>were free." That was part of a speech that Ronald Reagan gave.<br><br>I'm proud to be an American because of the *Constitution.* I'm proud of<br>the Constitution and what it stands for. Politicians don't do anything<br>for me, as they all support and defend the Constitution, just like I<br>did. I'm proud of what the Constitution represents to us, and the<br>freedoms it guarantees. And I'm proud that I was, for a short time, part<br>of the band of brothers who was on the front lines "supporting and<br>defending" that Constitution and our way of life.<br><br>Maybe it's because it feels a little different when you've pledged to<br>give your life in your country's defense. Maybe it's a lack of<br>historical context that causes you to be proud of a country because it<br>has a great orator as its elected leader. But for me, the president is<br>just the head of the executive branch. There are three branches of<br>government, and none is supposed to be more powerful than any of the<br>others. This "balance of power" is what was originally designed to keep<br>our country from becoming a dictatorship or a monarchy or an oligarchy.<br>And so far, it's done a pretty good job. Did a president do that? Did a<br>Congressman or a Supreme Court judge do that? It is only the<br>Constitution that did that.<br><br>And it is only our *belief* in the ideals written there, and our<br>*willingness* to further those ideals, that keep the ship upright. The<br>fact that we've endured as a Constitutional Republic for more than 200<br>years is testament to the willingness of the population to do just that.<br><br>We don't support a President. We support a Constitution.<br><br>THAT is why I'm proud to be an American.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
