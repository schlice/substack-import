If you meet the<br>requirements to buy cannabis, you can buy CBD oil.<br><br>The requirements vary by state. Some states allow medical marijuana,<br>which requires special permission from the state, and the requirements<br>for each state differ. Some states have decriminalized possession of<br>small quantities of marijuana. And two states (Washington and Colorado)<br>have made recreational possession legal.
