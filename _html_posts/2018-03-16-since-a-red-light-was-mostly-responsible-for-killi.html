<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Since a red light was mostly responsible for killing those six people<br>under that Miami bridge, do you think we should now outlaw red lights?**<br><br>No.<br><br>The only object which operated outside of its normal operating<br>parameters was the bridge, so the proximate cause of the deaths was the<br>bridge. It was the bridge that crushed the cars, not the red light.<br><br>The cars may still have been crushed even if the light was green and<br>they just happened to be under the bridge at that time. And if the cars<br>had failed to follow the law and failed to stop for the red light, they<br>might not have been crushed, or might still have been crushed depending<br>on when they decided to run the light. So the light itself was not the<br>proximate cause of the death, as adherence to the light, or even a<br>different color of light, could have still seen people die.<br><br>Following your logic, the people were in cars at the time they were<br>crushed, so we should now outlaw cars because you can get crushed inside<br>of them.<br><br>Additionally, those people in those cars were outside of their homes at<br>the time they were crushed. Therefore, people should not be allowed to<br>leave their homes any longer, because they could get crushed by bridges.<br><br>The insanity can continue, but really, the only cause that is proximate<br>to the death was the failing bridge. Don't try to put the blame anywhere<br>else.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
