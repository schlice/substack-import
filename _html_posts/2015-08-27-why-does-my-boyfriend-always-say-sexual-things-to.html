<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [He says those things because he\'s into<br>[BDSM(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c1abf6&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDSM){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. There\'s a myriad of<br>different configurations and permutations of it, but it always involves<br>some form or combination of bondage, domination, sadism, or massochism.<br>Sadists enjoy being the punishers, and massochists enjoy being<br>punished.\<br>\<br>Generally, the BDSM community includes informed consent when they engage<br>in power-unequal relationship types like this.\<br>\<br>I would suggest you talk to your boyfriend about it, especially if you<br>are not interested in such a power-imbalanced<br>relationship.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
