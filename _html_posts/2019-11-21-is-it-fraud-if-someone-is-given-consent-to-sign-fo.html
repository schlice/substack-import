<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it fraud if I give you consent to sign for me?<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>Depending on the document you intend to grant someone else permission to<br>sign on your behalf, there may be a legal process you must go through in<br>order to grant that permission. In most cases, you'll need to use this<br>procedure in order to have someone else legally sign for you; most<br>reputable businesses won't accept someone else's signature in your<br>behalf without this procedure being followed.<br><br>You will need to produce a special document. It's called a "Special<br>Power of Attorney." It's a document that you sign and notarize that<br>allows someone else to sign a document as you. It basically says that<br>you grant so-and-so permission to sign as you on the following<br>documents, and then you list the documents. The power is limited to the<br>documents you specify; the person can't take that document and then go<br>buy a car in your name using your credit (unless that's the document you<br>are allowing them to sign).<br><br>The signer then takes your notarized power of attorney and signs the<br>document "Jane Doe, attorney-in-fact for John Doe" and a copy of the PoA<br>must be attached to the document.<br><br>Then, and only then, can you and the signer not be accused of fraud.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
