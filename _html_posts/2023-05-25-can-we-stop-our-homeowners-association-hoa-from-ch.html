<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, the two are unrelated.<br><br>You still have to pay late fees if you are late on a dues or a fine<br>payment.<br><br>If the HOA failed to *even attempt* to have an annual meeting, you can<br>sue the HOA for violating state law. Usually though, they don't "fail"<br>to have a meeting, because the bylaws usually state that they have to<br>"attempt" to have a meeting, which means they have to send out meeting<br>notices and proxy forms to homeowners, who have the option of<br>participating or not. In many cases, they don't.<br><br>If the Board doesn't have enough attendance (both in-person and by<br>proxy) to lawfully hold an annual meeting with the percentage of<br>homeowners required in the bylaws, then they cannot hold an annual<br>meeting. Whether or not they try again, and how many times they try, is<br>also dependent on your individual governing documents.<br><br>So it could happen that no annual meeting takes place, but it is<br>perfectly legal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
