<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is yes, but it's not quite so simple.<br><br>There is currently a battle raging between the Biden administration and<br>Congress.<br><br>Following the overturn of *Roe v. Wade*, Biden crafted an Executive<br>Order which directed the Department of Health and Human Services to<br>ensure that abortifacient drugs are available to anyone who wants them.<br>HHS, in turn, sent guidance to 60,000 pharmacies nationwide, warning<br>their employees of harsh "corrective action" against anyone who refuses<br>to comply. The guidelines say, for instance, that if a pharmacist<br>refuses to fill an order for mifepristone or misoprostol "because these<br>medications can also be used to terminate a pregnancy --- the pharmacy<br>may be discriminating on the basis of sex." HHS adds that pharmacies<br>could open themselves up to legal action if they sell any kind of birth<br>control, such as condoms, but refuse to dispense the morning-after pill<br>or other forms of so-called "emergency contraception."<br><br>It's interesting to note that the *Dobbs* ruling stated very clearly<br>that abortifacient drugs, and abortion itself, is not sex<br>discrimination, and the Court has found this result many times over.<br>Just because it only applies to women doesn't make it discrimination<br>based on sex.<br><br>While legally dubious (but when has the administration cared about being<br>legally accurate), the Biden administration directive implies that<br>pro-life pharmacists may not be safe from government-instigated legal<br>actions, ***even though federal law formally protects conscience<br>rights***. Although the document notes the same office implements the<br>Church Amendments, which protect pro-life medical employees from having<br>to take part in an abortion if it violates their "religious beliefs or<br>moral convictions," it says the law will be evaluated "on a case-by-case<br>basis."<br><br>Congress, for its part, vociferously disagrees with HHS' stance. "You<br>can pass all the legislation you want. You can sign every executive<br>order that you want to sign. But if you think you're going to force a<br>pharmacist to go against their moral obligation to take care of<br>patients, to take care of babies, and dispense a prescription that's<br>going to be used for abortion: Good luck with that," Rep. Buddy Carter<br>(R-Ga.) vowed defiantly on the House floor.<br><br>"This is simply ludicrous and an obvious overreach," Carter, who served<br>as a pharmacist and co-chairs the Congressional Community Pharmacy<br>Caucus, said in a<br>[statement(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9102b2&url=https://tonyperkins.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="tonyperkins.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>So Biden and HHS is basically telling pharmacists that they can follow<br>their conscience, but it will be legally costly, because HHS will be<br>pursuing legal "corrective action" which the pharmacist will have to<br>defend. Federal law protects the pharmacist, but that clearly won't stop<br>HHS from pursuing legal action against pharmacists.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can pharmacists refuse to fill prescriptions for drugs that can be used<br>in abortions?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
