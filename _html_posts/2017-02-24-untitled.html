<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Thank you for sharing your story. It was indeed tough to read. No one<br>deserves that kind of treatment; I'm glad that I'm *from* New York, not<br>there anymore.<br><br>When we suspect an inmate is faking, we still take them to the hospital,<br>but we warn them ahead of time that if the doctor confirms that there is<br>nothing wrong, they will incur loss of privilege when they return. And<br>crying wolf doesn't bode well for future times when something may be<br>really wrong.<br><br>I will be sure to keep your story in mind in the future.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-incident-has-traumatized-you-for-good/answer/Christin-Taggart<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
