<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Please explain how God can do something evil.<br><br>In order for God to do something evil, there must be a source of<br>morality to which God is subject.<br><br>*What source of morality is greater than God?*<br><br>Therefore, in order to answer this question, **you must ground your<br>morality**. From where do you get your morality? What is the source of<br>morality that both you and God are subject to? From where did this<br>morality originate?<br><br>If you cannot answer the question about where the morality came from,<br>then you are *self-referential*. That means that everyone can build<br>their own morality, and the definition of evil is individualized to the<br>person.<br><br>But we know intuitively that this is incorrect. Everyone, everywhere,<br>knows that murder is wrong and that courage is better than cowardice.<br>University of Texas at Austin professor J. Budziszewski writes,<br>"Everyone knows certain principles. There is no land where murder is<br>virtue and gratitude vice." C. S. Lewis, who has written profoundly on<br>this topic in his classic work Mere Christianity, put it this way:<br>"Think of a country where people were admired for running away in<br>battle, or where a man felt proud of double-crossing all the people who<br>had been kindest to him. You might just as well try to imagine a country<br>where two and two made five."<br><br>In other words, everyone knows there are absolute moral obligations. An<br>absolute moral obligation is something that is binding on all people, at<br>all times, in all places. And an absolute Moral Law implies an absolute<br>Moral Law Giver.<br><br>Now this does not mean that every moral issue has easily recognizable<br>answers or that some people don't deny that absolute morality exists.<br>There are difficult problems in morality, and people suppress and deny<br>the Moral Law every day. It simply means that there are basic principles<br>of right and wrong that everyone knows, whether they will admit them or<br>not. Budziszewski calls this basic knowledge of right and wrong "what we<br>can't not know," in his book by that title.<br><br>We can't not know, for example, that it is wrong to kill innocent human<br>beings for no reason. Some people may deny it and commit murder anyway,<br>but deep in their hearts they know murder is wrong. Even serial killers<br>know murder is wrong---they just may not feel remorse. And like all<br>absolute moral laws, murder is wrong for everyone, everywhere: in<br>America, India, Zimbabwe, and in every other country, now and forever.<br>That's what the Moral Law tells every human heart.<br><br>In fact, we know the Moral Law exists. The Moral Argument tells us that<br>God exists:<br><br>1.  Every law has a law giver.<br>2.  The Moral Law exists.<br>3.  Therefore, there is a Moral Law giver.<br><br>But is it really true that there is a Moral Law? Our Founding Fathers<br>thought so. As Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of<br>Independence, "Nature's Law" is "self-evident." You don't use reason to<br>discover it, you just know it. Perhaps that's why people know that<br>helping others is the right thing to do, but they can't explain *why*<br>without appealing to a standard outside themselves. Without an<br>objective standard of meaning and morality, then life is meaningless<br>and there's nothing absolutely right or wrong. Everything is merely a<br>matter of opinion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
