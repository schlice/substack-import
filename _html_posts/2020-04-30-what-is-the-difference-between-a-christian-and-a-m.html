<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the difference between a Christian and a Mormon in terms of<br>beliefs, and are they similar?**<br><br>First, Christianity is different from *every other religion in the<br>world* in that Christianity is the only world religion which says that<br>there is nothing you can do to earn your salvation, only grace saves<br>you. Every other world religion, including Mormonism, says that there is<br>something you must do in order to earn your salvation.<br><br>Additionally, Mormonism *is not* Christian. There are many ways in which<br>Mormonism lies in direct contrast with the Bible, but they explain that<br>this is because the Bible was translated inaccurately. They believe that<br>the Book of Mormon is a more complete teaching, and that the Book of<br>Mormon is more correct than the Bible. If you want to really determine<br>the orthodoxy of any particular religion, just look at how they view<br>Jesus. Just ask them the question, "Who do you say Jesus is?" Mormons<br>view Jesus as divine, but not deity. They view Jesus as exemplary, a<br>great teacher, but not as a penal substitution for our sins. These are<br>core Christian beliefs. Mormonism doesn't believe in *sola fides* (only<br>grace saves you), they believe in faith AND works. They don't believe in<br>*sola Scriptura* (God's word is only in the Bible), they believe in the<br>Bible AND another book. There are more examples, but these are a few.<br><br>There are many varied differences between Mormonism and Christianity,<br>and they are well documented. I don't need to go through them here. Feel<br>free to look them up at your leisure. Suffice it to say that they are<br>vastly different in what they believe, but the main differences are the<br>way you gain salvation and belief in Jesus as God.<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being<br>isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I<br>wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is<br>un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m<br>wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,<br>not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,<br>you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.<br>Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be<br>followed by a block and a mute. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br>*In this specific case, please don't bother trying to tell me that<br>Mormons don't believe what I said because something-or-other isn't in an<br>"official" Mormon teaching. If it's not in a Church-sanctioned book,<br>fine. But why have Mormon apostles and high officials written them and<br>taught them? Why are they still, to this day, sold in Mormon bookstores?<br>Why hasn't the official Church leadership come out and denounced them?<br>Mormons are taught these things, with or without tacit approval from the<br>Church leadership.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
