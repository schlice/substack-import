<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, and that was the whole purpose of the 14th Amendment.<br><br>The Reconstruction Amendments (13--15) were added to the Constitution<br>following the Civil War. In order for the southern states to be<br>re-admitted into the Union, they had to ratify these Amendments. The<br>14th Amendment says, in part, that everyone is treated equally under the<br>law:<br><br>> All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to<br>> the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the<br>> State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law<br>> which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the<br>> United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life,<br>> liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any<br>> person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.<br><br>There are three main parts to the Amendment:<br><br>- the Privileges and Immunities clause<br>- the Due Process clause, and<br>- the Equal Protection clause<br><br>The text of your question is answered by the Equal Protection clause:<br>"nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of<br>the laws." That means that this doesn't just apply to US citizens. Note<br>to whom it applies: any person within \the state's\ jurisdiction.<br>It applies to all persons, not just all citizens.<br><br>Now, that doesn't mean this always happens, but it is what the<br>Constitution says.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Do constitutional protections apply for all US citizens equally?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
