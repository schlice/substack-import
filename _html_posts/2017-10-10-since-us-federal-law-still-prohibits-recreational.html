  highways are federally funded, can one get charged with possession if pulled over
  while driving from Washington State to Oregon? Would driving on state roads be different?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Colorado has done this, but they have done it in a way which does not<br>violate the 14th Amendment (Federal law applies to states). The way this<br>works is that the state Constitution provides an affirmative defense<br>against any state charges which might be related to possession of<br>marijuana for personal use. In other words, it's still illegal, and you<br>can still be charged, but because there is an affirmative defense in the<br>state Constitution, those charges will never stick, so effectively there<br>is no charge at the state level. There are still laws regarding selling<br>and distributing marijuana, so if you are caught with multiple kilos of<br>marijuana, this would be an intent to distribute, and you have to be<br>licensed by the state to do that, so you can still be charged there. You<br>can still be charged with lots of other crimes related to marijuana<br>also, but if you're simply a recreational user in possession of<br>recreational quantities of marijuana for personal use, you won't be<br>charged. The law limits how much marijuana you can possess for personal<br>use at any time.<br><br>Additionally, your question regarding interstate highways would be valid<br>only if you leave the state. The affirmative defense is only valid in<br>the state of Colorado, and highway laws are enforced by the state, not<br>the Federal government. Money from the Fed comes to the state first, and<br>the state then uses the money to pay for the highway system, so<br>technically (and technicalities matter), it's the state that pays for<br>the interstate highway within the state borders, but the interstate<br>nature of the highway necessitates assistance from the Federal<br>government to do it.<br><br>Anyone who intends to purchase marijuana in Colorado should acquaint<br>themselves with the laws here regarding how you can get it, where you<br>can use it, and how you can get it from where you buy it to where you<br>use it. Since Federal highway use is enforced at the state level within<br>the state, you would be protected by the state constitution within the<br>state. Those same state laws say you cannot leave the state with<br>marijuana under any circumstance. Once you leave the state, the issue<br>becomes a very clear *interstate commerce* issue, and you are clearly<br>under Federal jurisdiction, not state jurisdiction, so the state<br>protections vanish at the border.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
