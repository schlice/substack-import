Can I pray for him to be blessed with serenity,<br>> courage, and wisdom?<br><br>You could, but who would be granting that prayer? To whom would you be<br>praying? And why would you think that God did not have these things? He<br>is all-powerful, eternal and omnipotent. He lacks nothing; he already<br>has everything. So you could pray for these things, but it doesn't make<br>much sense.<br><br>> I only pray for others. I learned long ago that my prayers for myself<br>> were unanswered.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-580a0d6493923558409fa0b4eac4cf8b){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-580a0d6493923558409fa0b4eac4cf8b" master_w="888"<br>master_h="499"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>I don't mean to be a Negative Nell here, but if the prayers you prayed<br>for yourself were unanswered, what makes you think that the prayers you<br>pray for others will be answered? It doesn't make any sense to me.<br><br>Personally, it sounds like you're praying incorrectly. It sounds like<br>you're thinking of God like a vending machine. You put the prayers in<br>the little coin slot and you expect the answered prayers to come out of<br>the door at the bottom. But for some reason, God isn't giving you what<br>you're asking for.<br><br>So there's a number of reasons why you may not be receiving answers to<br>your prayers<br><br>- What you are asking for will eventually harm you<br>- What you are asking for is not part of God's good plan for you<br>- God may be answering you, but in a way you didn't expect.<br><br>First, it could be that what you are asking for will eventually harm<br>you. You may not see it now, but God does. He knows your entire future,<br>and along with the next bullet, He has a plan for you.<br><br>> "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to<br>> prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."<br>> --- Jeremiah 29:11 NIV<br><br>Along with that, it could be that what you are asking for is not part of<br>His plan for you. We also know that God doesn't frequently tell us His<br>plans for us.<br><br>Finally, it may be that God is answering your prayer, but not in a way<br>that you expect.<br><br>> *I asked for strength,\<br>> And God gave me difficulties to make me strong;*<br>><br>> *I asked for wisdom,\<br>> And God gave me problems to learn to solve;*<br>><br>> *I asked for prosperity,\<br>> And God gave me brain and brawn to work;*<br>><br>> *I asked for courage,\<br>> And God gave me dangers to overcome;*<br>><br>> *I asked for love,\<br>> And God gave me people to help;*<br>><br>> *I asked for favors,\<br>> And God gave me opportunities.*<br>><br>> *I received nothing I wanted -- I received everything I needed.\<br>> My prayer has been answered!*<br>><br>> *--- Author Unknown*<br><br>So you may not be receiving anything you asked for, but you may be<br>receiving everything you needed.<br><br>The bottom line is that God's good plan will be enacted in your life. So<br>perhaps instead of asking God for things, ask God to let you in on His<br>plan for you, because life goes so much smoother when you work *with*<br>God rather than working *against* Him. Ask him for wisdom to see His<br>plan for you in your life, and ask Him to bless you with the knowledge<br>that He will prosper you, and the comfort of knowing that He will keep<br>His promises.<br><br>If you still want to ask for something in specific, ask that He do<br>something *if it is part of His plan for us.* But tell Him that you<br>understand that His will will be done regardless, so if He doesn't give<br>you what you're asking for, it's because what you are asking for is not<br>part of His plan.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
