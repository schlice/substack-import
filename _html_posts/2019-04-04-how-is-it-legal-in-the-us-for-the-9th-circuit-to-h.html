<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How is it legal (in the US) for the 9th Circuit to have blocked a<br>Presidential order?**<br><br>The Constitution.<br><br>Article III of the Constitution says that a federal court can decide an<br>Executive Order case when there are "Controversies to which the United<br>States shall be a Party." The Supreme Court has interpreted this to mean<br>that plaintiffs who can claim a true "injury in fact" caused by the EO<br>are allowed to bring cases.<br><br>If a plaintiff can show a true injury caused by the EO, a federal judge<br>can rule that the EO is either illegal or unconstitutional. That ruling<br>can, of course, be appealed to the Supreme Court, who would have the<br>final say.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
