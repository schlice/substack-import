<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Detention legally occurs when the person being questioned "feels like"<br>they can't leave. No specific words have to be said. You simply must<br>"feel like" you can't leave and that counts as detention.<br><br>If you are ordered to stay, you are being detained. You must be read<br>your rights before any statements you make are legally admissible in<br>court. So if the officer tells you to stay and then questions you, feel<br>free to tell him you killed your girlfriend, because it's not admissible<br>if he didn't read you your rights.<br><br>But how often are you killing your girlfriend? And how often are you<br>told to stay and then asked questions which might implicate you later<br>on?<br><br>Yeah, hardly ever. You're more likely to be bitten by a shark, twice,<br>than have that happen to you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-it-illegal-in-Texas-to-not-comply-with-an-officers-order-when-you-have-not-committed-any-crimes-If-you-are-a-bystander-and-a-police-officer-tells-you-to-sit-down-and-you-do-not-comply-is-this-a-crime/answer/David-Rosen-5<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
