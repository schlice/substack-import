<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How does the US southern border fit the definition of a National<br>Emergency, ie, a "situation beyond the ordinary which threatens the<br>health or safety of citizens and which cannot be properly addressed by<br>the use of other law"?**<br><br>While I can appreciate your attempt at a definition, there is no legal<br>standard by which the President must follow before declaring a national<br>emergency.<br><br>But the situation at the southern border most definitely fits what you<br>described:<br><br>- A situation beyond the ordinary - the situation at the Southern<br>  border, where people openly violate US law and enter the country<br>  illegally by the thousands every day is definitely beyond the ordinary<br>- which threatens the health or safety of citizens - there are<br>  several arguments which prove that illegal immigration threatens the<br>  health and safety of our citizens. Just ask Angel Families.<br>- and which cannot be properly addressed by the use of other law - I<br>  think it's fair to say that existing laws (i.e. funding for border<br>  construction through Congress' macchinations) are not adequate to<br>  address the immediate need at the border.<br><br>You can be sure that there will be both political and legal challenges<br>to this state of national emergency. It will be fascinating to see how<br>it all shakes out.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
