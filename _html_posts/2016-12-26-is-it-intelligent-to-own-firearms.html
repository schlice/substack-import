<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Actually, it is not only the most intelligent thing you can do, it is<br>the most civilized of actions you can undertake in a free society.<br><br>Interactions between people in a civilized society can happen in one of<br>two ways: reason or force. You can either use reason and oration to<br>convince me to exercise my free will and do what you want willingly, or<br>you can overpower me with force and compel me to do what you want<br>unwillingly.<br><br>The gun is the great equalizer. The gun is the only tool available which<br>sets the 105 pound octogenarian on equal footing with the 230 pound<br>assailant, the lone female on equal footing with her armed male<br>aggressor, or the homosexual on equal footing with the truckload of<br>drunken homophobes. Without the gun, we accept domination and control by<br>the strong, the armed, or the many. The gun removes these advantages and<br>sets everyone in society on equal footing. The advert from the mid 1800s<br>for Colt Arms said it best: "God made man, Sam Colt made them equal."<br><br>When carrying a gun, I force you to use reason, removing force as an<br>option for our interaction. In a utopian society, there is no force;<br>only reason is used to compel one person to do another person's bidding.<br>Carrying a gun forces you to interact with me in the way closest to what<br>a utopian society would provide.<br><br>Therefore, carrying a gun is the most civilized thing you can do in a<br>free society.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
