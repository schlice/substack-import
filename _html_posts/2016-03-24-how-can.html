<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The same state motor vehicle code which lists the infraction, in<br>general, allows for the state to employ parking enforcement agents who<br>are not sworn peace officers. If it\'s not in the motor vehicle code,<br>it\'s in the city or state statutes. This only makes sense from a<br>cost-saving perspective. It costs the state far more to equip, train,<br>and employ a peace officer than it does to equip, train, and employ a<br>parking enforcement agent. There are no \"functions\" which are<br>exclusively \"reserved\" for peace officers other than what is specified<br>in city or state statutes. It is purely statutory, and the state can<br>choose to farm out enforcement of any city code to any agency.<br><br>For example, our school district security has the power to write city<br>parking tickets, which are fully enforceable in municipal court. This<br>was done through city regulation, so if you\'re parking unlawfully in a<br>fire zone or handicapped spot in one of our school parking lots, school<br>security can write you a parking ticket which the city will log and<br>track.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
