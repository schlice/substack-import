<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not just "biblical literalists." Scientists believe in the existence of<br>Adam and Eve, too. They simply refuse to admit the correlation between<br>our DNA ancestors and the Adam and Eve from the Bible. We know from<br>investigation that "Y-chromosomal Adam" and "Mitochondrial Eve" existed.<br>We even know they existed about the same time. Skeptics though do not<br>believe that the two even knew each other. Nevertheless, we know that<br>they both existed.<br><br>If you believe that the Bible is indeed the inspired word of God, there<br>is no reason to think that anything written in it is simply "didactic<br>fiction."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
