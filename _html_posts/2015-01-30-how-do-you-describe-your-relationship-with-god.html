<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You have no idea why He is keeping you alive.\<br>\<br>I get that feeling.\<br>\<br>I know a former hard core drug dealer here in town who was up on meth<br>for like 19 days, fell asleep at the wheel, and jumped her car off of an<br>overpass. Amazingly, she lived. Long story short, she got clean and is<br>now a successful businesswoman and a pastor. She ministers to other<br>people who are where she was 10+ years ago. And He\'s still not done<br>with her!\<br>\<br>The hardest thing for a believer to do is to recognize *and accept* that<br>He really has a plan for your life, and that you have to trust Him to<br>lead you down the path that He desires for you.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
