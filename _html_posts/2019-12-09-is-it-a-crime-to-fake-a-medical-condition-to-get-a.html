It is also<br>fraud by misrepresentation.<br><br>In some cases, the airline might simply [[refuse to transport the<br>passenger](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=84f5c5&url=https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/woman-fakes-illness-flight-police-say/index.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cnn.com"}]{.qlink_container} rather than pressing charges of<br>theft, but it is indeed a crime in the United States.<br><br>We often see this with people who use their 1st Amendment right to<br>freedom of expression to wear military uniforms when they did not serve<br>in the military. You can feel free to wear a military uniform. You can<br>even feel free to claim you were in the military. All perfectly legal,<br>and Constitutionally protected. But once you use that uniform to get 10%<br>off your latte at Starbuck's, you're committing theft.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
