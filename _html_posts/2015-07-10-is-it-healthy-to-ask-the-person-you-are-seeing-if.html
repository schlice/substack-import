<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I think any relationship, sexual or otherwise, should be<br>handled with open, honest conversation. Tell her your needs and your<br>wants. Ask her if you are providing her with everything she wants and/or<br>needs. Is there something else you can do to make her happier, either in<br>or out of bed?\<br>\<br>Don\'t focus the conversation on sex, focus it on your relationship as a<br>whole. I think if you can talk openly and honestly about anything, you<br>will have a more fulfilling relationship.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
