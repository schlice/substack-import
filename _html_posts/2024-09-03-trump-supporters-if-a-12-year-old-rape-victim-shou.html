<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This question is an example of the logical fallacy known as a "false<br>equivalence."<br><br>A false equivalence or false equivalency is an informal fallacy<br>in which an equivalence is drawn between two subjects based on flawed or<br>false reasoning. This fallacy is categorized as a fallacy of<br>inconsistency. Colloquially, a false equivalence is often called<br>\"comparing apples and oranges.\"\[1\](#WylWS){#cite-WylWS<br>.citation_link}<br><br>Comparing the desire for equal rights to life for babies and mothers<br>with the desire to not expose elementary school children to materials<br>discussing sexual orientation, more so than just base biology, are two<br>totally separate issues. The existence of one doesn't impact the<br>reasoning behind the other. This is why the comparison is false.<br><br>The only comparison I can make here is "if we prohibit one degeneracy<br>(killing babies), then we should perhaps prohibit more degeneracies<br>(discussions about sexual proclivities)." But that discussion is a<br>stretch, because clearly the proponents of both of these degeneracies<br>don't believe they are degeneracies.<br><br>So yes, it is absolutely a false equivalence. The two topics are totally<br>unrelated.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-WylWS){.citation_index} [[False equivalence -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f30d72&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
