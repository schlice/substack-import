<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can I really be evicted in Florida with a 3-day notice for reasons<br>other than non-payment?**<br><br>You can't be evicted in 3 days. Your lease can be terminated in either 3<br>or 7 days, and you may have the opportunity to correct your breach of<br>contract. Eviction requires a court order.<br><br>For reasons other than non-payment, if you materially breach your rental<br>agreement, you either have 7 days to "cure" it (or fix it, if it is of a<br>"fixable nature"), or you have 7 days to "quit" the unit (i.e. move<br>out). If the item is not of a fixable nature, the landlord can simply<br>tell you that your lease is terminated and you have 7 days to move out.<br><br>If it is fixable (i.e. activities in contravention of the lease or<br>Florida statute such as having or permitting unauthorized pets, guests,<br>or vehicles; parking in an unauthorized manner or permitting such<br>parking; or failing to keep the premises clean and sanitary), the<br>landlord will present you with a 7-day "cure or quit" notice which<br>reads:<br><br>> You are hereby notified that (cite the noncompliance) . Demand is<br>> hereby made that you remedy the noncompliance within 7 days of receipt<br>> of this notice or your lease shall be deemed terminated and you shall<br>> vacate the premises upon such termination. If this same conduct or<br>> conduct of a similar nature is repeated within 12 months, your tenancy<br>> is subject to termination without your being given an opportunity to<br>> cure the noncompliance.<br><br>In other words, you have one chance to fix it, and if you do you can<br>stay, but if you break the lease terms again within a year, your lease<br>will be terminated without the opportunity to fix it.<br><br>If it is not a breach that is of a fixable nature (i.e. destruction,<br>damage, or misuse of the landlord's or other tenants' property by<br>intentional act or a subsequent or continued unreasonable disturbance,<br>etc), or you committed a curable breach of lease agreement within the<br>past 12 months, the landlord will provide the following notice:<br><br>> You are advised that your lease is terminated effective immediately.<br>> You shall have 7 days from the delivery of this letter to vacate the<br>> premises. This action is taken because (cite the noncompliance) .<br><br>If the breach of rental agreement is for non-payment, the landlord<br>can serve you with a 3-day "cure or quit" notice which means you have<br>three days (excluding weekends and holidays) to pay your rent or leave<br>the unit.<br><br>Once the appropriate time frame is up, and you either haven't paid,<br>haven't fixed the issue, and you haven't moved out, the landlord will<br>have to file in court to have you forcibly evicted.<br><br>*(Source: Fl Stat 83.56)*<br><br>**TL;DR: 3 day notices in Florida are for non-payment. Other lease<br>terminations not for non-payment result in a 7-day notice. Whether or<br>not you can stay depends on the violation. Eviction happens when your<br>lease has been terminated and you haven't moved out, and your landlord<br>goes to court to get an eviction notice.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
