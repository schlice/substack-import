<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is your opinion of assault rifles being renamed as \"people<br>killing machines\"?**<br><br>It's like renaming "cars" as "people moving machines." Except that in<br>the case of guns, it's designed to inflame.<br><br>**Let's be honest. If you didn't know by now that guns are people<br>killing machines, you must have been living under a rock until now.**<br><br>This is only "news" to the people who are swayed by "news."<br><br>And it's only relevant if there is never a valid reason under which a<br>person can be killed.<br><br>In the United States, there are at least two valid reasons under which a<br>person can be killed: *self-defense* and *resistance to tyranny*.<br><br>Poo-poo on those ideas all you want, but according to the Constitution<br>and subsequent case law (many decades of it), those two are actual, core<br>functions of the Second Amendment.<br><br>*Since killing a person is reasonable and not unlawful in at least one<br>circumstance, why would you not use the most efficient "people-killing<br>machine" to which you had access to do it?* You'd want to use the<br>machine which had the best chance of stopping whatever violent act you<br>were trying to stop, with the smallest amount of possibility that you'll<br>accidentally harm someone other than your intended target.<br><br>Guns put a tremendous amount of force on a person with near pinpoint<br>accuracy. They take a little bit to master (like cars), but once you do,<br>you can apply tremendous force at standoff distances, with nearly zero<br>risk of harm to the operator.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
