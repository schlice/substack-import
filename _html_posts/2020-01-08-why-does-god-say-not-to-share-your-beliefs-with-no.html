<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why does God say not to share your beliefs with non-believers?<br><br>The Bible does reference non-believers, but it doesn't say to not share<br>your beliefs with them.<br><br>The Bible actually talks about "being yolked to" non-believers, or<br>receiving them into your house (which is accepted to mean that you<br>welcome them into your life and the life of your family).<br><br>> *Do not be deceived: "Bad company ruins good morals." --- 1 Cor 15:33<br>> ESV*<br>><br>> *Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has<br>> righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with<br>> darkness? --- 2 Cor 6:14 ESV*<br><br>Paul does make an exception for marriage, stating that marriage between<br>a non-believer and a believer can benefit both:<br><br>> *If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to<br>> live with her, she should not divorce him. For the unbelieving husband<br>> is made holy because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made<br>> holy because of her husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean,<br>> but as it is, they are holy. --- 1 Cor 7:13--14 ESV*<br><br>But it does indeed say that you should share your beliefs with everyone.<br>In fact, it's exactly what Jesus instructed His disciples to do just<br>before He left the Earth. It's what Christians call the Great<br>Commission:<br><br>> *Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where<br>> Jesus had told them to go. When they saw him, they worshiped him; but<br>> some doubted. Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in<br>> heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make<br>> disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and<br>> of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey<br>> everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to<br>> the very end of the age." --- Matthew 28:16--20 NIV*<br><br>TL;DR: While we should indeed be wary of being swayed by the<br>non-believers, we should indeed make every effort to bring them the<br>Gospel message:<br><br>> *For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that<br>> whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. ---<br>> John 3:16 NIV*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
