<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Congress can't "guarantee a right to an abortion," because the<br>Constitution guarantees rights. Laws cannot guarantee rights, as laws<br>can be overturned by other laws, or by the Constitution through the<br>courts. Only the Constitution can guarantee rights will not be abridged,<br>as the Constitution can only be amended by another Constitutional<br>amendment.<br><br>That said, yes, Congress can pass federal abortion laws. While there are<br>limits to what Congress can legislate, they can certainly put something<br>together, in the same way that they passed the federal Partial Birth<br>Abortion Ban Act, which was upheld in 2007. This law was grounded in the<br>Commerce Clause, so there is a mechanism for a willing Congress to pass<br>such a law.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Could the US Congress have ever passed a federal law guaranting \sic\<br>a woman's right to an abortion? Could they do it now if they were<br>willing?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
