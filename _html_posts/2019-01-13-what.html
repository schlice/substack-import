<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Building on [[Tom<br>Martin](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tom-Martin-385)]{.qlink_container}\'s<br>answer, it really depends on what is important to you and your family.<br>If you are looking for the best schools, I will agree that [[Academy<br>District<br>20](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b892ff&url=http://www.asd20.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="asd20.org"}]{.qlink_container} is your best bet. This will<br>influence where you decide to live, although you can choice into the<br>district. It\'s just much easier to get your child enrolled in a D20<br>school if you actually live in D20.<br><br>D20 also encompass the North end of the city, which is much newer.<br>You\'ll be looking in the Briargate and Pine Creek neighborhoods, and<br>further north into Northgate and Gleneagle, and east to Cordera. You\'ll<br>find the newest neighborhoods there. But clearly, you\'ll pay more for<br>these houses, which are frequently 10 years old or newer.<br><br>If you\'re looking to save money on a house, you might look a little<br>further south towards Woodmen, or west towards Rockrimmon. Still in D20,<br>but older, more established neighborhoods.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
