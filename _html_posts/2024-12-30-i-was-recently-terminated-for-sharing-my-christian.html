<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As a Christian, I tell you this in the most loving and caring way I<br>possibly can.<br><br>You are free to say anything you like, even to share the Gospel.<br><br>You are *not* free from the consequences of what you say.<br><br>You are free to tell an atheist that he's going to burn in hell. But if<br>that atheist tells your employer what you did, your employer can choose<br>to terminate you for any reason they like, or no reason at all.<br><br>The Constitution grants you the right to say anything you want. The<br>Constitution does not make you *immune* to any consequences from that<br>speech.<br><br>If your company decided that you are not the type of person that they<br>wish to keep employed, then they can fire you. You don't have a right to<br>work, and you don't have a right to say anything you choose without<br>consequence.<br><br>My employer could similarly fire me for what I write on Quora. I assume<br>that risk when I voice my opinion on this platform. I am under no<br>disillusion that I can somehow sue my former employer for unlawful<br>termination because they didn't agree with the content of my free<br>speech.<br><br>Again, you are free to say whatever you like to whomever you like. But<br>you are not free from the legitimate and expected consequences of such<br>speech. Your speech indicates your character, and your company can<br>absolutely hold its employees to minimum standards of character.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
