<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Note we are talking about civil annulment, not religious<br>annulment.\<br>\<br>You should be able to file your civil annulment in the county in which<br>you currently live. In most cases, a civil annulment is fairly<br>straightforward, since there is a small list of authorized causes of<br>action that can meet the standard for a civil annulment. The short list<br>of authorized causes in most states (from<br>[Nolo.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=df29b4&url=http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/annulment-vs-divorce-30234.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nolo.com"}]{.qlink_container}):\<br>\<br>]<br><br>- Fraud or misrepresentation. One spouse concealed or lied about<br>  something that was essential to the marriage, like the ability to have<br>  children.<br>- No consummation of the marriage. One spouse is physically unable<br>  to have sexual intercourse, and the other spouse didn't know it when<br>  they got married.<br>- Incest. The spouses are too closely related by blood so that their<br>  marriage is illegal under the laws of the state where they married.<br>- Bigamy. One of the spouses was still legally married to someone<br>  else at the time of the alleged marriage.<br>- Underage. One of the spouses was under the age of consent at the<br>  time of the marriage.<br>- Unsound mind. One or both of the spouses was too impaired by<br>  alcohol or drugs at the time of the wedding (or didn't have the mental<br>  capacity for some other reason) to understand what was happening and<br>  give consent to the marriage.<br>- Force. One of the parties was forced into the marriage.\<br><br>\<br>Most annulments take place after the marriage has been in place for only<br>a short time (a few weeks to a few months), so there is usually not much<br>community property to divide, and usually no children to worry about<br>custody and support payments.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
