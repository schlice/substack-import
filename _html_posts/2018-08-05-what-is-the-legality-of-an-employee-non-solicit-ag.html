<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you address the legality of a non-solicit agreement? How is it<br>constitutional for two parties (in this case a company and an<br>ex-employee) to collude to not hire current employees of the company, if<br>the employees are not a party to the contract?**<br><br>First of all, you're probably asking about a "non-compete clause," not a<br>"non-solicitation agreement." A "non-compete clause" basically says that<br>an employee cannot use the skills they gained at your workplace for a<br>set period of time after they leave your employ, either by working for a<br>competitor, or by recruiting or taking the customers from your business.<br><br>In general, this is done in highly skilled or highly technical fields,<br>and is done primarily to protect trade secrets or business confidential<br>information from being used by industry competitors if an employee<br>switches jobs.<br><br>Important to note here: the companies are not "colluding" to not hire<br>current employees. Companies know the laws, and they know that the<br>employees signed non-compete clauses, so they could face legal action by<br>hiring you. Rather than risk legal action, they choose to not hire you<br>so as not to run afoul of your non-compete clause.<br><br>For completeness, a "non-solicitation agreement" says that you cannot<br>solicit customers of your former company for a period of time after you<br>leave your employment. This means that you can't call your old customers<br>and convince them to follow you to your new place of business (except in<br>California, where non-solicitation agreements are generally not<br>enforceable, and this practice is considered fair).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
