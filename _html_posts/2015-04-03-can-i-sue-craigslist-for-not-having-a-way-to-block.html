<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'d say you should be able to stop this behavior, because<br>if Craigslist can\'t identify you as you, then they can\'t identify<br>anyone else as you, and you could still be liable under<br>\"bait-and-switch\" even if you didn\'t post the ad, since no one at<br>Craigslist can verify that you are you.\<br>\<br>You probably can\'t sue Craigslist because they don\'t have adequate<br>spam protection. You might, however, be able to get Craigslist to block<br>ads for your business, or (if they refuse), get an injunction barring<br>Craigslist from posting any ads for your business.\<br>\<br>This also means that you won\'t be able to post ads as you, either.\<br>\<br>But that\'s just fine, at least it protects your business from such<br>malicious ads, especially since Craigslist doesn\'t have a viable way to<br>prove that you are you.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
