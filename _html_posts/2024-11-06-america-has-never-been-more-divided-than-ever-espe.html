<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> especially after we threw our great president under the bus.<br><br>Wait, you mean Biden?<br><br>That man was experiencing cognitive decline in his second year of<br>presidency, and his staff and his vice president covered it up.<br>There were many ways to handle it, up to and including invoking the 25th<br>Amendment. Instead, Democrats chose to ignore it, cover it up, and<br>gaslight anyone saying anything other than Biden walked on water when he<br>wasn't in the limelight. You didn't throw Biden under the bus.<br><br>This loss sits squarely on a poorly executed Democrat campaign, from<br>start to finish. Democrats need to realize that every time they point a<br>finger, three fingers point back at them. They need to do some serious<br>resetting over the course of the next four years. The course they have<br>been running on has been clearly and unambiguously repudiated with this<br>election.<br><br>> acknowledge that every single Trump voter is a piece of garbage<br><br>Identity politics has been repudiated. This election proves clearly and<br>unambiguously that identity politics is a losing strategy. But hey, feel<br>free to double down on that idea. The loss two years from now in the<br>House and four years from now in the White House will *dwarf* what you<br>saw on November 5th if you hang on to identity politics.<br><br>Democrats ran on transgender issues, yet the American voters said<br>clearly that transgender issues were **literally at the bottom of their<br>priority list.** The economy topped most voters' lists.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
