<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The logical fallacy you have committed is called a **false<br>equivalency**, believing that somehow the two facts you stated are<br>related. Let me explain where you went wrong.<br><br>Gun company stock reacts positively to tragedies because Democrats<br>always, without fail, immediately call for the banning of guns. When<br>Democrats claim that guns are the problem in mass killings, people fear<br>that some way, somehow, they will succeed in restricting the most<br>popular rifle in America (the AR-15), and if they were contemplating<br>buying one anyway, this pushes them over the edge. So gun company stock<br>reacts positively to Democrats threatening to shutting down their sales.<br><br>The NRA does not want to block the sale of guns because there is no<br>reason to do so. The gun is not the culprit; the killer is. The killer<br>passed every background check he was given, so adding more background<br>checks wouldn't have stopped him. Banning guns from law-abiding citizens<br>wouldn't have stopped him either; as a contractor for the government, he<br>would still have had access to guns, just as the police would after a<br>complete gun ban as well. The NRA is, rightly, opposed to punishing gun<br>manufacturers because the gun is not the problem.<br><br>So since the two facts you quoted are unrelated, your equivalency is<br>also invalid.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
