Driving home you black out and kill an<br>entire family. Are you guilty of a crime?**<br><br>(US Answer)<br><br>In most states, vehicular homicide is defined as a crime which "involves<br>the death of a person other than the driver as a result of either<br>criminally negligent or murderous operation of a motor<br>vehicle."\[1\](#tEzNa){#cite-tEzNa .citation_link} The "other person"<br>can be someone outside the vehicle (like a whole family in another car)<br>or someone in your own car (like a passenger).<br><br>This is a subclass of "criminally negligent homicide" wherein a person,<br>through criminal negligence, causes or allows another person to die.<br>Criminal negligence exists when the accused fails to foresee an<br>otherwise avoidable danger, and thus allows it to come to fruition. It's<br>not really a "malfeasance" wherein the accused knows the risk and<br>willingly exposes someone else to that risk; it's more of a<br>"nonfeasance" in that the risk is simply not seen by the accused. To<br>determine this level of negligence, the "reasonable person" standard is<br>used: would a reasonable person with the same general knowledge and<br>abilities react in the same way?<br><br>In this day and age, an "overabundance of caution" would state that you<br>never accept a poured drink at a party; you always open your own can or<br>bottle, or pour your own drink. But if you're at an all-adult party at<br>which you know the host, and you don't expect any foul play (such as at<br>a Christmas party at a co-worker's house as opposed to a young adult<br>frat house party), a soft drink poured from a bottle would be generally<br>regarded as safe. There is far less expectation of a tampered-with drink<br>at a co-worker's Christmas party than at a frat house party, to continue<br>my own example.<br><br>It would come down to whether or not a reasonable person would expect a<br>drink to be spiked at the particular party in question.<br><br>If it was a party at which a reasonable person might expect that a drink<br>could be tampered with, such as at a frat house party, it is possible<br>(although only slightly so) that a jury could find that there was a<br>foreseeable risk in accepting a poured drink, and that the accused<br>should have known that this could happen.<br><br>I would think, however, this would be the exception rather than the<br>rule. It appears in this case that the accused was attempting to be<br>responsible (only drinking soft drinks and not alcohol), and therefore<br>did not expect that his or her drink was being tampered with.<br><br>Therefore, I think that in this case, it's unlikely that the accused<br>would be charged with a crime.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-tEzNa){.citation_index} [[Vehicular homicide -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c0378b&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_homicide){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
