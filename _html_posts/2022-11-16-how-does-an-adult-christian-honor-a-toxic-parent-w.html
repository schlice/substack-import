<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I got this one, as I am in this boat.<br><br>I broke down in church on Father's Day a number of years ago because I<br>was so conflicted with this. The Bible says, "Honor your father and<br>mother" in the Ten Commandments as well as in a few other places (Exodus<br>20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16; Matthew 15:4; Ephesians 6:2,3). But how do you<br>*honor* someone who is demonstrably evil or toxic?<br><br>The Bible does, if you are still a minor, tell you to accept their<br>authority, even if you do not respect or trust them. Colossians 3:20<br>says "Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the<br>Lord." (NIV) So when you are young, you honor your parents by<br>recognizing and accepting the authority God has given them.<br><br>But what if you are an adult? The Bible says that you are to<br>*appreciate* them (Proverbs 7:1, 2; 23:26), which in this case, means<br>thanking them for raising you, for providing a roof over your head, food<br>for your belly, and clothes for your back (inasmuch as they may have<br>done this; I don't know your personal situation. In my case, my parents<br>at least gave me this much). They also, at least, gave you the<br>foundation upon which you could become the Christian you are today<br>(which ultimately is your choice, not theirs). You can absolutely<br>appreciate that, and you can thank God that He gave you parents who did<br>this.<br><br>The Bible also commands us to treat them with *respect*. And I know<br>(personally) that this can be difficult, because some parents make it<br>extremely hard to respect them. Even so, the Bible tells us to avoid<br>disrespectful speech and actions (Proverbs 30:17). The Bible also tells<br>us that failing to treat them with respect is a serious offense (Matthew<br>15:4 Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9).<br><br>If your parents are older, you can honor them by *making sure they are<br>cared for* (1 Timothy 5:4,8). This doesn't mean you have to take them<br>into your home and become best buds, but you still have to ensure that<br>their needs are met. This is the basic standard we apply to everyone<br>(Love your neighbor as you love yourself), but more so for your own<br>parents. Even Jesus, right before He died, saw to the care of His mother<br>(John 19:25-27).<br><br>Look, I totally get it. I'm right where you are with my own parents. But<br>you can indeed *honor* your parents, even if you don't *like* them very<br>much.<br><br>\<br><br>*Original question:*<br><br>How does an adult Christian honor a toxic parent whom they cannot<br>respect and dare not trust?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
