<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I would pose several fixes:<br><br>1.  Term Limits. When the government was originally formed, there was no<br>    notion of a "career politician." Politicians were chosen from<br>    ordinary life, went to Washington, served their term, and returned<br>    to their jobs and homes. I don't see a problem imposing term limits<br>    on politicians. There are enough "career" positions in Washington<br>    that can fill in the knowledge gaps when it comes to turnover of<br>    Congressmen.<br>2.  Unelected Bureaucrats. Currently, we have all of these Federal<br>    agencies which consist of unelected bureaucrats. Congress gave these<br>    organizations the authority to make Federal policy, which applies to<br>    all citizens of the US, and has the force of law behind them. This<br>    is patently unconstitutional. It says very plainly that only<br>    Congress can write law. We get mad when the Supreme Court legislates<br>    from the bench, but we don't get mad that there are all of these<br>    federal agencies which do the same thing? Make a Congressman<br>    responsible for passing all of the laws which come out of Federal<br>    agencies. We need elected personnel to hold accountable for the<br>    actions of federal agencies.<br>3.  Unfunded Mandates. No bill can be passed which imposes a financial<br>    cost on the states without funding that mandate as well.<br>4.  Budget. Require Congress to pass a budget or they lose their jobs<br>    and they all go home. Simple. Require them to stick by that budget.<br>5.  The Supreme Court must first and foremost interpret the<br>    Constitution. They can secondarily rely on existing case law, but<br>    when case law is in question or being reviewed, the Constitution is<br>    the ultimate authority.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
