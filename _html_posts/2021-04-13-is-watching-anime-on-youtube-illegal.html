<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is watching anime on YouTube illegal?<br><br>Let me help clear up a little confusion.<br><br>**Watching anything that is posted to YouTube is not illegal. If it's on<br>YouTube and you can open the video, it is perfectly legal for you to<br>watch it, unless your country or your state has some law against viewing<br>any particular content.**<br><br>Now that this is out of the way, the account which posted the video may<br>have done so in a way which violated the copyright of the owner of the<br>content, as well as YouTube's Terms of Service. So if anything at all<br>may be illegal, this would be it.<br><br>But if you can open the link and it exists, it is not illegal for you to<br>watch it. Yes, while it is true that you are not supposed to consume<br>illegally-posted content, when it comes to YouTube, the punishment is on<br>the account holder who posted the video, not the average person who<br>opened the video. In other words, it's not your responsibility to check<br>the copyright status of the video and whether or not the account holder<br>had permission to post it before you watch it.<br><br>That's why YouTube takes action against the account holder, not the<br>viewer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
