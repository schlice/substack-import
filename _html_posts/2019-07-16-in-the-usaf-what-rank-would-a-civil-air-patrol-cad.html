There's no further special advancement for achieving<br>the higher Spaatz Award.<br><br>Also, you should know that ROTC and USAFA both look very favorably on<br>Civil Air Patrol experience. Approximately 10% of each incoming USAFA<br>class has CAP experience.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
