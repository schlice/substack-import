They can demand whatever they want. However, especially at border<br>checks, there is no requirement to acquiesce to any of those demands.<br><br>The choice would be:<br><br>1.  Allow this man to search you<br>2.  Do not cross the border.<br><br>The traveler would have to determine which was more important: his<br>homophobia, or crossing the border. The choice would be up to him.<br><br>See? Life is all about choices.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
