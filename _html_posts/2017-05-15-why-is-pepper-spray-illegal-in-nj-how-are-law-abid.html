<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Leave New Jersey and move to a state with more friendly laws.<br><br>Seriously, I wouldn't expect NJ to change any time soon. NJ is a "duty<br>to retreat" state, so if you do defend yourself, but they find that you<br>could have run away instead of doing so, you could be charged with a<br>crime.<br><br>This means that New Jersey is a great place to be a criminal.<br><br>That's why you should do the sensible thing and move.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
