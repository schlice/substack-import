How can they push<br>> their agenda when they, themselves do not live as Christians?**<br><br>Calling yourself Christian does not give anyone the authority of the<br>church.<br><br>In other words, *don't blame the church for the failings of the<br>messengers.* Their failings are their own. People who take on the name<br>of Christ and yet do not live as He commanded are taking the Lord's name<br>in vain.<br><br>> **God gave men free will, how can you put yourself above God and<br>> demand everyone live your very flawed interpretations?**<br><br>These "fake Christians" can demand anything they like. That doesn't mean<br>you have to do what they say.<br><br>There are plenty of "fake" people out there who demand you act in a<br>certain way. You are under no obligation to do so.<br><br>That doesn't relieve you of the responsibility to repent of your own<br>sin. If you have unrepented sin, I urge you to go to God and repent of<br>that sin. But that doesn't mean that others can "demand" you live in a<br>particular way.<br><br>\<br><br>But let's make sure we have a balanced answer.<br><br>Perhaps what is going on is that Christians are pointing out sin in your<br>life, and you are taking that to mean that they are demanding that<br>everyone live that way, and because it doesn't match the way you<br>believe, you are calling their interpretation "very flawed." You are<br>then using the *ad hominem* basis of, "well, you're not a very good<br>Christian yourself" to ignore what they are trying to teach you.<br><br>So how do you know what is "right?"<br><br>The answer, the gold standard, is the Bible. Compare what you are being<br>told with the Bible. If you don't know how to interpret the Bible, ask a<br>pastor to help you. Perhaps if you told us here what you are being told<br>to do, we can help you review what the Bible says about it and you can<br>make your decision based on that.<br><br>But ultimately, you get the choice to either love God or reject God, in<br>whatever you decide to do with your life.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
