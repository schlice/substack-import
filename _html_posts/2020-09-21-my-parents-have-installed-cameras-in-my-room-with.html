<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My parents have installed cameras in my room with video and 2-way<br>audio, WiFi controlled, specifically Night Owl brand that can be viewed<br>remotely. How can I stop them from watching me?**<br><br>Cover the camera. Place a picture in front of it. Disconnect it from<br>power. Buy yourself a Wi-Fi jammer. There are any number of ways to stop<br>them from watching you.<br><br>But those ways of stopping them will have to come with a discussion,<br>because they will insist on turning that camera back on. If they insist<br>on this kind of behavior, you can tell them that on your 18th birthday,<br>your present to them will be to move out of their house and never ever<br>speak to them again. If they can't trust you in your room, they clearly<br>are disinterested in any ongoing relationship with you.<br><br>Now, maybe you have lost their trust. Maybe you did something that<br>caused them to question your trustworthiness, and it probably had<br>something to do with what you were doing in your room. Maybe their<br>reaction is on par with your trust-breaking, maybe it wasn't. This is<br>only something that they can answer.<br><br>However, you can still present the same ultimatum: you resent living<br>like this, and you will get out of that situation at the very first<br>second you are able, and you will vanish from ther lives. Maybe they're<br>okay with that, maybe they're not. So make sure as soon as you legally<br>can, get a job and start saving money so that you can move out when you<br>turn 18. Then finish high school and get on with your life.<br><br>Or, if they don't want to lose you when you turn 18, sit down and have a<br>conversation with them about how you can establish some privacy in your<br>house while you still allow them to make sure you aren't doing the bad<br>things you did to break their trust in the first place. It's called<br>communication, and it's not easy. But you'll have to do it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
