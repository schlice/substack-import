<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [For most normal operations, [[Mike<br>Holovacs](https://www.quora.com/profile/Mike-Holovacs)<br>]{.qlink_container}is spot on: they fly them there and stop off along<br>the way, or \"tank up\" while in flight. They will place mid-air<br>refueling aircraft (i.e. KC-135 or KC-10) on \"orbit\" (flying a roughly<br>oval pattern in the sky) in strategic locations along the way, allowing<br>aircrews to stop off and \"get gas\" while in flight.\<br>\<br>In certain situations, some aircraft can be loaded in C-17 or C-5 cargo<br>haulers and be flown directly to their destination, but it is far more<br>common to simply fly the aircraft directly there.\<br>\<br>Also, some aircraft can be fitted with external wing-mounted fuel tanks<br>to carry extra fuel for long-distance flights.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
