<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The slap is what is universally known as \"assault.\" In<br>some states, it is further broken down to \"assault\" (verbal), and<br>\"battery\" (physical). The threats are a civil assault, and could be a<br>crime.\<br>\<br>You always have a legal right to self-defense. Where the lines get<br>blurry is pre-emptive strike. You see the fist. It\'s cocked back. You<br>know the punch is coming. Do you have the legal right to strike first,<br>before the punch comes? That\'s a tricky situation. The lynchpin in your<br>case is that the assault and battery already happened. Your strike<br>is just defending yourself, since you were already assaulted and you<br>have a clear belief that the striking will continue (you see a fist<br>cocked back and ready to strike). Even if you are arrested for assault<br>and battery, this can be your defense in court.\<br>\<br>I would caution you to ensure you use the minimum amount of force to<br>stop the attacker from continuing to attack. Virginia law allows for you<br>to defend yourself from an assault, so your actions would be defensible<br>only to stop the attack. If the person is down and you continue hitting,<br>you now become the aggressor. For blowhards like this, a good gut shot<br>that knocks the wind out of him will generally do the trick (plus, since<br>he\'s probably drunk, he\'ll have to stop and puke after the gut shot,<br>so still gives you plenty of time to get to safety). You might even<br>consider a nut shot. Remember, fighting is never fair. There\'s no such<br>thing as a \"low blow\" in a street fight. This isn\'t pro boxing.<br>You\'re trying to stop the furtherance of an assault. Just ensure you<br>use the minimum amount of force needed to get out of the situation, and<br>legally you should be fine.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
