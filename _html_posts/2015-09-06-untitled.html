<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [I think you misunderstood.\<br>\<br>Pre-employment drug screening (as a condition of employment), and random<br>drug tests while employed, as a condition of employment, are valid and<br>are supported under the \"drug-free workplace\" standards which have<br>been successfully used in this country for decades.\<br>\<br>On the contrary, healthcare decisions and healthcare costs are as much<br>borne by the employee as they are by the company. Yes the company pays<br>more, but the company pays into a \"risk pool.\" That means that the<br>risks provided by any one patient are spread across the entire pool of<br>payors. That\'s why when I am diagnosed with a lifelong disease while I<br>am employed (as happened to me), my insurance didn\'t drop me based on<br>the long term costs that my disease will incur. They spread the cost of<br>my disease across the entire risk pool. The more people in the risk<br>pool, the lower the amount that any one disease will affect the rates of<br>the entire pool.\<br>\<br>Does this give the employer the right to demand blood samples from<br>employees to test for medical conditions? What if the employer found<br>genetic markers for Parkinson\'s (I know you can\'t adequately test for<br>Parkinson\'s, but I\'m using it as an example). Could the employer fire<br>you because they know your healthcare costs will become too expensive<br>down the road?\<br>\<br>The answer is no, because first of all, personal health information is<br>private between the health insurance company and the individual.<br>Employers do not have access to that information. Unless you tell your<br>employer, he will have no idea what health conditions you have.\<br>\<br>What most companies do these days is work with insurance companies to<br>take \"health risk assessment\" surveys which are not mandatory, but if<br>you choose to \"opt-out\" of the survey, you will not get the benefits<br>of the lower rates that you would get if you did take the survey. The<br>health insurance company will then use the results from the survey,<br>calculate your risk factors (stress, diet, exercise, etc), and will<br>assign a \"health coach\" to keep in contact with you to ensure you are<br>maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Again, this is between the insurance<br>company and the employee. The employer only knows if you completed the<br>HRA in order to charge you the correct rates. You can also opt out of<br>the \"health coach\" calls as well. Opting out of the health coach calls<br>will not affect your insurance rate.\<br>\<br>There is a sense of voluntary participation, as you can choose to opt<br>out of the HRA and pay the higher rates, or you can take the HRA and pay<br>the lower rates. You can choose to opt out of the health coach calls.<br>Perhaps in the future, companies will give you even further discounted<br>rates if you participated in the health coach calls, but the insurance<br>companies would have to show that the health coach calls reduced patient<br>payouts for health-related issues by X% before companies will start<br>offering incentives for using those programs.\<br>\<br>Companies also provide other self-help health-related programs as well.<br>My company provides free biometric screenings, free smoking-cessation<br>classes, free blood pressure monitoring with Internet-enabled blood<br>pressure cuffs, etc, all done through health insurance.\<br>\<br>The goal should be a \"partnership\" between the employer and the<br>employee, using their shared relationship with insurance to further that<br>partnership. The goal should not be \"adversarial\" with \"punitive\"<br>consequences should you fail to participate voluntarily.\<br>\<br>Additionally, blood is a tricky subject, because while blood can be used<br>to tell you about diseases you may have, this blood is being used to<br>determine if you are a smoker. Blood is too fraught with privacy issues<br>that I wouldn\'t want it used in this way. Perhaps a urinalysis, which<br>can also show nicotine, would be a better idea, but again, what do you<br>do about false positives? How will you (as a company) handle them?\<br>\<br>\"Opt-in\" benefits is much better than \"opt-out\"<br>punishments.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/My-employer-wants-a-blood-sample-to-determine-my-health-insurance-premium-What-should-I-do/answer/Garrick-Saito<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
