<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How is progressive relapsing remitting Multiple sclerosis different<br>than secondary progressive MS?**<br><br>As of 2013, the old designations have changed, and we no longer have a<br>specific designation of PRMS (Progressive Relapsing MS). It has been<br>combined into PPMS. Read on for more clarification of the new types of<br>MS.<br><br>There are now three major groups of disease courses of MS:<br>Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS), Primary Progressive MS (PPMS),<br>and Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS).<br><br>\<br><br>Relapsing Remitting MS (RRMS): In RRMS, there are distinct periods<br>of relapse (which is a period of worsening disease activity, also<br>called exacerbations) followed by prolonged periods of remission<br>(which is where symptoms appear to disappear partially or completely).<br>RRMS can be further characterized as either active (with relapses<br>and/or evidence of new MRI activity) or not active, as well as<br>worsening (a confirmed increase in disability over a specified<br>period of time following a relapse) or not worsening. Approximately<br>85% of new MS diagnoses are classified as RRMS.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-b265ccc27f6adc953f635d7ff30f94fe){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-b265ccc27f6adc953f635d7ff30f94fe" master_w="300"<br>master_h="403"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br><br>Primary Progressive MS (PPMS): In PPMS, patients experience<br>continually worsening neurological symptoms without any evidence of<br>relapse or remission. PPMS can be further characterized at different<br>points in time as either active (with an occasional relapse and/or<br>evidence of new MRI activity) or not active, as well as **with<br>progression** (evidence of disease worsening on an objective measure of<br>change over time, with or without relapse or new MRI activity) or<br>without progression. Approximately 15% of all new diagnoses are<br>PPMS.<br><br>***PPMS with relapse is what used to be called progressive-relapsing MS<br>(PRMS), but is now broadly categorized as PPMS with relapse.***<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-b213779c2fad0c2d0a05ccd092c4f182){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-b213779c2fad0c2d0a05ccd092c4f182" master_w="304"<br>master_h="393"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br><br>Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS): For RRMS patients, at some point in<br>time, they will most likely transition to SPMS. Most people who are<br>diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to a secondary<br>progressive course in which there is a progressive worsening of<br>neurologic function (accumulation of disability) over time. SPMS can be<br>further characterized at different points in time as either active<br>(with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity) or not active,<br>as well as with progression (evidence of disease worsening on an<br>objective measure of change over time, with or without relapses) or<br>without progression. Untreated, RRMS will, on average, transition to<br>SPMS within 10 years, but this number is only for *untreated* RRMS. We<br>don't have good numbers yet for RRMS which has undergone continuous<br>therapy from the approved MS therapy drugs. Initially, it appears that<br>the MS therapy drugs extend the amount of time before RRMS transitions<br>to SPMS, but how much and to what extent is currently unknown.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-e1942dcc87788ce607853e4654d086c3){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-e1942dcc87788ce607853e4654d086c3" master_w="301"<br>master_h="426"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(Images courtesy* [[*National MS<br>Society*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=97541f&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/Types-of-MS){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
