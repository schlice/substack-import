<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer is yes.<br><br>Longer answer is that the vast majority of work arrangements in the US<br>are "at-will" employment. You can quit at any time, and your employer<br>can fire you at any time. Your boss would have to fire you for an<br>illegal reason in order for it to be illegal. If he literally, on a<br>whim, just decided to fire everyone for absolutely no reason, it is<br>legal. it's bad for business, but it's not illegal.<br><br>That said, there are a few exceptions to the at-will employment rule.<br><br>If you have some form of contract or written agreement that promises you<br>a job for a certain period of time (and that includes offer letters<br>which promise continued employment), you may have an *implied contract*<br>and you may be able to enforce the provisions of that implied contract<br>in court.<br><br>Implied contracts do not need to be simply a document that isn't a<br>technical contract. They can indeed be verbal --- promises made by your<br>employer that your employment would be "permanent" or for a specified<br>time. If your employer boasted about this frequently, even if he never<br>put it in writing, this could be construed as an implied contract, which<br>could be legally enforceable.<br><br>Also, if there is a standard disciplinary practice in your business<br>which was not followed, such as problem employees being provided an<br>improvement plan and a 6-month period to improve before being fired, and<br>you were not provided such a plan, this could also be viewed as breach<br>of an implied contract.<br><br>Some states recognize what is called a breach of "good faith and fair<br>dealing." For example, if your employer was firing you all so that he<br>could hire cheaper labor, or repeatedly assigning you crap tasks so that<br>you would quit on your own, or misleading employees about their chances<br>of promotion and salary increases, these could be considered breaches of<br>good faith and fair dealing. Like I said, not all states recognize this,<br>and some states require that you have a written employment contract<br>before you can sue for breach of good faith and fair dealing.<br><br>As I mentioned initially, you cannot be fired for an illegal reason.<br>Some illegal reasons:<br><br>- Violations of public policy, such as being fired because you served on<br>  a jury or as part of the military Reserves or National Guard<br>- Retaliation, which occurs when you perform a legally protected act<br>  like reporting an ethics violation to the appropriate authorities and<br>  you are fired as a result of it (also called *whistleblowing*)<br>- Discrimination, such as being fired for being too old, or being<br>  female, or Black, or Muslim.<br>- Defamation. While defamation lawsuits are separate from termination,<br>  if you have proof that your termination was due to false statements<br>  made about you, and your employer knew that they were false (or<br>  recklessly disregarded the actual truth of the statement), and that<br>  false statement harmed you (by causing you to lose your job), you may<br>  have a defamation claim, and that verdict could impact your future<br>  employment.<br><br>If you think you have a claim for wrongful termination, it is imperative<br>that you consult with an employment attorney in your local area as soon<br>as possible, or you risk running out of time to file your claim.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it legal for your boss to fire everyone on Christmas Eve for no<br>reason?<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not legal advice, a substitute for professional legal<br>advice, or a solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific<br>facts.
