<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Maybe not so much a need, or pressure, but *desire.*<br><br>Yes, you will likely *desire* to spread the Gospel! If you've just<br>learned about something so wonderful that you can hardly contain it,<br>wouldn't you literally want to share that with every single person you<br>meet?<br><br>Alas, reality hits hard. You realize that while you've found the Good<br>News, Satan is still ruler over this world. He has his claws into many<br>people, and he has control of much of the media and entertainment<br>industries. Your Good News won't be so warmly welcomed out there in the<br>great big world.<br><br>But take heart, because while the world will give you trouble, Jesus has<br>overcome the world (John 16:33).<br><br>My advice: live in such a way that people will want to know why you are<br>so happy all the time, even when times are tough. When you explain that<br>you have *hope*, you can then tell them *why*.<br><br>If you, as a new Christian, want a compelling way to share the Gospel, I<br>think that's a pretty good option.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
