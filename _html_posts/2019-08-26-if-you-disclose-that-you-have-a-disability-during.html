<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you disclose that you have a disability during a job interview, is<br>the interviewer then allowed to ask questions about the disability?**<br><br>Excellent question,<br>[Leslie(https://www.quora.com/profile/Leslie-Merritt-2)]{.qlink_container},<br>thanks for asking.<br><br>Since you brought up the disability during the interview, the<br>interviewer can then ask you any questions they choose about the<br>disability. However, regardless of what they ask you, they may not use<br>any of that information to determine whether or not you qualify for the<br>job. None. The law doesn't prevent the interviewer from discussing a<br>disability that you brought up; the law prevents the interviewer from<br>*using* that information to make a decision about suitability of a<br>candidate to perform a job.<br><br>So it makes little sense to actually bring up a disability during a job<br>interview. It doesn't benefit the prospective employee, and it can't be<br>used by the employer to either grant or deny you the position.<br><br>The way this works is that the employment application lists a series of<br>tasks you must be able to perform. For example, "standing for four hours<br>at a time," "able to lift 50 pounds and move that weight no more than 50<br>feet at a time." "able to see colors to operate our proprietary<br>equipment," etc.<br><br>The application will then ask, "Are you able to do these things, **with<br>or without appropriate accommodations?**" That last phrase is key. If<br>you are disabled and you need assistance to stand for long periods at a<br>time (but you can do it), then you can answer yes to that question. This<br>puts the onus on the applicant to determine whether or not they can<br>actually accomplish the key tasks of the job. This is the only thing<br>you can discuss in the job interview: **can you do the job, with or<br>without accommodations**. You should not discuss the presence or absence<br>of a disability.<br><br>It is only after you are hired that you must then advise your<br>employer that you will need accommodations. As long as the<br>accommodations are not exceedingly onerous (usually because they are<br>prohibitively expensive), and as long as the accommodations don't<br>substantially interfere with how the employer does business (the<br>accommodations cannot force the business to fundamentally change how<br>they operate), they must be provided.<br><br>**TL;DR: There should be no reason for a prospective employee to bring<br>up a disability in a job interview. It doesn't benefit anyone.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
