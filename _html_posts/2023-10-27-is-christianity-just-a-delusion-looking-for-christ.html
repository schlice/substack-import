<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The "evidence against our faith?" You mean the evidence that God does<br>not exist? Because I have yet to see that evidence. No one has yet been<br>able to give me conclusive evidence that God does not exist.<br><br>But I do have positive, empirically detectable evidence of design in the<br>human cell, and the human brain. I do have positive, empirically<br>detectable evidence to prove that the universe had a beginning and<br>therefore is not eternal and could not have created us.<br><br>In other words, the evidence we do have lines up pretty well with the<br>theistic worldview as opposed to the atheistic worldview. We know that<br>the universe had a beginning and thus a cause. You can't get something<br>out of nothing, so something must have caused the universe to come into<br>existence. Does it make more sense to say that *no one* created<br>something out of nothing, or that *someone* created something out of<br>nothing? Which one of those positions is more reasonable? The theistic<br>worldview is more reasonable. Which position requires more faith to<br>believe? Does it require more faith to believe that *no one* created<br>something out of nothing, or that *someone* created something out of<br>nothing? The atheistic worldview requires more faith.<br><br>Therefore, when it comes to the question of evidence against my faith,<br>it takes more faith to be an atheist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
