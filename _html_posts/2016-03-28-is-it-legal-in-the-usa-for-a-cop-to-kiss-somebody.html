<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>[[Eric<br>Olsen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Eric-Olsen-23)]{.qlink_container}<br>is on the right track here. I can\'t see this particular video *not*<br>being staged; nevertheless, there is no law against kissing in public.<br><br>The OP may be thinking of something more along the lines of department<br>policy that may discourage PDA (public displays of affection) while in<br>uniform, or while on duty. To be fair, I am not aware of any such<br>policy. I *am* aware of policies that require officers to *not* do<br>things that would *not* bring credit to the department. Whether or not<br>any particular action brought credit or discredit to the department<br>would entirely be up to the sole discretion of the department.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
