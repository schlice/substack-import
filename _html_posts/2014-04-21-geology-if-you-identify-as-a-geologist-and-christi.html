<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [I would absolutely suggest looking up *Inherit the Wind*,<br/>which was a play based on the famous [[Scopes<br/>Trial](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=70f914&amp;url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopes_Trial){.external_link<br/>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br/>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br/>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. The seminal part of the<br/>trial was when Clarence Darrow, an acknowledged agnostic, called the<br/>prosecutor, Col. William Jennings Bryan, to the stand, and proceeded to<br/>\"demonstrate\" how it was possible that evolution and the Biblical<br/>account could actually be related.\<br/>\<br/>For example, the Genesis story of the creation of the earth talks about<br/>how long it took God to form each part of the earth. In particular, he<br/>asked about the first day when God separated the waters in the heavens<br/>from the waters on the earth, and then the second day when he formed dry<br/>land. He asked if those were typical 24-hour days (the Bible, of course,<br/>does not specify). He asked if it was possible that they were 25 hours,<br/>since the sun, in the biblical account, was created on the fourth day.<br/>As he said, there was no sun, no way to count the hours, so isn\'t it<br/>possible that the creation of the earth took exactly the same geological<br/>amount of time that we can measure through carbon<br/>dating?]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
