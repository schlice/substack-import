<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The First Amendment protects free speech and expression by preventing<br>the government from writing laws which restrict free speech and<br>expression.<br><br>We also have specific categories of speech which are *not* protected<br>by the First Amendment. For example, **the First Amendment does not<br>protect speech that is intended to incite or produce imminent lawless<br>action and is likely to incite or produce such action**. This is known<br>as the "Brandenburg Test". The Brandenburg test is a legal test for<br>incitement that states that the government can only punish someone for<br>speech that incites violence.<br><br>The U.S. Supreme Court first defined "fighting words" in *Chaplinsky v<br>New Hampshire* (1942) as words which \"by their very utterance, \...\<br>tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace\".<br><br>Speech which incites violence can only be punished if the government can<br>prove that:<br><br>- The speaker intended for unlawful violence to occur<br>- Unlawful violence is likely to occur<br>- The unlawful violence is imminent<br><br>The Supreme Court established the Brandenburg test in the 1969 case<br>Brandenburg v. Ohio. In the case, a Ku Klux Klan leader gave a speech at<br>a rally to his fellow Klansmen. After listing a number of derogatory<br>racial slurs, he then said that "it\'s possible that there might have to<br>be some vengeance \sic\ taken".<br><br>The Brandenburg test states that **the First Amendment does not protect<br>speech that is \"directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless<br>action and is likely to incite or produce such action\"**. A law that<br>forbids speech that is intended to cause imminent violence or other<br>criminal activity will pass the Brandenburg test and be deemed<br>constitutional.<br><br>There are three prongs which must be tested:<br><br>- The speaker must intend to incite violence. If I say something<br>  that is so beyond the pale to some people that they spontaneously are<br>  spurred to unlawful action, it is not the fault of the speaker if he<br>  did not intend for lawless action to take place following his words.<br>- Unlawful violence is likely to occur. I can say that I think<br>  people should all get in boats and storm Europe, but this wouldn't be<br>  incitement of violence because it is unlikely that this will happen.<br>- The unlawful violence is imminent. I could say that people should<br>  all someday stand up to law enforcement and kill all those pigs, but<br>  that's legal because the unlawful violence is "someday," not "right<br>  now, go attack that cop over there". The unlawful violence must be<br>  imminent.<br><br>So we do have laws which protect against speech which incites violence.<br><br>\<br><br>You also mentioned when speech is offensive. I went back and re-read the<br>Constitution (it's not really all that long) and I can't find any right<br>to never be offended. So I'm pretty sure that the First Amendment does<br>not protect against offensive speech.<br><br>In fact, I'd say that *the whole reason we have a First Amendment is to<br>protect speech that other people won't like!* If your speech is kind and<br>caring, if your speech "ruffles no feathers," there is no need to<br>restrict it. If all speech was always amenable and agreeable, we would<br>never need a First Amendment.<br><br>I would argue that we need the First Amendment *to protect offensive<br>speech*. Sometimes, the things we say cause others to be offended.<br>Sometimes, we intend that reaction (which is quite evil, but that's not<br>the point). Most times, we don't intend that reaction. We simply intend<br>to make a point, but others may find that point offensive. If we are not<br>intending to be offensive, it is the hearer who has the problem, not the<br>speaker.<br><br>Regardless, the First Amendment has nothing to do with offense, because<br>you do not have a right to never be offended.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
