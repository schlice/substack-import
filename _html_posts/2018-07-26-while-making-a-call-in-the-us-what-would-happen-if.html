It, of course, refers to video games.<br><br>Context matters. The cop has no knowledge of the context of the<br>conversation, so it's very likely that absolutely nothing at all would<br>happen.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
