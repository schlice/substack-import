<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Because when there is questionable evidence as to whether<br>or not a crime has been committed, the District Attorney will take the<br>case to the Grand Jury to see if there is enough evidence to go to<br>trial. If we took every case directly to trial, even if there may not be<br>enough evidence to support a charge, we\'d clog the court system in a<br>hot second.\<br>\<br>The Grand Jury is a boon for the prosecution, by the way. It\'s<br>basically a mini trial, but with NO DEFENSE! If you\'re a guilty cop,<br>you are SCREWED at the Grand Jury. You can\'t even defend yourself! You<br>have to testify and it\'s all against you.\<br>\<br>However, if you go to the Grand Jury and they can\'t find enough<br>credible evidence to support going to trial, then there was absolutely<br>no way you could possibly win at trial with a vigorous defense. If a<br>prosecutor can\'t get a Grand Jury to indict, he\'d have no chance in an<br>actual full trial.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
