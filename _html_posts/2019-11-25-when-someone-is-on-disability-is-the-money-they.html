<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**When someone is on disability, is the money they're receiving from the<br>government or from money they put in through their employers?**<br><br>The answer is "it depends."<br><br>If the person is a disabled veteran (like me), they may receive<br>compensation from the Veteran's Administration. This is disability<br>caused by military service, and the government reimburses the veteran<br>for that disability.<br><br>If the person is on "short-term disability" or "long-term disability,"<br>this is an insurance policy that an employer and an employee pays for<br>during their active employment. If they are injured to such a degree by<br>their work that they can no longer work, their disability insurance pays<br>them. This type of disability is paid by employers (or more accurately,<br>the employer\'s insurance policy).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
