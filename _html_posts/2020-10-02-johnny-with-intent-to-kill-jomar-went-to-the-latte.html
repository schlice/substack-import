<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Johnny with intent to kill Jomar went to the latter\'s house and upon<br>seeing him on the bed, shot him immediately. Later, Johnny realized that<br>Jomar was already dead for a couple of hours. What is the crime<br>committed? Why is it punishable by law?**<br><br>Cool, law school questions!<br><br>Anyway, you can't murder someone who is already dead. The elements of<br>the crime of murder are not met, namely the very first one: the unlawful<br>taking of a life. Even if you fully intended to murder someone, you<br>cannot commit the crime if they are already dead.<br><br>You could absolutely be charged with attempted murder. In attempted<br>murder, a person must take a direct step towards the killing and must<br>have the specific intent to kill that person. The crime of attempted<br>murder has an *action* and an *intention*. The action would be to going<br>to Jomar's house and entering it. The intention is to kill Jomar. In the<br>vast majority of US states, Johnny could be charged with attempted<br>murder.<br><br>The *defense* to the attempted murder charge would be one we call<br>*impossibility*. Johnny doesn't deny going to Jomar's house with the<br>specific intent of killing him. However, he could not commit the murder<br>because Jomar was already dead. You can't have an attempted murder if<br>you can't actually commit the crime of murder. Some states do not allow<br>the impossibility defense, but if Johnny's state does, he could make<br>that claim.<br><br>He could also be charged with unlawful discharge of a firearm, and<br>mutilating a corpse.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
