<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a great question, and it highlights a facet of our belief which<br>we call progressive revelation. In short, God's requirements for<br>belief are based on the amount of information He has revealed to people<br>up to that point.<br><br>Before the times that Scripture was written, the people were still<br>responsible to God for what He had written on their hearts, and what was<br>visible in nature all around them. Abraham believed what God had said in<br>the past, with the addition of what God has revealed to him (cf Genesis<br>12, 15).<br><br>Think of it this way. Have you ever used a credit card? You buy things<br>before you have the money to pay for them, but the people you buy from<br>know that *eventually* you will have the money to pay.<br><br>Throughout the Old Testament times, believers essentially *bought on<br>credit.* They believed that *someday*, God would permanently address the<br>problem of their sin, but they believed and acted based on the<br>information they had on hand at that time. They burnt offerings to God,<br>which temporarily addressed their sin, but they had faith that God<br>would, someday, permanently take their sin away. On the Day of<br>Atonement, they would symbolically transfer their sin into a lamb and<br>sacrifice it, addressing their sin for that year. It was a stop-gap<br>solution until the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world,<br>past, present, and future, would be given.<br><br>Today, we have far more revelation from God than the people then had.<br><br>> *Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by<br>> the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son,<br>> whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created<br>> the world. \-- Hebrews 1:1--2 ESV*<br><br>Today, we can see the full picture. We know that God did address our sin<br>permanently, through the person of Jesus Christ, and we believe and live<br>accordingly.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
