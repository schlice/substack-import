<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it illegal to run around nude?<br><br>As with all legal things, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>Primarily, it depends on two things:<br><br>- Where you are running around nude<br>- The nature and intent of the exposure.<br><br>The first bullet is the most important, as it varies wildly by state.<br><br>The largest majority of states simply ban exposure of male or female<br>genitalia in public. These states allow nudity in private areas which<br>are reasonably expected to be protected from public view. Some states<br>are even restrictive of nudity *inside your home* if it can at all be<br>seen from outside, and it's up to you to know whether or not you can be<br>seen. For example, if you are nude in your back yard, and you have a<br>privacy fence around your yard, but the potential exists for your<br>neighbor to see you from their second story window, you would be in<br>violation of the public nudity law.<br><br>Other states allow public nudity, and in those states (Colorado is one<br>of them), the nature of the exposure determines whether or not you can<br>be charged with public indecency. Exposure *with the goal* *of sexual<br>arousal* is prohibited, but other exposure is not. So for example, if<br>you are touching yourself in an attempt to elicit sexual arousal, that<br>would be a prohibited exposure.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
