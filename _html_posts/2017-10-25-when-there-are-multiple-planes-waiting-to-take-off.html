<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Your question hints at an entire science of air fluidity called<br>[[***wake<br>turbulence***](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b9c095&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_turbulence){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. I won't reproduce the<br>entire article here; you should read up on it. It's actually fascinating<br>stuff.<br><br>Suffice it to say that there are varying degrees of time aircraft must<br>wait for the wake turbulence to clear before they are allowed to take<br>off under International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) rules.<br><br>> An aircraft of a lower wake vortex category must not be allowed to<br>> take off less than two minutes behind an aircraft of a higher wake<br>> vortex category. If the following aircraft does not start its take off<br>> roll from the same point as the preceding aircraft, this is increased<br>> to three minutes. To put this more generally, an aircraft is usually<br>> safer if it is airborne before the rotation point of the airplane that<br>> took off before it. However, care must be taken to stay upwind (or<br>> otherwise away) from any vortices that were generated by the previous<br>> aircraft\[1\](#nijUE){#cite-nijUE .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-nijUE){.citation_index} [[Wake turbulence -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b9c095&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_turbulence){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
