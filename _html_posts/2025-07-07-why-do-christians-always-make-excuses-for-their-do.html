<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do nothing?<br><br>You sure were taking about the same God?<br><br>Is He not the same God who literally *spoke the universe and everything<br>in it into existence?*<br><br>Is He not the same God who, not being human, *made Himself human so He<br>could be the perfect example for us to follow?* He didn't need to do<br>this, but He did, to make a way for us to be reunited with Him.<br><br>For a "do nothing" God, He certainly has done a lot.<br><br>\<br><br>Oh wait, I get it now. You think God should show Himself to you, right?<br>Like, why doesn't He write in the clouds, "I exist, FFS"? Or why doesn't<br>he float down on a cloud shaped like an old man with a flowing white<br>beard and zap all of the evil with His laser fingers? Right? Isn't that<br>what you claim to want?<br><br>Let me ask you something. If that happened, would you believe in Him?<br>Would you literally drop your entire life and pattern your life after<br>His? **If God revealed Himself to you, and if He answered every question<br>you have, *would you become a Christian?***<br><br>If the answer is still no, then the problem isn't whether God appears.<br>The problem isn't that you don't have enough information to believe.<br>*The problem is that you don't* *want* *to believe.* The problem is<br>that you don't want anyone in charge of your life but you.<br><br>And that's okay. Because God, along with giving you life, gave you *free<br>will*. And true free will means that you have the freedom to reject Him.<br><br>This is why He doesn't make Himself more apparent than you might like.<br>Free will means that your choice must be free from *coercion*, and His<br>presence would be way too coercive.<br><br>\<br><br>Or maybe you think that God should just destroy all evil, right? And if<br>He doesn't, but He has the power to do so, He must not exist, right?<br><br>Let me ask you another question. If you asked for something from your<br>parents and they didn't give it to you right at that moment, did you<br>think that they didn't have the power to do it? If they made you wait,<br>did you think they were bad parents?<br><br>I can assure you, God will destroy evil. God will send Satan and the<br>demons to hell. He just hasn't done it yet. Does that mean He doesn't<br>exist? Of course not. It just means that He will do it on His timeframe,<br>not ours.<br><br>\<br><br>Okay, I'm ready. Tell me why you don't believe in God. Because you can<br>absolutely choose to ignore Him if you like. You can choose to not<br>pattern your life after His. But claiming that He doesn't exist is just<br>illogical.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
