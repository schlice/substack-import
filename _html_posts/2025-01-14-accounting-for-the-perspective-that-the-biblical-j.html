<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So let's assume for the moment that the Jesus of the Bible was invented<br>out of whole cloth as you claim. So for this analysis, we can't rely on<br>the Bible for any historicity.<br><br>How do you explain all of the non-Christian writers who wrote about<br>Jesus? And some of these sources are decidedly *anti-Christian, not just<br>non-Christian.* So even in denying certain aspects about Jesus (like<br>denying that He is God or that He was resurrected), they simultaneously<br>prove that He existed.<br><br>All in all, there are ten non-Christian sources who mentioned Jesus<br>within 150 years of His life. They are:<br><br>- Flavius Josephus, a historian;<br>- Tacitus, the Roman historian;<br>- Pliny the Younger, a Roman politician;<br>- Phlegon, a freed slave who wrote histories;<br>- Thallus, a first-century historian;<br>- Seutonius, a Roman historian;<br>- Lucian, a Greek satirist;<br>- Celsus, a Roman philosopher;<br>- Mara Bar-Serapion, a private citizen who wrote to his son;<br>- the Jewish Talmud<br><br>Whether you doubt the truth of those particular authors, or whatever<br>your personal issues with them are, these authors collectively<br>acknowledged certain facts about Jesus. These non-Christian authors<br>admit facts about early Christianity that help us piece together a<br>storyline that is surprisingly congruent with the New Testament. These<br>are the facts which come out of those authors' stories:<br><br>1.  Jesus lived during time of Tiberius Caesar.<br>2.  He lived a virtuous life.<br>3.  He was a wonder-worker.<br>4.  He had a brother named James.<br>5.  He was acclaimed to be the Messiah.<br>6.  He was crucified under Pontius Pilate.<br>7.  He was crucified on the eve of the Jewish Passover.<br>8.  Darkness and an earthquake occurred when he died.<br>9.  His disciples believed he rose from the dead.<br>10. His disciples were willing to die for their belief.<br>11. Christianity spread rapidly as far as Rome.<br>12. His disciples denied the Roman gods and worshiped Jesus as God.<br><br>So in order to claim that Jesus didn't exist, you would have to also<br>doubt the validity of all of these authors.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
