<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not all states require former employers to provide you with reference<br>letters.<br><br>[https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyc\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=48b1a3&url=https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/free-books/employee-rights-book/chapter9-6.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nolo.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>If you don't get one, you are still right to put that experience on your<br>résumé, but your prospective employer may not be able to validate it.<br><br>It is similar for requests for employment verification. Unless state law<br>requires it, or unless they get a request from a federally-backed<br>institution (like a bank doing a loan request verifying employment),<br>employers are not generally under any obligation to verify your<br>employment. Most employers voluntarily comply with such requests, but<br>they are not legally obligated to do so outside of some state laws.<br><br>You could always prove your employment in other ways:<br><br>- provide pay stubs<br>- provide your W-2s<br>- provide your tax returns<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
