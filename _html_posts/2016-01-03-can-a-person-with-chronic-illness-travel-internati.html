<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So long as your medication is legal and prescribed to you, you can bring<br>it with you through an airport security checkpoint. Make sure that your<br>medication remains in its original packaging (i.e. don\'t put it in a<br>pill sorter or a Ziploc baggie) with the prescription label showing that<br>it is prescribed to you. Even controlled substances can be transported<br>in this way.<br><br>Your liquid prescription medications are also not subject to the 3 oz in<br>1 qt bag restrictions. I used to travel heavily while I was taking<br>Copaxone for multiple sclerosis. Copaxone came pre-packaged in syringes,<br>but they were all in blister packs. I just made sure that I had my<br>prescription label, even though I re-boxed them in hard plastic<br>containers. I never removed them from the prescription blister packs. I<br>travelled internationally with my syringes. Never had an issue,<br>regardless of the country I was travelling through.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
