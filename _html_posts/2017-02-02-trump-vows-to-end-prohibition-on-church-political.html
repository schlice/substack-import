<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, Trump can't do this unilaterally. He can press Congress to<br>repeal the Johnson Amendment, which is something he may actually do.<br><br>Repealing the Johnson Amendment is a good thing, because it is utterly<br>unconstitutional.<br><br>Pastors have preached about political issues since the founding of the<br>country. Sermons were delivered opposing Thomas Jefferson because he was<br>a Deist. Sermons denounced William Howard Taft because he was a<br>Unitarian. Churches have led many of the significant social and<br>governmental changes in this country (segregation and civil rights come<br>to mind) until 1954, when the Johnson Amendment to the US tax code was<br>passed. The amendment states that non-profit tax exempt entities cannot<br>"participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or<br>distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of or in<br>opposition to any candidate for public office." In essence, the IRS gets<br>to determine when a pastor's speech has become too "political," and that<br>church could lose its tax-exempt status.<br><br>This amendment should be repealed because it unconstitutional.<br><br>1.  It violates the Establishment Clause because it allows the<br>    government to determine when truly religious speech becomes<br>    "political." The government has no business making such<br>    determinations.<br>2.  It violates the Free Speech clause because it forces the government<br>    to discriminate against speech based only on the content of the<br>    speech. Some speech is allowed, and some speech is not. The Supreme<br>    Court has ruled against this type of discrimination of speech for<br>    many years.<br>3.  Additionally, it violates the Free Speech clause because it makes<br>    tax exemption a condition of speaking the "correct" words. So long<br>    as you use the "correct" speech, you can have a tax exemption.<br>4.  It is also well known that certain parts of Scripture would be seen<br>    as "political." This means that a church cannot preach the full<br>    Scripture for fear of losing their tax exemption, which is also a<br>    violation of the Free Exercise clause, because the government<br>    "substantially burdens" a church's exercise of religion without a<br>    compelling reason to do so.<br><br>Whether or not you think a church has such far-reaching power that<br>talking to its constituents could influence an election, the Johnson<br>Amendment should be repealed because it unconstitutionally restricts<br>churches from preaching their full beliefs.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
