<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Indeed it is. Almost all males\* age 18--25 must register with the<br>Selective Service System. Citizens are required to register within 30<br>days of turning 18. Immigrants are required to register within 30 days<br>of arrival in the United States.<br><br>The people in this demographic find out really quickly whether or not<br>they are registered, because failing to register means that you will not<br>be eligible for federal student aid. But they've made it really easy:<br>while you're filling out the<br>[FAFSA(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a7da40&url=https://studentaid.gov/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="studentaid.gov"}]{.qlink_container}, it allows you to check<br>your registration status, and optionally allows you to register online<br>while you're filling out the application.<br><br>Also if you don't register, you won't be eligible for federal job<br>training, or a federal job. You may be prosecuted and face a fine of up<br>to \$250,000 and/or jail time of up to five years. If you're an<br>immigrant to the U.S., you will not be eligible for citizenship.<br><br>\* As of July 22, 2021, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted to add<br>language to the National Defense Authorization Act requiring women to<br>sign up for the draft. They've been working on it since 2016, when the<br>military opened all combat jobs to women. That year, they created a<br>commission to study requirements for draft registration. Last year, that<br>commission recommended expanding the draft to women, as a "necessary and<br>fair step."<br><br>So this may be the year that women are added to the draft.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
