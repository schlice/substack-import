Do you support him in this?**<br><br>First of all, SCOTUS remanded the case back to the lower courts, because<br>there were still questions of law that needed to be answered, and that<br>ain't their job, so to speak. Since the issue still needed to be<br>investigated further, they couldn't make a decision in time to get the<br>question added back to the 2020 Census.<br><br>Secondly, Trump ordered the US Census Bureau to print 2020 Census<br>questionnaires without the citizenship question. So no, he's not<br>planning on putting it in the census anyway.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
