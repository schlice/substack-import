<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is "it depends."<br><br>Each HOA's elections are governed by their Governing Documents: the<br>Declaration of Covenants, the Articles of Incorporation, and the Bylaws<br>for the corporation, as well as any Policies, Procedures, Rules and<br>Regulations (PPR&R) which may have been written and approved by the<br>Board.<br><br>The ability to which an HOA's election can be "rigged" is a function of<br>the specific rules for the election process in the Governing Documents,<br>as well as rules which may be in place for HOA elections in your state.<br><br>But *in general*, it's not easy to rig an HOA election. Usually, the<br>process by which the election takes place has some minimal security in<br>place. A disinterested third party (usually the management company) will<br>administer the election, collect the responses, and ensure there is only<br>one vote per household.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
