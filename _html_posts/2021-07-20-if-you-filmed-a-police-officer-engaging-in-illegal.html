<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>By "appropriate," I assume you mean the one that will get visible<br>results.<br><br>The actual "appropriate\" organization would be the department itself.<br>It would be the departments Internal Affairs office, or if you can find<br>the officer\'s supervisor or sergeant, that person.<br><br>But they will take the information, do their own audit, do interviews,<br>review training, and take internal action. That action could be anything<br>ranging from disciplinary action, retraining, or perhaps possibly<br>reassignment of the officer. If criminal charges were to be filed<br>against the officer, it would not be done in the open, because the<br>department would not want a black eye over the incident, especially if<br>they have to file charges themselves. Change will happen, but there\'s a<br>very good chance that you will not see the change.<br><br>Therefore, if you want visible results, the best organization to give<br>the footage to would be your local television station. Go to their<br>website, and find the information regarding their investigation team.<br>Local TV stations usually have some sort of consumer investigation<br>group. They do investigations on behalf of viewers, and then turn the<br>results into a story. Contact them, and give them the footage. Let them<br>turn it into a story for the local news, and the department will be<br>forced to publicly respond in a way that\'s appropriate to people who<br>saw the original footage.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If you filmed a police officer engaging in illegal activity, what is the<br>most appropriate organisation to report it to?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
