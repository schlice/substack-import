<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>1.  The HOA can only tow cars from land they own. If you live in a gated<br>    community, they can tow cars from the street. If the city or county<br>    owns the streets, they cannot tow from the streets. If the HOA owns<br>    the clubhouse, they can tow from the parking lot, but that's it. If<br>    the HOA owns parking spaces, they can tow from those spaces.<br>2.  The HOA can set whatever rules they like regarding cars on property<br>    they own. If one of those rules is that cars must have a current<br>    registration and must have license plates attached and visible, then<br>    they can tow cars which do not follow this rule.<br><br>You can find all of the HOA's rules in the Governing Documents, which<br>the HOA should give you, but if you can't find them, they are also on<br>file with the County in which the HOA is located.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
