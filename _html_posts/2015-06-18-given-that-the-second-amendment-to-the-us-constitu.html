<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The process by which an amendment to the Constitustion is<br>added or repealed is necessarily a difficult one. The framers intended<br>for it to be hard. They made it this way because they didn\'t want the<br>Constitution changing willy-nilly with the thoughts of the day. They<br>wanted it to have some permanence, but to be able to be modified should<br>the majority of the country believe that it should.\<br>\<br>The reason that people think that the Second Amendment can never be<br>changed is because you\'re going to have a very hard time convincing the<br>majority of the country that it is no longer needed and should be<br>abolished. Whether that\'s a good or a bad thing is a matter of opinion,<br>but the bottom line is that you need a majority of the states and a<br>majority of the Congress to pass a Constitutional amendment (or to<br>repeal one), and people rightly understand that there is not a majority<br>of Americans that want the Second Amendment changed.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
