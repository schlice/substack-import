<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What sort of criminal liability is Donald Trump exposed to because of<br>alleged misspending on his inauguration?**<br><br>Despite what all the conservative pundits will tell you, there is some<br>(albeit limited) criminal exposure for the president.<br><br>A paper from the Justice Department, *Federal Prosecution of Election<br>Offenses*, spells out the criminal liability which a candidate can face<br>for violating the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), 52<br>U.S.C. §§ 30101--30146, as amended:<br><br>> FECA contains its own criminal sanctions, which provide that, to be a<br>> crime, a FECA violation must have been committed knowingly and<br>> willfully and, except for campaign misrepresentations and certain<br>> coerced contributions, must have involved at least \$2,000 in a<br>> calendar year. 52 U.S.C. § 30109(d). FECA crimes aggregating \$25,000<br>> or more are five-year felonies, and those that involve illegal conduit<br>> contributions and aggregate over \$10,000 are two-year felonies. 5 2<br>> U.S.C. § 30109(d)(1)(A), (D). Moreover, all criminal violations of<br>> FECA are subject to U.S. Sentencing Guideline § 2C1.8, that the United<br>> States Sentencing Commission promulgated in response to a specific<br>> Congressional directive.<br>><br>> FECA violations that either: (1) do not present knowing and willful<br>> violations, or (2) involve sums below the statutory minimums for<br>> criminal prosecution, are handled non-criminally by the Federal<br>> Election Commission (FEC) under the statute's civil enforcement<br>> provisions. 52 U.S.C. § 30109(a).<br>><br>> Finally, FECA violations that result in false information being<br>> provided to the FEC may present violations of 18 U.S.C. § 371<br>> (conspiracy to disrupt and impede a federal agency), 18 U.S.C. § 1001<br>> (false statements within the jurisdiction of a federal agency), 18<br>> U.S.C. § 1505 (obstruction of agency proceedings), or 18 U.S.C. § 1519<br>> (creation of false records in relation to or contemplation of federal<br>> matters).<br><br>Therefore, in order for Trump himself to be criminally liable (and we're<br>talking about Cohen's payments to the porn stars being illegal campaign<br>contributions), Trump would have had to know that the contributions were<br>illegal. This means that someone would have had to tell him, "Hey boss,<br>this violates campaign finance laws," and he would have to have said, "I<br>don't care, do it anyway." Or words to that effect.<br><br>If he didn't know it was a violation, it's not a criminal action, but a<br>civil action. Obama's campaign violated these laws by failing to report<br>some campaign contributions and paid over \$300,000 in fines for<br>non-criminal violations of the law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
