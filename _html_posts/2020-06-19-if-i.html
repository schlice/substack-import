<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If I'm getting texted anonymously, can I get a restraining order if I<br>know who's doing it?**<br><br>Most likely, no. It's much easier and quicker to simply enable blocking<br>of anonymous SMS messages.<br><br>In iPhones, you can block iMessages from anonymous or unknown sources,<br>but SMS messages are a little more difficult to block. You may need to<br>install a third party app to do it. This post at Apple's site has a<br>little more information:<br><br>[[Can't block SMS with no number - Apple Support<br>Communities](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ed6ba2&url=https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7691952){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="apple.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>In Android, block unknown contacts from within the Messaging app itself.<br>Since there are multiple messaging apps, it's difficult to say where<br>exactly in the Settings you will find this, but they all have it.<br>Android also has third-party apps which can manage unknown SMS messages.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
