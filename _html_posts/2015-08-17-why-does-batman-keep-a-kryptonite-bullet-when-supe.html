<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I never did quite understand that. Here\'s my theory.\<br>\<br>The hope is to catch Superman with his back turned so he can\'t speed<br>away. But his body is impervious to bullets (even the Kryptonite<br>variety), so the hope is that the bullet catches in his garments. Being<br>in close proximity to Kryptonite is enough; it doesn\'t have to<br>penetrate his body.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
