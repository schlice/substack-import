<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not unless he also plans on ripping up the Constitution.<br><br>Federal police officers cannot enforce state law, only federal law. So<br>unless he plans on abolishing all states and making one "United State of<br>America" with one American Police Force, then the states will continue<br>to enforce their own laws.<br><br>The FBI does not enforce state law. only federal law.<br><br>By the way, Trump has never stated, ever, that he planned on ripping up<br>the Constitution. In fact, he greatly respects the police and will<br>likely increase his support of them rather than tearing them down.<br><br>It would have been a Democratic president who would have been more<br>likely to abolish the states in favor of the Federal government than<br>someone like Trump who at least leans Republican.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
