<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Look, I get where you're going.<br><br>You are arguing that the best way to prevent COVID is to give it to<br>everyone. They either gain natural immunity, or they die. It's just<br>natural selection! The people with the comorbidities will all die at sea<br>(since while there are medical facilities on the ships, there are not<br>nearly enough, and they are not nearly advanced enough, to provide ICUs<br>for any significant population of the ship), and all the healthy people<br>will catch COVID and recover.<br><br>So you're left with a ship on which you kill 1/3 of your shipboard<br>population, and the rest come back immune!<br><br>Of course, in order to do this, you must be a terrible person to begin<br>with. Because you have to begin from a position of ***moral<br>superiority*** because you are vaccinated and they are not.<br><br>This, by the way, is not your fault. The government taught this to you.<br>The government politicized the virus. The government politicized the<br>vaccine. And for the trifecta of abuse, the government disingenuously<br>pushes the vaccine over all other therapeutics, treatments, or natural<br>immunity.<br><br>So you can't really be blamed for listening to the President and doing<br>what he says. it's really his fault, not yours. You are simply too<br>weak-willed to recognize that you've been lied to all this time.<br><br>It's just sad that you have to come on to a platform like this and<br>display your moral ambiguity for everyone.<br><br>**TL;DR: When you admit, on an open social media platform, that you're<br>willing to kill people because they're not vaccinated, you're a bad<br>person.**<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>In a theoretical world could we offer a free three week cruise to all<br>the unvaccinated and end the pandemic? The sick ones wouldn\'t clog our<br>ERs, they would all get Covid, natural immunity, or die. They get a<br>trip, NO rights abused, no complaints.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
