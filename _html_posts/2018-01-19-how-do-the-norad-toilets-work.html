<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How do the NORAD toilets work?<br><br>If I had to try to understand this question, I would probably think that<br>you're asking how is wastewater handled in NORAD. I'm assuming you're<br>not asking how the toilets in the bathrooms work, because they are<br>regular bathrooms with sinks and urinals and toilets and they all work<br>like regular sinks and urinals and toilets.<br><br>The short answer is that black water and gray water are pumped via an<br>underground buried pipeline to nearby Fort Carson, and is sent to their<br>sewer system for treatment. Drinking water comes from a natural spring<br>which was discovered while digging out the facility. Clean spring water<br>overflow is discharged either directly out the side of the mountain or<br>is discharged into Fountain Creek, or is used to carry any remaining<br>effluent into the Fort Carson pipeline.<br><br>Here are the details on the system [[from the<br>EPA](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cf8d0d&url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-10/documents/co-0034762-cmafs-sob-pn-2016-b.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="epa.gov"}]{.qlink_container}. In this summary, CMAFS stands<br>for Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station, the actual name of the Cheyenne<br>Mountain Complex. Interestingly, it took 40 years to get the EPA to<br>approve that "NPDES permit" which allowed us to discharge **untreated<br>natural spring water** out of the side of the mountain. We literally<br>discharged natural spring water overflow into the Fort Carson sewage<br>pipeline for 40 years because we didn't have the permit to discharge out<br>of the side of the mountain. Note that this is overflow from a 1.5<br>million gallon drinking water tank. Sheesh.<br><br>> The various wastewaters, excess spring water, and drainage from the<br>> underground complex at CMAFS are either routed to the sanitary sewer<br>> system at nearby Fort Carson via a buried pipeline or discharged under<br>> the provisions of a NPDES permit. An exception is that when there is<br>> an excess of untreated spring water routed to the drinking water plant<br>> storage tanks, the excess flow is diverted to an unnamed tributary of<br>> Fountain Creek.<br>><br>> Waters and wastewaters going to the pipeline to the Fort Carson<br>> sanitary sewer system include the sanitary wastewaters from the<br>> underground complex, cooling tower blowdown, cooling tower basin<br>> cleaning wastes, infiltration water from the diesel storage reservoir,<br>> overflow from the drinking water reservoir, overflow from the<br>> industrial water reservoirs, and water collected in certain floor<br>> drains in the underground complex. All of these, with the exception of<br>> the sanitary wastewater, are collected in the Main Tunnel Pit 52 and<br>> pumped directly to an oil/water separator, which is located outside<br>> the underground complex. The effluent from the oil/water separator<br>> goes to the pipeline to the Fort Carson sanitary sewer system. The<br>> sanitary wastewaters are routed separately to the pipeline. There is a<br>> memorandum of understanding (MOU) between CMAFS and Fort Carson<br>> concerning the routing of wastewater from CMAFS to Fort Carson.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
