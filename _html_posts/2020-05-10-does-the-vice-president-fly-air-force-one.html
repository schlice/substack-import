<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As a reminder, any aircraft on which the President flies is called Air<br>Force One, and any aircraft on which the Vice President flies is called<br>Air Force Two.<br><br>Currently, we have a Boeing C-32, a 757 outfitted for the Vice President<br>and which most commonly serves as Air Force Two. It is similar in most<br>respects to the President\'s aircraft, but because it requires a smaller<br>complement of support staff, the aircraft can be smaller.<br><br>On occasion, the Vice President does use the VC-25A, which is more<br>commonly used as Air Force One, and appropriately it is called Air Force<br>Two.<br><br>I flew on Air Force Two with the Vice President in the 90s when its home<br>base was still called Andrews AFB.<br><br>[[Air Force Two -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9648f0&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_Two){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
