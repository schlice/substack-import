<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Are school shootings responsible for CounterStrike?<br><br>School shootings: a (likely) unstable former student decides to get<br>revenge on all of the people whom he feels "wronged" him in some way and<br>takes a gun into a school and starts shooting anyone he sees, with<br>absolutely no armed resistance whatsoever. It's a free-fire zone.<br><br>[[*Counter-Strike: Global<br>Offensive*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f45331&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} (affectionately known as<br>CS:GO): An online first-person shooter multiplayer video game which pits<br>a team of "terrorists" and "counter-terrorists" against each other in<br>fictional cityscapes full of boxes, cars, buildings, windows, ramps and<br>nary an innocent bystander anywhere to be seen (if you see a person,<br>they're either on your team, or they're not). Both teams work to<br>eliminate each other while working on other objectives (planting or<br>defusing bombs, and defending or rescuing hostages). You communicate<br>with your team and direct tactical movement, call out enemy positions<br>when you see them, and are generally equally matched with your opponents<br>in terms of available firepower (note to hardcore CS:GO players: I'm not<br>talking about purchase ability and funds available based on round<br>wins/losses; I'm talking about the difference between two \generally\<br>balanced, armed teams vs one shooter and all unarmed victims).<br><br>If you can make the stretch from school shootings to CS:GO, you've got<br>quite an imagination.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
