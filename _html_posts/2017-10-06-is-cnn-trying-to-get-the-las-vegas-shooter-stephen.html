<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>CNN, just like every other major news outlet, has only one goal: **keep<br>your eyeballs glued to the screen for as long as they can.**<br><br>Their goal is not to bring you fair and balanced anything. Their goal<br>isn't even to deliver *news.* Their goal is to keep you watching, for as<br>long as they can do so, so that they can claim viewership numbers and<br>make more advertising revenue for their parent company.<br><br>This sometimes means that the stuff they put out may not necessarily be<br>fully true or complete. It may be inflammatory. It may be outrageous. It<br>may be from "anonymous sources" who are not simply protected from<br>disclosure by the news agency, but are anonymous *to the news agency* as<br>well, which also means *unverifiable* without second-hand corroboration,<br>which sometimes does not occur for the sake of, of course, keeping your<br>eyeballs glued to the screen.<br><br>So does this mean that CNN can make wild allegations that Paddock's<br>girlfriend was actually *complicit* in the killings? Of course it does!<br>Is there any evidence to support this claim? NONE WHATSOEVER. And if<br>there is such evidence, it is *protected from distribution* by the<br>people who actually know: law enforcement.<br><br>What they are doing is *speculating.* What they are doing that is<br>intellectually dishonest is *speculating and passing it off as truth*<br>without copious disclaimers that "this is just speculation" and "no<br>official statements have been made by law enforcement" and "this is just<br>my talking-head uninformed anchorman's opinion."<br><br>Television news has become partisan opinion, nothing more. You must<br>view everything you see on broadcast television and cable news shows as<br>opinion. You must now verify every "fact" you get from media sources,<br>because *they're not doing it anymore.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
