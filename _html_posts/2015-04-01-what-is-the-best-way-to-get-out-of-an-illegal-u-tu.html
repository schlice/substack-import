<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [According to your research, there had to be a curve or the<br>crest of a hill within 500 feet of where you made the U-turn in order<br>for it to be illegal, or it would have had to be clearly marked as a<br>\"No U-Turn\" area. The Ohio law makes it illegal to do a U-turn within<br>500 feet of a curve or the crest of a hill, such that you\'re not<br>clearly visible for 500 feet from where you make your U-turn.\<br>\<br>Go back to the place where you did the U-turn and measure the distance<br>from that spot, in both directions, to the nearest crest of a hill which<br>obstructs driver view, or the nearest blind curve (one you can\'t see<br>around). Take pictures from the spot of the U-turn in both directions.\<br>\<br>Then bring those to court, and argue that the U-turn didn\'t violate the<br>500 foot rule, and there are no signs visible to the driver in that area<br>that say \"No U-Turn\". Your pictures will support that assertion.\<br>\<br>If, perchance, there is a blind curve or the crest of a hill within 500<br>feet of where you made the U-turn, or there is a \"No U-Turn\" sign<br>there, I\'d suggest you follow Officer[<br>Hawk(https://www.quora.com/profile/Christopher-Hawk)]{.qlink_container}\'s<br>advice and see if you can get the local prosecutor to allow you to plead<br>guilty to a general equipment violation. Make sure they understand that<br>you\'re trying to keep the points off of your license for insurance<br>reasons. You will pay a higher fine, but you won\'t get any points, and<br>insurance will stay nice and tidy.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
