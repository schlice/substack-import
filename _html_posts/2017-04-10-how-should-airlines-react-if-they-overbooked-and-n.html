<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How *should* they react? They should react in the same way that they all<br>usually do react: First-come, first-served. Possession is 9/10ths. And<br>any other pithy quote which says *the people in their seats are the ones<br>who get to fly.* Using check-in times to determine who gets seats<br>doesn't work, because you can check in 24 hours before you arrive.<br>You're not even headed to the airport 24 hours before you arrive! If you<br>make it to the airport and there are still seats available, you get one.<br>Easy peesey.<br><br>How they do react is different for every airline.<br><br>For the record, I think overbooking is a terrible practice in the first<br>place. Intentionally selling more tickets than you have seats because<br>*statistically* a certain percentage of people buy tickets and never<br>show is a bad practice, because sometimes they *do* all show. For the<br>airline, they guarantee themselves that they will always run the plane<br>at capacity. They also almost always inconvenience some travelers.<br>Granted, they are the travelers who got to the airport last, but what if<br>they had car trouble? What if they got caught in traffic? Now they are<br>doubly inconvenienced! And why would you oversell a plane during<br>holidays? Or during Spring Break? People are trying to travel on Spring<br>Break! That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. But it happened to me<br>on Spring Break. I got bumped, which means my family gets bumped. Spent<br>all day in the flippin' airport, eventually made it there a full day<br>later.<br><br>You've already bought the ticket; if you don't show, who cares? Don't<br>try to make an extra buck by selling the same seat, because you<br>inconvenience actual customers because of statistics.<br><br>I understand why they do it (because they can). And I understand that<br>dealing with inconvenienced passengers has simply become the norm in the<br>industry. I don't have to like it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
