<br><br><h2>Space Submission</h2><br><div><br><br>Space name: Christians & Christianity<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There seems to be a great deal of confusion surrounding the fact that<br>God is *omnipotent* but has also given you *free will.*<br><br>Here's the thing: **simply knowing that something will happen does not<br>mean that you have *directed* it to happen.**<br><br>For example, if I see a pencil rolling towards the edge of a table, I<br>know it's going to fall off. But that knowledge doesn't *make* it fall<br>off.<br><br>Even more so, God has seen all of our days, because God exists *outside<br>of* time, and is not constrained by it. We only have visibility into the<br>present, because we exist within the bounds of time and space. God is<br>present in all times, and in all places, so he has seen everything that<br>has happened, and everything that will happen. But this alone does not<br>alter your free will.<br><br>*Knowing* what you will choose does not equal *influencing* your<br>decision.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Are we really in control of our lives, or does God make our decisions<br>for us? Aren\'t we supposed to make our own decisions?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
