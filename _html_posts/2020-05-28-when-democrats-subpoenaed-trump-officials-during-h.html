<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**When Democrats subpoenaed Trump officials during his impeachment and<br>they didn\'t show up, can Obama officials refuse to show up on Lindsey<br>Graham\'s subpoenas?**<br><br>Lots of heavily politically tilted answers here, let's see if we can get<br>you a more neutral answer.<br><br>When Trump officials were subpoenaed by Congress, Trump did not allow<br>them to testify, citing Executive Privilege. This is a doctrine which<br>states that presidents can keep communications secret in order to<br>encourage communications between government officials, and the President<br>can protect that information when it relates specifically to<br>governmental functions.<br><br>> The Supreme Court confirmed the legitimacy of this doctrine in *United<br>> States v. Nixon* in the context of a subpoena emanating from the<br>> judiciary, instead of emanating from Congress. The Court held that<br>> there is a qualified privilege, which once invoked, creates a<br>> presumption of privilege, and the party seeking the documents must<br>> then make a \"sufficient showing\" that the \"presidential material\"<br>> is \"essential to the justice of the case"<br>><br>> Regarding requests from Congress (instead of from the courts) for<br>> executive branch information, as of a 2014 study by the Congressional<br>> Research Service, only two federal court cases had addressed the<br>> merits of executive privilege in such a context, and neither of those<br>> cases reached the Supreme Court.<br>><br>> In addition to which branch of government is requesting the<br>> information, another characteristic of executive privilege is whether<br>> it involves a \"presidential communications privilege\" or instead a<br>> \"deliberative process privilege\" or some other type of privilege.<br>> The deliberative process privilege is often considered to be rooted in<br>> common law, whereas the presidential communications privilege is often<br>> considered to be rooted in separation of powers, thus making the<br>> deliberative process privilege less difficult to overcome. Generally<br>> speaking, presidents, congresses and courts have historically tended<br>> to sidestep open confrontations through compromise and mutual<br>> deference in view of previous practice and precedents regarding the<br>> exercise of executive privilege.\[1\](#FdGGS){#cite-FdGGS<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>In this case, there was no "compromise and mutual deference." Each side<br>bandied their arguments about and neither moved forward with any attempt<br>at compromise.<br><br>If Senator Graham subpoenas members of Obama's staff, could Obama order<br>them to not testify, citing executive privilege? No one knows, as it has<br>never happened before. If they did, it would then be up to Senator<br>Graham to bring his subpoena to the courts to determine which side has<br>priority: the Congressional subpoena, or the Executive claim of<br>privilege.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-FdGGS){.citation_index} [[Executive privilege -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=19a368&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_privilege){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
