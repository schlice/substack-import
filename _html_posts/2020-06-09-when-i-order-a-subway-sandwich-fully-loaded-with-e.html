<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**When I order a subway sandwich, fully loaded with every option<br>available, how do they make any profit at all from me?**<br><br>One of my good friends owned two Subway stores in town. Every time I'd<br>go in there and he was in the store, he'd give me my sandwich for free.<br>I felt bad for that, and I told him so.<br><br>He waved me off. "These things cost me pennies to make," he said.<br><br>He wasn't entirely accurate in terms of actual dollars and cents. In<br>actuality, it only costs about \$2 in ingredients to make a Subway<br>sandwich. But Subway still needs to pay for other things, like rent,<br>electricity, and salaries for employees. Anyone who has been an avid<br>watcher of *Restaurant: Impossible* or any such "save my restaurant"<br>show knows that a simple formula to determine retail price of a plate in<br>a restaurant is three times the actual product cost. So that Subway sub<br>should be selling for about \$6. It costs a Subway franchise well over<br>\$4 *all in* for each sandwich, and so the math works: \$6 is<br>reasonable, factoring in reasonable profit, not just break-evenness.<br><br>Which is why the [[\$5 Footlong promotion nearly bankrupted<br>Subway.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c56904&url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-subway-foot-long-promotion-20171229-story.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="latimes.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>There is a big disconnect between Subway corporate and its franchisees.<br>It's almost like they don't want their franchisees to make any profit at<br>all.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
