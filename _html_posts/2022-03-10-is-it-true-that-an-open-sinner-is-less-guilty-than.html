<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm not sure I understand the concept of "less guilty." Are we trying to<br>say that certain sins are worse than others? The Catholics do this, as<br>they differentiate certain sins as *venial* or *mortal*.<br><br>Christians do not do this. To the Christian, all sin is an affront to<br>God, and all sin must be atoned for. No sin against God causes any less<br>or more guilt. All of us are sinners, and all of us are guilty in God's<br>eyes, and all of us are deserving of God's wrath. But God's grace saves<br>us, through the sanctifying blood of Christ.<br><br>(Note that there is one difference, and it has to do with "the<br>unpardonable sin," but that's a different concept, and not one we are<br>discussing here)<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it true that an open sinner is less guilty than he who professes to<br>serve God but who bears no fruits to His glory?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
