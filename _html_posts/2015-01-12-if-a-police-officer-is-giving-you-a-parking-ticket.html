<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Question Details:*<br>><br>> *I had this problem once. The police came to write a ticket because I<br>> parked in a red zone (I\'m color blind). During the process of writing<br>> the ticket, I tried to open the door and drive away, but he said no.*<br>><br>> 1.  *Should I have gotten in my car and drove away regardless? Just<br>>     push the gas pedal and drive away? He can get out of the way if he<br>>     wants, right?*<br>> 2.  *Also, what if I said, \"Dude, I\'m driving away, get the fuck<br>>     away from my car.*<br>><br>> *What would be the consequences if I did one or both of those?*<br><br>Two issues here:<br><br>1\. Parking in a \"Red Zone\"\<br>2. Leaving the scene<br><br>1\. Parking in a \"Red Zone\": Color-blindness would only be an<br>affirmative defense if you could show that there was no \"text\"<br>anywhere that stated that it was a \"no parking\" zone (such as a sign,<br>or words spray-painted on the curb). If the curb was only colored, and<br>there was no other indication using text that described the no-parking<br>zone, you could claim it as a defense against the ticket in court.<br><br>2\. However, you have to receive the ticket before you can contest it.<br>If you get in your car and drive away, your license plate (which was<br>already recorded) will be reported to the police, and you will be<br>charged not only with the parking violation, but with leaving the scene,<br>as well as potential charges of bodily harm against the parking<br>enforcement personnel.<br><br>Bottom line: bad idea. Allow them to complete the ticket, take pictures<br>of the area in question, and fight it in court.<br><br>As many of us have said when dealing with law enforcement, you have many<br>options and remedies. NONE of these remedies takes place AT THE SCENE.<br>Let them finish what they are doing and then take them to court.<br><br>(EDIT) In most jurisdictions, leaving while a parking enforcement<br>official is writing a ticket is, in and of itself, another traffic<br>offense. So more than likely, what will happen is you will get two<br>tickets. In the mail.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
