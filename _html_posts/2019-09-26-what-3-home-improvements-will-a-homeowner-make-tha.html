<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What 3 home improvements will a homeowner make that will never pay for<br>themselves?**<br><br>It's a lot easier to list things that you can improve that will<br>absolutely pay for themselves (exterior upgrades, curb appeal, kitchens,<br>etc). It's much harder to list things that will never pay off, since any<br>improvement might hit that right note with one particular buyer.<br><br>Nevertheless, there are three improvements that are the *least likely*<br>to result in a substantial increase in sale price:<br><br>- Bathrooms. You will typically see less than 50% of a bathroom<br>  remodel returned in resale value. People know that they don't spend<br>  much time in the bathroom, so it's less likely to make a huge<br>  difference. Also, the cost per square foot in a bathroom is high, so<br>  usually remodeling the bathroom won't get you the big returns you're<br>  looking for.<br>- Adding a room. Again because of the high cost per square foot,<br>  adding an addition on to your house is unlikely to see a tremendous<br>  bump in resale value.<br>- Bells and whistles. That yoga room, that wine cellar, or that<br>  sauna you just "had to have" may suit you just fine, but it's unlikely<br>  to raise your home's value. In fact, it may turn buyers off who don't<br>  want those features, don't want to maintain them, and may cost them<br>  money in the future to change into something more useful for them.<br>  Niche additions can be a negative as they may turn off some buyers.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
