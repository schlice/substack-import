<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is the present US constitutional criteria an adequate basis for<br>removing a US president? If not, how should it be improved?**<br><br>"Adequate?" As in, "covers all conditions in which we might want to<br>remove a President?"<br><br>If that's the question, then the answer is an emphatic yes.<br><br>The impeachment power in Congress, while it is only supposed to be used<br>for "high crimes and misdemeanors," can really be used for any offense a<br>President commits. There isn't a list of offenses which can be called a<br>"high crime or misdemeanor."<br><br>Once a president is impeached, the Senate has a trial to determine<br>whether or not that charge for which he was impeached is of a sufficient<br>nature as to impede his ability to perform the duties of the office of<br>president. If so, the Senate votes to remove him from office.<br><br>If the president becomes physically incapable of carrying out the duties<br>of the office, the 25th Amendment contains a process to allow the Vice<br>President to assume the command of the office without any action<br>required on the part of the President.<br><br>Finally, if the President is acting in a way you don't like, or if he's<br>a big mean orange bully and it hurts your feelings, you can simply not<br>re-elect him, and he'll go be orange somewhere else. If the President<br>can do too much damage in four years that you think you'd need to remove<br>him before that, then Congress has given the President too much<br>authority and needs to dial it back.<br><br>So it would seem that the Constitution has all the bases covered, so to<br>speak.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
