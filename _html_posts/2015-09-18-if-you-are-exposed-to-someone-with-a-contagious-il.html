Antibiotics have classes<br>of pathogens against which they are most effective. The converse is also<br>true; there are some pathogens against which the antibiotics in question<br>are less effective, if not ineffective altogether.\<br>\<br>And if that\'s the case, you also know that antibiotics kill *all*<br>bacteria, not just the bad ones. Killing all the bacteria in your gut<br>does a number on your immune system, which is already busy trying to<br>fight a bacterial infection, so you may actually be *more* susceptible<br>to the particular pathogen to which you were exposed.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
