<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The doctor should, at a minimum, pay a fine and lose his or her license,<br>and perhaps do jail time. If we respected life in this country, the<br>doctor would be tried for murder, but we have a long way to go and a lot<br>of enlightenment left to develop before that will happen.<br><br>Oh, were you thinking that the *mother* should be punished? No, the<br>mother should never face a penalty for having an abortion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
