<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In the military, the \"ready position\" is thumb break<br>open, hand on the backstrap. Military police remove their weapons from<br>their holsters for one of two reasons: to clear it and give it back to<br>the armorer, or to fire it. Otherwise, the weapon never leaves the<br>holster. Research upon which the military relies tells them that an<br>officer can draw and shoot fast enough for situations which require you<br>to shoot, and leaving the weapon in the holster as a matter of policy<br>prevents accidental discharge because some airman who is bored to tears<br>in a remote guard shack decides to play \"quick draw.\"\<br>\<br>Note that this policy works for the military. This policy would<br>never work outside the gate.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
