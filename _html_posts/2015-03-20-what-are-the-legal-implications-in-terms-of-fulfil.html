<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Question details:*<br>><br>> *Recently, I\'ve noticed that various services sell \"lifetime<br>> subscriptions\" or \"lifetime licenses\" for a one-time payment. In<br>> most cases, this is marketing speak for \"pay once for your license\".<br>> I wonder what the implications would be, if the producer would stop<br>> providing the service. Since the lifetime of the buyer wouldn\'t be<br>> over yet, would the producer have to give a partial refund<br>> proportional to the remaining lifetime?*<br><br>A \"lifetime subscription\" is valid for the life of the service. It<br>doesn\'t guarantee that you will receive the service throughout your<br>life, it only guarantees that you will receive the service for as long<br>as the service is actually operating. Lifetime subscriptions<br>automatically terminate when the service is terminated.<br><br>If you perhaps were paying for the service based on an estimated length<br>of your life and the service terminated before you did, you might be<br>able to recoup some of the cost of the lifetime subscription. But if you<br>\"paid one price\" for access to the service, and everyone who joined<br>paid the same price, then the cost is not dependent on the length of<br>your life. Therefore, it is also not dependent on the length of the<br>service.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
