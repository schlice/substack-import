<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [While I\'m not big on doing your Econ homework for you,<br>since the answer is so blatantly posted in Wikipedia, it\'s a silly<br>homework question anyway, so shame on your teacher for making you answer<br>it.\<br>\<br>From Wikipedia, here are three commodities which do not follow the law<br>of supply and demand:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> Giffen goods\<br>> Initially proposed by Sir Robert Giffen, economists disagree on the<br>> existence of Giffen goods in the market. A Giffen good describes an<br>> inferior good that as the price increases, demand for the product<br>> increases. As an example, during the [[Irish Potato<br>> Famine](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=78e543&url=http://javascript:void(0)){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container} of the 19th<br>> century, potatoes were considered a Giffen good. Potatoes were the<br>> largest staple in the Irish diet, so as the price rose it had a large<br>> impact on income. People responded by cutting out luxury goods such as<br>> meat and vegetables, and instead bought more potatoes. Therefore, as<br>> the price of potatoes increased, so did the quantity demanded.\<br>> \<br>> Expectation of change in the price of commodity\<br>> If an increase in the price of a commodity causes households to expect<br>> the price of a commodity to increase further, they may start<br>> purchasing a greater amount of the commodity even at the presently<br>> increased price. Similarly, if the household expects the price of the<br>> commodity to decrease, it may postpone its purchases. Thus, some argue<br>> that the law of demand is violated in such cases. In this case, the<br>> demand curve does not slope down from left to right; instead it<br>> presents a backward slope from the top right to down left. This curve<br>> is known as an exceptional demand curve. When people feared that the<br>> government was going to enact bans on ammunition, the price, and the<br>> demand, similarly increased.\<br>> \<br>> Basic or necessary goods\<br>> The goods which people need no matter how high the price is are basic<br>> or necessary goods. Medicines covered by insurance are a good example.<br>> An increase or decrease in the price of such a good does not affect<br>> its quantity demanded.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
