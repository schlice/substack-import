<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the United States, that would be 100%. You don't keep a salaried<br>employee employed, consider him innocent, and not pay him for his<br>eligible time.<br><br>But you only tend to see it in the news when it is a police officer<br>under investigation, so I can understand this concept of "paid<br>administrative leave" seems like nothing more than a "gift" from a<br>department "willing to look the other way," but it's nothing of the<br>sort.<br><br>I also don't understand how people think that it's right to not pay<br>someone who is innocent until proven guilty, is still an employee, but<br>is simply asked to not perform his primary job function while an<br>investigation is ongoing. If we don't pay someone, it's either because<br>they are terminated, or because they have already been found to be<br>guilty. In this case, neither of those has happened, so we continue to<br>pay our employees.<br><br>If you're innocent (as in "innocent until proven guilty in a court of<br>law"), the department has no grounds on which to terminate you. But it<br>would be improper to continue having you work as a police officer while<br>you are the subject of an investigation. Therefore, you are placed on<br>leave. This simply means that you don't report to your normal job<br>location. You may be required to report to the office and be physically<br>present, or you may be required to remain at home. You may be required<br>to function as an "office admin," maybe manning the switchboard or the<br>front desk, as sometimes instead of saying that an officer was placed on<br>"paid administrative leave," they say he was temporarily reassigned to<br>"administrative duties." But "paid administrative leave" does not mean<br>"here's a present for doing wrong" since "doing wrong" has yet to be<br>determined.<br><br>If you are still employed, *you still get paid*. The officer cannot seek<br>employment somewhere else, since he is still employed by his agency.<br>These investigations could go on for months, and it's in no way fair to<br>the officer to keep him employed, consider him innocent, and not pay him<br>for his time. That would be illogical, and in some cases unlawful in and<br>of itself.<br><br>**TL;DR: Suspending an officer without pay implies misconduct, which has<br>yet to be determined.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
