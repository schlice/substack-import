<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Well, when you put it *that* way...<br><br>What Israel *actually* did was to destroy a Hamas terrorist stronghold<br>in Jabaliya, northern Gaza, which happened to be located under an<br>apartment building. As usual, Hamas hides behind civilians.<br><br>And just so we're clear, the Geneva Conventions say that when you build<br>a military facility inside of a civilian facility, the facility then<br>becomes a legitimate military target.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-1594493afee9caccaa4d070a560f4c75){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-1594493afee9caccaa4d070a560f4c75" master_w="680"<br>master_h="564"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(image courtesy*<br>[*IDF*(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a9ce30&url=https://twitter.com/idf/status/1719424225751027715?s%3D46%26t%3DD_zXgy8e2MQxh-4DY49Ejg){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="twitter.com"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br>Anyway, the IDF killed about 50 terrorists and destroyed the entrances<br>to some of Hamas' network of tunnels, where they keep munitions, and<br>plan and launch attacks. Additionally (as you noted), Ebrahim Biari, who<br>was Hamas\' commander of the Jabaliya center battalion, was killed in<br>the airstrike.<br><br>If you want to know why refugee camps were targeted, you'll have to ask<br>Hamas why they place military targets underneath civilian structures, in<br>clear violation of the Geneva Convention and other international rules<br>of war.<br><br>(EDIT) Apparently, lots of people are unaware of the history of the<br>people in Gaza, claiming that there can't be a "refugee camp" in Gaza.<br>This has already been answered in the comments, so I'll add it here to<br>answer you before someone else, again, says that you can't have a<br>refugee camp in Gaza:<br><br>> They call some communities refugee camps and keep the descendants of<br>> those who fled the 1948 war there for eternity. The UN pays for them.<br>> Hamas gets lots of fighters supported by the UN, steals their<br>> supplies, and puts military facilities under them. Basically their way<br>> of getting the UN to pay for their war and nurture their fighters.<br>><br>> [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pa\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c247e2&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugee_camps){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br>><br>> *(Credit:* [[*Michael<br>> LeBauer*](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-LeBauer)]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
