<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>Massachusetts is a "two-party" state. This means that both parties to<br>the conversation must be aware that the conversation is being recorded,<br>or it may not be used as evidence (in other words, no "secret"<br>recordings are allowed). Some two-party states require that the<br>recordings have a "recording tone," which is essentially a beep every 15<br>seconds indicating that the conversation is being recorded. You will<br>often hear this tone if you call 911, as their calls are always<br>recorded. In Massachusetts, the recording tone should be sufficient to<br>inform all parties that the recording is not "secret," but to be safe,<br>if you are recording, you should always announce to all parties that the<br>call is being recorded. If a party to a conversation does not want to be<br>recorded, it is up to that party to leave the conversation. By the way,<br>this applies to any recording in which audio is captured; this includes<br>video recordings with audio, unless you are recording the police<br>performing their duties in public. This is separately protected under<br>the First Amendment.<br><br>In the rest of the US, some states are two-party like Massachusetts and<br>require the recording tone, some two-party states do not require the<br>tone, and others are "one-party," which means that at least one party in<br>the conversation must be aware that it is being recorded. One-party<br>states do not require recording tones.<br><br>Check with the laws in your state before recording a conversation and<br>expecting to be able to use it as evidence.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
