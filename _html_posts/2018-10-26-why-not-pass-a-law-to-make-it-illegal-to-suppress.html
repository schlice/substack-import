<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why not pass a law to make it illegal to suppress voting?<br><br>During the period following emancipation, Southern states passed various<br>Jim Crowe laws designed to prevent newly freed blacks from voting,<br>things like poll taxes, literacy tests, and grandfather clauses. Most of<br>these things (and other forms of voter suppression) were made illegal by<br>the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits racial discrimination in<br>voting.<br><br>Specific voter laws are controlled at the state level, as voting is<br>conducted by state, and not by the Federal government. Many states<br>attempt to control what they claim is fraudulent voting practices<br>(especially by those who are not US citizens) by requiring some form of<br>ID to vote. Opponents of so-called voter ID laws claim that because some<br>people have difficulty obtaining government-issued ID, the laws are<br>intentionally designed to suppress those votes. Additionally, they<br>claim, there are so few actual cases of voter fraud that implementing<br>voter ID laws is a solution in search of a problem. Supporters claim<br>that you need government-issued ID to perform most functions in today's<br>society, including seeking assistance from the government, so providing<br>the same ID when voting shouldn't be an onerous requirement.<br><br>Therefore, states attempting to curb fraudulent voting by instituting<br>voter ID laws have faced stiff opposition in the courts, as people claim<br>that these laws are discriminatory and are actually intended to suppress<br>voters.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
