<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, let's clarify the dwelling you're talking about, because<br>it sounds like a game warden can waltz right up to your front door in<br>beautiful downtown \<insert_city_name_here\> and bust on in without a<br>warrant.<br><br>Clearly, that's not true.<br><br>But game wardens can indeed come on to your land, and can enter your<br>dwelling, to check for illegal game.<br><br>How can they do this? You agreed to let them, when you bought a hunting<br>license. The rules for what game wardens are allowed to do in your state<br>are in your state laws surrounding protection of game, and you agreed to<br>these provisions when you bought a hunting license. Failure to allow a<br>game warden to search will result in two things:<br><br>1.  Loss of your hunting privileges in the state, which would apply<br>    whether or not they find any evidence from #2.<br>2.  The game warden returning with the sheriff and a warrant.<br><br>That said, accessing your land without a warrant is covered by the "open<br>fields" exception to the Fourth Amendment. An individual cannot<br>reasonably expect to have privacy in woodlands or fields that are<br>generally accessible to the public. The case *Hester v. United States*<br>found that "the special protection accorded by the Fourth Amendment to<br>the people in their 'persons, houses, papers, and effects,' is not<br>extended to the open fields.\" The courts have decided that woods,<br>fields and streams do not constitute the equivalent of "persons, houses,<br>papers, and effects," and fencing and/or signage indicating private<br>property are not likely to change that. It might make a civilian subject<br>to trespassing laws, but a game warden who is performing his duties<br>would likely be covered by that "open fields" exception.<br><br>Depending on how you protect it and how far away from the house it is,<br>the area immediately outside of your "dwelling" may be called<br>"curtilage" and may also be protected by the 4th Amendment. If your<br>"curtilage" is just protected by chicken wire, clearly visible from<br>"open fields" areas, you may lose the curtilage protections from the<br>"plain sight" exceptions. But if you have a 6 foot privacy fence<br>installed around your "dwelling," your "curtilage" is likely protected.<br><br>Game wardens can usually enter your dwelling and search your freezers<br>and storage areas for illegally obtained game. They generally have to<br>have some indication that you were involved in some form of illegal<br>hunting, and they have to be able to articulate that information, but<br>again, the hunting laws in the state generally allow game wardens to<br>enter your property and search the appropriate areas for evidence of<br>illegal hunting activities.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
