<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Your question is specious because discrimination against the LGBTQ<br>community is not legal.<br><br>There is no SCOTUS ruling which allows any service provider to<br>discriminate on the basis of sexual preference. And in states where such<br>a category exists, it is illegal to do so.<br><br>But that's not what the *303 Creative* case held.<br><br>The *303 Creative* case said that the First Amendment does not permit<br>the state to force a person into a commercial agreement wherein they<br>must speak a state-approved message with which the person does not<br>agree.<br><br>The case was about *compelled speech,* not legal discrimination.<br><br>In other words, if a same-sex couple walks into Lorie Smith's door, she<br>cannot say, "I refuse to serve you because I believe homosexuality is a<br>sin." That would be illegal in Colorado, and it would be fully supported<br>by this ruling. If a same-sex couple came in the store and said, "We<br>want you to build us a website for our online CD reselling business,"<br>she could not refuse because the couple is same-sex. That would be<br>patently illegal in states where sexual orientation is a protected<br>class.<br><br>However, if any couple (straight or gay) came into the store and said,<br>"We want you to make a same-sex wedding website for our daughter and her<br>wife-to-be," Smith can decline. Note that she was willing to do business<br>with the people, but she wasn't willing to speak the message that she<br>disagreed with.<br><br>TL;DR: *It's not about the people, it's about the message.* This<br>isn't just splitting hairs. This is the distinction that makes the<br>difference.<br><br>\<br><br>Since you have an erroneous statement, a false equivalence, and a<br>question, I can answer the question separately:<br><br>> can the LGBQT community legally discriminate against Christians?<br><br>No. Religion is a protected class. You cannot legally discriminate<br>against someone because they are Christian.<br><br>As an example, you can require that no one wear head scarves in your<br>store (for safety reasons), and that would not be a discrimination<br>against Muslim women because you apply the restriction to everyone<br>equally, not just Muslims.<br><br>But denying business to Christians *because they are Christian* is<br>unlawful and violates the federal Civil RIghts Act as well as all state<br>civil rights laws.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
