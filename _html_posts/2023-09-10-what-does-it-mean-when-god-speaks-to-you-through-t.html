<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>God rarely speaks to people audibly these days.<br><br>Is that a sign that He has changed? Or is that a sign that *we* have<br>changed?<br><br>Actually, I don\'t think either of those are true. I think God doesn\'t<br>speak audibly to us anymore because *the message* has changed. We<br>don\'t need the audible voice of God in our lives anymore. We have the<br>Bible. If we read the Bible with an open heart and we ask the Holy<br>Spirit to help us understand it, that\'s where the voice of God comes<br>from.<br><br>So if you are hearing the voice of God while you read the Bible,<br>rejoice! God speaks to us through His Word, which is timeless.<br><br>Some Christians take a really long time to get to the point where you<br>are, where you\'re actually hearing the voice of God through the Bible.<br>Being able to quiet your mind and open your heart enough to let the<br>Spirit come in and speak to you is a skill, one that not even all active<br>Christians have mastered (myself included). I actually have to be<br>cautious myself, because I can easily slip into envy when I see how<br>easily some people hear God\'s word.<br><br>TL;DR: if you read the Bible with an open heart, and you hear the<br>voice of God from its pages, you are doing something right!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
