<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does your new driver\'s license have a star on it? Is this harmless or<br>are they about to start rounding us up for concentration camps?**<br><br>Thanks for the chuckle. I literally just about spit my coffee out my<br>nose.<br><br>So instead of coming up with conspiracy theories and comparing state<br>governments to Nazis, when I saw the yellow star on my license, I looked<br>it up. You know, like a normal person.<br><br>You know what I found? It's actually a federal program. And it's really<br>important, especially the next time you want to get on an airplane.<br><br>It's called REAL ID. From the [[DHS<br>website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cd3897&url=https://www.dhs.gov/real-id){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="dhs.gov"}]{.qlink_container}:<br><br>> *The REAL ID Act establishes minimum security standards for license<br>> issuance and production and prohibits Federal agencies from accepting<br>> for certain purposes driver's licenses and identification cards from<br>> states not meeting the Act's minimum standards. The purposes covered<br>> by the Act are: accessing Federal facilities, entering nuclear power<br>> plants, and, boarding federally regulated commercial aircraft.*<br><br>If your state is compliant with REAL ID, your driver's license will<br>sport a little yellow star. No, not because you've been tagged for the<br>next round of concentration camps, but because federal agencies accept<br>your state's license as meeting minimum standards for security in<br>production and issuance.<br><br>Why is this important to you? If you don't have a little yellow star,<br>you may be in for a surprise next year when you try to board an<br>aircraft. Again, from DHS:<br><br>> *The Transportation Security Administration is reminding travelers<br>> that beginning October 1, 2020, every traveler must present a REAL<br>> ID-compliant driver's license, or another acceptable form of<br>> identification, to fly within the United States.*<br><br>They do keep trying to tell everyone, but I'm certain that on September<br>30th, 2020, this will be a big surprise to people.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
