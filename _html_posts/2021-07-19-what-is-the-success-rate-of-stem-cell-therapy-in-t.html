<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's difficult to say, because success is dictated by lots of factors,<br>and varies by the disease being treated. Additionally, adult stem cells<br>have been very successful, while embryonic stem cells have yet to find a<br>single success in treatment. Stem cell therapy is not an approved<br>therapy for every disease or condition, so there is no "overall success<br>rate" for stem cell therapy. However, in general, we can say that adult<br>stem cells induced into pluripotency have been treating diseases<br>effectively for many years now, treating dozens of diseases and<br>disorders.<br><br>Specifically in my case, stem cells have shown great promise in a<br>procedure called Hematopoietic Stem Cell Therapy (HSCT). You've probably<br>heard of it referred to as a "bone marrow transplant." Here's how it<br>works:<br><br>> HSCT (Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation) attempts to<br>> "reboot" the immune system, which is responsible for damaging the<br>> brain and spinal cord in MS. In HSCT for MS, hematopoietic (blood<br>> cell-producing) stem cells, which are derived from a person's own<br>> (scientifically referred to as "autologous") bone marrow or blood, are<br>> collected and stored, prior to depleting much of the immune system<br>> using chemotherapy drugs. Then the stored hematopoietic stem cells are<br>> reintroduced to the body. The new stem cells migrate to the bone<br>> marrow and over time reconstitute the immune<br>> system.\[1\](#CLzOj){#cite-CLzOj .citation_link}<br><br>HSCT has shown some success in treating MS, but not 100% success. We are<br>finding that HSCT is very effective against certain forms of MS, and is<br>less effective against others.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What is the success rate of stem cell therapy in the USA?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-CLzOj){.citation_index} [[Bone Marrow Stem Cell Transplant<br>--<br>HSCT](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=118598&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Research/Research-News-Progress/Stem-Cells-in-MS/Bone-Marrow-Stem-Cell-Transplant-%25E2%2580%2593-HSCT){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
