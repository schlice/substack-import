<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can you drive a vehicle home without insurance?<br><br>In short, no. You cannot legally drive a car on public roads in the<br>United States without having an insurance policy.<br><br>If you have insurance, most insurance carriers will automatically extend<br>coverage to your new car temporarily until you can get the car added to<br>your policy. Some companies automatically cover any cars you own, some<br>give you a set number of days of temporary coverage to get the new car<br>added to your policy. I was able to use my carrier's mobile app to add<br>the new car to my policy while I was at the dealership and print out<br>insurance cards while I was there, which I provided to the dealer to let<br>me go home with my new car.<br><br>If you don't have insurance, you will have to sign up before you can<br>drive home. Most carriers can sign you up as a new customer right over<br>the phone. Remember GEICO's ad? "15 minutes can save you 15% or more on<br>car insurance." Getting an insurance policy is pretty quick, and you'll<br>be covered and can legally drive home.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
