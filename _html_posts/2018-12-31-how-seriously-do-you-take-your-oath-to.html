<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How seriously do you take your oath to "support and defend the<br>constitution of the United States; against all enemies foreign and<br>domestic?**<br><br>I take my oath so seriously that while I have been relieved of my post<br>on Active Duty, I have never been relieved of my oath. As far as I am<br>concerned, I've not been relieved of that particular duty. I will<br>continue to support and defend the Constitution, and I am still prepared<br>to give my life in its defense.<br><br>**For officers, what does "without mental reservation, or purpose of<br>evasion" mean to you?**<br><br>The full sentence says, "I take this obligation freely, without any<br>mental reservation or purpose of evasion." Therefore, mental reservation<br>or purpose of evasion are modifiers to the first part of the sentence.<br><br>To that end, "mental reservation" means I'm committed to my oath (which<br>may be why I take it so seriously) and I do it consciously, without any<br>doubts about what I'm doing, and "purpose of evasion" means exactly what<br>it says: I take the obligation because I want to, not because I'm trying<br>to evade some other responsibility.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
