<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My sister got pulled over for speeding. We slowed down at least 500ft<br>from the cop. I checked when my sister was slowing down and she wasn't<br>going over 85 (70mph zone). He gave us a ticket for going 85. What<br>should?**<br><br>The law doesn't say that you only get a speeding ticket if you don't<br>slow down in time, before the cop sees you.<br><br>The law doesn't say that you are allowed to exceed the speed limit<br>unless cops are around.<br><br>The law doesn't say that it's not illegal if you don't get caught.<br><br>You were speeding. You got caught.<br><br>What should you do? Pay the ticket, and stop speeding.<br><br>If you want some advice, don't ever do more than 5 over. 5 mph is within<br>the limits of the inaccuracy of your speedometer and the inaccuracies<br>which may be present in any speed measuring device. But hey, that's free<br>advice, and it's worth every penny you paid for it.<br><br>(EDIT) It has been suggested that your question is actually one of<br>ability of the officer to actually measure your speed accurately at the<br>distance at which you were located. With traditional RADAR, this might<br>be true. But with LIDAR, your speed can be measured accurately at a much<br>greater distance than the 500 feet within which you say you slowed down.<br>The theoretical range of a LIDAR gun is about 2000 feet in ideal<br>conditions, but in all practicality, it is generally effective at an<br>average range of about 1000 feet away.<br><br>In other words, if he was using LIDAR, he got your speed at twice the<br>distance away from him that you slowed down. He saw your speed, and he<br>even saw you slowed down when you saw him, so not only does he know that<br>you were speeding, he also knows that you knew you were speeding.<br><br>This means you're double-caught. My original advice stands. Pay the fine<br>and quit speeding.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
