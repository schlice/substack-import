<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, let's correct your statement-question.<br><br>If *Roe* is overturned, whether or not abortion is legal becomes a<br>question to be answered by each state and the state legislature therein.<br>It returns to something that the people can vote on, by electing<br>representatives that will adjust abortion rules in their state depending<br>on what the majority of voters in that state want. Today, it is the<br>Supreme Court which decided this issue, a group of nine unelected judges<br>with lifetime appointments.<br><br>Activists are militant because *Roe is symbolic.* Overturning *Roe*<br>means that their precious right to kill humans is not actually a right<br>found in the Constitution, but is a *privilege* afforded by law, and<br>each state can decide if they want to allow it or not. They don't want<br>that. They want to have the Constitutional right to kill humans.<br><br>They want rights to comport with their moral views, which allow them to<br>place differential value on human life depending on its temporal<br>locality.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Even if the SC ends the Roe decision, abortion will be legal and<br>available for every women in the US, so why are activists so militant?<br>Is this more about votes than reality? Why or why not?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
