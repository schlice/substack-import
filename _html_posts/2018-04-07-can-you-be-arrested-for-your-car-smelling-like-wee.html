<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can you be arrested for your car smelling like weed?<br><br>In short, no.<br><br>The smell of weed forms what is known as "reasonable suspicion" to<br>search the car for weed. He does not need your permission to search your<br>car. The smell forms an exception to the 4th Amendment, called the<br>"plain smell" exemption, which is patterned after the "plain sight"<br>exemption.<br><br>He can search your car, and he does not have to be gentle. He can call<br>in a drug-sniffing dog to assist with the search.<br><br>But if he does not find any weed in the car, you cannot be arrested<br>because your car smells like weed. You actually have to be in possession<br>of weed in order to be arrested for possession of weed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
