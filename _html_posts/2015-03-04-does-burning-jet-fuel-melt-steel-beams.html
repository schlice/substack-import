<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [No, jet fuel does not burn hot enough to melt steel beams.<br>Jet fuel burns between 800° and 1500°F which is not hot enough to melt<br>steel, which melts at 2750°F.\<br>\<br>But (and I presume this is a 9/11-related question), jet fuel and the<br>subsequent fires they caused inside the building *did* cause the steel<br>to lose its structural integrity and buckle. None of the steel in the<br>building was *melted*, but it was twisted and warped from losing<br>structural integrity. Steel can lose around 50% of its structural<br>integrity at around 1100°F. Studies of the wreckage showed that some of<br>the pockets of fire reached over 1800°F, more than enough to cause the<br>steel to lose its structural integrity and allow the floors to<br>collapse.\<br>\<br>You would think that structural engineers would have thought of this,<br>and would have taken steps to prevent the beams from becoming heated in<br>a fire, you know, like using *insulation* and stuff.\<br>\<br>In fact, at one time, the beams in the building were insulated. With<br>*spray-on asbestos*. As you know, exposure to airborne asbestos<br>particles causes a very specific lung cancer called *mesothelioma*. So<br>asbestos has been banned in construction for the last 25 years. Anywhere<br>that asbestos was found to have been used in fireproofing in<br>construction, it has been removed. Removal is a difficult and costly<br>process, since you have to control the airborne asbestos particles very<br>carefully.\<br>\<br>In the WTC, the asbestos was removed from the beams, but *had not yet<br>been replaced*. As long as the sprinkler systems in the building are<br>working, and the insulation is scheduled to be replaced, this is<br>acceptable under NYC fire code. This lack of insulation on the beams<br>allowed them to heat above 1200°F and lose structural integrity, causing<br>the upper floors to collapse, and the floors underneath to<br>pancake.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
