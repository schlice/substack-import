<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The world is playing tiddly winks while Trump is playing 4-D chess. At<br>the same time that the administration delayed some tariffs for 90 days,<br>they imposed a 125% tariff on Chinese products. So they're suspending<br>tariffs on other countries, but raising tariffs on China.<br><br>Do you see what's happening here? **This isn't about tariffs. It's<br>about *China.*** China has been systematically stealing our stuff<br>for decades. They steal our intellectual property, produce cheap<br>knock-offs of our stuff, and sell it back to us, in our own marketplaces<br>(ahem, Amazon), and undercut the people who actually created the stuff.<br><br>They've been part of the World Trade Organization for decades, and they<br>have never abided by any of the rules *they agreed to* for all of<br>that time.<br><br>Could this cause a short-term rise in some product prices? Sure. But<br>China will back down. President Xi can only stay in power so long as his<br>people are employed. Once tariffs get so high that people stop buying<br>Chinese products and Chinese workers start losing their jobs, they're<br>going to start looking for new leadership in Beijing.<br><br>Once we raise tariffs high enough, Xi will start negotiating. We cannot<br>crack down on the theft of IP in China. China has to crack down on the<br>theft of IP in China. We just need to give China the right "motivation"<br>to start playing by the rules.<br><br>This is how we protect America. This is how we put American workers and<br>American entrepreneurs first. This is how we put American businesses<br>first. Love him or hate him, Trump is doing *exactly* what he was<br>elected to do.<br><br>Making it up as they go along? Hardly. *They're the only ones with the<br>plan.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
