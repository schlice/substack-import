<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Cars, toys, and aspirin, all have to follow the mandatory safety<br>standards in order to protect the users of the products. Guns are exempt<br>from these type of standards. Why shouldn't guns be subject to the same<br>type of standards?**<br><br>Maybe I don't understand.<br><br>So you're saying that someone can crush up 500 aspirins and put them in<br>my dinner and after I die, my family can sue the aspirin company for<br>failing to protect me from their product?<br><br>No?<br><br>Or you're saying that if I get hit by a Ford, my family can sue Ford for<br>failing to protect me?<br><br>No?<br><br>Or you're saying that someone can take Super Stretch Man and wrap his<br>arms around my neck, and my family can sue the toy manufacturer for<br>failing to protect me?<br><br>No?<br><br>So why are you trying to apply that same lack of standard?<br><br>Probably because you (and *The Trace*) have no idea what you're talking<br>about.<br><br>Guns are *most certainly not* **exempt from any safety<br>standards.** Their safety record speaks for itself. Gun operators are<br>very rarely, if ever, injured or killed by a defect of those products.<br>I'd venture to say that guns are extremely safe for their operators.<br><br>Oh wait, you're talking about the person on the *business end* of the<br>gun?<br><br>The problem, in those instances, is that the gun is operating<br>*correctly.* Product liability would attach if the gun was not operating<br>correctly (material defect) and it injured or killed its operator or<br>bystanders.<br><br>People try to sue gun manufacturers when their products are used<br>*illegally*, which is not the fault of the manufacturer. But people try<br>anyway. In fact, one of the tactics of the anti-gun Left is to sue gun<br>manufacturers out of business, forcing the passing of laws to protect<br>arms manufacturers from such frivolous lawsuits. Yes, it's clear that<br>such a lawsuit would never proceed on the merits, but wasting all the<br>time and money in defending the suits would have put them out of<br>business.<br><br>Therefore, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) was<br>passed. This law makes it illegal to sue gun manufacturers for product<br>liability when their products work as designed. This should seem fairly<br>intuitive, but they had to make a law to prevent it.<br><br>Hopefully this helps you to understand.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
