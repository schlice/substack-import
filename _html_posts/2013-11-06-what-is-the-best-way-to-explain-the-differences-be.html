<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I think the best way to answer this is that the source of<br>both of these is different.\<br>\<br>Rights, as stated by Jefferson, are \"inalienable\" because they were<br>endowed by our Creator. They are inalienable, which means they can never<br>be revoked by anyone. Because we live in a society in which the rights<br>of others also have to be respected, our rights can be curtailed or<br>limited, but never revoked.\<br>\<br>Privileges are granted by governments or other organizations. Because<br>privileges are not inalienable, they can be revoked. For example,<br>driving a car is a privilege.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
