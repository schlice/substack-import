<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [I think the best way to answer this is that the source of<br/>both of these is different.\<br/>\<br/>Rights, as stated by Jefferson, are \"inalienable\" because they were<br/>endowed by our Creator. They are inalienable, which means they can never<br/>be revoked by anyone. Because we live in a society in which the rights<br/>of others also have to be respected, our rights can be curtailed or<br/>limited, but never revoked.\<br/>\<br/>Privileges are granted by governments or other organizations. Because<br/>privileges are not inalienable, they can be revoked. For example,<br/>driving a car is a privilege.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
