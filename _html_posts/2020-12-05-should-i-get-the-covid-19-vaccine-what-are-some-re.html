<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Are there any valid reasons for not getting the covid 19 vaccine?<br><br>*(Remember, this was asked in the MS space, so this answer is specific<br>to MS patients)*<br><br>At this time, we don't know, because we don't have one yet.<br><br>But there *may* be valid reasons for not getting one. We can use the<br>same valid reasons to not get *specific formulations of the flu shot* as<br>an example.<br><br>There are two specific formulations of flu shot: a *killed virus* and an<br>*attenuated virus*. The killed virus is *inactivated* virus. Inactivated<br>viruses are made from a protein or other small pieces of a virus or a<br>bacteria. The inactivated virus is injected into your body, and your<br>body responds exactly as it would if the virus were whole and active.<br>You create antibodies to fight off that virus (even though it cannot<br>infect you), and you store the pattern of those antibodies to fight<br>re-infection. But it has no chance of giving you the flu, because it's<br>inactivated. Your body does react as if you got the flu (you sometimes<br>feel a little feverish or develop some body aches).<br><br>The LAIV (live attenuated influenza vaccine) is a spray mist sprayed in<br>the nose. This virus is live (still capable of infection), but is<br>*attenuated*, or weakened. It allows people with a normally-functioning<br>immune system to create antibodies to the flu without getting sick.<br><br>The key there is *normally-functioning immune systems*. Certain people<br>who are on immunosuppressant or immunomodulating therapies should not<br>take the nasal spray flu vaccine. Also, it is widely accepted that<br>people with MS do not have normally-functioning immune systems.<br>Therefore, people with MS should not take the live attenuated flu<br>vaccine. They should always discuss with their doctor which flu vaccine<br>is right for them to get, but in most cases, it's going to be the shot.<br><br>Depending on how the COVID-19 vaccine works, doctors will have to make<br>informed decisions based on their patients and what medications they are<br>taking in order to make a recommendation as to whether or not they<br>should take the vaccine. Be sure to check with your neurologist once a<br>vaccine is released.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
