<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The president doesn't have the authority to overturn state or local<br>laws. The truth is that the president, like the Congress, follows the<br>will of the people. And the people (well, the white people anyway)<br>wanted these laws.<br><br>Jim Crow laws were state and local laws which existed for about 100<br>years (from the end of the Civil War until around 1968). They started to<br>crumble in the post-WWII reconstruction time period, which saw a great<br>deal of civil rights expansion for blacks (in fact, it was civil rights<br>for all, including blacks).<br><br>All of those presidents may have been good men and good presidents, but<br>they were not kings. They work for the people. And if that's what the<br>people want, the president (and the Congress) won't override them. The<br>multitude of state and local laws which existed around the country<br>testified to the fact that people wanted those laws.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
