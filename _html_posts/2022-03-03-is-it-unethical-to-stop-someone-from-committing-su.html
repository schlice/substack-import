<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No. Ethically, life is seen as good. Our bodies are intrinsically<br>programmed to want to live. When you're drowning, you struggle to get<br>out of the water so you can breathe. Our bodies are built with natural<br>survival techniques. It is clear that physiologically, we are designed<br>to live. Therefore, life is good.<br><br>Since death is an end to life (which we just established is good), then<br>ethically, death is not good.<br><br>Suicide is manually inducing death (which is not good), and so<br>ethically, stopping someone from manually inducing death is the opposite<br>of "not good" which is good.<br><br>If someone believes that life is bad, they have a belief problem, not an<br>actual bad life problem. Sure, they have troubles (so does everyone),<br>but ethically, as life is seen as good, they can overcome their troubles<br>just as countless other people who have troubles can (and do).<br><br>Besides, there are numerous ways to overcome troubles in your life, and<br>suicide is simply too final of a way to do so.<br><br>So from a purely ethical perspective, it is indeed ethical to attempt to<br>stop someone from committing suicide. If they really, really want to,<br>that's because they are really, really confused, not because it's<br>unethical to stop someone from committing suicide.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it unethical to stop someone from committing suicide, especially if<br>they really, really wanted to?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
