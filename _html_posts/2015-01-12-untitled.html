<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Like I mentioned, it\'s a violation of law. These laws are<br>usually State-level laws that are enforced by the municipality in which<br>the infraction took place.\<br>\<br>For example, Colorado\'s traffic rules are codified in Colorado Revised<br>Statutes, Section 42-4. CRS 42-4-107 states \"No person shall willfully<br>fail or refuse to comply with any lawful order or direction of any<br>police officer invested by law with authority to direct, control, or<br>regulate traffic. Any person who violates any provision of this section<br>commits a class 2 misdemeanor traffic offense.\"\<br>\<br>If a traffic officer (any traffic officer would qualify under this<br>section) tells you to not move your car, moving your car in direct<br>violation of his lawful order constitutes a class 2 misdemeanor traffic<br>offense, in addition to the original violation. Doing so in an unsafe<br>manner (putting his safety at risk) would at least be an aggravating<br>condition, if not a separate charge altogether.\<br>\<br>That\'s just one example from Colorado state law. Each local area can<br>make their own laws which match the state statute.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/If-a-police-officer-is-giving-you-a-parking-ticket-can-you-get-in-the-car-drive-away-and-escape-the-ticket/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
