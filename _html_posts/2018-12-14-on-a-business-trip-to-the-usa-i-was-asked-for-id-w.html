<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**On a business trip to the USA, I was asked for ID when entering a bar.<br>The guys on the door were very surprised that I didn\'t routinely Carry<br>ID on me (I\'m from the UK). Is this a normal \'thing\' in the USA?**<br><br>You must understand the cultural differences.<br><br>The entire layout of the country was built around the automobile. How we<br>lay out communities and towns and cities and neighborhoods is all<br>predicated on the presence of a personal automobile. While in the UK you<br>can walk to a neighborhood store or to school or to the library, in the<br>US, in nearly all cities, you have to drive there because the distances<br>are usually too great. Some small strip malls are appearing in more<br>populated suburbs to make up the difference, but even these may be too<br>far to walk to. They may be just a few minutes drive, however.<br><br>To that end, nearly everyone is a driver, so it is very common for<br>almost everyone to routinely carry their license with them. It is used<br>just as much as a form of personal identification as it is a validation<br>that they are able to drive a car on public roads.<br><br>Additionally, bars in the United States ID everyone who appears to be<br>under 40 years old, and the most commonly accepted form of<br>identification is a driver's license.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
