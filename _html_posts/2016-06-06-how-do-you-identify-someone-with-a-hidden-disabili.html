<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>They tell you "I have a hidden disability."<br><br>Other than that, the point is that the disability is "hidden," which<br>means it doesn't produce any visible symptoms.<br><br>Which generally produces the response, "Wow, ***but you look so<br>good..."***<br><br>The dichotomy that then goes on in the mind of such a disabled person<br>is, "It's strange that I look so good on the outside, when I **feel<br>so bad on the inside.**"<br><br>The short answer is that you cannot identify someone with a hidden<br>disability unless they tell you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
