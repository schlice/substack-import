<br><br><h2>Space Submission</h2><br><div><br><br>Space name: Christians & Christianity<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Wow, three questions in one! Aren't I the lucky one? I will helpfully<br>split the one question into three and answer all of them.<br><br>> What does it mean to put 100% faith in Jesus Christ<br><br>It means to trust him, completely and totally. It means you understand<br>who he is (God in human form, the word became flesh) and what he has<br>done for you (died to pay for your sin). It means rejecting any other<br>method by which you might attain salvation. You can't believe that Jesus<br>is the way to salvation and also believe that you can earn your way into<br>heaven by doing good things or whatever. There is only one way to<br>salvation. This is what it means to be "all in" for Christ.<br><br>> how do we truly believe he died for our sins even though we don't know<br>> him<br><br>Great question! I mean, this stuff happened thousands of years ago. Some<br>guy could have totally made this up!<br><br>The problem with that (and it is a big one) is the Bible isn't just any<br>old book. It wasn't written by *one guy*. The Bible is a *compilation<br>of* 66 books, written by about 40 different authors, over the span of<br>*1500 years* on three continents. There is no possible, physical way<br>that these authors could have collaborated to concoct such a story and<br>have such *unity* in the message. Throughout the entire Bible,<br>everything points to Jesus. Every story, every song, every poem,<br>foreshadows the life of Christ.<br><br>Additionally, the Bible contains a great deal of *prophecy*. Prophecy is<br>the ability to see events in the future, before they happen. Some of<br>these early Bible authors were prophets. They foretold events that were<br>to take place. And hundreds of years later (thousands of years later in<br>some cases), those prophecies *all came true in the life of Jesus<br>Christ*. The probability of those things happening are *astronomical*.<br><br>But, you say, couldn't Jesus have read those early works and then just<br>*done* those things? Sure he could have. But could he have controlled<br>*his birth*? Could he have controlled *his lineage*? Everything about<br>him and his earthly ministry was foretold by prophets. The chances of<br>that happening by chance are too high to even be probable.<br><br>Therefore, we know the Bible must be true, and must be the inspired word<br>of God, because only God could have inspired these writers to write what<br>they did.<br><br>There's no reason to believe that the Bible is true, but then not<br>believe what it says.<br><br>So how do we know that Christ died for our sins? The Bible tells us so.<br><br>> what do we if we're are ignoring our conscience and we are<br>> unrepentant?<br><br>When I was in pilot training, I can remember one time when ATC told me<br>to fly at 9000 feet. I was flying along, and my instructor said, "What's<br>your altitude?" I said, "Just under 9000 feet, yeah, I know I'm a little<br>low." And he sort of raised his voice a little and said, "Well, fix it!<br>You're the pilot!" So I pulled back a little on the stick and we climbed<br>up to 9000 feet.<br><br>If you know you are doing the wrong thing, fix it! Don't wait until<br>some time in the future. It's not like you're going to have to so<br>radically alter your lifestyle that you'll be bored, or you will feel<br>like you're missing out. I know, because I've been there. Your<br>conscience is trying to guide you. Maybe it's time to start listening.<br><br>God will always love you. He will never leave you. He will never give up<br>on you. He is literally waiting for you to make the right choice and<br>accept Jesus as your savior and give your life over to him and to repent<br>of your sins.<br><br>But no one will ever force you. You are always free to make your own<br>choice. He wants that, too. He wants you to choose him knowing<br>everything you know. He wants you to see that his way is better. He<br>wants you to see that his way leads you to life, and to freely choose<br>him.<br><br>So? What are you waiting for? Like my flight instructor said, fix it!<br>It's time to stop ignoring your conscience, and it's time to start<br>living the way God wants you to live. The sooner you do, the sooner you<br>will end this struggle in your heart. Warring against your own<br>conscience simply cannot end well. It simply leaves you frustrated and<br>angry. So stop doing that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
