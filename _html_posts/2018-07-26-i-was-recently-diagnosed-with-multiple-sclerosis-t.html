<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I was recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The doctors say<br>there is no cure. What should I do? I feel depressed.**<br><br>There are a lot of answers here. Most of them don't actually answer your<br>question, or they give you improper or even dangerous advice. Please<br>read on, and don't follow any medical advice without consulting with<br>your doctor before you do.<br><br>Depression is a normal part of the grief process. Going through the<br>[[five stages of<br>grief](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d7b8fa&url=https://grief.com/the-five-stages-of-grief/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="grief.com"}]{.qlink_container} is normal, natural, and<br>required (you must get through it, you cannot go around it). And there<br>is no "set timeframe" for how long you linger in each stage of grief.<br>Some people pass through it rather quickly, and others can get bogged<br>down in depression for long periods of time.<br><br>But in nearly every case, you will get through it. You will move past<br>the grief and into acceptance and you will be able to sort your feelings<br>and make a future.<br><br>On the medical front, if you haven't gotten yourself a good<br>neurologist yet, do it. Find a neurologist *who specializes in multiple<br>sclerosis*. Let me caution you: DO NOT pick just any old neurologist! If<br>you need help finding a good neurologist in your area, reach out to<br>[[your local chapter of the National MS<br>Society](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2ebc99&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Chapters){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} (assuming you're<br>in the United States).<br><br>You will want to get on one of the approved MS therapy drugs. MS may not<br>be curable, but we can slow it down and lessen its effects. Evidence is<br>mounting that the sooner you do this, the longer you will go without<br>more significant disability later on. The "conservative" approach is to<br>"conserve" as much brain tissue as possible, so getting on one of the<br>approved drugs is absolutely key.<br><br>People will tell you that there are all kinds of magical cures for MS,<br>everything from getting off of anything with aspartame to special diets.<br>While complementary and alternative medicines can help you feel better<br>(in some cases) and can improve your quality of life, they won't slow<br>down disease progression. Use them, but in conjunction with your MS<br>therapy drugs and with the advice and consent of your neurologist.<br>That's why they are *complementary* medicines: they *complement* your<br>existing therapies. They should not be thought of as a *replacement* for<br>your existing therapies.<br><br>Finally, look for a support group in your area. Talking to other people<br>who have experienced what you have is also critical to improving your<br>outlook on your life and understanding your disease.<br><br>As some others here have said (and I compliment them for it), ***MS is<br>life-altering. It is not life-ending.***<br><br>And in case you were wondering, there is no cure yet for MS, and<br>there is no grand conspiracy to silence those who "found the cure."<br>Considering the millions of medical personnel who would have to be in on<br>such a conspiracy, there would have to be a few leaks. To date, over the<br>hundreds of years which MS has been recognized to exist, there has never<br>been a "leaker" indicating that there is a vast conspiracy covering up<br>the true cure for MS.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice. This answer is for GENERAL<br>INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. If you think you are experiencing a medical<br>emergency, call your local emergency number (in the United States, 911)<br>immediately.* *ALWAYS SEEK THE ADVICE OF YOUR DOCTOR* *before<br>starting or changing treatment.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to health-related questions are<br>intended third-party beneficiaries with certain rights under Quora\'s*<br>[[Terms of<br>Service](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
