<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I guess these days I can call myself a conservative Christian. So<br>speaking as one, I don't think that conservative Christians "hate"<br>anyone. They may not wish to associate with people who they have judged<br>to be sinners, and I don't blame them. I wouldn't want to associate with<br>known sinners myself. People tend to emulate those they spend the most<br>time around. Think about it: aren't most of your friend groups people<br>with whom you personally identify? Isn't that normal and acceptable? As<br>part of what James 1:27 refers to as \"pure and faultless\" religion, we<br>are to feel compassion towards those for whom Christ died and keep<br>ourselves \"from being polluted by the world.\" So of course I'd want to<br>distance myself from people who live in open sin; that's only natural<br>and makes sense. But *hate*? I don't think so.<br><br>In fact, we are called to *love* sinners. We do not love their sin, and<br>we encourage them to live righteously. But we still love them.<br><br>So let me ask you this: have you ever talked to an atheist? Have you<br>ever talked to someone who is strong in another faith? Have you ever<br>tried to talk to them about Christianity? Most people who have not<br>dabbled in apologetics or in active evangelism have never really done<br>that. What you'll find, in many cases, is people who are *intransigent*<br>and in some cases *openly hostile* towards Christians. This is<br>especially true of atheists, many of whom are atheists because they have<br>already had a bad experience with some Christians, and that hatred is<br>immediately transferred to anyone who calls themselves Christian, and<br>especially someone who is displaying an attitude of evangelism. So I<br>actually find that the perceived "hate" goes the other way.<br><br>Nevertheless, I think that conservative Christians do not "hate" anyone,<br>and especially do not hate anyone "by proxy." Remember, it's only the<br>sin we hate. If God hates sin, so should we, no? Jude 1:22--23 comes to<br>mind:<br><br>> Be merciful to those who doubt; save others by snatching them from the<br>> fire; to others show mercy, mixed with fear---hating even the clothing<br>> stained by corrupted flesh. (NIV)<br><br>So here, we're told that mercy for the sinner and a healthy loathing of<br>sin and its consequences should be the defining characteristics of our<br>evangelism. But we also understand that we are flawed human beings, and<br>that there is a huge gap between us and God in terms of loving and<br>hating. Even as Christians, we are not capable of perfect love or<br>perfect hatred (i.e., without ill will). But because He is God, God is<br>able to perform both of these things flawlessly. Without any desire to<br>sin, God can hate. Because of this, He is able to despise both the sin<br>and the sinner in a completely holy way, while also forgiving the sinner<br>in love at the point of repentance and faith.<br><br>The Bible clearly teaches that God is love.<br><br>> Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. This is<br>> how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into<br>> the world that we might live through him.--- 1 John 4:8--9 NIV<br><br>While we can't comprehend it, it is nonetheless true that God can<br>perfectly love and hate a person at the same time. This means He can<br>love him as someone He created and can redeem, as well as hate him for<br>his unbelief and sinful lifestyle.<br><br>We, as imperfect human beings, cannot do this; thus, we must remind<br>ourselves to "love the sinner; hate the sin." But how do we do that? We<br>demonstrate our love for sinners by treating them with respect (1 Peter<br>2:17), praying for them (1 Timothy 2:1), and sharing the gospel with<br>them. We demonstrate our hatred for sin by identifying sin for what it<br>is, abstaining from it, and decrying it as incompatible with God\'s<br>character. Sin should not be tolerated or dismissed; it should be hated.<br><br>**It is a true act of love to treat someone with respect and kindness<br>even though you do not approve of his or her lifestyle or sinful<br>choices.**<br><br>TL;DR: Sometimes, people misinterpret the hate for the sin as hating the<br>sinner. There is indeed a difference between hating the sinner and<br>hating the sin.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
