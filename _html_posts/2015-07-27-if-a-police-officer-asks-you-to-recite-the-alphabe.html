<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [My kids actually learned to recite the alphabet backwards<br>in school, so I learned it with them. Spoken rythmically:\<br>\<br>ZYXWVUT,\<br>SRQPONM,\<br>LKJ, IHG,\<br>FEDC \<clap\> BA.\<br>\<br>However, before I had kids, I was driving a drunk classmake back to the<br>dorms and the gate guard stopped us when he smelled the inside of the<br>truck cab. He made me get out and when I got to the guard shack, his<br>sobriety test included reciting the alphabet backwards. I could barely<br>do it, but not because I was drunk; I just could barely do it.\<br>\<br>Officers won\'t ask you to recite the alphabet backwards. There are too<br>many cognitive impairments that could interfere with a proper outcome,<br>and since it\'s so unreliable, it\'s not used anymore.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
