<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Have you ever gotten a tour of NORAD (when it was inside of Cheyenne<br>Mountain)?**<br><br>I used to *give* those tours. I worked in the Systems Center, so I knew<br>everything about the workings of the facility. I also worked in Security<br>Forces, which meant that sometimes I'd provide armed security on some<br>tours.<br><br>The Mountain is a fascinating relic of Cold War paranoia, but it's still<br>relevant today, for several reasons:<br><br>1.  Heat is a *negative* cost inside the Mountain. We re-circulate the<br>    heat from the people and the computers throughout the facility,<br>    which is naturally cooled by the surrounding granite to between 55<br>    and 65 degrees F, so only a little bit of additional heat is needed<br>    to bring the facilities inside the Mountain to a comfortable working<br>    temperature.<br>2.  Water is a *negative* cost inside the Mountain, due to several<br>    prolific natural springs which were hit while excavating the<br>    facility. The springs provide *so much* water that it is more than<br>    we can conceivably use for drinking and for mechanical (cooling<br>    towers, fire suppression, etc). We store 1.5 million gallons of<br>    potable water and 4.5 million gallons of non-potable water, and the<br>    spring produces so much extra that it's literally dumped out the<br>    side of the Mountain.<br>3.  Security is a *negative* cost inside the Mountain. We don't have to<br>    worry about stray radio signals listening to our gear, because<br>    science has so far had a hard time propagating a radio wave through<br>    1500 feet of granite. Physical security is simple when you only have<br>    one way in to your facility and it's got big blast doors on it.<br>4.  While it may not be able to survive a direct nuclear strike, nothing<br>    else can touch it. Storms (hurricanes, winter weather, etc) won't<br>    knock it out. Its redundant power systems mean that it will never<br>    lose power. Its redundant communications systems means that it will<br>    never lose connectivity. You can't fly a plane into it. It's about<br>    the securest facility you can think of, as secure as any<br>    subterranean facility, except it's built into a mountain.<br><br>I personally believe that the minor inconvenience the General has to go<br>though to haul his ass up to the facility in the event of a contingency<br>is a small price to pay for the big benefits we have of hosting a<br>facility whose mission is still relevant today inside of Cheyenne<br>Mountain.<br><br>\<br><br>Want some more cool information about NORAD?
