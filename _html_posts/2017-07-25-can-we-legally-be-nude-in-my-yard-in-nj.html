<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, as with all legal answers, this is not legal advice. To<br>get legal advice, you must consult an attorney in your area. This is<br>general information. To get specific advice for specific situations, you<br>must contact an attorney.<br><br>Under N.J.S.A. 2C:14-4, *it is unlawful for a person to commit any<br>flagrantly lewd and offensive act that one knows or reasonably expects<br>is likely to be observed by other non-consenting individuals who would<br>be affronted and alarmed.*<br><br>Notice that the statute doesn't say anything about where you are, or<br>what fences you are protected by. It simply states that you can be<br>charged under the statute if you are *likely to be observed* by a<br>non-consenting individual. You should also note that the statute doesn't<br>mention whether or not you truly believed you were in an area that you<br>were likely to not be observed. It only mentions reasonable expectation,<br>so the test is the "reasonable person" standard. In other words, would a<br>reasonable person in that situation believe that it is likely that they<br>would be observed?<br><br>In your case, because you have elevated property around you which can<br>see into your yard, a reasonable person would believe that you are<br>likely to be observed by non-consenting individuals. Therefore, it's<br>likely that you could be charged under NJ's indecent exposure law.<br><br>If you are convicted of violating N.J.S.A. 2C:14-4, you could be<br>punished by up to a 30-day jail term and a fine of up to \$1,000.<br>However, if your nudity was observed by a child under 13, or an<br>individual suffering from a mental disability or deficiency that<br>prevents him from understanding the nature of your conduct, then the<br>severity of the crime increases, and you could face up to 18 months in<br>jail and pay a fine of up to \$10,000.<br><br>**TL;DR: Under NJ law, if someone sees you from those high windows, you<br>could be charged with indecent exposure, even in your own back yard.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
