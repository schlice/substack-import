<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What laws or rules of a HOA can be established about homeowners with<br>out of control kids?**<br><br>The answer really depends on what "out-of-control kids" do to harm other<br>neighbors.<br><br>If there is vandalism or noise after 11:00 PM, it is out of the HOA's<br>hands. Contact your local police department.<br><br>HOAs usually do have rules about excessive noise, nuisance odors, and<br>disturbing other neighbors unnecessarily. You should have a look at the<br>Governing Documents to see if any HOA rules that currently exist might<br>cover your situation.<br><br>If not, talk to the HOA Board members. They are homeowners too, and they<br>live in your neighborhood with you. I'm sure they can find a way to<br>assist you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
