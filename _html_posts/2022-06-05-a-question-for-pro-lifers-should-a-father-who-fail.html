<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you can prove that the State's motivation in restricting abortion is<br>to remove the woman's control over her body, then the State can use the<br>same line of reasoning (removing control over his body) to sterilize a<br>man.<br><br>But as of yet, no State (nor does the draft SCOTUS opinion) state as<br>their primary reason for repealing *Roe* that the motivation in<br>restricting abortion is to "remove the woman's control over her own<br>body."<br><br>In my opinion, women absolutely have control over their own bodies, but<br>only to a certain extent. In the case of abortion, it's not a control<br>issue. It's an equal rights issue. And if we are to be consistent<br>regarding equal rights, then we must consider the baby in the womb to<br>have at least access to the same rights.<br><br>So it's much less about control, and much more about equal rights.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>A question for Pro-Lifers. Should a father who fails to support his<br>child be subjected to forced sterilization by the State if the mother<br>was forced to carry the child to term by the State?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
