<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How does Apple stop the iPhone XR from cannibalizing sales for the<br>iPhone XS?**<br><br>Literally no one who was going to buy an Xs would actually stop<br>themselves and say, "You know what, I really wanted an Xr." That's not<br>the customer they're going after.<br><br>Which means you asked the wrong question.<br><br>What you *meant* to ask was "How does Apple stop the iPhone Xr from<br>cannibalizing sales of the *iPhone X*"?<br><br>Easy. Give it a 331 ppi LCD display.<br><br>Wanna know the last Apple device that had a display of this resolution?<br>The iPhone 4.<br><br>But LCD 1080p displays are so cheap to put on phones. If manufacturers<br>like Huawei and Xiaomi can do it, why can't Apple? I mean, I can't watch<br>Netflix or Hulu in 1080p on a phone released in 2018? No full HD<br>support? What's the deal?<br><br>The deal is that Apple is trying not to compete with itself.<br><br>If they release a phone running iOS 12 with an A12 Bionic chip *and* a<br>1080p display, who's going to bother to pay an extra \$250 just to get<br>an OLED screen?<br><br>That's right, no one in their right minds. So once they drop the Xr, no<br>one will buy an X, and they're not planning on stopping production on<br>the X just yet, even with an Xs and an Xs Max in production.<br><br>But just as phones differentiate themselves on the *high* end, phones<br>have to find their niche in the *lower* end, too.<br><br>And in this case, a phone with a lower-resolution LCD screen is<br>definitely going to feel less premium than a higher resolution OLED<br>screen. This leaves the three levels of device (Xr, X, and Xs) in clear<br>stratas of product.<br><br>That's what they were going for, and that's why they put the lower<br>resolution screen on the Xr.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
