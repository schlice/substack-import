<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I have to agree with [[Ian<br>R](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ian-R-124)]{.qlink_container} on this<br>one. It's likely that your HOA rules has some sort of clause in it which<br>requires that a garage be usable for cars.<br><br>You should contact the Managing Agent of your HOA and request a copy of<br>the P,P,R&R (Policies, Procedures, Rules, & Regulations). In Colorado,<br>we broke those up into two separate documents (Policies & Procedures,<br>and Rules & Regulations). You'd be looking for both documents. The Rules<br>will detail the specific rule which requires your garage to be capable<br>of accepting a car. As a tenant, you should have received the copies of<br>all of the HOA Governing Documents along with your lease, but some<br>landlords are less responsible about those things than others.<br><br>The HOA can indeed write a rule that says that garages are for cars.<br><br>In our HOA, we did it slightly differently. We said that all homeowners<br>and tenants must park in their garages. Once their garages are full **of<br>cars**, they must then park in their driveways. Only guests may park in<br>the street, and only for a maximum of 10 days.<br><br>Notice the specific bolded text. It's no excuse to come to the Board and<br>ask for an exception when you have three cars, a two-car driveway and a<br>garage full of "not cars."<br><br>We didn't say you can't store stuff in your garage. We simply said that<br>you can't park on the street, and having a garage full of stuff is not<br>an excuse for parking on the street. We are fining a particular<br>homeowner in my HOA monthly (which is more expensive than him renting a<br>storage unit, but whatever) because his garage is full of work stuff and<br>he refuses to relocate his work stuff and park his cars in his garage<br>instead. Oh well, it's his money I guess.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
