<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In general, an officer cannot "get in trouble" for failing to make an<br>arrest or write a ticket, so long as he believes that no arrestable or<br>ticketable offense took place, and he can articulate that belief.<br><br>His basis is probably in his report. You can get his report from the<br>department, as the complainant. Feel free to contact the department and<br>speak to the officer's supervisor if you are dissatisfied with the<br>outcome of the incident.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
