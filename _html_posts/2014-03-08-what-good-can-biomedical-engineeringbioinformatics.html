<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Neural engineering (or neuroengineering) is the sub-class<br/>of biomedical engineering that focuses on using engineering to enhance<br/>or repair neural systems. These people work at the interface between the<br/>body and the machine. Two applications come to mind right away:\<br/>\<br/>Biocompatible prostheses: prostheses that respond directly to neural<br/>input. It doesn\'t have to be an artificial limb, either. Imagine<br/>putting on an exosuit (think a Spandex bodysuit with filaments running<br/>through it) and having it conduct the signals from the brain to the body<br/>because the nerves that are supposed to perform that function are shot.<br/>You would be able to walk again, or grab things correctly. This would be<br/>a coup for MS patients. It\'s also something that spinal-cord injury<br/>patients would like to see as well.\<br/>\<br/>Neural repair: one of the problems that MS patients face today is that<br/>nerves don\'t readily repair themselves. Even if the plaques are<br/>removed, the damaged nerves remain. Many times, especially in the brain,<br/>the function that was lost can be \"re-learned\" using other neural<br/>pathways. But in the spine especially, nerve tissue does not readily<br/>re-grow. Finding a way to influence nerve cells to regenerate (perhaps<br/>by bio-engineering adult stem cells) could mean that the body\'s own<br/>ability to heal itself could be enhanced and tuned to fix the damage<br/>caused by MS.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
