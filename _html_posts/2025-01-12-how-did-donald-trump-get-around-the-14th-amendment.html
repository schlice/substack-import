<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So the other answerers were correct, but let's go into a little more<br>detail about the 14th Amendment.<br><br>The 14th Amendment was part of a series of Constitutional amendments<br>passed following the end of the Civil War known as the *Reconstruction<br>Amendments*. They included the 13th Amendment, which ended slavery, the<br>14th Amendment, which provided equal protection under the law, granted<br>citizenship to everyone born here, and prevented any of the previous<br>cessation state politicians from holding positions in the new<br>government, and the 15th Amendment which allowed the freed slaves to<br>vote by preventing discrimination in voting based on skin color or<br>previous condition of servitude.<br><br>At the time of Reconstruction, the 14th Amendment prevented several<br>former Confederates from being sworn in to the post-Civil War Congress,<br>including a county sheriff, U.S. congressmen, and even a local<br>postmaster. At that time, there was a general understanding that the<br>disqualification clause barred ex-Confederates. So, many more former<br>officials didn\'t attempt to run for office again during this period.<br>Clause 5 of the Amendment permits Congress to enforce the Amendment<br>through "appropriate legislation."<br><br>Congress passed that legislation which also criminalized "insurrection."<br>This law is codified in 18 U.S. Code ยง 2383. A conviction under this<br>statute will lead to being ineligible from federal office. This could<br>form the basis for a future Supreme Court ruling that a person *not*<br>convicted of the crime of "insurrection" cannot be disqualified under<br>Section 3. However, the Supreme Court has not yet decided on such an<br>issue, nor has one been brought before the High Court.<br><br>Finally, in 1872, Congress passed the Amnesty Act. This removed Section<br>3 disqualification for most former Confederate officials (except<br>high-profile leaders like Jefferson Davis).<br><br>Today, the 14th Amendment gets tossed around a lot, with some people<br>questioning why Clause 3 (the Disqualification Clause) was not<br>implemented in the case of President Trump. There are several<br>significant reasons.<br><br>First, most of what we talk about regarding Clause 3 is *theoretical*.<br>Courts have had very little opportunity to ever develop any case law<br>around it, so it has never been thoroughly vetted by the courts.<br><br>Second, Clause 3 is *political*, not *legal*. So much like impeachment<br>being for "high crimes and misdemeanors" taking place during an elected<br>official's term, disqualification is something that Congress determines<br>(see *Trump v. Anderson 23--719 2024)*. Clause 5 says that it is<br>Congress who carries out the disqualification, and since the Clause does<br>not specify an amount, precedent says that only a simple majority of<br>both Houses of Congress would be needed, if a criminal conviction of<br>insurrection has not taken place, to disqualify someone from office.<br><br>To date, Congress has not moved to disqualify President Trump on the<br>basis of a 14th Amendment violation.<br><br>So no, Trump did not "get around" the 14th Amendment; he didn't meet the<br>criteria to be disqualified under it. Congress did not act to disqualify<br>him, and so he is not disqualified.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
