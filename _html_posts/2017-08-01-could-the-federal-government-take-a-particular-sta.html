<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Colorado is an interesting case. They didn't actually "legalize"<br>marijuana. What they did is to provide an "affirmative defense" to the<br>Federal charge at a state level. It also specifically enjoined state and<br>local law enforcement from enforcing any laws against the sale or<br>possession of marijuana. That means that no state or local cop will bust<br>anyone for possession of marijuana, because the state Constitution has<br>provided an affirmative defense for possession. They are allowed to<br>create laws surrounding appropriate use of marijuana, which they have<br>done.<br><br>This has no bearing whatsoever on the Federal charge of violations of<br>the Controlled Substances Act. It simply says that the state will not<br>charge you with violations of the CSA.<br><br>This means that the DEA could waltz in at any time and charge anyone<br>buying or selling marijuana with violations of Federal law. And that<br>would be perfectly legal. The change to the Colorado Constitution would<br>not apply, since the charge is a violation of the Controlled Substances<br>Act, not a violation of state law.<br><br>That also means that there is no legal case the Feds can pursue against<br>Colorado. In fact, it's already been decided by the Supreme Court that<br>the Federal government cannot force states to enforce Federal law.<br>Remember Arizona v. United States? Arizona wanted to enforce Federal<br>immigration law, and SCOTUS ruled that they could not. Only the Federal<br>government can enforce Federal law, and states are barred from doing so.<br>The Federal government, conversely, cannot force states to enforce state<br>law, either. All they are allowed to do is to claim that a state law<br>allows direct violation of a Federal law, which is not what the Colorado<br>constitutional change does.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
