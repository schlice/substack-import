<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>And what it depends on is *what state you live in.*<br><br>In some cases, the sunbather can be cited for indecent exposure if they<br>are indecent in an area which a reasonable person should know is<br>viewable by someone who has not affirmatively consented to seeing such<br>things. In New Jersey for example, they can be cited under this statute<br>for simply being naked in their yard. The statute doesn't care where<br>they are. It simply says that if they are in an area which can<br>reasonably be seen by someone who didn't consent to look at what they<br>are seeing, they can be cited. In such a scenario, imagine if a child<br>saw them. They could *also* then be charged with contributing to the<br>delinquency of a minor, which would get them arrested, and probably<br>added to the sex offender registry. Contrast that with the indecent<br>exposure laws in Colorado. In that state, the exposure must be<br>sexually-related in order to be charged with indecent exposure. They<br>either have to be having sex, or exposing themself in a sexually<br>explicit manner (i.e. touching themself explicitly). Simply "being<br>naked" where they can be seen by someone else does not constitute<br>indecent exposure there.<br><br>Also, if you can see them in their yard from your own house, you have<br>every right to watch as well as record, so long as you do it from the<br>same place you can normally see them (i.e. a second-story window). In<br>other words, if the sunbather wants *privacy*, they need to go inside<br>and cover their windows. If they can be seen from a neighbor's<br>second-story window, they voluntarily give up their expectation of<br>privacy by stepping outside naked. Whether or not they will be charged<br>with indecent exposure is dependent on your local laws.<br><br>Therefore, check your state and local laws regarding indecent exposure.<br>And if your local laws allow the exposure (so long as it is not sexual<br>in nature), then just enjoy the show, and feel free to record it if you<br>choose. You can even post it online (where appropriate), but you can't<br>sell it, because that would be using someone else's likeness for<br>commercial gain without their permission. Do be careful about the online<br>part though, laws are still very new regarding posting nude images of<br>someone without their permission, and *revenge porn* is a problem that<br>some states are trying to address. You certainly don't want to run afoul<br>of any of those laws, so while you can watch and record, please be very<br>careful about what you do with those recordings.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What should I do about my neighbor visibly nude sunbathing in their<br>backyard almost any day the sun's out now that it's getting warm- if<br>anything? I have now idea if there are even laws against this. Just<br>enjoy the show?<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice.
