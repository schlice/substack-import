<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Well, since you don't put your income on a W-4, you don't really need to<br>worry about it.<br><br>What you *do* put on it is the number of *exemptions* you have, so<br>that your employer can calculate how much of your salary to withhold for<br>taxes. Your company then pays your *estimated* income tax on your<br>behalf, right out of your paycheck.<br><br>Then, at the end of the year, you do an IRS form 1040, wherein you<br>calculate your *actual* taxes due, taking into account everything you<br>earned, all of your exemptions, and all of your deductions and credits.<br><br>- If the amount your company withheld is more than your actual taxes<br>  due, you get a refund.<br>- If the amount your company withheld is less than your actual taxes<br>  due, you owe the difference.<br><br>Putting exemptions on your W-4 to which you are not entitled simply<br>means you end up owing tax at the end of the year rather than getting<br>that sweet, sweet refund check.<br><br>But if you withhold *too much*, then you don't get enough of your<br>paycheck throughout the year. Sure, you get a massive refund check, but<br>you could have used that money throughout the year.<br><br>So it's only to your benefit that you do your W-4 correctly, and set<br>your withholdings right.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
