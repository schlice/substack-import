<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As [[Matthew Park<br>Moore](https://www.quora.com/profile/Matthew-Park-Moore)]{.qlink_container}<br>explained, in general, Good Samaritan laws are designed to indemnify you<br>against lawsuits for what might happen if you cause more harm to someone<br>when attempting to assist in a life-threatening situation. For example,<br>if you pull someone from a burning car but they had a spinal injury and<br>become paralyzed as a result, you would generally be protected from<br>lawsuits seeking damages because you caused the paralysis.<br><br>There are, of course, limitations to that protection.<br><br>For example, if you work in a field in which you should know better<br>(i.e. you're a doctor), you are not covered under many states' Good<br>Samaritan laws (but hopefully you have medical malpractice insurance<br>that can protect you). Also, you have to be making a *good faith<br>attempt* to save the victim's life; the protection does not allow you to<br>be reckless or place the person in more danger than you found them (also<br>called gross negligence). Back to the burning car example, if you were<br>to drag the person to safety and leave them on the pavement in the<br>middle of a six-lane freeway, it could be argued that you were negligent<br>in your actions, and it doesn't take a rocket surgeon to figure that<br>out.<br><br>If, however, you are making a good faith attempt to help, you're not a<br>trained first responder, and something goes horribly wrong during your<br>attempt, you should be indemnified under most states' Good Samaritan<br>laws. Not all states are the same. Alabama only protects<br>medically-trained personnel. Oklahoma only protects non-trained<br>personnel if they are performing CPR or controlling bleeding; anything<br>else, and you risk a liability lawsuit.<br><br>However, before you stop to help at an accident scene, take the time to<br>review the Good Samaritan statutes in your state.<br><br>Also, bear in mind that there is never any liability involved if the<br>only thing you do is to be a good witness and call 911 to let the<br>professionals handle it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
