<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm going to answer these out of order. It will make sense later. Trust<br>me.<br><br>> **That is, the fact that they sin is the result of a curse placed on<br>> humanity because of SOMEONE ELSE'S SIN.**<br><br>Adam's sin *changed humanity*. It changed us by *separating us from<br>God.* Jesus reunited us with God. That's the 30,000 foot view. Let's<br>talk details though.<br><br>Before the first sin, Adam and Eve walked with God in the Garden. They<br>could talk to God directly. They were as close to God as you could get.<br><br>After the fall, humanity was separated from God. Because Adam's choices<br>had introduced sin into the human condition, our bodies became<br>susceptible to disease and early death because of it.<br><br>We were always free to choose good or evil. But now we get to choose<br>good or evil in sinful bodies which cannot help but to sin. And because<br>of our sin condition, most of us sin without even thinking about it, in<br>our thoughts and in our words, in what we have done, and what we have<br>failed to do. We are all sinners. Each and every one of us have fallen<br>short of God's glory. If God were nothing but completely just, He would<br>be well within His rights to reject us all from His Kingdom and send us<br>to the torment of eternal separation from Him.<br><br>But He has offered us an alternative.<br><br>Instead of leaving us to this fate, He sent His son to pay for our sin<br>in our place. Jesus died on the cross, accepting onto Himself the sins<br>of the world: past, present, and future. His sacrifice paid for all of<br>our sin. His blood washed us clean. All we have to do is repent of our<br>sin and accept Jesus as our savior.<br><br>He built the system this way so we have the freedom to choose to love<br>Him or reject Him without violating our free will. If you think about<br>it, it's actually a pretty ingenious system.<br><br>The TLDR here is that you can *blame* God for the way this is, or you<br>can *love* Him for who He is and what He has done. In other words, you<br>can be *bitter*, or you can be *better.*<br><br>Be better.<br><br>> **If Christ truly paid for the sins of the world, then why must we<br>> continue to worship a God who condemns innocent people to Hell?**<br><br>Is anyone truly innocent? As we have seen, we are all sinners. No one is<br>truly innocent.ยน<br><br>Also, God has written His truth on to everyone's hearts, and His<br>invisible hand can be seen in all of His creation, in nature. In this<br>way, everyone knows about God. But people reject what they know is true.<br>This is what sends people to hell, not God. In other words, *people<br>willingly separate themselves from God by rejecting what they know in<br>their hearts to be true.*<br><br>It is only the people who have accepted Christ as their savior who<br>benefit from His salvific work on the cross.<br><br>\<br><br>ยน Children and the mentally handicapped are unable to consciously reject<br>God, and so they are not held responsible for that inability to reject<br>Him.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
