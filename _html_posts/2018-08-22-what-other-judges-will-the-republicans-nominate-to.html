Gruender, a former U.S. Attorney in St. Louis under Bush,<br>> has been a solidly conservative vote on the 8th Circuit since winning<br>> confirmation on a 97-1 vote in 2004. Before taking the U.S. Attorney<br>> post, he worked as a prosecutor there, handling white collar crime and<br>> corruption cases involving county council members, as well as lawyers<br>> and judges connected to a scandal in Missouri's workers' compensation<br>> system.<br>><br>> On the appeals court, Gruender wrote an en banc decision in 2008<br>> upholding South Dakota's "informed consent" law on abortion, and he<br>> later wrote an opinion stating that the state has the right to force<br>> doctors to tell women seeking abortions that they would be at risk of<br>> committing suicide if they underwent the procedure.

The Supreme Court later endorsed his decision, 5-4.<br>><br>> Hardiman won favor with gun rights advocates for a 2013 dissent that<br>> said New Jersey was violating the Second Amendment to the Constitution<br>> by requiring those seeking to carry a handgun to demonstrate a<br>> "justifiable need" for such a permit.<br>><br>> Raymond Kethledge of Michigan, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth<br>> Circuit, 51. Kethledge, who joined the 6th Circuit in 2008, has a<br>> resume with something rarely seen on Trump's SCOTUS list: a stint on<br>> Capitol Hill. The University of Michigan law school graduate spent a<br>> couple of years as a Judiciary Committee counsel to former Sen.<br>> Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.) before heading across the street to clerk<br>> for Kennedy.<br>><br>> In 2014, Kethledge wrote an opinion rejecting a groundbreaking Equal<br>> Employment Opportunity Commission case seeking to limit private<br>> employers' use of credit checks for job applicants.
