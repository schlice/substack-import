<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Bible is a compilation of books and letters (66 of them) which were<br>written by about 40 different authors over the span of about 1600 years.<br>It was written by a wide variety of people: doctors, rabbis, tax<br>collectors, fishermen. It was written in 13 different countries on three<br>different continents. Yet there is unity in the message of the<br>Bible. The themes of the writing are maintained across the years, the<br>people, and the locations. And after all that space and time, the Bible<br>does not contradict itself. It is only by divine inspiration that such a<br>feat could have taken place.<br><br>Compare this to the Qur'an. It was compiled by one person, Zaid bin<br>Thabit, under the guidance of Mohammed's father-in-law, Abu-Bekr. Then,<br>in A.D. 650, a group of Arab scholars produced a unified version and<br>destroyed all variant copies to preserve the unity of the Qur'an.<br>\[1\](#Hgewy){#cite-Hgewy .citation_link}<br><br>In other words, the Bible was unified across the years, people, and<br>continents, from the time of its writing. The Qur'an had unity forced<br>upon it by human editors.<br><br>That is just one way we know that the Bible, as a whole, is the inspired<br>word of God. Some of the others:<br><br>- Prophesy. God spoke to men telling them the things that he was going<br>  to make happen in the future. There are over 300 prophecies about the<br>  coming of Jesus, and these were all written long before he was born.<br>  They all came true in his life.<br>- Archaeological records support what was written in the Bible. While<br>  people have tried to find archaeological evidence to disprove what was<br>  written in the Bible, to date they have failed.<br>- Outside writings corroborate the stories told in the Bible. For<br>  example, a man named Titus Flavius Josephus was a Jewish historian who<br>  wrote during the 1st century AD. Josephus records some events which<br>  also correlate with what was written in the Bible. There are others as<br>  well, and they all back up what was stated by the Bible authors.<br>- Scientific accuracy. Every scientific claim made in the Bible has been<br>  found to be true, despite the scientific knowledge of the age. For<br>  example, in Isaiah, it says "It is he who sits above the circle of the<br>  earth" (Isaiah 40:22 ESV). The word "circle" here translates to<br>  "globe" or "sphere." How did Isaiah know that the earth was a sphere,<br>  when all scientific knowledge at the time said the earth was flat? Job<br>  said, "He spreads out the northern skies over empty space; **he<br>  suspends the earth over nothing.**" (Job 26:7 NIV). How did Job know<br>  that the earth "hung in space" before modern astronomy? Divine<br>  inspiration.<br><br>The Bible is an amazing book. It is so deep, that scholars can spend<br>*lifetimes* studying it and still never completely plumb the depths of<br>its knowledge and wisdom. Yet its stories are so simple, children can<br>read the Bible and understand the major themes written within it. How<br>can people create something so timeless and so complete, so complex and<br>yet so understandable, at the times when these books were written? The<br>only logical conclusion is divine inspiration.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>J.K. Rowling (for arguments sake) wrote Harry Potter & made billions<br>through penning her gift of imagination. The Bible was written by<br>humans. Why do people believe Its the word of God. How can we prove<br>it\'s not fiction?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-Hgewy){.citation_index} [[Is there proof for the<br>inspiration of the<br>Bible?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bcc67a&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/proof-inspiration-Bible.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
