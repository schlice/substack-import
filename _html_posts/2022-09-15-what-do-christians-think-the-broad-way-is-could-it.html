<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> "Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the<br>> road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small<br>> is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few<br>> find it." --- Matthew 7:13--14 NIV<br><br>This idea of "the broad way" versus the opposite, "the narrow way," is<br>directly out of the Sermon on the Mount. Matthew's Gospel details the<br>sermon.<br><br>I heard a comedian say, "The fact that there's a 'Highway to Hell' but a<br>'Stairway to Heaven' says a lot about predicted traffic volume."<br>Similarly, the fact that there is a "wide gate" versus a "narrow gate"<br>also says something about predicted traffic volume.<br><br>The gate which leads to destruction is wide. It's easy to pass through.<br>It doesn't require much effort, and it's really comfortable. There's<br>plenty of room on the road. You don't have to hunt for it, it's big and<br>bold, blocking your view. You can't miss it. But the gate which leads to<br>life is small, and the road you'll be traveling is narrow. It's more<br>difficult of a journey, as the road is clearly not well-traveled. The<br>gate is not grandiose, but small. It's not difficult to find, but it's<br>not dominating your view either.<br><br>This is literally an allegory for our decision to give ourselves to<br>Christ.<br><br>Living a life of sin is easy. We simply do what our bodies tell us they<br>want to do. Little effort is required, and we have a very easy journey<br>on a nice, wide road, through grand, broad gates. And that road leads<br>directly to Hell.<br><br>But choosing to give our lives to Jesus involves effort. It involves<br>introspection and acceptance that we are all sinners. It involves the<br>conscious decision to repent of (or turn away from) sin and turn towards<br>the life Jesus offers. It runs counter to what our bodies want to do.<br>It's therefore not easy, and few people will choose that path. The gate<br>is small, and the road is narrow.<br><br>So what is the "broad" way? It's the way of the world. It's the way that<br>the atheists and the naturalists and the "do-what-feels-good" crowd want<br>you to take. It's easy. There's little effort involved.<br><br>But the "narrow" road through the small gate is the way of Jesus. It's<br>not the easiest road, and it's not the most comfortable.<br><br>But it's not the road that counts in this case. It's the *destination.*<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What do Christians think the broad way is? Could it be the false church<br>that is everywhere?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
