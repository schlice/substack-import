<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [See a doctor.\<br>\<br>Throat and ear pain when swallowing can be caused by any number of<br>medical conditions. Most commonly, it is caused by sinus drainage<br>irritating the throat and similar drainage from the sinus cavities<br>through the eustachian tubes is also irritating.\<br>\<br>But there are a number of other conditions which can cause pain when<br>swallowing. I highly suggest visiting your doctor this week. If your<br>pain is accompanied by fever, chills, body aches, nausea or vomiting,<br>get to your doctor today, or visit your local urgent care if your<br>doctor\'s office doesn\'t have weekend hours. If none of those options<br>are available to you, go to the nearest ER for<br>treatment.]<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
