<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Jon, I can take this.\<br>\<br>For a food service establishment, these days they have to follow certain<br>health codes. Their employees have to be trained on the use of the<br>sanitization equipment that is used for the plates, glasses and utensils<br>and in the correct use of the dishwashing machines. The business retains<br>the liability if the employee does not properly sanitize the dishes and<br>utensils and a customer contracts any manner of foodborne illness due to<br>unsanitary conditions. The restaurant would then be subject to closure<br>by the local government\'s health department because of unsanitary<br>conditions. There is no way that any person would be allowed to use<br>food-grade sanitization equipment without being a trained employee.\<br>\<br>In short, this may have been something that happened years and years ago<br>in a small town in a mom-and-pop diner that washed their dishes by hand,<br>but that kind of thing would never happen today because of health/safety<br>and liability concerns.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Do-restaurants-allow-someone-to-wash-dishes-as-compensation-if-they-cannot-pay/answer/Jon-Mixon-1<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
