<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It depends on the particular \"anti-gun effort\" in question.<br><br>If the goal is elimination of all guns out of the hands of private<br>citizens, then yes, that particular anti-gun effort is indeed futile<br>while the Second Amendment still stands.<br><br>If the goal is to reduce the amount of guns that law-abiding citizens<br>possess, or reduce the amount of law-abiding citizens who can possess<br>guns, these efforts are not futile. They have worked in the past. They<br>can be disguised in many different ways, primarily under the guise of<br>protecting people from certain types and classifications of other<br>people. For example, felons. Once you\'ve been convicted of a<br>felony, in most states, you never get your gun rights back (it depends<br>on the particular conviction, and the state in which it was received).<br>Felons are *adjudicated bad people*, right? So if we can\'t get rid of<br>guns, we\'ll make certain people ineligible to carry guns, and we\'ll<br>start with people we know are bad, because the court said so.<br><br>But then we move on to other people, like those who are **mentally<br>ill**. I mean, if they can\'t tell that purple aliens aren\'t coming<br>down to suck out their brains, how can they possibly wield a gun safely?<br>Sure, let\'s restrict them too.<br><br>But then, and at the risk of invoking the slippery slope argument, where<br>does it end? Just because the slippery slope argument is a logical<br>fallacy in general doesn\'t mean that it sometimes doesn\'t have roots<br>in truth. Case in point: in July of last year, the administration<br>started pushing for Social Security benefit recipients from owning<br>firearms if they "**lack the mental capacity to manage their own<br>affairs**.\" Specifically, they seek to target Social Security<br>recipients who are unable to manage their own affairs because of<br>\"marked subnormal intelligence, or mental illness, incompetency,<br>condition, or disease.\" Social Security has never classified people in<br>this way, but the VA has. They have reported people to NICS who have<br>been declared incompetent to handle pension or disability payments and<br>have been assigned a fiduciary.<br><br>How long are we going to let the government chip away at the rights of<br>the citizens to keep and bear arms? If they can\'t get wholesale repeal<br>of the Second Amendment, and they can\'t actually get rid of guns, they<br>will chip away at who can legally own guns, little bits at a time, until<br>virtually every category of citizen will be disallowed, in one way or<br>another, from legally owning a gun.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
