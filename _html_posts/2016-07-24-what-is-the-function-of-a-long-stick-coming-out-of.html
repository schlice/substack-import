<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>(EDIT: changing my answer now that details have arisen)<br><br>This is a pitot tube. Pitot tubes measure air pressure, which help<br>the aircraft compute things like airspeed and altitude. It works in<br>conjunction with a static port to form the pitot-static system.<br><br>The problem arises due to what is known as the aircraft's **pressure<br>field**. As the aircraft moves through the air, it "pushes" and<br>"compresses" the air in front of it; even the most streamlined aircraft<br>still produces a pressure field. Every airframe is different, and every<br>pressure field is different.<br><br>Additionally, the pressure field changes (grows, shrinks, morphs) as the<br>aircraft maneuvers. Especially during high-G maneuvers, or high<br>angle-of-attack maneuvers, the pressure field surrounding the aircraft<br>can grow fairly substantially.<br><br>The pitot tube needs to be longer than the pressure field to reach into<br>relatively undisturbed air to better calculate air pressure, with less<br>compensation needed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
