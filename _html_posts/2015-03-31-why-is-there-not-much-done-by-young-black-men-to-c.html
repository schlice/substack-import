<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [*PLEASE NOTE: We\'re going to talk about some very<br>hot-button issues, and the media has conditioned you to think that any<br>time we speak about these, they are instantly \"racist.\" Relax, I\'m<br>not racist. But in order to discuss these things, we have to tread into<br>area that is generally considered \"racist.\"*\<br>\<br>*Are we past that now? Good. Let\'s get to the meat of the issue.*\<br>\<br>\<br>\<br>Great question, and very timely. Thank you for asking.\<br>\<br>There are two major problems that feed into why young black men don\'t<br>change their perceptions of themselves:\<br>\<br>1. A culture in the black community that values underachievement.\<br>\<br>Jason L. Riley, a columnist with the *Wall Street Journal*, recently<br>published a book called *Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make It<br>Harder for Blacks to Succeed.* He talked about his book in a speech he<br>gave recently:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> The book is not an autobiography or a memoir, but I do tell a few<br>> stories about growing up black and male in the inner city. And one of<br>> those stories involves a trip back home to Buffalo, New York, where I<br>> was born and raised. I was visiting my older sister shortly after I<br>> had begun working at the *Wall Street Journal*, and I was chatting<br>> with her daughter, my niece, who was maybe in the second grade at the<br>> time. I was asking her about school, her favorite subjects, that sort<br>> of thing, when she stopped me and asked, \"Uncle Jason, why you talk<br>> white?\" Then she turned to her little friend who was there and said,<br>> \"Don\'t my uncle sound white? Why he tryin\' to sound so smart?\"\<br>> \<br>> She was just teasing, of course. I smiled and they enjoyed a little<br>> chuckle at my expense. But what she said stayed with me. I couldn\'t<br>> help thinking: here are two young black girls, seven or eight years<br>> old, already linking speech patterns to race and intelligence. They<br>> already had a sophisticated awareness that, as blacks, white-sounding<br>> speech was not only to be avoided in their own speech, but mocked in<br>> the speech of others.\<br><br>\<br>Statistics bear this trend out. Eighty percent of black kids in New York<br>public schools are performing below grade level. And a big part of the<br>problem is a black subculture that rejects attitudes and behaviors that<br>are conducive to academic success.\<br>\<br>Another big part of the same problem is a reluctance to speak honestly<br>about these cultural shortcomings. Racism has become an all-purpose<br>explanation for bad black outcomes, be they social or economic. If you<br>disagree and you\'re white, you\'re a bigot. If you disagree and you\'re<br>black, you\'re a sell-out.\<br>\<br>If we\'re going to talk honestly about this subject, we have to look at<br>the violence in black communities. Blacks constitute about 13% of the<br>total population, but they commit more than half of the murders in the<br>United States. The black arrest rate for most offenses is typically two<br>to three times their representation in the population. So long as blacks<br>continue to commit a larger than average amount of crime, they are going<br>to be perceived suspiciously and tensions between the races will<br>continue. If we want this to change, we\'re going to have to talk about<br>how to change the behavior that drives these perceptions.\<br>\<br>2. **A Democratic party that is willing to support the false narrative<br>that racism is the cause of any bad black outcome.**\<br>\<br>The Left in this country play a big part in keeping blacks from helping<br>themselves, by sticking to the same tired explanation that all bad black<br>outcomes are because of racism, and we have to \"help\" the black man to<br>overcome it. Otherwise, he will never improve his lot in life. Looking<br>specifically at what you asked (the high rates of black violence in<br>America), the Left would like to blame this on lots of different things<br>which have nothing to do with the real cause:\<br><br>- *Poverty and racial tensions.* Back in the 40\'s and 50\'s, when<br>  racism was legal and blacks were far poorer than they are today, the<br>  black crime rate was lower.<br>- *\"The system.\"* Blacks have long been a part of running that system.<br>  Some of the most violent cities in this country in the 70\'s and<br>  80\'s, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, and Cleveland, were run by<br>  black mayors and black chiefs of police. Some of the most violent<br>  cities today are run by blacks.<br>- *Over-policing of black neighborhoods*. The Left would love for you to<br>  believe that blacks are dying at the hands of cops, when this<br>  couldn\'t be farther from the truth. A cop is six times more likely to<br>  be shot by a young black man than the other way around. 98% of black<br>  shootings don\'t involve police at all. The number one cause of death<br>  for a young black man is homicide, and in 90% of those cases, the<br>  shooter is another young black man. The rate at which blacks are<br>  arrested is nearly equal to the rate at which blacks are identified by<br>  victims as their assailants. The police are in those neighborhoods<br>  because that\'s where the 911 calls are coming from, and young black<br>  men are being killed by other young black men, not cops.\<br>  \<br><br>If the Left really wanted to change these trends, they should be<br>focusing less on their tired narratives, less on \"racism,\" and more on<br>the attitudes in the black community towards school, work, marriage,<br>parenthood, and raising children. Black boys without a father are 68%<br>more likely to be incarcerated than those with a father. The likelihood<br>of teen pregnancy, drug abuse, dropping out of school, and other bad<br>social outcomes increases dramatically when a father is not around.<br>Political scientist James Q. Wilson said that if crime is to a<br>significant degree caused by weak character, if weak character is more<br>likely among children of unmarried mothers, if there are no fathers who<br>are willing to help raise their children, acquire jobs, and protect<br>their neighborhoods, if boys become young men with no preparation for<br>work, if school achievement is a sign of having sold out \-- if all of<br>these things are true, then the chances of reducing the crime rate among<br>low income blacks anytime soon is slim.\<br>\<br>Blacks ultimately have to help themselves. They have to develop the same<br>attitudes and behaviors and habits that other groups had to develop to<br>rise in America. And to the extent that a social policy, however<br>well-intentioned, interferes with this self-development, it does more<br>harm than good. The Left continues to trumpet these social policies<br>intended to \"help\" the black community, when all they do is create a<br>\"learned helplessness\" that keeps blacks ultimately as perpetual<br>victims. This does nothing to help them! Asked by whites in 1865 what to<br>do for freed black slaves, Frederick Douglass said, \"I have had but one<br>answer from the beginning. Do nothing with us! \\...\ If the apples<br>will not remain on the tree of their own strength\...let them<br>fall!\...And if the Negro cannot stand on his own legs, let him fall<br>also. All I ask is, give him a chance to stand on his own legs.\"<br>Douglass was basically saying give blacks equal opportunity, then leave<br>them alone. Booker T. Washington also said that it\'s important and<br>right that all privileges of the law be granted to blacks, but it is<br>vastly more important that they be prepared for the exercise of those<br>privileges.\<br>\<br>They both understood that government needed to ensure that equal rights<br>were assigned to blacks, but they also understood the limits of<br>government benevolence. Blacks have to meet the challenge of being in a<br>position to take advantage of those rights. The history of 60\'s liberal<br>social policies is mostly a history of ignoring that advice.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
