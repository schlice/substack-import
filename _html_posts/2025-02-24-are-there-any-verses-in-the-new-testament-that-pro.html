<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Before I answer your specific question, I need to explain what it is you<br>are referring to.<br><br>This is a movement known as Prosperity Theology. It is a belief that<br>financial and physical well-being is a gift of God, and that faith and<br>charitable donations will increase a believer's material wealth. **We<br>believe that this is an unbiblical, quite possibly heretical,<br>teaching.**<br><br>There are a number of verses that believers in the prosperity gospel<br>point to. I know you said New Testament, but believers also point to an<br>Old Testament passage:<br><br>> Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my<br>> house. And thereby put me to the test, says the LORD of hosts, if I<br>> will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a<br>> blessing until there is no more need. \-- Malachi 3:10 ESV<br><br>But from the New Testament, we have the following:<br><br>> The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they<br>> may have life and have it abundantly. \-- John 10:10 ESV<br>><br>> And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in<br>> glory in Christ Jesus. \-- Phil 4:19 ESV<br>><br>> Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in<br>> health, even as thy soul prospereth. --- 3 John 1:2 KJV<br>><br>> Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you<br>> have received it, and it will be yours. \-- Mark 11:24 ESV<br><br>The idea of the prosperity gospel is foundationally unbiblical, as it<br>promotes the idea of material blessings as being a sign of God's favor.<br>It promotes the idolatry of money, and we believe that Jesus\' teachings<br>indicate a focus away from material wealth, and towards spiritual<br>blessings.<br><br>Jesus spoke directly about this in the Sermon on the Mount:<br><br>> Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust<br>> destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for<br>> yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys<br>> and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure<br>> is, there your heart will be also. \-- Matthew 6:19--21 ESV<br><br>We believe that the "blessings" spoken of in the other passages refer to<br>spiritual blessings, not material blessings. Prosperity theology teaches<br>that God is a cosmic vending machine: put your prayers into the little<br>coin slot, and financial prosperity comes out the little door at the<br>bottom. Jesus specifically teaches against this.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
