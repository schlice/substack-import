<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Biden Administration is not attempting to put pressure on Hamas. The<br>Biden Administration is attempting to put pressure on Israel.<br><br>Their focus, as of late, has been trying to get Israel to stop its<br>counter-offensive against Hamas. Israel, for its part, rightly claims<br>its right to self-defense, and that the attack by Hamas was an act of<br>war against the state of Israel. Israel has legally declared war against<br>Hamas, and calls for Israeli restraint have been met with examples of<br>how Israel is not indiscriminate with its operations. In fact, the IDF<br>has taken great pains to ensure that non-combatants are not harmed. This<br>does not mean that there will be no civilian casualties, just that<br>Israel is taking a very slow, methodical approach to attacking Hamas.<br><br>One example of this is how they are choosing to flush Hamas out of their<br>network of tunnels: flooding them with seawater. The influx of seawater<br>is gradual enough to simply make the tunnel network unusable, not to<br>kill everyone inside by making the tunnels impassable. It's to force<br>Hamas to evacuate everyone from the tunnel network and to make the<br>tunnels as unusable as possible. If Israel was being indiscriminate,<br>they would have used mustard gas or fuel-air bombs in the tunnel<br>network. They have instead chosen to flood the tunnels to force Hamas<br>out.<br><br>\<br><br>But even if they wanted to, the US really has no control over Hamas.<br>Hamas is literally laser-focused on the destruction of Israel and the<br>complete genocide of every Israeli in the region. I mean, it's even in<br>their slogans. "From the river to the sea" literally means from the<br>Jordan to the Mediterranean. For those in the cheap seats, *that's all<br>of Israel*. Anyone who chants "from the river to the sea" is advocating<br>for the complete genocide of all Israelis. Genocide, by any country, is<br>never a valid wartime tactic.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
