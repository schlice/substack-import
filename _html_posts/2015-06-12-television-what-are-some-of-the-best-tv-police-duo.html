<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Thanks for the A2A. My top five all-time favorite police<br>duos:\<br>\<br>5. Starsky and Hutch - from the show that bore their names. No<br>explanation needed. Classic never-follow-the-rules guys. Totally<br>tipified that 70\'s mentality people had of the police.\<br>\<br>]<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-f7cfcfa353d3ce437f243417809218ec){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-f7cfcfa353d3ce437f243417809218ec" master_w="214"<br>master_h="317"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br>\<br>4. Poncherello and Baker - from the second-best 70\'s police show,<br>*CHiPs*. Erik Estrada and Larry Wilcox will always be best remembered<br>for this. And what do we remember best? The title sequence, scrolling<br>through the closeups of the characters on their bikes. Totally cool.\<br>\<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-b06210cbe8f5bf7bcd794c9fd2b026f6){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-b06210cbe8f5bf7bcd794c9fd2b026f6" master_w="214"<br>master_h="317"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br>\<br>3. Benson and Stabler - The only reason *Law & Order* and *Law &<br>Order: SVU* isn\'t higher in my list is because it\'s too dramatized for<br>me. I love it for what it is, but it\'s too \"made-for-TV\" to be higher<br>in my list. That said, Chris and Mariska play their characters superbly.<br>And this cast is an insane group of people. You totally got to watch<br>Ice-T cut his acting chops throughout this series. Seriously, he was<br>terrible his first few shows (sorry T, I calls \'em like I sees \'em).<br>And who knew funny man Richard Belzer could play a role like this? He\'s<br>great. And Dann Florek is a card as well, but he makes a great boss<br>(I\'d work for him). Awesome cast here.\<br>\<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-e34adab58b24e9d2f6a5cdaa4e2d698d){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-e34adab58b24e9d2f6a5cdaa4e2d698d" master_w="502"<br>master_h="374"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br>\<br>2. Briscoe and Curtis - Jerry Orbach makes all the difference here.<br>He (and my #1 pick) are absolutely made for their characters. They play<br>them so well, it\'s sometimes hard to separate the man from the<br>character. Lenny Briscoe will forever be the coolest cop. Ever. And Rey<br>Curtis as his partner was even better than Jesse L. Martin\'s Ed Green,<br>although he comes in a really close second in my book. This shot of<br>Bratt, Orbach, Executive ADA Jack McCoy (played by Sam Waterston) and<br>ADA Jamie Ross (played by Carey Lowell) is one of my all-time favorite<br>cast line-ups they ever fielded.\<br>\<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-1eed596743d60a63fa3b531dc8e48e3c){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-1eed596743d60a63fa3b531dc8e48e3c" master_w="300"<br>master_h="173"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br>\<br>1. Sipowicz and Simone - First, I have to say that as a drama, *NYPD<br>Blue* was, by far, the best police show, ever. Even better than *Hill<br>Street Blues*, which was right up there (\"Let\'s be careful out there,<br>people\"). I know it was a dramatization, but they did pull their<br>content from real cases. I know, because one night while I was watching,<br>I got a call from my dad, who was excitedly screaming into the phone:<br>\"That was my case! I worked that case! That was my case!\" And even<br>though Bobby Simone came on later in the series, he was clearly Andy\'s<br>best partner. He was good for Andy; he kept him grounded, probably kept<br>him sane, and saved his life more times than we can count. Dennis Franz<br>played that role so well, it\'s hard to separate him from it. Just<br>remove some of the TV dramatization from it, and it really was a pretty<br>close approximation of squad detectives.\<br>\<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-6a9c71290c0bf37dbcc975c52e89760b){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-6a9c71290c0bf37dbcc975c52e89760b" master_w="214"<br>master_h="317"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br>I should note that *NCIS* is one of my favorite shows, but since it\'s<br>not a police duo, it doesn\'t make the list. Mark Harmon is just<br>awesome.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
