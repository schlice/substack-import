<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [%00000000001\<br>\<br>It\'s very very unlikely that you would survive those shots. There are<br>multiple factors involved, such as how close you were to the gun, what<br>was the angle of incidence in which you were shot, where did the bullet<br>impact, where did it enter the brain, where did it exit, what is the<br>brain\'s capacity for self-healing, etc.\<br>\<br>Plus, when there is a traumatic brain injury, there are many other<br>factors that will determine survival, such as secondary infection and/or<br>intercranial edema.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
