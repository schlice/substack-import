And<br>the President's executive action was not guidance on how to execute<br>existing law. It was \*new\* guidance that does not exist in current<br>law. The President cannot write law, only Congress can write law. And<br>therefore, his unlawful executive action was stayed.<br><br>Yes, the better way would indeed be to follow the law and go through the<br>proper procedure if you are dissatisfied with a law. Like perhaps going<br>to the people who, oh, I don't know, write the laws and petitioning<br>them to, oh, I don't know, change the law.<br><br>What the President and liberal Democrats fail to understand is that<br>*inaction by Congress does not mean failure to act.

And so Congress *chooses*, consciously, to do<br>nothing.<br><br>When the President says, "I'm acting because Congress failed to act,"<br>this is faulty logic, is self-serving, and as the Supreme Court ruled<br>today, is unlawful.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-disrespect-law/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
