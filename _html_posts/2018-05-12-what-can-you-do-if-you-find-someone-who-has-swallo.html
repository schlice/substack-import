<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So from your question details, you found the woman unconscious.<br><br>Once you have called the ambulance, cooperate with the 911 operator as<br>much as you can, trying to find out what she took and how much of it she<br>took. Is there a pill bottle nearby?<br><br>Then, start CPR. Is she breathing? Is her heart beating? Is her airway<br>obstructed?<br><br>Once those are taken care of, there's really not much more you can do.<br>The rest would have to be handled by a hospital.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
