<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will the Mueller Report be enough to overcome the elephant in the room<br>AKA \"The good of the country\" and finally flush Trump out of office?**<br><br>Most certainly not.<br><br>Even if the House Democrats look at Mueller's report and determine that<br>there is enough evidence in the "emanations and penumbras" (because it's<br>not in the written text) that Trump attempted to obstruct justice, and<br>they decide to impeach him over it, the Senate will never vote to remove<br>him from office. It wlll be seen as blatantly political, it will serve<br>to destroy the integrity of the impeachment process (reducing it to<br>"sour grapes" political caterwauling) and it will cost them the White<br>House in 2020 when Trump gets re-elected.<br><br>The only point at which Trump is going to leave office is at the natural<br>conclusion of his term. Based on how Democrats in Congress are handling<br>Mueller's findings, that looks like it will be in 2024.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
