<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Is it kidnapping?*<br><br>In the United States, a baby does not gain the privileges associated<br>with personhood until it is born. The fetus does not have any rights.<br>Therefore, a pregnant woman cannot be charged with kidnapping since<br>there is no baby (save for the fetus in her womb) to be kidnapped.<br><br>*\W\hat legal action can a husband take if the wife is 9 months<br>pregnant and leaves him only taking her clothes and own money?*<br><br>Make sure that you change the locks, cancel any credit cards she may<br>have, and close any checking accounts she may have access to.<br><br>Since you said \"wife,\" I can only assume that the couple was married.<br>So while she may \"leave the house,\" if she really wants to \"leave,\"<br>she will need to file for divorce. During the divorce settlement, child<br>support and visitation arrangements will need to be made. She will want<br>to do this, because being a single mother is hard, and she will want to<br>ensure that child support arrangements are made by the court. Alimony<br>(also called maintenance in some states) is dependent on how long the<br>couple was married, and several other factors that the court uses to<br>determine whether or not it will be paid.<br><br>Conversely, of course, if the mother requests child support, the father<br>will request visitation rights. This door swings both ways.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
