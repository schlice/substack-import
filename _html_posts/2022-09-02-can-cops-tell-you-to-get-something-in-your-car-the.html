<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are plenty of people who will tell you that this is the stupidest<br>question they have ever seen in this space.<br><br>There are also plenty of people who will tell you of course this<br>happens, and then the cops fabricate the evidence to acquit themselves.<br><br>But I'll tell you something different.<br><br>Yes it can happen, but not because of police malice.<br><br>It happened in the Philando Castile case.<br><br>[[Bill Stein\'s answer to After watching the dashboard cam from the<br>shooting of Philando Castile by police officer Yanez, what could the<br>officer have done to avoid a<br>shooting?](/After-watching-the-dashboard-cam-from-the-shooting-of-Philando-Castile-by-police-officer-Yanez-what-could-the-officer-have-done-to-avoid-a-shooting/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Without re-hashing my previous answer, Yanez gave Castile two<br>conflicting commands: get your license, don't reach for your gun.<br><br>When Castile said he was legally carrying a gun, he was told not to<br>reach for it.<br><br>Castile was stupid for trying to reach for his license when his gun was<br>so close to his license. When he did, Yanez shot him. Yanez was only<br>acquitted of murder charges because he claimed he was in fear for his<br>life.<br><br>But the video evidence told a different story. The video evidence showed<br>clearly that it was Yanez who put Castile in the bad situation in the<br>first place.<br><br>Remember the old adage: "Never attribute to malice that which can easily<br>be explained by stupidity."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
