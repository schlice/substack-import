<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Neither. We already have many gun laws, and better parenting can't<br>really be legislated.<br><br>The problem, which we all know in our hearts but dare not speak it, is<br>the decline of the nuclear family. The lack of ethics being taught and<br>modeled at home. The dissolving of the family and the rise (and<br>celebration) of single parenting. The near-necessity of two parents<br>working. The abortion culture, with its near-militant, but yet somehow<br>oddly casual, disregard for human life. The lack of focus on (and the<br>veritable shunning of ) mental health. After all of this, are we<br>surprised *at all* that mass shootings happen?<br><br>But thanks to the rise of liberalism and progressivism, that ship has<br>sailed. It will take *decades* to restore the family as the core unit to<br>train children on morals and values, and to model the same effectively<br>for them, if we even try.<br><br>No, it's far more likely that the family will continue to erode, along<br>with morals and values.<br><br>Therefore, the only way we can avoid more school shootings is to harden<br>schools even further.<br><br>- Employ full-time armed security<br>- Improve physical security. One-way doors, alarm systems, AI-powered<br>  scanners, monitored camera systems, etc.<br>- Dissolution of "Gun-Free Zones" and permitting fully-licensed<br>  concealed carry teachers to carry during school hours<br><br>Or even better, don't send your kids to traditional schools. Online<br>learning has gotten<br>[vastly(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6ad2b5&url=https://www.k12.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="k12.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br>[better(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=01aa8f&url=https://www.connectionsacademy.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="connectionsacademy.com"}]{.qlink_container}, and achievement<br>rivals that of traditional school settings. But again, that whole<br>both-parents-at-work thing kinda precludes homeschooling because your<br>kids need a babysitter.<br><br>See how the government has both caused the problem and then provided the<br>solution? Hmm...<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
