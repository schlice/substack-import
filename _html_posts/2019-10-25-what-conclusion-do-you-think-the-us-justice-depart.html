The IG is appointed<br>by the President and the nomination is confirmed directly by the US<br>Senate. Therefore, the IG is outside of the framework it is<br>investigating.<br><br>To that end, any investigation done into fraud, waste, abuse and<br>misconduct in the DOJ has the best chance of being neutral and fair.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
