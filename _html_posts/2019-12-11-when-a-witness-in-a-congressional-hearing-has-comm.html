In fact, people seem<br>to lie to Congress with great regularity.<br><br>[[5 people who lied to Congress, and what happened to<br>them](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=108264&url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/5-people-who-lied-congress-what-happened-them-n941936){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nbcnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>The Chairman cannot be sanctioned when a witness lies. The lie is all on<br>the witness. Charges are not required, so the Chairman is not derelict<br>in his duty if he does not press charges.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
