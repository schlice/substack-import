<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, the doors on modern airliners all open inward, they do<br>not open outward. Doesn't matter how hard you fall against it, you're<br>not going to open it.<br><br>Secondly, the cabin is pressurized. This means that the door is<br>being pressed into its frame by the differential air pressure inside the<br>cabin. At a typical cruising altitude, you can have up to 8 pounds per<br>square inch (psi) of pressure on the interior of the fuselage. That's<br>over 1,100 pounds per square foot holding that door into its door frame.<br>A human physically cannot move a door with around 2 psi (common at lower<br>altitudes) pushing it closed, let alone the 8 psi at cruising altitude.<br>You simply cannot physically move the door with that much air pressure<br>against it. The doors are further held in place by a series of<br>electrical and/or mechanical latches which prevent it from opening<br>unless you actually intend on opening it (which again is impossible<br>while in flight).<br><br>Thirdly, on the actual 2002 flight from hell, Lesnar and Henning fell<br>into the door. The "almost opening it" part that seems to be part of<br>some of the accounts all appears to be embellishment.<br><br>Short of some sort of massive structural failure, you cannot open an<br>emergency exit mid-flight.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
