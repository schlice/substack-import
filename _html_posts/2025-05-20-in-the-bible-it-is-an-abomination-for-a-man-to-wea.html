<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ah yes, another Levitical law question bring asked of Christians who are<br>no longer under the old laws.<br><br>Let\'s see...(thumbing through index of standard answers)...ah, here we<br>are: Biblical Laws.<br><br>The Bible contains three types of laws: ceremonial, civil, and moral.<br>Let\'s elaborate:<br><br>Moral Laws. These laws, such as the Ten Commandments, are seen as<br>reflecting God\'s eternal character and are believed to be binding on<br>all people, including Christians.<br><br>Ceremonial Laws. These laws dealt with religious practices like<br>sacrifices, purifications, and the observance of holy days within the<br>Old Testament covenant. They are understood to have pointed to Christ<br>and were fulfilled by his death and resurrection. Therefore, these laws<br>are not binding on Christians.<br><br>Civil Laws. These laws were specific to the nation of Israel and<br>dealt with matters like social order, criminal justice, and property<br>rights. They are considered to be temporary and not binding on<br>Christians, if they were specifically related to the functioning of the<br>nation of Israel, since God was creating a nation out of a group of<br>people who were multi-generational slaves and did not know how to govern<br>themselves.<br><br>The laws about clothing were intended to separate the nation of Israel<br>from all of the other nations, causing Israel to be set apart among the<br>nations. Dictating customs of dress was one way that God separated the<br>Israelites from the other nations around them. This is yet another<br>example of laws which only applied to the Israelites of the day, and do<br>not apply to Christians in the modern day.<br><br>That doesn\'t mean that the laws are not descriptive of the time in<br>which they were written. But just because they were *descriptive* does<br>not mean that they are *prescriptive*. Something can exist in the Bible<br>without it relating directly to us.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
