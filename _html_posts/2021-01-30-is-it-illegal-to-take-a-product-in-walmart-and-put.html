There is no law on the books relating to<br>relocation of products in Walmart. It's not illegal to take product from<br>one area of the store and move it to another.<br><br>Not having been a Walmart employee, I'm not sure if it violates store<br>policy. Store personnel normally do "recovery" when they find an item in<br>one area of the store that doesn't belong there. It's more work for<br>store employees, but in general, as far as I know, it doesn't violate<br>store policy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
