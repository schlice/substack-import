<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Certainly. Sounds like he may have found a great friend.<br><br>**If he is truly happy in his marriage, he will not find his friendship<br>brings his heart more joy than his marriage.**<br><br>And if he knowingly and willingly places himself in such a position, not<br>only is it disrespectful to his wife, and to the vows he has made, but<br>it is unfair to her for dividing his attention and his efforts between<br>women when only one of them rightly deserves that level of attention.<br><br>Remember, a marriage is based on love, and love in this context is not a<br>feeling. It is a *doing. Love* is a verb. You work on your marriage with<br>deliberate action that you do not take with a friendship. *That* is<br>love.<br><br>With that in mind, if you find yourself in a position where a friendship<br>makes you happier than your marriage, you may be placing too much<br>emphasis on the *feeling* of love rather than the *doing* of love.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Can-a-happily-married-man-fall-in-love-with-someone-else-and-if-yes-what-do-honest-men-do-then/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
