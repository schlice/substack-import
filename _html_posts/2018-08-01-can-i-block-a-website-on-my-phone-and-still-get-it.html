<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Depends on how you block.<br><br>If you\'re using the same browser platform on both devices, and your<br>blocking plug-in is the same, there is a fair chance that you can block<br>on one platform and see the block on the other.<br><br>However, it\'s not always the case. In fact, usually browsers are<br>different between mobile and desktop, so it\'s less likely that you will<br>see the same blocks on mobile that you see on desktop.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
