<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**At what price point would you consider a mobile phone case<br>ridiculously overpriced? What is the line you won\'t go beyond?**<br><br>It really depends what I'm protecting, what its warranty is, what<br>coverage I have for damage, and how much I need to protect it against<br>damage.<br><br>For example, my current daily driver is a Galaxy S8. Now, we all know<br>that the S8 is a screen crack magnet. Even though it's rocking Gorilla<br>Glass 5, it still tends to crack more than average, and industry drop<br>tests confirm this. However, it's a company phone, and they will replace<br>it if the screen cracks. They don't pay for my case, however.<br><br>So I get the case that I know has excellent corner protection, but isn't<br>going to break the bank. I have a [[Spigen Tough Armor<br>Case](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=73a52b&url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XP74MYV/ref%3Doh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie%3DUTF8%26psc%3D1){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}. It's one of the best-rated<br>cases at this price point, and so far, it has performed admirably<br>protecting my phone. I have dropped my phone once from waist high onto<br>the street and it was totally fine. I've also reviewed the OtterBox<br>Commuter for this phone, and it didn't review quite as well as previous<br>OtterBox designs, so I didn't feel comfortable shelling out the<br>additional for an OtterBox with it reviewing so poorly. I highly<br>recommend Spigen's cases, and if you haven't checked them out yet, you<br>should give them a chance.<br><br>Now for my wife's phone, I had to get an OtterBox, no question. She is<br>admittedly clumsy with her phone, often sticking it in workout pants or<br>shorts with no pockets and watching it tumble to the floor. Granted,<br>she's not tall so it's not a far drop, but she drops her phone far more<br>frequently than I do. So she most definitely has an OtterBox Commuter on<br>her iPhone 8. Pink and grippy, of course. So yes, I will shell out \$40<br>on that case.<br><br>If the situation called for it, I would definitely spend \$50 on an<br>OtterBox Defender (if I know I'm going to be working all day outside and<br>I could potentially be dropping my phone all over the place). But that's<br>it. Anything above \$50 is overkill.<br><br>Unless it's a specialty case like a battery case, which I know is going<br>to be more. However, I don't even get the expensive battery case. I got<br>the [[Elebase Battery<br>Case](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cb8cc4&url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071923NPC/ref%3Doh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie%3DUTF8%26psc%3D1){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container} for my phone, and it works<br>great. I had some issues with the PowerBear battery case for my son's<br>S7+, but I've had nothing but good things to say about this case. It's<br>totally worth the \$23 I spent on it. I don't keep it on unless I know<br>I'm going to be away from power for a full day or two.<br><br>I used to use ZAGG InvisibleShields on all my gear screens exclusively,<br>but when they switched away from the "full wet" install and instead went<br>to some stupid wipey wet thing, I dumped them. I went with the<br>[[ArmorSuit<br>MilitaryShield](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=578744&url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XXTRWBL/ref%3Doh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie%3DUTF8%26psc%3D1){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container} and I couldn't be happier.<br>It's one of the cleanest wet install screen protectors I've ever used,<br>and it works well with the Spigen case.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
