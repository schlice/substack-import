<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is every on duty cop now legally required to have a body camera?<br><br>In the context of this question, I'll assuming you're referring to the<br>nearly one million police officers in the more than 18,000 law<br>enforcement agencies across the country. And in that context, I can<br>emphatically say no, not every cop is legally required to have a<br>body camera.<br><br>Maybe every cop in a single city, or maybe even every cop in a single<br>state, *may* be required to have a body camera, but that would require<br>levels of funding that not every department or every state has, and it<br>is highly dependent on the state or the city.<br><br>In fact, there are scant few *laws* that require body cameras anywhere<br>in the country. Use of body cameras is generally regulated by the<br>department, at the direction of their governing body. It is not<br>generally mandated by law. Mostly this is due to the aforementioned<br>funding issues surrounding use of the cameras.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
