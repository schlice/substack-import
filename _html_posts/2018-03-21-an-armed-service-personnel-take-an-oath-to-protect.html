<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Armed service personnel take an oath to protect and defend the<br>Constitution . If our Government illegally revise the 2nd Amendment,<br>would the military personnel be obligated to follow their superior\'s<br>orders knowing the Constitution was violated?**<br><br>How do you "illegally revise" the 2nd Amendment? The only way to revise<br>the 2nd Amendment is through...you guessed it...the amendment process.<br>Amendments cannot be "revised" in any other way.<br><br>While I like hypotheticals as much as the next guy, this one simply<br>makes no sense. An amendment cannot be illegally revised. The only thing<br>the government could do is pass a law, and a law that is in violation of<br>the 2nd Amendment is, by definition, unconstitutional.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
