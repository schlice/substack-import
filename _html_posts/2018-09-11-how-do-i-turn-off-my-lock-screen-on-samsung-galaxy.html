<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How do I turn off my lock screen on Samsung Galaxy S9?<br><br>Assuming you actually can (I'll get there in a minute), the lock screen<br>is controlled from Settings \> Lock Screen and Security \> Screen Lock<br>Type. Just select "None" as your screen lock type, and your screen will<br>never lock. It will turn off, but it won't lock.<br><br>Some of your screen lock types may be "grayed out" (i.e. you can't<br>select them). For example, on my phone, I can't select None, Swipe, or<br>Pattern. Off on the right is a small "i" in a green circle (which<br>generally means "Information." You will see a popup which says something<br>along the lines of "Unable to perform action" and some text which<br>explains why. It may show you an app that is preventing you from setting<br>certain lock screens. For example, if you are connected to a corporate<br>network, or you receive company email on your device, the "Messages"<br>program may restrict certain lock screen types (including None, meaning<br>you must have a lock screen).<br><br>You can always disable that Device Administrator which is forcing you to<br>have a lock screen, but that particular app may stop working if it is<br>not a device administrator.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
