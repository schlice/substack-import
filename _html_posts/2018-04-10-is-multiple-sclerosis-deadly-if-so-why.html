<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is multiple sclerosis fatal?<br><br>We used to say that MS itself is not fatal, but you can be killed by the<br>secondary effects of the disease.<br><br>It's more accurate to say that because of medications which slow down<br>the disease process and lessen its effect, lifespans for people with MS<br>tend to match fairly closely with those who do not have the disease.<br><br>Some recent studies have shown that people with MS have been living, on<br>average, seven years fewer than people without the disease, mostly<br>caused by disease complications and other related conditions. Many of<br>these related conditions and complications are manageable, or even<br>preventable. Examples of related conditions in the study were heart<br>disease and stroke. Maintaining overall health and a healthy lifestyle<br>will be of great benefit in disease management.<br><br>That all said, there are a few rare cases of MS which can progress very<br>rapidly from disease onset, and can be fatal.<br><br>Continue to work closely with your care team, including your<br>neurologist. Follow their advice and stay healthy.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
