<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In the US, can Democrats pass any bill without having a majority in<br>the Senate?**<br><br>Yes!<br><br>A majority in the Senate is not required to pass a bill. You, as a<br>Democrat Senator, must reach consensus with your Republican<br>counterparts, and a bill can certainly be crafted that would pass both<br>Republican and Democrat scrutiny.<br><br>You need a majority in the Senate (to go along with the majority in the<br>House) to pass legislation that Republicans, by and large, *do not agree<br>with*. In other words, in order to *advance your agenda*, you need a<br>majority. Then, a party-line vote will fall your way.<br><br>You don't need a majority to pass any bill. You need a majority to pass<br>bills which the other party finds objectionable, and then you can pass<br>those bills *over their objections*.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for<br>everyone.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
