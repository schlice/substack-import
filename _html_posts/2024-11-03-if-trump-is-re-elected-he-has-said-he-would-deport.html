<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Continuing the poem you quoted (*The New Colossus* by Emma Lazarus) from<br>the base of the Statue:<br><br>> The wretched refuse of your teeming shore<br><br>Oof! "Wretched refuse?" That's what you call "immigrants"? And you think<br>that's valid? Maybe you should look closer at what you are espousing.<br>Because when Trump called these places "shitholes," you balked. But now<br>you're quoting the same poem which calls these people "wretched refuse?"<br>So shitholes is bad, but wretched refuse is good? I'm confused.<br><br>Anyway, let's continue, and I'll highlight what I'm talking about:<br><br>> Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,\<br>> I lift my lamp beside the golden door.<br><br>I highlighted something in the last stanza of that poem: **the golden<br>door**. Hmm. So they come in through a "door." Why is it a "door?" So if<br>it's a door, can it be *closed*? So that means there is a "wall" in<br>which there is a "door" and you can only come in through the "door"?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Because borders (walls) define the boundaries of our nation, and you<br>must come in through a process (the door) and we can decide, as a<br>nation, what that process is, and we can also define if we need to close<br>that door.<br><br>So yes, the President, who controls immigration policy, can determine<br>that people who came into our country *not* through the door must<br>leave and come in *through* the door.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
