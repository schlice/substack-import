<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The US Constitution has as its strongest undercurrent liberty. It says<br>very little about "equality," with the first reference to the concept in<br>the Declaration of Independence, and only then to show that "all men are<br>created equal" so as to eliminate classes of society (such as "being<br>born into nobility") popular in Britain at the time.<br><br>Since the purpose of the Constitution is to control the power of the<br>government, the whole notion of it is to preserve personal liberty. If<br>you want to equate it to equality, it would be **equality of<br>opportunity**. The Constitution affords all citizens the same<br>opportunity to succeed.<br><br>The new American Progressives (meaning since the founding) conflate this<br>with equality of outcome and attempt to show that the Constitution<br>is unjust because it allows class distinctions and income distinctions.<br>In a truly free society, it is only your degree of personal ambition<br>which limits your income and class potential, so in a way, the<br>Constitution does permit inequality, because it does not regulate it.<br>This is in keeping with the purpose of the Constitution: to limit the<br>power of government, not to force equality of outcome on the people. The<br>Bill of Rights enshrines rights you already have as a citizen and a<br>human being; it does not "grant" rights. Since there is no "right" to<br>equality, it is not a factor. The only right to equality might be found<br>in the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection clause, which says that all<br>laws must be applied to all citizens equally. It is the overreach of the<br>14th Amendment which implies to Progressives that **all thngs and all<br>outcomes** should be equal, not just application of the law.<br><br>It is a Socialist concept that forces equality of outcome over equality<br>of opportunity.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
