<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would you be happy for your son or daughter to become a police officer<br>or detective? Why or why not?**<br><br>I am facing this *today*, as my middle son wants to join the police<br>department.<br><br>Unlike my own father who supported me in everything *except becoming a<br>police officer*, I'm going to support my son in whatever field of<br>endeavor he chooses to enter.<br><br>That said, I'm going to spend a lot of time (as I already have) exposing<br>him to as many of the realities of police work as I can, not the<br>glossies on the public affairs website. I do this through trusted<br>friends who are active cops, as well as by explaining the process, the<br>environment, and the public perception, which is very important,<br>especially today. He knows what he can expect his life to look like for<br>the foreseeable future, and he knows the danger inherent in his choice<br>of career.<br><br>And he wants to do it anyway.<br><br>I won't stop him because it's not my life; it's his. But I will damn<br>well ensure that he goes in to it with eyes wide open, knowing exactly<br>what it is that he's getting himself into.<br><br>Now, will I be happy? Well, I'm happy for him, because he's chosen<br>something he's passionate about and is going to commit himself to<br>achieving. That's laudable in any day and age. Am I going to be happy<br>about his career choice? To be honest, there are other careers he could<br>have chosen which I would have been happier to see him pursue, but he<br>wouldn't have been as happy doing. But again, it's not about me, it's<br>about him. He has to be happy with his own career choice, not me.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
