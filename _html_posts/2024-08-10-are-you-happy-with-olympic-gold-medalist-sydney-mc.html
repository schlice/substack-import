<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What's to be not happy about? She is a woman of faith. She is under no<br>compunction to keep her faith under a basket while she's representing<br>her country. Unless you've forgotten, the ability to freely practice<br>your religion is in the Bill of Rights. So if she wants to credit<br>everything that she does to God's grace, what difference does that make<br>to you?<br><br>The United States is a country where you are free to practice whatever<br>religion you choose, or no religion at all. But that also brings a<br>*responsibility* to allow those who do wish to practice their<br>religion to do so without your interference.<br><br>Remember, you don't have the right to be *free from religion*. The<br>Constitution doesn't recognize such a right. But it *does* recognize the<br>right of every individual to practice their religion as they please,<br>even on the world stage.<br><br>And that is a beautiful thing for the world to see.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
