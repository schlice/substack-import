<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The short answer is **not without securing permission from the original<br>copyright owner.**<br><br>The longer answer is slightly more complicated, and differs around the<br>world. We'll stick with US copyright law.<br><br>An accompaniment track would be considered a *derivative work* under US<br>copyright law. This quote from<br>[Wikipedia(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0095ee&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_work%23Originality_requirement){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} was perfect for this<br>answer:<br><br>> For copyright protection to attach to a later, allegedly derivative<br>> work, it must display some originality of its own. It cannot be a<br>> rote, uncreative variation on the earlier, underlying work. The latter<br>> work must contain sufficient new expression, over and above that<br>> embodied in the earlier work for the latter work to satisfy copyright<br>> law's requirement of originality.<br><br>Therefore, since an accompaniment track is actually the original work<br>*minus vocals*, it would not meet the originality standard required to<br>protect it as a derivative work.<br><br>Therefore, in order to produce and sell an accompaniment track, you<br>would need to secure permission (as well as arrange for royalties) from<br>the original copyright holder.<br><br>***Of course, it goes without saying that this is not legal advice, and<br>if you're actually going to record and sell an accompaniment track, you<br>need to seek the advice of a licensed copyright attorney in your<br>area.***<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
