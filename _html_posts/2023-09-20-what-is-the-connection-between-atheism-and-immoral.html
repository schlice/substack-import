<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The problem you're running into is a fundamental misunderstanding of<br>morality, and by whose standards do you judge how moral someone is.<br><br>Morality for all people is something which is developed throughout your<br>childhood and upbringing, for theists and atheists alike. Your morals<br>are shaped throughout your childhood and into your adult life.<br><br>The difference between the theist and the atheist is **the source of<br>that morality**.<br><br>- For the atheist, the source of that morality is the **shared moral<br>  goals of society.**<br>- For the theist, the source of that morality is **that religion's deity<br>  and the teachings of that religion.**<br><br>The problem arises when atheists attempt to interpret the shared moral<br>goals of society. The big stuff, clearly, is well understood in society.<br>Don't murder, don't kick old ladies in the shins, etc. All societies all<br>over the world share these moral imperatives (which raises an<br>interesting question in and of itself, but we'll ignore that for now).<br>But as we get down into the weeds, we start to see variation, not only<br>between societies, but between people themselves. How high do we value<br>virtue? To what extent is philanthropy noble? When do I have to stop to<br>help that person, or when can I go on about my merry way? These are most<br>definitely variable when you try to interpret society's position and<br>then impart it on to your children.<br><br>But make no mistake: **to each individual, those actions are 100%<br>moral. But if the *source*** of your morality is not solid,<br>unchanging, and timeless, then the morals you may develop over your<br>lifetime may not match the morals of others in society. This is the<br>problem when you do not have an unchanging source of morals. Your<br>morals, essentially, become *self-referential*.<br><br>So are atheists, by default, less moral than people of other belief<br>systems? No, not at all. They believe they are acting 100% in accordance<br>with their morals, and they are. *The disconnect is in comparing their<br>morals with the morals of others.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
