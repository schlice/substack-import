<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I absolutely agree with you. Those people who say that life begins at<br>birth literally look at one of the two only people who were never born<br>and somehow equate that to the rest of humanity which comes into<br>existence in a totally different way.<br><br>Think about it. Adam was a Claymation character who God breathed on and<br>he came alive. Eve was built from one of Adam's ribs by God. Neither one<br>of them were "born." So trying to equate how Adam and Eve came into<br>existence with how the rest of us came into existence doesn't work. It's<br>like saying that a stick-built house is only livable once it is<br>completed because pre-fab houses aren't livable until they are placed on<br>the lot.<br><br>In order to determine when "life" begins, we first need to look at what<br>is the definition of "life" as it relates to humans who were born, not<br>humans who were not.<br><br>\<br><br>But I posit that determining when life begins isn't a valuable piece of<br>knowledge. The reason: *we don't know* *what about a person makes<br>them* *alive**.*<br><br>Think about it in terms we see all the time: rather than the beginning<br>of life, let's look at the *end* of life: the moment a live person<br>becomes not alive. If you have two people side by side, and one is alive<br>and one just died, what's different about them? Don't they contain the<br>same chemicals in their bodies? Is one somehow structurally different<br>than the other? Why is one body alive while the other is not? We can see<br>*signs* of life, like heartbeats, breathing, and brain activity, but<br>those are just *signs* which point to a *reason* we are alive.<br>We know the signs, but we don't know the reason.<br><br>\<br><br>Rather than focus on "when does life begin," I'd like to instead look at<br>something else: *the right to life*.<br><br>We posit instead that **the unborn have an equal right to life as the<br>rest of humanity, *specifically because they are human.*** And we<br>can use what we already know about life to determine this.<br><br>To illustrate what I mean, let's imagine a large hall, like a conference<br>center or a theater. In it, let's place everyone that you and I<br>intuitively know have a right to life. This would, naturally, include<br>every person who has been born, right? From the youngest preemie to the<br>elderly, to people in comas and people with disabilities. All of them,<br>intuitively (meaning we just know, no one has to tell us) belong in the<br>room.<br><br>But what about that person in the coma? Do they have a right to life? I<br>mean, they're unconscious. They're not aware of the world around them.<br>Do they still have a right to life? I think intuitively, you would say<br>yes, they do. So consciousness is not what gives us an equal right to<br>life.<br><br>But what about squirrels? Do squirrels have an equal right to life with<br>people? I mean, I'm absolutely against animal cruelty, and I'd never<br>intentionally harm a squirrel, but *do they have the same right to life<br>that we have?* Intuitively, you'd have to say no, they don't. You might<br>say that this is because squirrels are not *self-aware*; in other words,<br>they don't know that they are an individual and they aren't aware of<br>their own existence. But if you exclude squirrels because they aren't<br>self-aware (aware of the world around them), you'd have to exclude<br>newborns for the same reason, and perhaps some people with disabilities.<br>So that can't be right either.<br><br>So now that we've fleshed out who belongs in the room, why do they all<br>belong there? *What is it about all of them which gives them an equal<br>right to life?* It can't be that they are conscious, because we've shown<br>that even the unconscious still have a right to life. It can't be that<br>they're self-aware, or you'd have to exclude newborns as well. **The<br>only criteria which fits what we all intuitively know gives us an equal<br>right to life is that we are all *human*.** It is our humanity which<br>gives us an equal right to life. Because we are all human (members of<br>the species *Homo Sapiens*), we have an intrinsic, equal right to life.<br><br>And accordingly, if you apply the same logic to the unborn, you will see<br>that they too are, unequivocally, human. The unborn are completely<br>unique, living human beings, who came from two human parents. There is<br>no doubt that they are indeed fully human.<br><br>It is at this point that most pro-choice advocates try to "move the<br>goalposts" so to speak and introduce more qualifications to the right to<br>life to try to make it fit their desires. For instance, they may say,<br>"No, you have to be human *and* conscious" or "you have to be human<br>*and* self-aware" or "you have to be human *and* be viable outside the<br>womb" in order to have an equal right to life. The X in "human and X"<br>usually refers to some functional ability. This is a logical fallacy<br>known as the *ad hoc fallacy* or the "human *and"* fallacy. When someone<br>is being *ad hoc*, they're engineering arguments and facts to match a<br>conclusion they decided in advance. *Ad hoc* arguments are designed to<br>reach a conclusion even if the best evidence doesn't lead to it. It's<br>important to note, though, that people are often *ad hoc*<br>unintentionally, so they can think they're being open-minded but<br>inadvertently make this mistake.<br><br>So in order to see if we really truly need the "human *and* X" criteria,<br>you'd have to ask yourself two questions:<br><br>- How did you come to the conclusion that functional ability X should be<br>  added to human nature when explaining who has personhood?<br>- What does your functional ability X offer to make "human *and* X"<br>  better than just "human?"<br><br>And when you analyze those answers, you find that the addition of the<br>"and X" to the argument is clearly just to exclude the unborn. Whatever<br>the "X" is, the X alone doesn't explain the right to life, because the X<br>alone either excludes some born humans, or adds more rights to life for<br>things like squirrels. And the "human and X" doesn't provide anything<br>more scientifically accurate than "just human" other than to just<br>exclude the unborn. If I wanted to argue in favor of abortion, and I<br>decided that personhood was a result of "something like human nature<br>PLUS being not a fetus," that would be *ad hoc*, and I think most people<br>would agree with that. I just added something for no purpose other than<br>getting the answer I wanted in the first place!<br><br>\<br><br>So let's circle back to complete this answer. In summary:<br><br>- Using the creation of Adam to describe the beginning of life in the<br>  womb is silly, since Adam was never in the womb.<br>- We have a hard time defining when life begins, because we don't know<br>  what about a person makes them alive.<br>- We're better off talking about our right to life rather than when life<br>  begins.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
