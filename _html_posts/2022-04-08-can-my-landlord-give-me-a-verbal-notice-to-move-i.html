<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In nearly all states, if you have a pre-existing rental agreement, the<br>landlord cannot *force* you to move. He can sell the house with you<br>still in it. But that's a downside for him, because, well, *you live<br>there*. If he wanted to sell the house to a family who wants to move in<br>right away, he can't because you're still there. Selling the house with<br>you still in it limits his potential buyer pool.<br><br>He is still allowed to *sell* the house, and he is still allowed to<br>*show* the house. He should work with you so that you can prepare the<br>house for showing (i.e. providing 24 hours notice before a showing), but<br>these details are part of your lease agreement. It specifies the<br>timeframe that he has to give you before he can enter the house.<br><br>Unless you have violated your lease agreement, the landlord can't force<br>you to leave. He can *negotiate* with you to leave early (usually by<br>offering you money to do so). But beware, if you enter into an agreement<br>to leave early, and then you don't, you would be violating your<br>agreement and you could be *evicted*, which no one wants.<br><br>Ultimately, though, he could just wait you out until the end of your<br>lease agreement and then simply not renew your lease, in which case you<br>would be forced to move out.<br><br>You are better off negotiating an early departure from your lease.<br><br>And on a second note,<br><br>You said that you have a disability and you need repairs. Your landlord<br>must make these repairs, or he must allow you to do so. Quoting from an<br>article by<br>[Nolo.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e82644&url=https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/disabled-renters-housing-rights-30121.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nolo.com"}]{.qlink_container}:<br><br>> Disabled Tenants\' Right to Accommodations by the Landlord<br>><br>> Landlords must accommodate the needs of disabled tenants, within<br>> reason, at the landlord\'s own expense (see [[42 U.S.C. ยง<br>> 3604(f)(3)(B)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ed382a&url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3604){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="cornell.edu"}]{.qlink_container}). As a disabled tenant,<br>> you may expect your landlord to reasonably adjust rules, procedures,<br>> or services in order to give you an equal opportunity to use and enjoy<br>> your dwelling unit or a common space.<br>><br>> Accommodations can include parking: If the landlord provides parking<br>> in the first place, providing a close-in, spacious parking space would<br>> be an accommodation for a tenant who uses a wheelchair.<br>><br>> Does your landlord\'s duty to accommodate disabled tenants mean that<br>> you can expect every rule and procedure to be changed at your request?<br>> No. Although landlords are expected to accommodate \"reasonable\"<br>> requests, they need not undertake changes that would seriously impair<br>> their ability to run their business. For example, if an applicant who<br>> uses crutches prefers the third-story apartment in a walk-up building<br>> to the one on the ground floor, the landlord does not have to rip the<br>> building apart to install an elevator. That expense would be<br>> unreasonable.<br>><br>> Disabled Tenants\' Right to Make Modifications<br>><br>> Landlords must allow disabled tenants to make reasonable modifications<br>> to their living unit or common areas at their expense, if needed for<br>> the person to comfortably and safely live in the unit (see [[42 U.S.C.<br>> ยง<br>> 3604(f)(3)(A)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ed382a&url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3604){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="cornell.edu"}]{.qlink_container}). You have the right to<br>> modify your living space to the extent necessary to make the space<br>> safe and comfortable, as long as the modifications will not make the<br>> unit unacceptable to the next tenant, or if you agree and are<br>> financially able to undo the modification when you leave.<br>><br>> Examples of modifications undertaken by a disabled tenant include:<br>><br>> - lowering countertops for easier access from a wheelchair<br>> - installing special faucets or door handles due to limited hand use<br>> - modifying kitchen appliances to accommodate poor vision or<br>>   blindness, and<br>> - installing a ramp to allow wheelchair access to a raised living<br>>   room.<br>><br>> These modifications must be reasonable and made with prior approval. A<br>> landlord is entitled to ask for a description of the proposed<br>> modifications, proof that they will be done in a workman-like manner,<br>> and evidence that you are obtaining any necessary building permits.<br>><br>> In addition, if you propose to modify the unit in a way that will<br>> require restoration when you leave (such as the repositioning of<br>> lowered kitchen counters), the landlord may require you to pay into an<br>> interest-bearing escrow account the amount estimated for the<br>> restoration. (The interest earned will belong to you.)<br><br>Your landlord must still treat you as his tenant while you live there,<br>even though he wants you to leave.<br><br>This part is important: **if you feel like your landlord is holding your<br>repairs over your head, or he won't repair the property and instead<br>wants you to leave, contact an attorney in your area who handles<br>disability rights cases. Your landlord may be in violation of the law.**<br><br>While your landlord does not have to renew your lease at the end of your<br>lease term, he still must treat you appropriately while you live there.<br><br>Usually, getting a certified letter from an attorney is enough to get<br>the landlord back on track with his responsibilities under the law.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can my landlord give me a verbal notice to move? I am disabled and ask<br>for some repairs to aid in my disability, then he calls me and tells me<br>I need to move as he\'s selling the house. I\'ve lived here for 12<br>years.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
