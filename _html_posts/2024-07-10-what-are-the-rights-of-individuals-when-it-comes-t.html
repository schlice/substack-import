<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It depends on who owns the parking lot.<br><br>If the parking lot is privately owned, they can set whatever rules they<br>choose as to who can park in their lot. Their facilities (including any<br>parking lots owned by them) are theirs to use as they see fit. There are<br>some requirements set by the state in terms of accessibility (i.e. a<br>certain number of spaces need to be designated as handicapped, etc), but<br>beyond that, it is up to the business to determine how they manage<br>parking spaces.<br><br>Sometimes, spaces are individually assigned, such as in some lots<br>adjacent to (or sometimes, underneath) apartment complexes. The complex<br>can assign spaces, and can tow vehicles which are parked there when they<br>do not belong. The tow companies will usually post signs at the entrance<br>to the lot indicating that the lot is controlled and parking is by<br>permit only and violators will be towed at the owner's expense. Your<br>rights, if you are one of these people who parked in a controlled lot or<br>space and your vehicle was towed, are limited. You must pay the tow<br>operator a fee to cover his costs to tow your car. There are limits (set<br>in state law) as to how much they can charge, but those limits are<br>agreed upon and are permitted by state law.<br><br>If the spaces are on public roads or public property, there really is no<br>ownership of the spaces other than by the government which controls that<br>area (city, county, etc). That government can set parking rules on those<br>spaces, and can similarly tow vehicles in violation to an impound lot.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
