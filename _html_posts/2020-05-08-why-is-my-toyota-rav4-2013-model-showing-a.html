Is this something serious?**<br><br>Probably not, but you should probably get the code checked to find out.<br><br>When you get one of those "Check Engine" lights, it's because one of the<br>car's diagnostic systems has found a fault. It has deposited a fault<br>code in a special buffer designed for such an occurrence.

I'm<br>certain that nearly every other large auto repair shop will also check<br>the code (for free) while simultaneously offering to fix the issue for<br>you (not for free).<br><br>In your case, it's most likely the case that you have a fault in your<br>vehicle's traction control system, considering that both lights came on<br>at the same time.<br><br>You should have this serviced.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
