<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [GM would have filed Chapter 11, their debt would have been<br>renegotiated, the portions of the business not directly related to<br>making cars would have been spun off and sold, and the company would<br>have emerged leaner and able to support itself.\<br>\<br>Or the company would have shuttered, the portions of the company not<br>directly related to building cars (i.e. OEM parts) would have been sold<br>and opened as new, independent businesses, the economy of Detroit would<br>be in shambles, and the rest of the auto industry would be taking over<br>the holes in the auto industry by GM\'s departure.\<br>\<br>Should the government have done what it did? That\'s a matter of debate.<br>Libertarians believe the government should not have bailed GM out, and<br>should have allowed market forces to run as they normally do. The<br>economic impact felt by Detroit would have been a major wake-up call to<br>the fact that they have put all their eggs in one<br>basket.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
