<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it possible to attack the police in self-defense?<br><br>First of all, you can never "attack" in self-defense. So no, attacking<br>in self-defense is never lawful. That's attack, never self-defense.<br><br>Secondly, while it is physically possible to defend yourself from a<br>police officer, that's not really the question. The question is whether<br>or not you will be charged for doing so.<br><br>In most cases, police officers act under "color of law." That means that<br>if they are doing their jobs (something you also really can't tell at<br>the scene), they are presumed to be acting lawfully unless a court says<br>otherwise.<br><br>And that's the real rub. You can't tell whether or not a police officer<br>is acting lawfully until a court determines it. It is only a court that<br>can make that determination, not you, not your sidewalk lawyer, not the<br>Internet. Just a court. So an officer acting under color of law is<br>presumed to be acting lawfully until the courts says otherwise, so you<br>"resisting" or "defending yourself" is unlawful.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
