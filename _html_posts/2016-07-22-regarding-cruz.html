<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You're kidding, right? Played?<br><br>Here's the reality of the situation: **Trump USED Cruz to unify support<br>for him!**<br><br>Trump *knew* that Cruz was not going to endorse him. By the way, in<br>any other convention for anyone, Bush, Clinton, etc., if you're not<br>endorsing the candidate, you don't get to speak. Period. If you're not<br>"in the tank" for the candidate, you don't get anywhere near the stage.<br>If Bernie Sanders was going to speak at Hillary's convention and *not*<br>endorse her, do you think he'd be allowed anywhere near that arena?<br><br>Not only did the Trump camp know what he was going to do, but did you<br>happen to notice when Trump entered the arena? It was at the ***precise<br>moment that Cruz made it clear that he was not going to endorse<br>Trump!*** The crowd was going nuts, and none of it was for Cruz. Trump<br>came in and was waving at everyone, and they were going absolutely nuts<br>after what they had just heard.<br><br>And then, Newt Gingrich followed Cruz, and he said (paraphrasing) that<br>Cruz just said "vote your conscience" and if you truly believe in the<br>principles of the Republican party, there really is only one ticket you<br>can vote for that will match your conscience, and that is the<br>Trump-Pence ticket. That was in Newt's speech, not off-the-cuff. Yet<br>another indication that this was totally planned.<br><br>Cruz is short-selling the Trump campaign, betting Trump is going to lose<br>the election so that he can say, "See, I'm the only one who was out<br>there holding to my principles." He's taking a calculated, but very big,<br>risk. And Republicans do not have short memories. They feel betrayed by<br>Cruz, so even though it's very clear he's setting himself up for 2020,<br>it may be over for him before he even begins. This stunt may not have<br>helped him at all.<br><br>If you look at this convention through the lens of a traditional<br>candidate, you think that Trump got played, he totally didn't expect<br>this, he was blindsided, etc. But make no mistake, not only was Trump<br>*not* played, he *allowed* Cruz to go out there and not endorse<br>him because it helps Trump galvanize support around himself. Some of<br>those people who were not so warmed-up to Trump are now aligning<br>themselves with him. Some of those Never Trumpers are now out there<br>supporting Trump. Cruz did that.<br><br>Also, because of the absolute media histrionics (again, free advertising<br>for Trump) over Cruz's supposed "snub" of Trump at his own convention,<br>ratings for day four of the RNC convention were through the roof. Cruz<br>did that, too.<br><br>So Cruz's failure to endorse Trump has accomplished two things:<br><br>1.  It has galvanized support behind Trump. Some groups which were "on<br>    the fence" about Trump are now backing him, and others who were<br>    "kinda" supporting Trump are now fully "in the tank" for him. He has<br>    done much with the Cruz speech and his own to show that he can speak<br>    eloquently, and he can deliver a polished speech, and he can level<br>    factual, substantial indictments of his opponent.<br>2.  He doesn't need to put hundreds of thousands of dollars into ad<br>    campaigns. The mainstream media attracts enough attention to Trump<br>    that he has no need to spend the money. Now that he has officially<br>    been chosen as the candidate, you will see an all out war against<br>    Hillary, and if this campaign and convention have shown you<br>    anything, this will be like nothing you have ever seen before from a<br>    candidate.<br><br>I'll say it again, if you view Trump's campaign through the traditional<br>lens of politics as usual, you're going to miss everything attracting<br>people to him. You're going to scratch your head and say, "Why do people<br>like this buffoon?" You won't get it. You'll look at Cruz's speech and<br>lack of endorsement and say, "See? He's still a buffoon. He totally got<br>played."<br><br>The number one mistake you can make about Trump is that he's stupid. You<br>can call him a misogynist, you can call him racist, or bigoted, or what<br>have you. But don't believe for one second that he's stupid. He didn't<br>enter that arena exactly when he did by accident. No doubt in my mind,<br>this whole thing was planned. And the results? The whole thing played<br>directly in Trump's favor.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
