<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [An \"indemnity bond\" is \"a bond that is intended to<br>reimburse the holder for any actual or claimed loss caused by the<br>issuer's conduct or another person's conduct. An indemnity bond acts as<br>coverage for the loss of an obligee when a principal fails to perform<br>according to the terms agreed upon between the obligee and the<br>principal. For example, in real estate, a lender may require an<br>indemnity bond in markets with slow growth in cases where the loan<br>amount is greater than 75% of the house value. During the time of<br>foreclosure, if the house is sold to pay off the loan and there is<br>negative equity, then the indemnity bond covers the difference.\" \1\\<br>\<br>In essence, an indemnity bond is a type of insurance policy that<br>guarantees payment of a debt if one party in a contract fails to<br>perform.\<br>\<br>\"There are usually three parties to an indemnity bond: the principal<br>(the person who will receive the money in the case of a breach \[of<br>contract\]), the obligor (the person who purchases the indemnity bond as<br>security for performance) and a third-party guarantor, usually a bank<br>that, for a premium or fee, assumes the risk to pay the face value of<br>the indemnity bond should the obligor fail to perform the terms of the<br>contract with the principal.\" \2\\<br>\<br>For help understanding your specific indemnity bond, please consult with<br>a licensed attorney in your area.\<br>\<br>\1\ [[Indemnity Bonds - Surety<br>Bonds](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=256ecd&url=http://suretybonds.uslegal.com/indemnity-bonds/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="uslegal.com"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>\2\ [[What Is an Indemnity Bond? \|<br>eHow](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0df102&url=http://www.ehow.com/info_8369942_indemnity-bond.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ehow.com"}]{.qlink_container}]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
