<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: you don't. The HOA is free to enforce some rules and not<br>enforce others. So long as they enforce equally, they can *not* enforce<br>a particular rule and that's perfectly legal. Most Covenants contain a<br>statement that says that the Association *may* enforce the<br>provisions of the covenants. That word "may" is a legal term which does<br>not require action. That word would be "shall." The word "may" means<br>that the Board has enforcement discretion. Check your Governing<br>Documents to see what your Board needs to do in any one case.<br><br>Our docs also state that an owner may "bring an action for specific<br>performance, declaratory decree or injunction." This means that you can<br>sue the Board in order to force them to enforce the provisions.<br><br>So the only way you can "force" the Board to enforce the rules is to sue<br>the Board. Otherwise, in most cases, the Board is under no obligation to<br>enforce any one specific rule. However, this is all dependent solely on<br>what your HOA's Governing Documents say, as well as prevailing state<br>law, so you must always check those to see what your Board must do and<br>what they are not legally compelled to do.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What are some ways to get an HOA to enforce rules about noisy dogs in<br>the neighborhood?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
