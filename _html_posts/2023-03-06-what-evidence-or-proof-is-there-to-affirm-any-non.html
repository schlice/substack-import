<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's an interesting question, because you're asking someone to<br>*prove* that God does not exist.<br><br>Philosopher and educator Mortimer Adler said it this way: "An<br>*affirmative* existential proposition can be proved, but a *negative*<br>existential proposition---one that denies the existence of some<br>thing---cannot be proved."<br><br>For example, I could say that red eagles exist, and you could say that<br>red eagles do not exist. I only need to show one example of a red eagle<br>to prove that they exist. You would need to be in all places at all<br>times throughout all of earth's history to prove that red eagles do not<br>exist, and never did exist.<br><br>This is why honest non-theists admit that they cannot *prove* that God<br>does not exist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
