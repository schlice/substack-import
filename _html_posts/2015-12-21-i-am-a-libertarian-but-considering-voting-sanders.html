<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Very few of Sen. Sanders\' policies are libertarian.<br><br>Sanders bases the vast majority of his policies on the Democratic<br>platform, which emphasizes class differences (wealth inequality, salary<br>inequality, wage inequality, etc). He hopes to fix this through wealth<br>redistribution (taking more from the top 1% of wage earners and giving<br>it to other wealth classes through redistribution programs like grants<br>and scholarships), as well as attempting to force business owners to pay<br>all entry-level workers upwards of \$15/hr within 5 years of being<br>elected (which will result in massively increased amounts of automation<br>and the elimination of many entry level jobs).<br><br>There is nothing libertarian about taking property from one class of<br>citizen and giving it to another.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
