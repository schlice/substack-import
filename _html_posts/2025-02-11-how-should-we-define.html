<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Biology. That's how we should define "sex" in the context of any<br>participation in women's sports.<br><br>*Transgender people are unquestionably one biological gender, regardless<br>of what they claim to be.* This should not be a controversial statement.<br>Biology is immutable (unchangeable), real (not imaginary, it<br>exists and we all know it does), and binary (there are only two<br>genders, not three, not five, and not fifty-seven). Biology is not a<br>social construct.<br><br>Therefore, any "transgender policy" designed to protect the integrity of<br>female sports need only specify that participants must have been<br>recorded female at birth on their original birth certificates. If no<br>birth certificate exists, then biology, not personal feelings, should<br>determine whether the participant would be allowed to compete as a male<br>or a female.<br><br>\<br><br>That said, *intersex* people pose a unique problem in sorting genders<br>for the purposes of participation in sports, but it is a much less<br>pressing problem for protecting the integrity of women's sports.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
