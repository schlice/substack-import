<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Nothing.<br><br>An HOA with no CC&Rs is not a useful HOA as it can't really accomplish<br>anything. It has no authority and no real vision or mission. In order to<br>be a non-profit corporation, it needs Bylaws and Articles of<br>Incorporation, but what is its purpose? If it has no CC&Rs, it has<br>nothing to do.<br><br>The CC&Rs are what gives the HOA its authority, its purpose, its ability<br>to collect dues, and its ability to spend that money.<br><br>In other words, the CC&R is the *raison d'Ãªtre* of the HOA. Without<br>them, they are useless.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What is the difference between a neighborhood with no homeowners<br>association (HOA) versus one with an HOA but no covenants, conditions,<br>and restrictions (CC&Rs)?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
