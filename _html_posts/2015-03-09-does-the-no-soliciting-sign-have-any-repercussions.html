<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [On a private residence, none whatsoever. It has to be<br>backed by law. On a private residence, it might simply indicate that a<br>solicitor would be dismissed out of hand, or have a door closed in their<br>face.\<br>\<br>If it appears at the entrance to a neighborhood, it could be that the<br>covenants of a covenant-controlled neighborhood prevent soliciting, and<br>the violation of that could mean a date in court and fines against the<br>company or individual.\<br>\<br>If it appears on the door of a business, the local laws in that area may<br>disallow solicitations in a local area, or in a particular business<br>zone. Businesses who solicit in those areas could face violations and<br>fines.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
