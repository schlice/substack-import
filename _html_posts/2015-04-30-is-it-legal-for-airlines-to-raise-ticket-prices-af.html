<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Why is changing your prices illegal?\<br>\<br>The whole concept of a free-market system is that prices are not fixed,<br>and you as a business can charge whatever you choose for a product or<br>service.\<br>\<br>Similarly, your competitors can charge whatever they choose for the same<br>product or service.\<br>\<br>The one with the best price wins.\<br>\<br>How would such a scheme as you have suggested serve the business? How<br>would it earn the company more money, unless you are talking about<br>hidden fees?\<br>\<br>And isn\'t what you\'re taking about called supply and demand? If<br>demand increases, all else being equal, price goes up. If supply<br>increases, all else being equal, price goes down. If demand on a<br>particular service increases, all else being equal, price goes up for<br>that service.\<br>\<br>How the airline determines when to raise the price for a ticket is an<br>unexplained sniglet of the universe that I will never<br>understand.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
