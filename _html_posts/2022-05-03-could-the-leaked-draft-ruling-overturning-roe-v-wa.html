<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It could, and most of us suspect that was the reason it was leaked. It<br>was probably someone who was disappointed with the decision, and wanted<br>to "get out in front of it" and rile up the public. If they did so,<br>maybe they could "pressure" the Justices to change their votes. At<br>least, that's probably what they were thinking.<br><br>Remember, this is just a draft. The final opinion hasn't been written<br>yet, and the Justices have not voted yet. Votes can change. The leaker<br>was probably hoping to use public opinion to try to get the Justices to<br>change their minds.<br><br>But considering how *sacrosanct* the Justices consider their drafts to<br>be, they will probably be far more upset at the fact that the leak<br>occurred than they will by any public outcry over the ruling itself.<br><br>(EDIT) I was right.<br><br>Chief Justice Roberts released a statement about the breach, which said,<br>in part:<br><br>> To the extent this betrayal of the confidences of the Court was<br>> intended to undermine the integrity of our operations, it will not<br>> succeed. \The\ work of the Court will not be affected in any way.<br>><br>> \...\<br>><br>> We at the court are blessed to have a workforce---permanent employees<br>> and law clerks who are intensely loyal to the institution and<br>> dedicated to the rule of law. Court employees have an exemplary and<br>> important tradition of respecting the confidentiality of the judicial<br>> process and upholding the trust of the Court.<br><br>The Chief Justice tasked the Marshal of the Supreme Court with<br>investigating the leak and finding the leaker. What will happen to the<br>leaker is still unknown, but I'll bet dollars to donuts that the person<br>will be fired, disbarred if they're an attorney, and will never work in<br>law again.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Could the leaked draft ruling overturning Roe v. Wade actually result in<br>the opposite ruling due to intimidation of the Justices by protests,<br>etc.?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
