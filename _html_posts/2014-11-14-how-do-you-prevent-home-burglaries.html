<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Use the \"Redneck Home Security System.\"\<br>\<br>]<br><br>1.  Get a big dog bowl. Put (or have your neighbor\'s dog put) some<br>    menacing-looking bite marks on it. Put it by your front door.\<br>2.  Get a big dog toy. Drive over it with you car several times or have<br>    the neighbor\'s dog do a number on it as well. Leave it near the dog<br>    bowl.<br>3.  (Bonus points here) Sprinkle a few spent shotgun shells around the<br>    bowl.<br>4.  Leave a note on your front door that reads: \"Hey Bubba, Big Jim,<br>    Duke and Slim, I went to the gun shop for more ammunition. Back in<br>    an hour. Don\'t mess with the pit bulls \-- they attacked the<br>    mailman this morning and messed him up real bad. I don\'t think<br>    Killer took part in it but it was hard to tell from all the blood.<br>    PS - I locked all four of \'em in the house. Better wait outside.\"<br>5.  DONE!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
