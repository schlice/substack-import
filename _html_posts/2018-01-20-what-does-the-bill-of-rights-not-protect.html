<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>[[The Bill of No<br>Rights](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=56120a&url=http://www.friesian.com/ross/ca40/noright.htm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="friesian.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>I read this piece a few years ago when it was published in our local<br>newspaper. It was written by a guy named Lewis Napper, who ran for the<br>Senate in Mississippi as a Libertarian. Anyway, it's a great piece, so I<br>will reproduce it for you here. Enjoy!<br><br>> We the sensible people of the United States, in an attempt to help<br>> everyone get along, restore some semblance of justice, avoid any more<br>> riots, keep our nation safe, promote positive behavior and secure the<br>> blessings of debt free liberty to ourselves and our great great-great<br>> grandchildren, hereby try one more time to ordain and establish some<br>> common sense guidelines for the terminally whiny, guilt ridden,<br>> delusional, and other liberal bedwetters.<br>><br>> We hold these truths to be self-evident: That a whole lot of people<br>> were confused by the Bill of Rights and are so dim that they require a<br>> Bill of No Rights.<br>><br>> - ARTICLE I \-- You do not have the right to a new car, big screen TV<br>>   or any form of wealth. More power to you if you can legally acquire<br>>   them, but no one is guaranteeing anything.<br>> - ARTICLE II \-- You do not have the right to never be offended. This<br>>   country is based on freedom, and that means the freedom for<br>>   everyone, not just you! You may leave the room, turn the channel,<br>>   express a different opinion, etc., but the world is full of idiots<br>>   and probably always will be.<br>> - ARTICLE III \-- You do not have the right to be free from harm. If<br>>   you stick a screwdriver in your eye, learn to be more careful. Do<br>>   not expect the tool manufacturer to make you and all your relatives<br>>   independently wealthy.<br>> - ARTICLE IV \-- You do not have the right to free food and housing.<br>>   Americans are the most charitable people to be found, and will<br>>   gladly help anyone in need but we are quickly growing weary of<br>>   subsidizing generations of professional couch potatoes who achieve<br>>   nothing more than the creation of another generation of professional<br>>   couch potatoes.<br>> - ARTICLE V \-- You do not have the right to free health care. That<br>>   would be nice but, from the looks of public housing, we\'re just not<br>>   interested in government run health care.<br>> - ARTICLE VI \-- You do not have the right to physically harm other<br>>   people. If you kidnap, rape, intentionally maim or kill someone,<br>>   don\'t be surprised if the rest of us want to see you fry in the<br>>   electric chair.<br>> - ARTICLE VII \-- You do not have the right to the possessions of<br>>   others. If you rob, cheat or coerce away the goods or services of<br>>   other citizens, don\'t be surprised if the rest of us get together<br>>   and lock you away in a place where you still won\'t have the right<br>>   to a big screen TV or a life of leisure.<br>> - ARTICLE VIII \-- You don\'t have the right to demand that our<br>>   children risk their lives in foreign wars to soothe your aching<br>>   conscience. We hate oppressive governments and won\'t lift a finger<br>>   to stop you from going to fight, if you\'d like. However, we do not<br>>   enjoy parenting the entire world and do not want to spend so much of<br>>   our time battling each and every little tyrant with a military<br>>   uniform and a funny hat.<br>> - ARTICLE IX \-- You don\'t have the right to a job. All of us sure<br>>   want all of you to have one, and will gladly help you in hard times,<br>>   but we expect you to take advantage of the opportunities of<br>>   education and vocational training laid before you to make yourself<br>>   useful.<br>> - ARTICLE X \-- You do not have the right to happiness. Being an<br>>   American means that you have the right to pursue happiness \-- which<br>>   by the way, is a lot easier if you are unencumbered by an over<br>>   abundance of idiotic laws created by those of you who were confused<br>>   by the Bill of Rights.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
