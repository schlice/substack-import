<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will the renewed pushback against sexual assault hurt Trump in light<br>of the 16 women who have now stepped forward to name him as their<br>victimizer?**<br><br>It is well known that public figures are targets of malicious lawsuits.<br>I'm not saying that's what is happening here, but Trump isn't a<br>politician, he's a public figure (TV star, rich businessman). And<br>today's climate of "get an accusation and have your life destroyed" puts<br>way too much emphasis on the victim and not enough protection for the<br>accused.<br><br>*(Before you SJWs get started, I'm glad that women are feeling empowered<br>enough to step forward and tell their stories. But I'm a law guy; not<br>only is this exceedingly unfair to the accused, it's going to royally<br>backfire on women, and that makes it all the more sad)*<br><br>So I say let the legal system handle it. It won't hurt Trump in the<br>slightest. Trump's base won't think any differently about him. Heck, if<br>the *Access Hollywood* audio tape didn't make a difference in the<br>election, what difference will this make?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
