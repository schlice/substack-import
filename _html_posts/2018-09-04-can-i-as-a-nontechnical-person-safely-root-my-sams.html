<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can I (as a nontechnical person) safely root my Samsung Galaxy S8? If<br>so, how?**<br><br>As a "non-technical" person, I would strongly suggest you not root<br>your phone, because a non-technical person should have very little need<br>to do so.<br><br>Especially for the S8 (which happens to be the phone I'm using as my own<br>daily driver these days), you're running nearly the latest Android<br>operating system available. We'll be getting Android Pie here shortly<br>(within a few months), and I'm hoping the intelligent battery life fixes<br>that Google added (which appear to be working well on Pixel devices)<br>will translate well to my S8.<br><br>I have to wonder: if you're as non-technical as you claim, why would you<br>want to root your phone in the first place? I'm not questioning your<br>decision so much as I'm questioning your need. Rooting breaks as much<br>functionality as it fixes on a S8. For example:<br><br>- You will *VOID YOUR WARRANTY* if you do this. Samsung uses an<br>  [eFUSE(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2be889&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFUSE){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} to indicate whether or<br>  not you have ever rooted the phone. Rooting your phone will trip the<br>  eFUSE. You cannot get around this. You cannot reset the eFUSE. If the<br>  eFUSE is tripped, you cannot get warranty service. Before even<br>  considering whether or not you will root your phone, it must be out of<br>  warranty. If you haven't owned it for a year, stop right here. Don't<br>  throw away your manufacturer warranty.<br>- You will *permanently* be unable to use any Knox-based technology<br>  (most notably, Samsung Pay), ***even if you unroot your phone in the<br>  future.*** If that eFUSE is blown, you will be unable to create any<br>  Knox containers, or access any existing Knox containers. That means<br>  DATA LOSS if you had data in a Knox container (it's never coming<br>  back). Samsung Pay secures your credit cards in a Knox container, so<br>  Samsung Pay will also stop working.<br>- If you connect to a company network using any sort of Mobile Device<br>  Management (MDM) platform, your device will no longer be able to<br>  connect to those networks. Your device will essentially be out of<br>  compliance.<br><br>ALL THAT SAID, if you are here and you still think that rooting your<br>phone will get you something you totally need and you don't care about<br>using Samsung Pay or anything related to Knox ever again and you're out<br>of warranty, the process in CF-auto-root (which you can pick up at<br>[firmware.mobi(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e91612&url=https://desktop.firmware.mobi/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="firmware.mobi"}]{.qlink_container}) is one of the easiest<br>and safest available.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
