<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(Note that this question and answer were written April 6, 2022, which<br>was when Musk was only the largest shareholder of Twitter. not the<br>company's owner)*<br><br>Wow, there's a lot to unpack here. Let's start with Elon Musk and<br>Twitter:<br><br>1.  Musk does not own a "controlling share of Twitter." He is their<br>    largest single shareholder, holding just over 9% of Twitter shares.<br>    A "controlling interest" would be greater than 50% of Twitter<br>    shares, and then he'd "own" Twitter. He'd have the controlling vote,<br>    and could basically control the direction of the company.<br>2.  Musk has not stated any intention to make modifications to the<br>    company. He disclosed his purchase on a SEC form 13G, which means<br>    it's a *passive interest*. If he wanted to take an *active interest*<br>    (which he still can), he would have to file a SEC form 13D, which he<br>    could do in the future.<br>3.  Probably in a move to keep Musk in an appropriately-sized box and<br>    control him a little bit, Twitter decided it would be in their best<br>    interest to *place him on the Board of Directors*. But in doing so,<br>    they stated that he can't own more than 14.9% of Twitter shares,<br>    either individually or as part of a group, while he's on the Board.<br>4.  He can absolutely agitate for change, but he can't *demand* change.<br>    That said, he now has a material ownership in the company, and he<br>    won't push for radical changes, so long as they listen to his ideas<br>    and execute on them. The point that Twitter execs should be wary of<br>    is that *he can*.<br><br>Now, let's talk about "everyone else." **No private web service needs to<br>stop censoring any views at all**. There is no requirement for any<br>private company to provide any sort of platform which holds to any of<br>the free speech principles in the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights<br>binds the *government* from creating laws which violate rights.<br>Companies can have whatever speech policies in place they like. However,<br>if they do censor some views, they are not free, open online platforms,<br>and they should not claim to be. Claiming to be a free, open platform<br>while actively censoring opposing views of any kind is disingenuous at<br>best, and antithetical to free speech at worst. The various web services<br>have been doing so in the name of "online safety," but the line between<br>safety and censorship is not legally well defined. This will come to a<br>head at some point.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Now that Elon Musk owns controlling share of Twitter and is making it a<br>platform for free speech and honest discord will websites such as Quora,<br>YouTube, Facebook and others have to stop censoring opposing view<br>points?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
