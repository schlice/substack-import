<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Christian here. And I loved the Percy Jackson series. I read the books<br>and watched the movie.<br><br>**You can watch it, and you can read the books, but you must do so<br>carefully.**<br><br>Just remember that it is all *fantasy.* None of it is an accurate<br>reflection of the world we live in. It certainly *seems* plausible, but<br>it is not. And movie magic makes it *feel* real, but again, it is all<br>fantasy, contrived by people.<br><br>The truth of God's kingdom is much different.<br><br>So long as you can tell the difference, enjoy the books and the movies.<br>Just remember it's all a story.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
