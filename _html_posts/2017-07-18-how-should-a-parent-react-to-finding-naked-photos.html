<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(For this answer, I'm assuming facts not in evidence, your honor. I'm<br>assuming that she willingly took the pictures of herself, and I'm<br>assuming she gave them to someone. If she did not, you should clarify in<br>the comments so we don't answer the wrong question)*<br><br>For your sake, I hope this has not happened to you.<br><br>Once an image has hit the Internet, it's forever. It's really hard to<br>get images off of the Internet once they're out there. There are<br>services which purport to do this for you, but they are not free, and<br>they are not cheap. I'd look at<br>[DeleteMe(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5d8f4b&url=https://www.abine.com/deleteme/landing.php){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="abine.com"}]{.qlink_container} because Abine is a reputable<br>company, but there are others.<br><br>How should you respond to your underage daughter?<br><br>- First, you sit her down and explain that the Internet is forever, and<br>  those photos will now appear any time someone searches for her online.<br>  Employers routinely search potential employees before hiring them. She<br>  may have hampered her future employability.<br>- Second, explain why the criminal defense attorney is also sitting with<br>  you. He's there because he may have to defend you against charges of<br>  *distributing child pornography.* Yes, if you distribute in electronic<br>  form pornographic images of someone below the legal age of consent,<br>  this is distribution of child pornography, and she can be arrested.<br>  Work with the lawyer to prepare to defend yourself in case the police<br>  come knocking.\<br>  (EDIT) I recognize that she may not have distributed the pictures,<br>  which makes the conversation with the police a little less awkward,<br>  but to be fair, the pictures did not take themselves, unless they were<br>  "hidden camera" photos, which I am assuming they are not. If they are,<br>  then you should be calling the police, not the other way round.<br>- Next, explain to her why she will be going to counseling. The need for<br>  acceptance and the need for validation are obviously so great that she<br>  would seek to demean herself to such a degree to gain it. And you as<br>  the parent should also seek your own counseling to figure out what you<br>  may have done in your life to encourage and/or fail to prevent such<br>  behavior. You all have a lot of work to do.<br>- Finally, explain why she's going to be home-schooled and lose access<br>  to all electronic communications media until she turns 18. Why<br>  home-schooled? The entire school will have seen her pictures. Even<br>  most of the teachers, the pervs that they are. Either that, or<br>  consider relocating your family to another state.<br><br>Sound kinda doom-and-gloom? *Teenage girls have* ***killed<br>themselves for less than nude photos.*** The stress that continuing to<br>live in the community will place on your daughter will be immense, and<br>she needs to be prepared for that. Counseling will help, but she's got a<br>long road ahead of her.<br><br>You need to get out in front of this *now.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
