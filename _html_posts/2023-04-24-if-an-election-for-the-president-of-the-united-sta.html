<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are a few ways, but the two biggest, in my opinion:<br><br>- Eliminate the Electoral College from the Constitution.<br>- Propose national election laws (in violation of the Constitution)<br>  regulating state elections.<br><br>The Electoral College makes it much more difficult to rig an election,<br>because you can't rig just one election; you have to rig a number of<br>state elections in order to make a significant enough difference to<br>influence the overall outcome of the election. Remember, there's not one<br>Presidential election, there are 51 separate elections (all 50 states<br>and the District of Columbia). The Electoral College process means that<br>small election anomalies in one area of the country won't affect the<br>overall outcome of the election. With the Electoral College in place,<br>you have to affect many swing state votes in order to change the outcome<br>of the election. Without it (i.e. with a purely popular vote), *any*<br>votes stolen in *any* precinct of the country could affect the national<br>outcome.<br><br>But swing states change all the time. Not every state which was a swing<br>state is still so today. If nothing else, safe and swing states are<br>constantly changing. California voted safely Republican as recently as<br>1988. Texas used to vote Democrat. Neither New Hampshire nor Virginia<br>used to be swing states. Most people think that George W. Bush won the<br>2000 election because of Florida. It certainly was a big factor, but he<br>really won the election because he managed to flip one state which the<br>Democrats thought was safe: West Virginia. Its 4 electoral votes turned<br>out to be decisive.<br><br>We also saw vast changes to state elections during the pandemic, when<br>security rules surrounding how ballots were sent, received, and counted,<br>were relaxed. Because this happened to broad swaths of the country, it<br>is at least conceivable that the national changes in election laws may<br>have impacted the outcome of the election. Returning election laws to<br>pre-COVID rules, or even tightening election security, would greatly<br>benefit the entire country by ensuring that elections are indeed secure.<br>Most states have fixed their election laws, and returned them to<br>pre-COVID standards, or better.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
