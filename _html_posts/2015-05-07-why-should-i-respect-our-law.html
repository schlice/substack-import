<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Law is a funny thing. It\'s really nothing more than words<br>on a piece of paper. You can choose to follow it, or you can choose not<br>to follow it. Humans are created with free will.\<br>\<br>In America, we choose to live together as members of a civil society. In<br>order to do that, we have to cede some control to the law, so that all<br>of us can live together in an ordered society. Without law, there would<br>be anarchy. Rioting in the streets daily. Murder. Utter chaos.\<br>\<br>We choose not to live like that. In order to do so, we choose to follow<br>the law.\<br>\<br>There will always be those who don\'t follow the law. For them, we have<br>the police and the courts (the Executive and Judicial branches of<br>government) who arrest the lawless and remove them from society, and<br>then prosecute them under the law.\<br>\<br>The court system sometimes doesn\'t look \"fair.\" Sometimes, the court<br>system looks downright cruel and unfair. But know that it is definitely<br>fair, even though it may appear to be unfair. There are reasons for<br>every decision.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
