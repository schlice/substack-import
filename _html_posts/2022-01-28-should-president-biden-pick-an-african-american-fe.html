Far from it, I'm certain she will be *eminently<br>qualified*.<br><br>It doesn't make this exercise any less *racist*.<br><br>Fighting racism with racism. Standard practice straight out of the<br>Progressive Playbook.<br><br>Additionally, it violates government hiring rules. Title VII<br>prohibits Federal, State and local government employers with 15 or more<br>employees and employment agencies from discriminating on the basis of<br>race, color, religion, national origin or sex (including pregnancy,<br>sexual orientation, and gender identity) in all aspects of an employment<br>relationship.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Should President Biden pick an African American female as the new<br>Supreme Court Justice?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
