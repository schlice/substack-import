Almost all<br>states require you to be truthful in that situation.<br><br>Other than that, you are under no legal obligation to be truthful with<br>the police. Whether or not it is a *good idea* to lie is a whole other<br>story.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
