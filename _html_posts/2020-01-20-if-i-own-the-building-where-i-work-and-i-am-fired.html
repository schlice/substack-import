If you can<br>show the court a provision of the lease they violated, you can begin<br>eviction proceedings.<br><br>If not, then perhaps you simply won't lease to them again once their<br>current lease is up. You are under no obligation to *renew* their lease,<br>but if they haven't otherwise violated the lease by firing you, you<br>can't evict them.<br><br>Note that this is general information; there may be specific laws where<br>you live which govern leases and it may be different, and of course, if<br>you have specific legal questions, you should always consult with an<br>attorney in your area.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.
