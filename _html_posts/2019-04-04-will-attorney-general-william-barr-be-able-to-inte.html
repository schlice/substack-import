<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will Attorney General William Barr be able to intervene in any way to<br>help President Trump keep his tax returns under wraps?**<br><br>Probably not.<br><br>The tax returns are being requested under IRS code 6103(f). This is<br>consistent with Congress' oversight power over the IRS.<br><br>But that said, we need to be sure we understand why Congress can do<br>this, and what they're looking for.<br><br>**Congress is allowed to do this to keep the IRS on track, not to hurt<br>the President.**<br><br>They asked for tax returns from 2013 to 2018. For each year, they also<br>asked for statements regarding:<br><br>1.  whether such return is or was ever under any type of examination or<br>    audit<br>2.  the length of such examination or audit<br>3.  the applicable statute of limitations on such examination or audit<br>4.  the issue(s) under examination or audit<br>5.  the reason(s) the return was selected for examination or audit, and<br>6.  the present status of such examination or audit (to include the date<br>    and description of the most recent return or return information<br>    activity).<br><br>Additionally, Congress is not authorized to disclose those tax<br>returns to anyone else.<br><br>I want to quote a section from the FAQ that was included with the letter<br>to the IRS from Chairman Neal on the House Ways and Means Committee:<br><br>> Why is the Chairman making this request?<br>><br>> The Committee on Ways and Meansis examining the extent to which the<br>> IRS audits and enforces the Federal tax laws against a President.<br>><br>> Why are the President's tax returns necessary for that purpose?<br>><br>> The Committee cannot consider whether legislative changes are<br>> necessary without first informing itself. The Committee therefore<br>> requires the President's tax returns and any administrative files<br>> (work papers, audit materials, examiner notes, correspondence, etc.)<br>> that reflect how the IRS audits and enforces the Federal tax laws<br>> against him.<br>><br>> Doesn't the IRS conduct a mandatory audit?<br>><br>> Under the Internal Revenue Manual, a President's individual income tax<br>> returns are subject to mandatory examination; however, this practice<br>> is simply IRS policy, not law. The truth is that we do not know what<br>> the IRS is reviewing, whether the IRS review includes audits that were<br>> ongoing before he took office, or even if a mandatory examination<br>> actually is taking place.<br>><br>> \...\<br>><br>> **Is the Chairman hoping to use the President's tax returns for<br>> impeachment purposes?**<br>><br>> Chairman Neal wants to be clear. He stands with Speaker Pelosi that<br>> the request is not about impeachment. It is about legitimate<br>> legislative and oversight issues. The Chairman is not going to<br>> presuppose anything about what the Committee will find or where the<br>> Committee will go.\[1\](#PTHGN){#cite-PTHGN .citation_link}<br><br>So from a full reading of the letter, they are doing this pursuant to<br>their oversight role only, and being able to craft law pursuant to what<br>the IRS actually does.<br><br>To that end, *any use of this material, outside of oversight and<br>legislation,* *should be dealt with extremely harshly.* If Congress<br>abuses this authority, and either a. the President's tax returns<br>magically leak on to the Internet, or b. some other type of action<br>begins against the President based on information in these tax returns,<br>Congress should be held to account for violating Federal IRS law.<br><br>Breaking tax laws is something that the President's advisers have found<br>out is a bad thing. Congress must be held to the same standard.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-PTHGN){.citation_index}<br>[https://int.nyt.com/data/documen\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a91710&url=https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/740-congress-request-trump-tax-returns/8fca455b44e383714434/optimized/full.pdf%23page%3D1){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nyt.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
