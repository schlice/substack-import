<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The same thing will happen to them as will happen to any person who<br>refuses a direct order.<br><br>Mandatory vaccination has existed in the military for many years. No one<br>in the military has ever been under any disillusion that they were<br>somehow immune to this. They are free to *disagree* with the<br>vaccination, but they are not free to *refuse a direct order* to be<br>vaccinated.<br><br>If their discharge is anything other than honorable, they will face<br>consequences throughout the remainder of their life, especially as they<br>try to find gainful employment. This may drive them towards<br>less-than-ethical lines of work, or may encourage them to become<br>radicalized and join militia groups.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What will happen to the ex-soldiers who are discharged for not getting<br>vaccinated?
