<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [People like Trump because he has no filter.\<br>\<br>A lot of people took what he said out of context. Trump basically said,<br>under his breath, offhand, \"he\'s not a war hero.\"\<br>\<br>He then immediately went on to qualify what he meant: \"McCain was a war<br>hero because he was captured\....frankly I like guys who weren\'t<br>captured.\"\<br>\<br>Finally, he said that McCain was basically last in his class (or second<br>to last) at Annapolis, and you\'re not supposed to say that, you\'re<br>basically just supposed to say how wonderful someone is, not point out<br>his actual record. He was a poor officer, a sloppy pilot, and his POW<br>status essentially negated his bad qualities. Trump simply pointed that<br>out.\<br>\<br>On that, I wholeheartedly agree. And there\'s nothing hypocritical about<br>doing just that. If this is \"Swift Boat\"-esque, let\'s see McCain\'s<br>co-pilots and comrades come to his defense and claim that he was a great<br>pilot or was an amazing officer.\<br>\<br>Trump also said that he raised a lot of money for McCain during his<br>Presidential bid, and then he lost, and Trump \"doesn\'t like<br>losers.\"]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
