<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can you get military disability for COPD because of smoking?<br><br>The Veterans Administration provides ongoing disability coverage and<br>health coverage for service connected disabilities. The VA must<br>therefore determine that the condition was caused by, or aggravated by,<br>military service. Service connection is determined in several ways:<br><br>- DIRECT -- Service medical records show that the disabling condition<br>  was diagnosed during military service and the condition has continued<br>  to affect the veteran.<br>- AGGRAVATION -- Evidence demonstrates that the disabling condition<br>  which existed prior to service was aggravated beyond normal<br>  progression during military service.<br>- PRESUMPTIVE -- Evidence demonstrates that the disability is one<br>  predetermined by the VA to be presumed for service connection by time,<br>  place and type of service.<br>- SECONDARY -- Evidence demonstrates that the disability developed as a<br>  result of, or residual of, another service connected disability.<br>- INJURY AS A RESULT OF VA MEDICAL TREATMENT -- This is a disability<br>  that the veteran incurred, had aggravated or died from because of<br>  medical treatment at a VA Facility.<br><br>It is unlikely that COPD from smoking will be considered a<br>service-connected disability, but only the VA can make that<br>determination. Your best option is to visit a VSO (Veterans Service<br>Office) near you in order to get help.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
