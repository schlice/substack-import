<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Let\'s be honest: life isn\'t fair.\<br>\<br>You really wouldn\'t want it to be fair, would you? I always tell my<br>kids this when they observe one child getting something that they<br>didn\'t get; they tell me, \"that\'s not fair!\" I tell them, \"Well, if<br>you want everying to be *fair*, I\'d have to punish you when he does<br>soemthing wrong, you know, just to be *fair.* To be *fair*, everyone has<br>to have the same outcome.\" The complaints about life being unfair<br>usually dissipate at that point.\<br>\<br>You don\'t really want life to be *fair*. You want life to be *just*.<br>That means everyone gets exactly what they deserve. And that\'s going to<br>be different for everyone. Life in the United States is based on this<br>concept: everyone has an *equal opportunity* to succeed. Not everyone<br>ends up the same way, but everyone starts out the same way, with the<br>same opportunities.\<br>\<br>For the mother in question, while it is certainly tragic that a mother<br>felt like she needed a gun to protect her family and she had no other<br>options than to illegally get one, the simple fact remains that she<br>illegally obtained a firearm. Is it *fair* that this happened? No,<br>probably not. But is it *just*? Absolutely. Under the current law, she<br>got exactly what she deserved.\<br>\<br>Some states have rules that allow convicted felons to regain their<br>rights to gun ownership under certain conditions. Lawyers can also help.<br>In California, there is a law firm that helps convicted felons regain<br>firearms rights by, in some cases, getting the felony conviction reduced<br>to a misdemeanor. In other cases, they can obtain a Governor\'s Pardon,<br>which will also restore their gun rights. They can also have the<br>original case expunged, which means the same as \"it never happened.\"\<br>\<br>State laws vary, and if you were convicted of a nonviolent felony at a<br>state level, that is the jurisdiction that takes precedence when the<br>Federal court looks at whether or not guns can be owned. 18 U.S.C. §§<br>921(a)(20) and (a)(33)(B)(ii) say that \"\a<br>y conviction which has<br>been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or<br>has had civil rights restored shall not be considered a conviction for<br>purposes of\" the federal gun ban. To determine whether someone\'s civil<br>right to own a gun has been restored, federal courts \"look to the law<br>of the jurisdiction of conviction . . . and consider the jurisdiction\'s<br>entire body of law.\" *United States v. O\'Neal*, 180 F.3d 115, 119 (4th<br>Cir.), *cert. denied*, 528 U.S. 980 (1999). So the question of whether<br>or not you can ever again own a gun depends on where your conviction<br>took place, and whether or not they ever restore civil rights to felons.<br>For example, in Colorado, nonviolent felons only lose their gun rights<br>for 10 years. In North Carolina, however, they *never* restore civil<br>rights to convicted felons. Even moving to another state, the Feds would<br>look to the state where you were convicted, and their law, to see if<br>your civil rights were restored following your conviction.\<br>\<br>Contact your local bar association to get a referral to an attorney who<br>might be able to assist with such an endeavor. They\'ll be able to tell<br>you if it\'s even possible, and if you have a chance at getting your<br>civil rights restored.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
