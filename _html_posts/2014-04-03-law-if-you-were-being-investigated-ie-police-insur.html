  legal for them to mess with your mind. Example: make you look crazy mentally to
  others? When does investigating turn into harassment? Losing job? Possible nervous

<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Investigators have many tools at their disposal. Police<br/>investigators can even lie to suspects during interrogation in order to<br/>convince them to reveal information that they would not normally<br/>reveal.\<br/>\<br/>However, if an investigator was interacting with a suspect for the sole<br/>purpose of \"making him look crazy\" or \"messing with his mind,\" that<br/>would fall squarely in the category of harassment.\<br/>\<br/>To determine if one is mentally capable of standing trial, understanding<br/>the concept of right and wrong, etc., a psychiatric evaluation is<br/>conducted. That is not the job of the police investigator, but of a<br/>psychiatrist.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
