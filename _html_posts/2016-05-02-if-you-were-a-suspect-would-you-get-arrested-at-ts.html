<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you are on a domestic flight, you will not be arrested. TSA<br>checkpoints at domestic checkpoints are not tied in to NICS or any other<br>identification system at all. TSA makes sure your identification matches<br>your ticket. That\'s about the level of detailed checking they perform.<br><br>If you are on an *international* flight, you might be arrested. If<br>you are a suspect who might be thought to flee the country, and your<br>passport is \"flagged,\" you can be arrested at the checkpoint, but note<br>that this checkpoint is not administered by the TSA, but by US Customs<br>and Border Patrol (CBP).<br><br>So strictly speaking, TSA will not arrest you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
