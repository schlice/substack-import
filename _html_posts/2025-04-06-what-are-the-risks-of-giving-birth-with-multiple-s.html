<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So here's the answer you were probably looking for from someone who<br>actually knows something about MS.<br><br>It is completely safe to have children if you have MS.<br><br>That said, there are a few things to think about.<br><br>1.  Not all MS therapy medications are completely compatible with<br>    pregnancy and/or breastfeeding. If you plan to get pregnant and/or<br>    breastfeed, talk to your neurologist about options you can pursue.<br>2.  During your pregnancy, you'll find that your personal symptoms get<br>    better. This is believed to be because of hormonal changes and<br>    because your body's immune system "ramps up" to protect both you and<br>    the baby. You'll feel really good during your pregnancy. But just as<br>    commonly, *once you give birth, you can expect that you'll have a<br>    relapse soon after.* This is just one of the joys of MS and<br>    motherhood.<br>3.  Finally, the risk for developing MS in the general population is<br>    about 1 in 750. When you have a *first-degree relative with MS*<br>    (either a parent or a sibling), that risk increases to anywhere<br>    between 1 in 100 and 1 in 40. Now, there's absolutely no guarantee<br>    that your children will develop MS. But it is true that the risk is<br>    slightly increased. There are lots of other factors which determine<br>    the overall risk of developing MS; heredity is just one of them.<br><br>To be clear, I am just making sure you have the complete picture; I'm<br>not telling you to not have children. Once you are aware of the very<br>minor risks, you can feel safe pursuing having a child while you have<br>MS.<br><br>And as always, if you have MS and you'd like to have a baby, talk to<br>your neurologist early and often. It can make your pregnancy as<br>smooth as possible.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional medical advice.
