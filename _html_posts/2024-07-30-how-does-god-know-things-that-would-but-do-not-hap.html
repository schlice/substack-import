<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Whoa, that's a lot of questions all in one question!<br><br>> **How does God know things that would but do not happen (when there is<br>> free will)?**<br><br>God operates on a different level of existence than we do, and it's a<br>level of existence that is really hard for our human brains to wrap<br>themselves around. God is transcendent, omnipotent, and eternal. That<br>means He exists outside of the universe (which means outside of matter,<br>space and time), He has unlimited power to effect change within our<br>universe, and He has no beginning and no end.<br><br>What we want to focus on to answer this question is God's<br>*transcendence*. Because He exists outside of the universe, He exists<br>outside of time. Time is a construct which only exists within this<br>universe, because time began with the Big Bang (see Einstein's Theory of<br>General Relativity).<br><br>The best way to describe how God sees us is that "everything is now" for<br>God. For Him, the past is now. The present is now. The future is now. He<br>sees everything, even though we (living in the universe as we do) only<br>see the present. The past is history, and the future is mystery. We can<br>see neither the past nor the future. We only see the now.<br><br>Additionally, God sees everything that we *will* choose. He has *always*<br>seen everything that we *will* choose, so everything He has designed was<br>designed with the results of our free choices already being understood,<br>even though we haven't made those choices yet.<br><br>See why this is so hard to wrap your head around? If I haven't made the<br>choice yet, how can God see it? What if I make a different choice when I<br>actually get there? These are all questions framed from a perspective<br>*within* time. God's perspective is so much greater. He's already seen<br>what we will choose. And He's already designed everything in accordance<br>with our choices which He can see even though we have not yet arrived at<br>the moment of choice on our timeline yet. We haven't even had the<br>opportunity to exercise our free will, but God has already seen the free<br>choice that we will eventually make.<br><br>> **How did he know ancient peoples he wiped out would be entirely evil<br>> a generation ahead? By developmentally simulating?**<br><br>Same reason: because He sees everything for all time as now, even<br>things which haven't come to pass yet for us.<br><br>> Why does he torture me who would always stay good?<br><br>You're going to have to re-phrase this question because I'm not sure<br>what you're asking here.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
