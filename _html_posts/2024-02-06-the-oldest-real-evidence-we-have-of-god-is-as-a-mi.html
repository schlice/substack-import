  The Mesha Stele. Does any jew, Christian or Muslim have any evidence that god existed
  before then, remembering that the Bible fables were written in later times?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Hebrew Bible, also known as the Old Testament, is a collection of<br>sacred books that developed over about a thousand years. The oldest<br>texts are thought to date back to the 10th or 11th centuries BC. The<br>Torah, the first five books of the Bible, were likely finalized and<br>canonized during the Babylonian Exile in the 6th--5th century BC. The<br>entire Hebrew Bible was complete by about 100 AD.<br><br>The earliest examples of written Paleo-Hebrew date back to the 10th<br>century BC. The Khirbet Qeiyafa ostracon, which was found in a dig at<br>the ancient fortress city near Beit Shemesh, is the earliest Hebrew<br>writing previously found, dating back to 1000 BC.<br><br>But you talk about "the oldest evidence we have of god" when these<br>writings are not "evidence" of God. They are the oldest writings we have<br>about God, but they are not "evidence" of God.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
