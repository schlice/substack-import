<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Oh, so you mean this guy?<br><br>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ro\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4b170a&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Even the legacy media is saying that DeSantis champions all of Trump's<br>priorities without the annoying Trump-esque characteristics. And he does<br>so intelligently and without the same level of belligerence and<br>braggadocio. He is a clear front-runner who could pose a real challenge<br>to Biden.<br><br>But he has been taking a lot of hits from the legacy media, presumably<br>in an attempt to tarnish his image and make him less palatable as a<br>possible Republican to run against Biden.<br><br>So would I vote for DeSantis if there wasn't a better alternative? Sure.<br>Are there better alternatives? Indeed there are. Here's who I'd love to<br>see run:<br><br>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=47687d&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>She is a woman, she is of Indian descent, and she became the first<br>Indian American in a cabinet position, so in theory, she meets all of<br>the "minority" rules, at least better than DeSantis. She is well-spoken,<br>super-smart, and tenacious. She has foreign policy experience (being the<br>US representative to the UN might do that for you). She was also a<br>governor. I'd vote for her in a hot second (I also would have voted for<br>Condi Rice if she'd have run, but that's neither here nor there).<br><br>But Haley will be panned as a Trumper, since she served on his cabinet.<br>I have a feeling, though, she'll be able to overcome that stigma fairly<br>easily.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Would you vote for someone with Trump-Esque policy but with the<br>temperament of Biden (e.g wants a wall but would never refer to Mexicans<br>as rapists & murderers. Wants tax cuts for the rich but wouldn\'t tweet<br>at his rivals as scumbags and unAmerican)?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
