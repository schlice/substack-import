<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why did Colorado Springs Police ignore my repeated reports of a<br>squatter using my address for Medicaid?**<br><br>First of all, you're talking about two separate things: squatter's<br>rights, and Medicaid fraud.<br><br>As to squatters, it's not something that the police handle, because it's<br>not a criminal matter, but a civil matter. When the police arrive, the<br>squatter says he was invited to stay by the lawful owner or a previous<br>tenant, and under Colorado law, that means that the squatter gets to<br>stay until that statement can be disproved in court.<br><br>Once the owner has convinced a judge that the squatter is not a legal<br>resident, then the Sheriff can post an eviction notice, and even then,<br>the squatter has anywhere from 14 to 21 days before he is successfully<br>removed from the home.<br><br>As to Medicaid fraud, it's up to the U.S. Health Department's Office of<br>Medicaid Management to address the fraudulent activity. Please call them<br>at 1 (877) 87 FRAUD. You can choose to make your complaint anonymous,<br>and your complaint will always remain confidential.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
