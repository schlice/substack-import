<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [[[Rob<br>Henst](https://www.quora.com/profile/Rob-Henst-1)]{.qlink_container} has<br>got it spot on. I have always found it to be caused by drinking too much<br>water before I run. Eat and drink sparingly before you run, or eat and<br>drink long enough before you run that it\'s not an issue.\<br>\<br>Like Rob said, if it\'s happening further into your run, you may<br>actually be running *out* of food. You may need to take some carb gel<br>with you.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
