<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What do gun right advocates and Trump supporters think about the<br>President directing the DOJ to propose a law banning bump stocks?**<br><br>I am both a Trump supporter and a gun rights advocate. What do I think<br>about banning bump stocks?<br><br>*Meh.*<br><br>Bump stocks are a novelty.<br><br>Anyone who is well-versed in firearms knows that bump stocks are wildly<br>inaccurate and basically exist because it's a neat trick to show how you<br>can be fully in compliance with the law but still make a semi-automatic<br>rifle behave like a fully automatic one.<br><br>If the Vegas shooter wanted to kill three times as many people, he'd<br>have taken the bump stock off and aimed with a good scope instead. Using<br>the rifle in the way it was intended would have allowed him to actually<br>place shots where he wanted them, and be far more accurate in the<br>process. Using the bump stock causes the part of the weapon you need to<br>hold steady to bounce around in your hand, which makes it terribly<br>inaccurate. He literally *vomited* rounds in the general direction he<br>wanted them to go and it was nothing but dumb luck that actually allowed<br>him to hit anything. If anything, more people survived the thousands of<br>rounds he shot *because* he used a bump stock.<br><br>So you wanna ban 'em? It's literally like banning those novelty glasses<br>with the attached nose and mustache. It's a novelty item. It has no<br>serious use in modern-day firearms. I'm sure that bump stock<br>manufacturers might disagree with me (just like professional clowns may<br>take issue with the whole fake mustache disguise banning), but I don't<br>care.<br><br>Bump stocks are a toy and if their existence in this world bothers you<br>or scares you because of the Vegas shooter, then please, by all means,<br>ban them from being sold in the United States. It hurts me not one bit.<br>It provides literally zero functionality. And banning them doesn't<br>prevent anyone from keeping or bearing arms in accordance with the 2nd<br>Amendment. So go ahead.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
