<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [SINGLE.\<br>\<br>Don\'t get married. Don\'t have kids. You\'ll be much more wealthy.\<br>\<br>But, of course, you\'ll be much poorer in quality of life. Having a<br>family enriches you in a way that nothing else can.\<br>\<br>In truth, there isn\'t one single word you can use that will make you<br>rich, or everyone would be using it. People that use certain words have<br>certain attitudes and approaches towards life. So the words are<br>significant only in how they are applied to life.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
