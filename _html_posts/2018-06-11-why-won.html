<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **Why won\'t the Florida state legislators put a statewide halt to<br>> suburban development?**<br><br>Why would any legislature vote to destroy growth?<br><br>Doing so would be political suicide.<br><br>> **We don\'t need any more Northerners coming down here buying up the<br>> land, turning it into transient communities of voters who vote to<br>> destroy our state.**<br><br>I'll literally pretend you didn't write this. Ignoring your marginally<br>xenophobic comment, no one moves to a state and "votes to destroy it."<br>It's like taking the gun and saying, "Gee, let me point this at my foot<br>and pull the trigger. Sounds like fun!" Literally no one does this.<br>Hyperbole much?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
