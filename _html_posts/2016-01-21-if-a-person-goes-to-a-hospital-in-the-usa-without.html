<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>According to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act<br>(EMTALA), any person who goes to an emergency room must be stabilized<br>and treated for life-threatening illness or injury, regardless of their<br>ability to pay. Hospitals are required to provide \"emergency medical<br>treatment\" which is lifesaving treatment and/or stabilization, and<br>provide treatment for women in \"active labor\" (water has broken).<br><br>(Note that ERs do not have to provide non-lifesaving treatment to<br>persons who cannot pay.)<br><br>Once that treatment is done, someone still has to pay the bill. So<br>several things will happen:<br><br>1.  The hospital will try to collect from the individual.<br>2.  If the individual cannot pay any of the bill (i.e. no income at<br>    all):<br>    1.  The hospital will try to determine whether or not the person<br>        qualifies for Medicare or Medicaid, and try to collect the money<br>        from them.<br>    2.  The hospital may try to write off the debt:<br>        1.  If the hospital is non-profit, it might write off the cost<br>            as \"charity.\" In order to maintain non-profit status, the<br>            hospital has to do a certain amount of \"charity\" work.<br>        2.  If the hospital is for-profit, it may write the debt off as<br>            \"bad debt\" which is then used to calculate Medicare and<br>            Medicaid reimbursement rates, allowing the hospital to<br>            command higher reimbursement from the government<br>    3.  The hospital can then use the \"bad debt\" or \"charity\"<br>        numbers to attempt to ply more from paying customers\' insurance<br>        plans, making it more expensive for everyone else to get care.<br>3.  If the person is employed but underinsured, or if they do have some<br>    form of income, the hospital will send the remainder of the bill to<br>    collections, which can bankrupt the individual.<br><br>One way or another, the hospital will get paid. The hospital will also<br>get paid at the expense of the other, paying, customers, in one way or<br>another.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
