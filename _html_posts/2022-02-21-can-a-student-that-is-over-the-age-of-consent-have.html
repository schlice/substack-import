<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(US answer)*<br><br>A student who is over the age of consent can have a relationship with a<br>high school teacher.<br><br>A student who is over the age of consent SHOULD NOT have a<br>relationship with HIS OWN high school teacher.<br><br>\<br><br>There is nothing magical about being a high school teacher which would<br>preclude normal relationships. HOWEVER, this changes drastically when<br>the two people involved are part of the same instructor-student<br>relationship.<br><br>Schools have documented the "why" better than I can, so here's an<br>excerpt from a University of Iowa manual describing why<br>instructor-student relationships are not allowed:<br><br>> There are also special risks in any sexual or romantic relationship<br>> between individuals in inherently unequal positions of power (such as<br>> teacher and student, supervisor and employee). Such relationships may<br>> undermine the real or perceived integrity of the supervision and<br>> evaluation provided, and the trust inherent particularly in the<br>> instructor-student relationship. They may, moreover, be less<br>> consensual than the individual whose position confers power believes.<br>> The relationship is likely to be perceived in different ways by each<br>> of the parties to it, especially in retrospect.<br>><br>> Moreover, such relationships may harm or injure others in the academic<br>> or work environment. Relationships in which one party is in a position<br>> to review the work or influence the career of the other may provide<br>> grounds for complaint when that relationship gives, or creates the<br>> appearance of, undue access or advantage to the person involved in the<br>> relationship, or when it restricts opportunities or creates a hostile<br>> environment for others.<br>><br>> Such relationships also have the potential for other adverse<br>> consequences, including the filing of charges of sexual harassment<br>> and/or retaliation \...\. In those circumstances when sexual<br>> harassment is alleged as the result of a romantic and/or sexual<br>> relationship, the existence of the relationship is not a *per se*<br>> violation of the policy on Sexual Harassment. However, the apparent<br>> consensual nature of the relationship is inherently suspect due to the<br>> fundamental asymmetry of power in the relationship and it thus may be<br>> difficult to establish consent as a defense to such a charge. Even<br>> when both parties consented at the outset to a romantic involvement,<br>> this past consent does not remove grounds for or preclude a charge or<br>> subsequent finding of sexual harassment based upon subsequent<br>> unwelcome conduct.\[1\](#YHVRK){#cite-YHVRK .citation_link}<br><br>When two people involved in an instructor-student relationship exists,<br>there is an *asymmetry of power* which is naturally created. This<br>imbalance leads the participants to *believe* that the relationship is<br>completely voluntary, but may not be as voluntary as they believe it to<br>be. Subconsciously, the student may feel compelled to participate, and<br>the instructor may feel like they are not exploiting an imbalance in<br>power in the relationship when they actually are.<br><br>This is why this particular form of relationship is not *illegal*, but<br>is usually *prohibited by policy* in schools and universities across the<br>country.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can a student that is over the age of consent have a relationship with a<br>high school teacher (romantic and sexual) if the parents allow it?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-YHVRK){.citation_index} [[Operations<br>Manual](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=25219c&url=https://opsmanual.uiowa.edu/community-policies/consensual-relationships-involving-students){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="uiowa.edu"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
