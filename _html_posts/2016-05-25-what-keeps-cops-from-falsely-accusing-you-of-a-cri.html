<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I suppose any government employee in any position could lie and cause<br>you great angst in your personal and professional life. I assume you're<br>asking the question specifically about the police because they normally<br>bring the lawless to justice, and it seems quite unfair that they might<br>bring a law-abiding citizen into the justice system when they did<br>"nothing wrong." By the way, walk into the jail and ask them by a show<br>of hands how many of them didn't do what they were accused, tried, and<br>convicted, of doing. You won't see a single hand not raised. Is that<br>truly possible? Could everyone in jail have been falsely accused? No,<br>it's exceedingly unlikely.<br><br>So what checks and balances keep cops from falsely accusing you?<br>Nothing. Nothing prevents a police officer from falsely accusing<br>you. Nothing prevents a police officer from planting evidence, or<br>railroading you into the system. Nothing at all.<br><br>That said, what checks and balances exist in *the system* to prevent<br>innocent people from going to jail?<br><br>1.  The court system. You (hopefully) would hire defense counsel if you<br>    were arrested and charged with a crime, and your lawyer will help<br>    you sort it out. It would definitely be an interesting first<br>    meeting: "I know every defendant tells you he didn't do it, but in<br>    my case, *I really didn't do it."*<br>2.  The fear that if the officer was caught, he'd not only lose his job,<br>    but he would face personal liability for false arrest and many other<br>    charges, charges against which the department would not defend him.<br>3.  Personal integrity of police officers. I can bet by the simple fact<br>    that you're asking this question that you don't put a lot of stock<br>    in the fact that police officers do, in fact, have personal<br>    integrity. But whether or not you believe it is not what determines<br>    fact. The vast majority of police officers are honest, hard-working<br>    people who want to keep you safe and want to see the bad guys go<br>    away for a long time. Departments do their best to ensure that the<br>    people they hire have personal integrity. The background<br>    investigations that officers go through rival what people go through<br>    to get access to DoD Top Secret information (I should know; I<br>    completed both processes). Occasionally a bad seed slips through,<br>    and people do change over the years. I would never be so naive to<br>    think that it wouldn't happen. It does. As [[Brian<br>    Jones](https://www.quora.com/profile/Brian-Jones-116)]{.qlink_container}<br>    mentioned, when we find the bad seeds, they are dealt with as<br>    quickly as possible. No department wants that kind of publicity.<br>4.  *Reality*, which is much more mundane than what you see in the<br>    movies or can create in your imagination. In a similar question<br>    where the questioner asked something like "what's to stop a police<br>    officer from lying about the speed I was doing," the question<br>    becomes *why?* Why would an officer *need* to lie about what you<br>    were doing? If he sits there for another five minutes, he's<br>    guaranteed to see another speeder. Why does he need to fabricate<br>    charges against you? Unless you knew the officer and he had some<br>    sort of personal vendetta against you, having an officer lie and<br>    fabricate charges against you is just seriously unlikely. There are<br>    plenty of bad guys to catch out there. He doesn't need to make<br>    anything up about you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
