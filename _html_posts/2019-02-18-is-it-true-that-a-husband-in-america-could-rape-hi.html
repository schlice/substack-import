<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it true that a husband in America could rape his wife without<br>penalty from the law?**<br><br>Absolutely not. [[Marital<br>rape](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=80de82&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_rape_(United_States_law)){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} (also known as spousal<br>rape) is illegal in all 50 states.<br><br>It does have a very long history, and for many parts of that history, it<br>was *not* illegal in all 50 states. The idea stems back to 17th century<br>England. Writings by Sir Matthew Hale indicate some of the foundation<br>for this idea that husbands are insulated from rape charges by the<br>"marital contract." He<br>[wrote(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=104071&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historia_Placitorum_Coron%25C3%25A6){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} that a \"husband cannot<br>be guilty of a rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by<br>their mutual matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given up<br>herself in this kind to her husband which she cannot retract.\" The<br>[[Model Penal<br>Code](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b93273&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Penal_Code){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} retained that idea,<br>defining rape as a crime committed when "a male \...\ has sexual<br>intercourse with a female not his wife."<br><br>Staring around the mid 1970s (following the womens' rights movements in<br>the United States), the view of spousal rape began to change. In 1984,<br>the New York State Court of Appeals heard the case of [[*People v.<br>Liberta*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d0ee7a&url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/women-and-justice/resource/people_v_liberta){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cornell.edu"}]{.qlink_container}, and in it, judge [[Sol<br>Wachtler](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=00ba5b&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Wachtler){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} stated that \"a marriage<br>license should not be viewed as a license for a husband to forcibly rape<br>his wife with impunity. A married woman has the same right to control<br>her own body as does an unmarried woman.\"<br><br>Beginning in the mid 1970s, states started removing spouse exceptions<br>from their rape laws, and by 1993, marital rape (or spousal rape) was a<br>crime in all 50 states.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
