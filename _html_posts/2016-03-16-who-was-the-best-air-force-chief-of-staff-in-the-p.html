<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Fogleman has my vote for the best. Dugan was a bit before my time, but<br>he comes in close second.<br><br>I had some of the worst experiences during the McPeak era, and not just<br>because he oversaw the drawdown that cost me a pilot\'s slot. The<br>uniform changes were ridiculous, downward-directed, and almost<br>universally hated. The whole Total Quality Management (TQM) movement<br>made the Air Force feel more like a civilian company rather than a<br>military. We felt like we were the red-headed stepchildren of the Armed<br>Forces under McPeak. Even Wikipedia has detailed the angst over the<br>McPeak years:<br><br>> McPeak\'s legacy as Chief of Staff has been considered in several<br>> quarters as one of the most controversial in U.S. Air Force history<br>> and has been the subject of much debate. Many Air Force senior<br>> officers and senior enlisted personnel, both active and retired from<br>> the Regular Air Force, the Air Force Reserve and the Air National<br>> Guard, have accused him of trying to run the Air Force as a<br>> corporation, with his introduction of Total Quality Management (TQM)<br>> under the moniker of \"Quality Air Force\" (QAF), as well as the<br>> uniform changes he unilaterally implemented which strayed from a<br>> traditional land-based military style. Some of his uniform changes<br>> were soon undone after his retirement by his successor as USAF Chief<br>> of Staff.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
