<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Hopefully, it doesn't take a Christian to review the actual data. Even<br>non-Christians should be able to see that using a single data point to<br>make policy usually results in bad policy.<br><br>So let's flesh out the numbers and then you can much more easily see *if<br>anything* needs to be done, and if so, *what*.<br><br>Yes, it is true that in 2020, the CDC reported that firearms became the<br>leading cause of death in children and adolescents, surpassing<br>automobile accidents for the first time ever.\[1\](#xwuYE){#cite-xwuYE<br>.citation_link}<br><br>But there are some details that this single data point leaves out.<br><br>First, we must understand that the CDC identifies "children" as people<br>between ages 1 and 19. So let's not forget that we are defining 19-year<br>olds as "children." Remember, we consider them adults at 18, so they're<br>including two years worth of adults in their figures. Keep a 19-year old<br>gangbanger in your mind when the CDC says "children."<br><br>Next, we must understand that the number includes self-inflicted gunshot<br>wounds, suicides being the largest percentage of the firearms deaths in<br>that CDC number. And when it comes to suicide, we must remember that<br>this was 2020. During the *pandemic.* When suicide rates among children<br>increased by 10% over the year prior.\[2\](#rNZWX){#cite-rNZWX<br>.citation_link}<br><br>The point we're making here is that a singular data point doesn't tell<br>us *why* that data point is how it is. Just saying that firearms-related<br>homicides increased more than automobile accidents in one year doesn't<br>explain why that is happening.<br><br>\<br><br>I'm not really going to speak to it, but I wanted to acknowledge your<br>unsubstantiated assertion that Christians are somehow "fine" with<br>children dying. Please tell us where you got this information so that we<br>can review it. I can't seem to find it anywhere.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-xwuYE){.citation_index}<br>[https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=087656&url=https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmc2201761){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nejm.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-rNZWX){.citation_index}<br>[https://www.usnews.com/news/heal\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6ac64c&url=https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2022-04-25/study-shows-higher-share-of-adolescent-suicides-in-2020){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="usnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
