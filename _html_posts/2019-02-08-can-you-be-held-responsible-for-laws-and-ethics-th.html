<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you be held responsible for laws and ethics that you knew nothing<br>about and were instructed by your employer to violate?**<br><br>Yes. Ignorance of the law is not an excuse. Also, "I was just following<br>orders" is not an excuse.<br><br>Your employer cannot instruct you to violate law.<br><br>When your employer instructs you to violate law, you may refuse. If your<br>employer fires you for failing to follow instructions, they can be sued.<br><br>I would quit and run, fast, from that employer. I think revealing to<br>another employer why you left would be justification enough for why you<br>quit.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
