<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You provide the abortion. Yes, there are some anecdotal reports of a few<br>people who experienced problems getting emergency medical care, ***but<br>the exception does not prove the rule.***<br><br>It is not normally a problem to receive emergency medical care. If you<br>leave the baby in, they would both die, but if you take the baby out<br>(and it can't survive on its own) and you save the mother, then you save<br>the mother. You do everything in your power to save the baby, but if the<br>baby is not viable and leaving it in will cause the mother to die, you<br>remove the baby.<br><br>In all honesty, this happens so infrequently as to be an outlier.<br>Usually, if the mother is going to have a prenatal emergency crisis, the<br>baby is grown enough to be viable and can survive as a preemie.<br><br>But again, at that point, if we leave the baby in and they both die, or<br>we take the baby out and only the baby dies, we save as many lives as we<br>can.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
