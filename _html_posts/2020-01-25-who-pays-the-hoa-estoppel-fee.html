<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Who pays the HOA estoppel fee?<br><br>Estoppels, which are more commonly known as HOA dues letters or HOA<br>certificates (depending on state), are documents used to prove that a<br>home seller does not have any outstanding debt or delinquent dues<br>payments before they sell their home.<br><br>**Because it is the seller who is coordinating with the HOA to prove<br>that they are "free and clear," it is the seller who pays this fee as<br>part of their closing costs.**<br><br>Interestingly, it is these fees (along with new account establishment<br>fees) which is where HOA management firms make their money. These fees<br>can be exorbitant, and the HOA does not make a big deal of disclosing<br>them (even though they are required to disclose the fees during contract<br>negotiations). HOA Board members, usually members of the community, are<br>generally not savvy enough to realize just how pricey these fees are and<br>how they relate to what other management companies charge, and they<br>usually ignore them.<br><br>Florida passed a bill in 2017 to try to cap unusually high estoppel<br>fees. SB 398 caps the fee for an association dues letter or<br>certification request at \$250.<br><br>> However, some management companies are adding on mysterious "online<br>> misc" fees of anywhere from \$5-50. Additionally, if there are<br>> delinquent amounts owed, the association may charge an additional max<br>> fee of \$150 for that information. **A \"delinquent amount\" could be<br>> as low as a dollar.**<br>><br>> There is also a \$100 fee for "expedited" requests.<br>><br>> All in all, the law requires a maximum of \$500 for an expedited,<br>> delinquent estoppel certificate from just one association. The<br>> unfortunate side effect of this required cap has been that management<br>> companies that didn't previously have exorbitant fees are now raising<br>> their prices. One company is now charging the full price for documents<br>> simply stating if there is a pass-through from a sub-association to<br>> the master association when this information was given at no charge<br>> before the law took effect.\[1\](#FOdiv){#cite-FOdiv .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-FOdiv){.citation_index} [[Florida Estoppel Law: The Good,<br>The Bad, and The<br>Ugly](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=278248&url=https://www.proplogix.com/blog/the-new-fl-florida-estoppel-hoa-dues-law-success){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="proplogix.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
