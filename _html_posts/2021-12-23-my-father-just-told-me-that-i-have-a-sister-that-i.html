<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You should feel however you would like to feel about that. All I can do<br>is tell you whether or not I think any one particular emotion is<br>useful or useless. I'll also tell you how I would advise someone who<br>told me this, but you can take it or leave it when it comes to my<br>advice.<br><br>Do you want to be angry at your father for not telling you about your<br>sister? You can, although that's pretty unproductive in my opinion. I<br>wouldn't waste my time with anger. I might also be wary about anything<br>my father says, since I know he's willing to lie to protect...something.<br><br>Do you want to be disappointed that you didn't get to spend all of this<br>time before now with your sister? Fine, be disappointed, but let it pass<br>quickly. Understand that the past is the past and you can't undo what<br>has been done. You can only work from today forward.<br><br>Instead, if I were to give you advice, I would say you should feel<br>*thrilled* that you have a sister, and you can meet her and learn all<br>about her and find all the weird little ways that you two are alike<br>because you're actually siblings, even though you didn't grow up<br>together.<br><br>I think it would be so fun to have a sister I never knew about. I would<br>love to meet her!<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>My father just told me that I have a sister that I never knew about. How<br>should I feel about this?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
