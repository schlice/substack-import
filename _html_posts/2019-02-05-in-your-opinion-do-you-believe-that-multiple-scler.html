In relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), it is the T<br>cell binding to myelin and the actual myelin destruction in itself,<br>which creates an inflammatory response. This inflammation produces the<br>symptoms of the disease during a relapse.<br><br>During later disease courses such as secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), it<br>is thought that the "neural load" of reserve neurons has been exhausted,<br>and as nerve damage occurs, replacement nerve cells cannot be inserted.<br>It is thought that this is actually a neurodegenerative response which<br>causes the symptoms in this disease course.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
