<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The fact that one person is an exact copy of another<br>person does not mean that the copy does not have as much right to live<br>as the original. It is still a functioning human being, who has as much<br>right to life and protection under the law as the original. The fact<br>that it is a *clone* makes it no less of a *human*. Until we start<br>cloning humans, we won\'t have to address this in our laws.\<br>\<br>Whether or not it is murder is up to the court, but it would be judged<br>in the same way that any murder case would. The definition of murder (at<br>least in our jurisdiction) is **the unlawful taking of another human<br>life with forethought and intent.** So just as in any other murder<br>trial, these elements will be examined.\<br>\<br>Whether or not it is morally wrong to kill your clone is another matter<br>altogether.\<br>\<br>[[Is it morally wrong or right to kill a clone you just<br>created?](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-morally-wrong-or-right-to-kill-a-clone-you-just-created)]{.qlink_container}]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
