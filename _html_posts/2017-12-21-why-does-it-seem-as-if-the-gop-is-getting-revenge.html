<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why does it seem as if the GOP is getting revenge for the United<br>States twice voting for Barack Obama? Have they ever been this<br>bloodthirsty before?**<br><br>You answered your own question. It *seems* that way. It's your<br>interpretation of what you're seeing.<br><br>I'm going to link you over to another answer to a previous Quora<br>question: [[*What do you think happened to America to bring about a<br>President like<br>Trump?*](https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-happened-to-America-to-bring-about-a-President-like-Trump/answer/Anthony-Zarrella)]{.qlink_container}<br>This answer, I think, perfectly encapsulates what Republicans were<br>*feeling* after eight years of an Obama administration.<br><br>Many of the policies you see being implemented now are policies that you<br>would never see during an Obama administration. So while they are not<br>implementing these policies *in order to be vindictive,* the appearance<br>is that these policies are exactly opposite of how we were doing things,<br>but that's because the policies we are implementing now are in direct<br>contradiction to the last eight years of US policy, both foreign and<br>domestic.<br><br>And they are not *bloodthirsty*; they are *determined* to implement the<br>policies they believe will be helpful to this country, and to its<br>people. This is what they were elected to do, and they're doing it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
