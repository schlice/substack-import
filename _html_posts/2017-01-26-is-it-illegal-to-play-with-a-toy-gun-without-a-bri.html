<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The legal restriction is on the sale of the gun, not its use. It is<br>an antique, which is the only reason it was legal to buy. Normally, you<br>cannot sell a toy gun at a store without a bright orange tip. The fact<br>that your toy was an antique made it legal to sell as an antique (not a<br>toy).<br><br>There is no requirement to have the bright orange tip on it when you use<br>it.<br><br>That said, you have to have a modicum of common sense here. Just because<br>it's a toy probably doesn't mean it's a good idea to shove it in your<br>waistband and go strolling around your downtown area. You probably<br>shouldn't "play with your toy" around police officers. You're very<br>likely to be shot. Just ask the kids who were shot by police while<br>"playing with toys" around them.<br><br>If you're in your yard, by yourself (or with other mentally-competent<br>adults, or children under adult supervision), you should be perfectly<br>fine to play with your toy, orange tip or not.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
