<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How Does \"Gabapentin\" affects for MS?<br><br>Gabapentin does not affect MS. It does not alter the disease process. It<br>does not reduce the time between relapses, and it does not reduce the<br>severity or duration of a relapse.<br><br>What Gabapentin does is to manage a possible symptom of the disease, and<br>no, it's not seizures. It's highly unlikely that an MS patient would be<br>suffering seizures as part of his disease.<br><br>Gabapentin is an *anticonvulsant*. It was originally used in epilepsy to<br>control seizures. The downside to Gabapentin was that it was not<br>long-acting. It is broken down in the body fairly quickly, and new<br>anticonvulsants have been released (since Gabapentin was approved as an<br>anticonvulsant) which work much better and control seizures for a much<br>longer period of the day, so it isn't used much for its on-label primary<br>use anymore.<br><br>Gabapentin has shown some benefit for people who suffer from the "MS<br>hug," as that is a nerve misfiring issue which sometimes responds<br>positively to Gabapentin.<br><br>However, Gabapentin has one big side effect: *drowsiness*. Gabapentin<br>makes you tired. It makes you tired quickly, and it clears out of your<br>body within about four hours. So in some cases, it is effective as a<br>*sleep aid* when other sleep aids are contraindicated.<br><br>Gabapentin also has some fairly complex dosing.<br><br>Therefore, make sure you only use Gabapentin exactly as it was<br>prescribed for you. Do not take more or less of it because you think it<br>will do something else for you. Always use your medication exactly how<br>it was prescribed, for exactly what it was prescribed on the label.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice, nor is it intended to<br>be professional medical advice.
