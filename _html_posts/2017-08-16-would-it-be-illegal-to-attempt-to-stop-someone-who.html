<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Wow, you could fill Quora with questions if you asked one question at a<br>time. So let's break down and see what we can do here.<br><br>> *Would it be illegal to attempt to stop someone who is committing a<br>> violent crime? What about non-violent crimes?*<br><br>Not trying to be obsequious, but the answer is "it depends." Mostly, it<br>depends on the crime. Violent crimes against the person (such as the big<br>ones: murder, rape, robbery, or kidnapping) are ones in which you can<br>usually intervene on behalf of the victim with force, even up to and<br>including deadly force. But as always, this varies by jurisdiction.<br>Additionally, such use of force and its subsequent "defense of others"<br>claim, is an "affirmative defense," which means you accede to committing<br>the violence against the aggressor, but you then claim self-defense (in<br>the form of defense of another) as your defense.<br><br>In the case of a crime against property or a non-violent crime, you do<br>not have the affirmative defense of defense of another to rely on, so<br>under normal circumstances, you cannot attempt to stop someone<br>committing such a crime. You would either have to use force against them<br>(which is a crime), or you would have to hold them against their will in<br>a particular location until the police arrived (which is false<br>imprisonment). You could make a "citizen's arrest," but the laws around<br>citizen's arrest, and what you are allowed and not allowed to do during<br>them, are wildly variable depending on where you are. So much so that it<br>is almost advisable to *not* perform one, as you take on a tremendous<br>amount of personal liability if you don't strictly follow the local laws<br>to do so, and you face a tremendous legal battle even if you do. In such<br>a case, I always advocate the "be a good witness" approach. Take note of<br>all of the who/what/when/where/how question details, and record as much<br>as you can on your phone. Turn your evidence over to the police, who are<br>not encumbered with the same set of legal challenges to using force to<br>effect arrest as you are.<br><br>Now that we've answered that, the other questions should answer<br>themselves quite easily:<br><br>> *Could it fall under self-defense even if you were not directly<br>> affected?*<br><br>As we've mentioned, defense of others falls under self-defense in most<br>jurisdictions.<br><br>> *Could the criminal bring charges against me for intervening?*<br><br>I would virtually expect the criminal (through his lawyer) to do just<br>that every time. Since you are not a police officer, you are not<br>specifically charged with stopping crime, and you don't have the legal<br>protections that a duly sworn peace officer does in enforcing the law.<br>This means you're operating within the realm of "citizen's arrest," and<br>as we've mentioned, the laws are wildly variable. Some citizen's arrest<br>statutes allow you to use some force, but most do not allow you to use<br>any force, to effect the arrest. Some require announcement of citizen's<br>arrest, some do not. You would have to know the law in your area very<br>well, follow it to the letter, and *still* expect the criminal to sue<br>you in civil court. Expect a hairy and expensive legal fight.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
