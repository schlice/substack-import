<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Since senators are not appointed under the Appointments Clause, they<br>cannot be impeached. However, if the state of Texas feels that Ted Cruz<br>needs to leave his position, the state of Texas may hold a recall vote<br>to remove him from office.<br><br>If they otherwise do not remove him, or if they do not have a mechanism<br>for recall of effected officials under Texas law, the next best bet for<br>Texas voters is to vote him out at the next election.<br><br>And as others have pointed out, the individual chamber can expel a<br>member with a 2/3 vote.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
