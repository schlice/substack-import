<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Specified Complexity.<br><br>Jodie Foster played a scientist who worked for the organization Search<br>for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) in the movie *Contact.* In the<br>movie, Foster gets extremely excited when her antenna picks up radio<br>waves that appear to have an intelligent pattern, "One, two, three,<br>five, seven, eleven...those are primes!" she exclaims (meaning prime<br>numbers). "That can't be natural phenomena!"<br><br>Indeed, random radio waves can be naturally produced, but those that<br>contain a message always have an intelligent source. Prime numbers, from<br>one to 101 in order, constitute a message that only comes from an<br>intelligent being.<br><br>Foster is so confident that ET has been found, she goes public with her<br>discovery. Government and military officials then converge on her<br>facility. "If this is such an intelligent source, then why don't they<br>just speak English?" one official asks with a hint of derision.<br><br>"Because math is the only universal language!" Foster fires back.<br><br>Of course she's right. In fact, alphabets, and thus language itself, can<br>be ultimately reduced to numbers. This is why the English alphabet is<br>mathematically identical to the genetic alphabet of DNA and why the<br>comparison of cell information to letters and sentences is a one-to-one<br>relationship rather than just an analogy.<br><br>While Foster and her colleagues later discover a more complicated<br>message embedded in the radio waves, they are absolutely certain the<br>prime numbers alone prove that the message came from intelligent life.<br>Why are they so certain of this? Because **repeated observation tells us<br>that only intelligent beings create messages and that natural laws never<br>do.** When we see a sequence of prime numbers, we realize that it<br>requires an intelligent cause. Another name for that message or<br>information is "specified complexity." In other words, not only is it<br>complex---it also contains a specific message.<br><br>\<br><br>So how does the presence of specified complexity prove the existence of<br>an intelligent Creator?<br><br>DNA.<br><br>DNA has a helical structure that looks like a twisted ladder. The sides<br>of the ladder are formed by alternating deoxyribose and phosphate<br>molecules, and the rungs of the ladder consist of a specific order of<br>four nitrogen bases. These nitrogen bases are adenine, thymine,<br>cytosine, and guanine, which commonly are represented by the letters A,<br>T, C, and G. These letters comprise what is known as the four-letter<br>genetic alphabet. This alphabet is identical to our English alphabet in<br>terms of its ability to communicate a message, except that the genetic<br>alphabet has only four letters instead of twenty-six. Just as the<br>specific order of the letters in this sentence communicates a unique<br>message, the specific order of A, T, C, and G within a living cell<br>determines the unique genetic makeup of that living entity.<br><br>Therefore, the message in DNA is not only complex, but it delivers a<br>message: it tells the entire cell how to function. **DNA is, therefore,<br>specified complexity.**<br><br>So where we are right now can be expressed in a logical statement:<br><br>- Only intelligent beings create specified complexity.<br>- DNA is specified complexity.<br>- Therefore, DNA was created by an intelligent being.<br><br>Now this says nothing *about* the intelligent being who created DNA. All<br>it says is that DNA was created by an intelligent being. This is a<br>logical conclusion and is scientifically supported by repeated<br>observation.<br><br>\<br><br>So thus far, we have proven that an intelligent being created us,<br>because we can prove that intelligence created DNA. But is there any<br>scientific principle we can use to learn *about* that intelligent being?<br>The answer is yes, there is. The forensic science principle known as the<br>Law of Causality says, in part, that an effect must resemble its cause.<br>Therefore, we can analyze the effect (us) in the present and learn about<br>the cause (the intelligent being who created us) in the past.<br><br>We can surmise the following about our intelligent creator (based on<br>characteristics of His creation):<br><br>- He must be supernatural in nature (as He created time and space).<br>- He must be powerful (incredibly).<br>- He must be eternal (self-existent).<br>- He must be necessary (the maker must be self-explanatory).<br>- He must be omnipresent (He created space and is not limited by it).<br>- He must be timeless and changeless (He created time).<br>- He must be immaterial because He transcends space/physical.<br>- He must be personal (the impersonal cannot create personality).<br>- He must be infinite and singular as you cannot have two infinite<br>  beings.<br>- He must be diverse yet have unity as unity and diversity exist in<br>  nature.<br>- He must be intelligent (supremely, as only cognitive being can produce<br>  cognitive being).<br>- He must be purposeful as He deliberately created everything.<br>- He must be moral (no moral law can be had without a giver).<br>- He must be caring (or no moral laws would have been given).<br><br>These things being true, we now ask if any religion in the world<br>describes such a Creator. The answer to this is yes: the God of the<br>Bible fits this profile perfectly. He is<br><br>- supernatural (Genesis 1:1),<br>- powerful (Jeremiah 32:17),<br>- eternal (Psalm 90:2),<br>- necessary (Exodus 3:14)<br>- omnipresent (Psalm 139:7),<br>- timeless/changeless (Malachi 3:6),<br>- immaterial (John 5:24),<br>- personal (Genesis 3:9),<br>- necessary (Colossians 1:17),<br>- infinite/singular (Jeremiah 23:24, Deuteronomy 6:4),<br>- diverse yet with unity (Matthew 28:19),<br>- intelligent (Psalm 147:4-5),<br>- purposeful (Jeremiah 29:11, Psalm 19:1-4),<br>- moral (Daniel 9:14), and<br>- caring (1 Peter 5:6-7).<br><br>\<br><br>Remember that we are using scientific observation to prove the existence<br>of an intelligent creator, so it is important to understand that, in<br>valid scientific fashion, this theory of Intelligent Design (ID) is<br>*falsifiable*. We are willing to abandon this whole notion of<br>intelligence creating specified complexity if natural processes are ever<br>shown to create it. However, the same *cannot* be said about the<br>Darwinist position. Darwinists don't allow falsification of their<br>"creation story" because they don't allow any other creation story to be<br>considered. Their "science" is not tentative or open to correction; it's<br>more closed-minded than the most dogmatic church doctrine the Darwinists<br>are so apt to criticize. In fact, Darwinists frequently say that<br>Intelligent Design is not science. Are they right?<br><br>Science is a search for causes, and there are only two types of causes:<br>intelligent and non-intelligent (natural). The Darwinists' claim that ID<br>is not science is based on their biased definition of science. But<br>that's circular logic: if your definition of science rules out<br>intelligent causes beforehand, then you'll never consider ID science.<br><br>The irony for the Darwinists is this: if ID is not science, then neither<br>is Darwinism. Why? Because both Darwinists and ID scientists are trying<br>to discover what happened in the past. Origin questions are forensic<br>questions, and thus require the use of the forensic science principles<br>we already have discussed (like the Law of Causality). In fact, for<br>Darwinists to rule out Intelligent Design from the realm of science, in<br>addition to ruling themselves out, they would also have to rule out<br>archaeology, cryptology, criminal and accident forensic investigations,<br>and the entire scientific process behind the organization portrayed by<br>Jodie Foster, SETI. These are all legitimate forensic sciences that look<br>into the past for intelligent causes. Therefore, something must be wrong<br>with the Darwinists' definition of science.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
