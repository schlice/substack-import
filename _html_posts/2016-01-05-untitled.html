<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [I agree with you, but I wonder where you found in the<br>Constitution a right to live without fear. That sounds a little bit like<br>your problem, not a problem of those of whom you are afraid.\<br>\<br>I also don\'t know how gun advocates have any input at all into the<br>healthcare debate. We\'d actually like to see more done to address<br>healthcare, and to be fair, deinstitutionalization was a liberal<br>position, not a conservative one.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-are-common-logical-fallacies-in-gun-control-arguments/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
