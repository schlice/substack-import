<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you were on the jury, how would you have voted in the case of the<br>off-duty Dallas police officer shooting her upstairs neighbor?**<br><br>Exactly as the jury did.<br><br>There's not a lot of wiggle room here. She claimed that the Castle<br>Doctrine applied even though she made a "mistake of fact" and entered<br>the wrong apartment. She truly believed she was in her own, and that<br>belief is what drove her desire for self-defense.<br><br>However, the Texas Castle Doctrine law is very clear.<br><br>> (c)â€‚A person who has a right to be present at the location where<br>> the deadly force is used, who has not provoked the person against whom<br>> the deadly force is used, and who is not engaged in criminal activity<br>> at the time the deadly force is used is not required to retreat before<br>> using deadly force as described by this section.<br><br>She did not have "a right to be present" in the other person's home, so<br>there is no application of the Texas Castle Doctrine, according to plain<br>language of the statute.<br><br>Therefore, Castle Doctrine theory did not apply, so a determination of<br>whether or not she was justified in shooting took place, and they found<br>quite clearly that a reasonable person would not have feared for their<br>life in the same situation.<br><br>Guilty, although if I had a choice, it would have been manslaughter, not<br>murder. Murder is a killing with malice and forethought, and this was<br>more an unjustifiable homicide than a murder. I would have called it<br>manslaughter, not murder, but this is Texas, so...<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
