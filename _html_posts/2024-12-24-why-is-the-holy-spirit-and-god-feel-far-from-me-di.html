<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>God will never abandon you. God will never forsake you (Hebrews 13:5).<br>He is always there, waiting for you (Jeremiah 29:11, Isaiah 30:18). So<br>if we are feeling far from Him, then it is probably an *us* issue, not a<br>*Him* issue.<br><br>So what are some of the reasons we can feel far from God?<br><br>- We will always feel far from God when we do not seek Him. When we<br>  ignore Him, when we act independently of Him, or when we do our own<br>  thing and expect God to support us in our own efforts, we can feel far<br>  from God.<br>- We will also feel far from God when we sin, and we don't seek<br>  forgiveness. If we haven't honestly repented of our sin for whatever<br>  reason, this can lead to God feeling as if He is far from us.<br>- When we don't *regularly* get in to the Word, God can feel far from<br>  us.<br>- When we allow negative thoughts and emotions to rule our minds, we<br>  leave Satan an opportunity to swoop in and plant the seeds of doubt in<br>  our minds, which separate us from God.<br>- When we compare our spiritual journey to others (I am so guilty of<br>  this), it leads us to feelings of inadequacy and discourages us in our<br>  own faith journey.<br><br>An honest self-examination and a commitment to prayer and regular<br>engagement in the Word should get you back on track.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
