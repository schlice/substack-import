It<br>keeps a lock on the sleigh and posts the update to the NORAD Tracks<br>Santa website, which feeds all of our other systems. It's pretty simple<br>and doesn't task the systems much.<br><br>But should we? It's outside of our core mission of Missile Warning.<br><br>We do anyway, out of the goodness of our hearts.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
