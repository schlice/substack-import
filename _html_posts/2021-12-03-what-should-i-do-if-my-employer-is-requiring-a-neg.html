<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Get the test. There really isn't much more you can do. Get the test and<br>go back to work.<br><br>This virus will eventually move out of the *pandemic* phase and into the<br>*endemic* phase, as it mutates to becomes more *virulent*, but less<br>*lethal*. Then, you'll just get your "combined flu/COVID shot" every<br>year and it will be no big deal. Getting COVID will be no more or less<br>dangerous than getting the flu (which itself is already minimally to<br>moderately dangerous), and whether or not you get it (the shot, the flu,<br>or COVID) will be no one's business again.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What should I do if my employer is requiring a negative COVID test after<br>I have recovered and finished quarantining in Pennsylvania?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
