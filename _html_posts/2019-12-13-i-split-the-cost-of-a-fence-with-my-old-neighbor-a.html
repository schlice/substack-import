<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I split the cost of a fence with my old neighbor. A new neighbor has<br>moved in and is wanting to remove the fence. The fence is entirely on<br>their property. Can they legally do this?**<br><br>*(US answer only)*<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Essentially, you volunteered to pay for half of a fence which was<br>located solely in someone else's property. Based on its location, you<br>were under no obligation to pay for any of that fence, but you chose to<br>anyway. The new owner is under no obligation to leave the fence up, or<br>get your permission before they tear it down, since it is on their<br>property.<br><br>You can try to make a claim in small claims court that you actually own<br>half of the fence because you paid for half of the fence, and perhaps<br>you can get some of your money back, but you won't be able to stop them<br>from removing the fence.<br><br>Perhaps the neighbor could give you the materials for the fence, and you<br>can then re-install it on your property with the nice side facing out<br>(which the neighbor can't prevent, even if they don't give you the<br>materials). Maybe you can work with the company de-installing the fence<br>and just have them move it on to your property instead. You'll clearly<br>need to pay for their labor in installing the fence on your property,<br>but the materials are all there already.<br><br>And as always, laws differ in every state, and we would always advise<br>you to seek the advice of a licensed attorney in your area before you<br>take any actions.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.
