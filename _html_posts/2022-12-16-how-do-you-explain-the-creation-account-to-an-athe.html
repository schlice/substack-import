<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You don't. It makes no sense to tell an atheist how God created the<br>world. They don't believe in God, so why would you do such a thing?<br><br>Instead, you should explain with logic **why a creator god is the only<br>logical choice for how the universe came to be at all.**<br><br>In order to address this truth, you have to begin by asking the correct<br>question. And that question is: *why am I here? Why is there something,<br>rather than nothing at all?* The search for the truth about why<br>something exists rather than nothing at all leads us to understand the<br>truth about God. The argument for God can be expressed very simply:<br><br>1.  Something exists.<br>2.  You can't get Something from nothing.<br>3.  Therefore, a necessary and eternal entity created Something.<br><br>Even atheists do not deny this logic. They simply claim that the<br>universe is that eternal entity. However, to date, all scientific and<br>philosophical inquiry has proven and re-proven that the universe had a<br>beginning, and the body of evidence proving this fact is continually<br>growing. If something had a beginning, it is not eternal. Therefore,<br>being that the only two sources of eternality are an eternal universe or<br>an eternal Creator, and we have proven that the universe is not eternal,<br>an eternal Creator must exist. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is<br>that God exists.<br><br>Explaining the creation account to an atheist is like spitting into the<br>wind. You're really not going to get far. First, you have to get the<br>atheist to believe that a creator god exists, and then you can explain<br>how that creator god created the universe and everything in it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
