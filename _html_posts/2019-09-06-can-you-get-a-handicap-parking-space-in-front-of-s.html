There are usually no marked<br>parking spaces in front of *any* single-family houses in the United<br>States. Not always, but in most cases, there is no regulated parking in<br>a city street.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
