<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You have the right to ask God for anything. I used to ask God for<br>laser-beam eyes. By the way, this is initially when I learned that God<br>doesn't give you everything you ask for. Sometimes, his answer is No.<br><br>While laser beam eyes probably weren't ever going to be a thing in my<br>life, this is still a pretty important concept to understand.<br><br>**We must understand that sometimes, when God answers our prayers, he<br>does so by saying NO.**<br><br>When it comes to asking God to forgive the sins in others when we have<br>ourselves sinned, Jesus addressed this:<br><br>> Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge<br>> others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be<br>> measured to you.<br>><br>> Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay<br>> no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your<br>> brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when all the time<br>> there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank<br>> out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck<br>> from your brother's eye. --- Matthew 7:1--5 NIV<br><br>Commentator Kent Hughes said, "We find it so easy to turn a microscope<br>on another person's sin, but we look at ours through the wrong end of a<br>telescope. We easily spot a speck of phoniness in another, because we<br>have a logjam of it in our own lives. Wrath toward the speck in someone<br>else's life may come from the suppressed guilt over the same massive sin<br>in our own lives."<br><br>So the problem isn't that we don't have the right to ask God to forgive<br>the sins of others. It's because we spend too much time looking at<br>everyone else's sins while not looking at the sin in our own life.<br><br>In fact, spending all the time worried about other people's sins instead<br>of our own may be a sign of guilt, because we have the same sin. If you<br>go back to Matthew's writings in their original language, "speck" and<br>"plank" come from the same word. In other words, Jesus was saying that<br>we may be so good at finding the specks in other people's eyes because<br>we have planks of the same material in our own.<br><br>In other words, don't look in the telescope or the microscope for sins,<br>look in the mirror. "Forgiven people are forgiving<br>people."\[1\](#LLrvL){#cite-LLrvL .citation_link} Seek forgiveness for<br>yourself, and you will find that you are much more forgiving of others.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Do we have the right to ask God to forgive others of sins when we<br>ourselves have also sinned?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-LLrvL){.citation_index} [[The Serious Humor of a Speck and<br>a<br>Plank?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=097f7a&url=https://www.christianity.com/jesus/life-of-jesus/teaching-and-messages/the-serious-humor-of-a-speck-and-a-plank.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="christianity.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
