<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I like<br>[User-11135432963137986568(https://www.quora.com/profile/User-11135432963137986568)]{.qlink_container}'<br>answer here very much. And in thinking about it, it makes sense to me<br>why I also will delete some comments:<br><br>Quora is not a debate site. Quora is a question and answer site.<br><br>I'm here to answer questions. I'm not here to debate you. You have as<br>much right to post an answer to the question as I do. I posted my<br>answer. You can post yours. May the person with the better reputation<br>win.<br><br>But I have neither the time nor the inclination to waste my time when<br>you don't like my telling of fact, or don't agree with the topic, or<br>would like to tell me about the latest social media frenzy. I post<br>facts. And I do not use the word fact loosely. Because when I<br>present a fact, I include citations to the relevant works which support<br>the factual statements I have made.<br><br>If you would like to question the facts with your own facts, I may<br>entertain your questions, but mostly because your questions highlight<br>more nuances about my own answer. If you're simply arguing with me,<br>don't bother. Post your own answer with your own "facts." Don't argue<br>with me. If you're arguing just to argue, I'm deleting. I simply don't<br>have time to fiddle with fools.<br><br>If comments have no relevance to my answer, I will also usually delete<br>them. It's my answer, and your comment is attached to my answer. If you<br>want to be heard, answer the question yourself. Don't argue with me.<br><br>Again, if you have constructive points to make, make them in a BNBR way.<br>If I feel they contribute to the discussion about my own answer, they<br>stay. If I feel they are simply trolling, they're gone.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
