<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What would happen if the Second Amendment to the US Constitution were<br>repealed?**<br><br>*Within the first week:* nothing. Nothing at all will change. The Second<br>Amendment prevents the government from passing laws which infringe on<br>the right of the people to keep and bear arms.<br><br>*Within the first month:* Congress will pass the first law which makes<br>possession of all AR-15 style rifles illegal. But because they didn't<br>repeal the 4th Amendment, they still need search warrants to find them,<br>so they would be relying on people to voluntarily turn them in. And<br>because they didn't repeal the 5th Amendment, they have to provide "just<br>compensation" (read: fair market value) for any that are seized. And<br>because their method of accounting will no doubt not be "just," every<br>person who turns in an AR-15 will sue the government claiming a 5th<br>Amendment violation.<br><br>Also, the Supreme Court will hear its first case of the new law<br>violating a State constitution (as 44 state constitutions have a 2nd<br>Amendment), and we will get to see just how far the Supremacy Clause can<br>be pushed when it comes to a Federal *law* which is counter to a state<br>*constitution* when there is no Federal Constitutional authority to ban<br>guns. The Supremacy Clause says that the Constitution, and any Federal<br>laws which flow from it, are the supreme law of the land and even<br>override state constitutions (such as when the Voting Rights Act<br>overrode state constitutions when it enforced the 15th Amendment). But<br>this law does not flow from the Constitution; there is no Constitutional<br>authority which allows the Federal government to ban guns.<br><br>Some states will completely ban guns within their borders because they<br>now can (New York, California, and DC will likely be first up). They<br>will purport to show everyone just how "safe" life can be with no guns,<br>conveniently downplaying the continuing murders committed with guns.<br>"But those are *illegal* guns," they'll say.<br><br>*Within the first six months:* At least one state (possibly two) will<br>realize that if the Bill of Rights is no longer inviolate, then the<br>Federal government doesn't really care about protecting the rights of<br>states, and maybe this whole idea of a "union" is no longer workable,<br>and you'll see at least one attempt (and possibly one succeeding) of a<br>state to secede. Since the state agreed to the Constitution with a Bill<br>of Rights attached, the Constitution as it currently stands is not what<br>the state agreed to, and so (they will argue) they can leave the union.<br><br>Also, the Federal government will realize that as hard as they try, they<br>can't seem to collect a whole lot of AR-15 style rifles, because not<br>only do they not know where they are, but the people they "think" might<br>have them have conveniently lost them in many mysterious boating<br>accidents.<br><br>This is just one possible scenario. There are a hundred others. Who<br>knows exactly how it would turn out, but what we do know is that no law<br>will stop a bad person from committing a crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
