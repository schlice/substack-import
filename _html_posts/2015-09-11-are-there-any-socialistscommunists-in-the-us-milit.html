<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There is a heavy conservative tilt in the military, as<br>conservative values are very much in line with the core values of the<br>military services.\<br>\<br>That said, your political viewpoint is irrelevant in military service.<br>You cannot attend political functions as a representative of the<br>military; this is illegal under UCMJ. You cannot promote any one<br>political party while in uniform.\<br>\<br>So are there socialists/communists in the military? Possibly. We used to<br>have questions on our security clearance questionnaires that asked<br>whether or not you belonged to any Communist organizations. I\'m pretty<br>sure that one is out, and the question is simply now whether or not you<br>belong to any group that seeks to overthrow the government.\<br>\<br>So you can belong to whatever group you want, so long as you don\'t seek<br>to overthrow the government.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
