<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If Hillary voters don't worry that she is the biggest threat to national<br>security since Nixon, runs her foundation like the Mafia, has failed at<br>every political office she has been offered, and sells political<br>influence like it's going out of style, then I have little doubt that<br>Trump voters would care if he's actually a child rapist, or guilty of<br>committing incest as you suggest. He's not going to legalize rape as the<br>president, nor is he going to rape *your* child, so there's little<br>danger in keeping him trapped under mountains of paperwork in the Oval<br>Office.<br><br>If you need more convincing regarding *why* people don't care about<br>the true character of political candidates, please refer to [[Sierra<br>Spaulding's<br>answer](https://www.quora.com/Do-Republican-voters-worry-about-Donald-Trump-being-accused-of-raping-a-13-year-old-girl/answer/User-12125117475950440112)]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>\<br><br>*NOTE: Please don't bother commenting to tell me what an idiot I am, or<br>how bad you think Trump is and how the world will fall into nuclear<br>winter within six months of his taking office. If your comments are not<br>constructive, I will summarily delete them. My answer, my comments.<br>Don't like it? Answer the question yourself.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
