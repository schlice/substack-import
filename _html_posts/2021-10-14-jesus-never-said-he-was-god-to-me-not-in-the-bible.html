The<br>people who heard him knew that he was saying that he was God, and you<br>can tell by their reaction: they picked up rocks to stone him (v31).<br>When he asked them why they were picking up rocks, they said, "For<br>blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God" (v33). Stoning was<br>the punishment for blasphemy in that time, and the Jews were picking up<br>stones because they believed Jesus had just committed blasphemy by<br>claiming that he was God.<br><br>Literally, the same thing happened again, when Jesus said, "Very truly I<br>tell you, ... before Abraham was born, I am!" (John 8:58) In this<br>statement, not only was he claiming to be God, but claiming to be Yahweh<br>by name, the "great I AM." Once again, they attempted to stone him for<br>blasphemy, so everyone at that time knew exactly what he was saying.<br><br>There are many other examples throughout the Bible where Jesus shows,<br>through word and deed, that "he and the Father are one." While he never<br>actually said "I am God," he didn't have to.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Jesus never said He was God to me. Not in the Bible, so why do we<br>worship and call Him God?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
