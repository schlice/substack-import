<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Continuous recording of one person and his actions is a<br>burden that no other profession endures. Continuous recording would mean<br>continuous, in all places at all times. So for every bathroom break or<br>pit stop, the camera is rolling. That is definitely a burden that we<br>don\'t place on anyone, anywhere, and I don\'t expect we\'d place that<br>same burden on our law enforcement officers.\<br>\<br>There has to be a system that balances the desire for on-body video from<br>the officer\'s perspective (the public frequently videos officers<br>performing their duties, sometimes in the hopes that they\'ll catch the<br>officer doing something illegal) with the desire for officers to be able<br>to control when the video is running and when it is not.\<br>\<br>The on-body system produced by TASER (the same group that produces the<br>stun devices which bear their name) is pretty good. The officer wears a<br>head-mounted camera (usually attached to sunglasses, but can be attached<br>to any eyewear or possibly a hat). The system is wired to a playing-card<br>sized recorder the officer wears on his belt. It also has a remote<br>start/stop button which can be run to somewhere on their body, usually<br>on their shirt.\<br>\<br>When they push the button to start the recording for the on-body system,<br>it takes the previous 30-seconds of video, *sans audio*, and prepends it<br>to the video. Yes, this means the video is running all the time, but it<br>only uses the previous 30 seconds of video-only after the officer<br>presses the button. From the button press forward, the full interaction<br>is recorded until the button is pressed again. It could, in theory,<br>record continuously from that point on if the officer does not stop the<br>recording. The unit makes a very quiet beep every 30 seconds or so to<br>remind the officer that he is recording.\<br>\<br>The idea is that you start the recording when you begin a contact with<br>someone. You\'ll get 30 seconds of video before the button press, but<br>you\'ll get everything from the button press forward.\<br>\<br>At the end of the shift, the recorder is checked back in to a cradle at<br>the station. The video is uploaded to a central server and the unit is<br>wiped and recharged for the next officer to use. The pre-roll video is<br>never kept; it is only used when the button is pressed.\<br>\<br>Additionally, the officer can only view the video after the unit is<br>checked in; the unit has a proprietary docking connector which means<br>that the officer cannot view or edit the video until after the video is<br>checked in. This ensures a chain of custody and allows the videos to be<br>admissible in court. The in-car cameras work the same way; the hard<br>drive is checked out at the beginning of the shift and checked back in<br>at the end; the video cannot be viewed until after the unit is checked<br>in]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
