<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(NOTE: I'm not going to tell you who to vote for. I'm just going to<br>give you my opinion about voting in general)*<br><br>I don't think it's correct to vote for someone because you don't like<br>the other guy (or gal). I most definitely believe that you should vote<br>for the candidate who most closely aligns with your beliefs about how<br>the country should be run. Who will provide you with the tax policy you<br>like the best? Whose policies will create the most jobs? Whose policies<br>will best improve the economy? Whose policies will lower your health<br>insurance premiums while still providing for the broadest possible<br>access to health insurance for everyone?<br><br>If you can't find a candidate who will do that for you, I would suggest<br>not voting. Don't vote for someone if they don't mirror your beliefs.<br><br>And don't fall for all this "it's your civic duty to vote" crap. The<br>majority of the country does not vote, and never has. Somehow, we've<br>managed to survive all this time without them; I suspect we will survive<br>another few years without them, too. It's your *right* to vote, it's not<br>a *requirement*.<br><br>Plus, you will have the competitive edge in any political argument:<br>"Hey, don't blame me, I didn't vote for him/her."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
