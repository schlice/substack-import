<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Nothing.<br><br>Nothing can *make* you believe anything. No one on earth can make<br>you do anything against your will, and God chooses to not make you<br>believe anything against your will.<br><br>Sometimes, people can bend your will, in violation of your free choices,<br>through coercion (i.e. torture, deprivation, etc), but in most cases, no<br>one can make you believe or do anything if you do not choose to do it<br>first.<br><br>**The only person who can make you believe in the truth of Christianity<br>is you.**<br><br>So now, it's up to you to discover the truth. How? Humbly seeking<br>answers, asking God to show you the truth of the Gospel.<br><br>*Because only God has the power to change your heart.*<br><br>> For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to<br>> prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.<br>> Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to<br>> you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your<br>> heart." --- Jeremiah 29:11--13 NIV<br>><br>> I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove<br>> from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. ---<br>> Ezekiel 36:26 NIV<br><br>When you seek Him with all of your heart, you will find Him, and he will<br>transform you, giving you a "heart of flesh" that is capable of loving<br>Him. Only He can do this (in fact, it's a process we call<br>*regeneration*). When you had your "heart of stone," you could not love<br>Him. You were *dead* in your transgressions:<br><br>> As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which<br>> you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the<br>> ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in<br>> those who are disobedient. All of us also lived among them at one<br>> time, gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires<br>> and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath. But<br>> because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us<br>> alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions---it is by<br>> grace you have been saved. --- Ephesians 2:1--5 NIV<br><br>He regenerates you through His grace. Jesus echoed Yahweh's words:<br><br>> "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and<br>> the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the<br>> one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be<br>> opened.<br>><br>> "Which of you, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or<br>> if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? If you, then, though you<br>> are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more<br>> will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him! So in<br>> everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this<br>> sums up the Law and the Prophets.<br>><br>> "Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the<br>> road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small<br>> is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few<br>> find it." --- Matthew 7:7--14 NIV<br><br>Jesus says the same: seek Him and you will find Him, because if you<br>seek, you will find. Jesus also cautions that few will choose this path,<br>for "wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction,<br>and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road<br>that leads to life, and only a few find it." So the small gate and<br>narrow path exist, but you have to put in the work to find them. But if<br>you do, God promises that you will indeed find Him.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
