<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it true that Stephen was the first recorded martyr in the history<br>of Christendom?**<br><br>St. Stephen is indeed the first recorded Christian martyr. He was the<br>first person recorded to be killed for his Christian faith, stoned to<br>death in the year 36 AD.<br><br>Stephen was one of the first deacons of the early church, a leadership<br>position defined in the Bible along with elders. Stephen often engaged<br>in religious discussions in the synagogue, which caught the attention of<br>the Sanhedrin. He was brought before them, and his defense of his faith<br>so enraged them that he was brought out of the city and stoned to death.<br>His last words echo the last words of Jesus on the cross:<br><br>> Then he fell on his knees and cried out, "Lord, do not hold this sin<br>> against them." When he had said this, he fell asleep. ---Acts 7:60<br><br>This echoes what Jesus said:<br><br>> Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are<br>> doing." --- Luke 23:34<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
