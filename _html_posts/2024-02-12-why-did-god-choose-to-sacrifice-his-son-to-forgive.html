<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If God's nature is as He says it is, then the answer is no.<br><br>God is infinitely forgiving, but at the same time, He is infinitely<br>just.<br><br>So in order for him to be both forgiving *and* just, then sin must be<br>atoned for. God cannot dismiss sin. *Someone* must pay the price for<br>the sin.<br><br>So there's really only two choices: we pay for our own sin (and we never<br>enter Heaven), or someone pays for our sin for us. That's it. Someone<br>has to pay.<br><br>God doesn't want us to *not* enter Heaven (as He is infinitely<br>forgiving). But He cannot allow us into Heaven if our sin is still<br>unpaid (as He is infinitely just).<br><br>Therefore, the only solution is for someone else to pay for our sin.<br><br>The only person who could pay for our sin is someone who is born<br>sinless. And the only person who did not inherit Adam's sin by being<br>born from the seed of a man is Jesus, who was born through direct<br>creation by God. Therefore, He was born sinless.<br><br>He then lived a completely sinless life, in contrast to the rest of us,<br>who do not live sinless lives.<br><br>He was then fully capable of taking on our sin on the cross and atoning<br>for it with His death. Only He was able to do this. No one else was able<br>to pay for our sin.<br><br>\<br><br>Now, let's take it even further.<br><br>Jesus was the only one capable of taking on our sin. *But Jesus is God.*<br><br>So God took our sin *on Himself*.<br><br>Think about that for a second. God is infinitely loving, infinitely<br>forgiving, and infinitely just. There was no other option to get us to<br>Heaven other than God taking the punishment for our sin *onto Himself*.<br>His infinite forgiveness drove Him to take our punishment Himself.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
