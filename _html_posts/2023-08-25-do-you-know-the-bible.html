<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, before we can answer this question, we need to clear up what an<br>"error" is.<br><br>Some have estimated there are about 200,000 errors in the New Testament<br>manuscripts. First of all, these are not "errors" but variant readings,<br>the vast majority of which are strictly grammatical (i.e., punctuation<br>and spelling). Second, these readings are spread throughout nearly 5,700<br>manuscripts, so that a variant spelling of *one* letter of *one* word in<br>*one* verse in 2,000 manuscripts is counted as 2,000 "errors."<br><br>Textual scholars Westcott and Hort estimated that only *one in sixty* of<br>these variants has significance. This would leave a text 98.33 percent<br>pure. \[1\](#Ejikp){#cite-Ejikp .citation_link} Philip Schaff<br>calculated that, of the 150,000 variants known in his day, only 400<br>changed the meaning of the passage, only fifty were of real<br>significance, and *not even one* affected "an article of faith or a<br>precept of duty which is not abundantly sustained by other and undoubted<br>passages, or by the whole tenor of Scripture teaching."<br>\[2\](#njvCZ){#cite-njvCZ .citation_link}<br><br>So when we say "zero errors," we are talking about errors which would<br>modify "an article of faith or precept of duty;" in other words, an<br>error would be something that changes the religious understanding of a<br>passage.<br><br>There are indeed zero of those errors.<br><br>The part about that statement which is so amazing; indeed, supernatural,<br>is the fact that the Bible is not one book but 66 books written in three<br>languages by about forty different authors on three continents over the<br>span of about 1500 years. And with all of that time and space between<br>them, there is complete unity in the message, and there are, indeed,<br>zero errors (of the kind we identified already).<br><br>There is absolutely no way that such a thing could be accomplished by<br>the exertions of humans.<br><br>**That's why the Bible has zero errors: because the Bible writers were<br>divinely inspired.** In fact, the lack of errors is indeed a hallmark of<br>this divine inspiration.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-Ejikp){.citation_index} [[Baker Encyclopedia of Christian<br>Apologetics;Baker Reference Library: Geisler, Norman L.: 9780801021510:<br>Amazon.com:<br>Books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b4afad&url=https://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Christian-Apologetics-Reference-Library/dp/0801021510/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-njvCZ){.citation_index} [[A Companion to the Greek<br>Testament and the English Version: Schaff, Philip: 9781017403817:<br>Amazon.com:<br>Books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3ba51d&url=https://www.amazon.com/Companion-Greek-Testament-English-Version/dp/1017403813/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
