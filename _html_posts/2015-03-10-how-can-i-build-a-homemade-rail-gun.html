<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>1.  Purchase a nuclear power plant. You\'re going to need it to generate<br>    the 33 megajoules of electricity required to accelerate the<br>    projectile sled to any useful velocity.<br><br>OR\<br><br>1.  For something handheld, create a baseball-sized nuclear reactor. I<br>    mean, Tony Stark did it, in the desert.<br>2.  Build rails that can withstand massive repulsive forces, because as<br>    the rails use their magnetic repulsive forces to propel the sled,<br>    they also use those same forces to repel each other.<br>3.  Build to extremely tight tolerances. The farther apart the rails<br>    get, arcing starts to occur between the rails, which limits the<br>    serviceable life of the rails. The navy claims that a shipboard<br>    railgun has fired over 400 rounds out of one barrel, and they are<br>    trending towards a barrel that can fire 1,000 rounds.\<br>4.  Reduce the inductance and resistance of the rails, which limits the<br>    performance of the rails. This is the big limiting factor in using<br>    smaller amounts of electricity, which is why the device doesn\'t<br>    scale down very effectively.<br>5.  Build a bracing mechanism which can withstand stresses well over<br>    three times the stresses placed on a standard 105mm deck gun on a<br>    destroyer.<br><br>The less efficiently the gun is built, the slower the projectile will be<br>flung.\<br>\<br>[Wikipedia(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bfd8dc&url=http://Wikipedia){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container} says it much more<br>eloquently than I:\<br>\<br><br>> A very large power supply, providing on the order of one million<br>> amperes of current, will create a tremendous force on the projectile,<br>> accelerating it to a speed of many kilometres per second (km/s). 20<br>> km/s has been achieved with small projectiles explosively injected<br>> into the railgun. Although these speeds are possible, the heat<br>> generated from the propulsion of the object is enough to erode the<br>> rails rapidly. Under high-use conditions, current railguns would<br>> require frequent replacement of the rails, or to use a heat-resistant<br>> material that would be conductive enough to produce the same effect.<br>> At this time it is generally acknowledged that it will take major<br>> breakthroughs in material science and related disciplines to produce<br>> high-powered railguns capable of firing more than a few shots from a<br>> single set of rails. The barrel must withstand these conditions for up<br>> to several rounds per minute for thousands of shots without failure or<br>> significant degradation. These parameters are well beyond the state of<br>> the art in materials science.\<br><br>\<br>In other words, you have a tough row to hoe.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
