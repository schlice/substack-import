<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(Note that this answer is from the Christian perspective; your religion<br>may vary)*<br><br>> Is it true that all life is sacred?<br><br>Yes, it is true that all life is sacred. All life is created and known<br>by God.<br><br>> If it is, why do we still have capital punishment?<br><br>*We have capital punishment* *because* *all life is sacred.*<br><br>Because all life is sacred, those who murder (or who dishonor the<br>sanctity of life) must be held to account for that, and they are held to<br>that account by blood (see Genesis 9:6).<br><br>There is disagreement in the church about whether or not Christ's death<br>and resurrection abolished the need for a blood-for-blood punishment for<br>murderers. But as it stands today, the Bible at least contains<br>justification for why murderers can be killed.<br><br>The Bible also contains several other requirements for capital<br>punishment, which we incorporate in our system of capital punishment<br>today:<br><br>- proportionality (Exodus 21:23--25)<br>- certainty of guilt (Deuteronomy 17:6, Numbers 35:30)<br>- intent (Numbers 35:22-24)<br>- due process (Deuteronomy 17, Numbers 35)<br>- reluctance (not refusal) (Ezekiel 33)<br><br>The church should continue to have a healthy dialogue about whether or<br>not capital punishment is both biblical and necessary. We should always<br>seek to refine our understanding of important issues like this.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it true that all life is sacred?
