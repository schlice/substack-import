<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You didn\'t say where the job was located. And if it\'s<br>located in the United States, that makes all the difference.\<br>\<br>The Americans with Disabilities Act says very clearly that employers<br>cannot discriminate against an employee because they have a disability.<br>But if this is true, then by the same token they absolutely cannot<br>discriminate against someone because they don\'t have a disability.\<br>\<br>Basically, the employer can state the requirements for the job, and if<br>the candidate meets the requirements, they can apply for the job.\<br>\<br>I suppose, if the employer chose to do so, he could create a position<br>that required a deaf person to apply. He\'d be severely limiting his job<br>pool, and I\'d have doubts as to whether or not such a position would be<br>legal (as it would be a type of reverse discrimination: legally you<br>can\'t require the position to be filled with someone who doesn\'t have<br>a disability, so you can\'t also require the position to be filled by<br>someone with a disability). But I suspect that employers would not<br>require the position to be filled by a deaf person.\<br>\<br>They can require that the person filling the job be able to communicate<br>in ASL fluently. They can test you on your ASL ability, and they can<br>take the candidate that \"speaks\" ASL the best. Whether you are deaf or<br>hearing is not relevant, unless it is (for example, you work with<br>equipment that has no capacity for visual signals, it only produces<br>audible signals, so the person operating it must be able to hear the<br>signals it produces. While this is unlikely, I\'m just putting it out<br>there showing when it would be acceptable for an employer to place a<br>hearing condition on a job).\<br>\<br>I can\'t speak to what the deaf community would think of a hearing<br>person taking a job that a deaf person can fill. But if I believe in the<br>legislation, a deaf person can fill any job, just as a hearing person<br>can.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
