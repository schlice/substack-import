<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends." And in this<br>case, it depends on what your Governing Documents say about the matter.<br><br>Remember that you can always reject the violation and sue the<br>Association based on the fact that they're writing violations without<br>proof. Additionally, before you pay, you can demand to see the evidence<br>proving the violation, and if they cannot produce the evidence, you can<br>refuse to pay simply based on that alone. Then, once they fine you, you<br>can sue them, but of course you'll need to retain your own attorney to<br>do that.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
