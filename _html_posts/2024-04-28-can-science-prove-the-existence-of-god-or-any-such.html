<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No. Science cannot prove the existence of God. But let's not just<br>leave it there, because there are billions of believers in God around<br>the world. Are they all delusional? Do they all believe something which<br>has *no proof?*<br><br>First, we must identify what we will accept as "proof." When most people<br>demand "scientific proof," this normally refers to data you can see,<br>hear, taste, touch, or smell---things that directly confirm or undermine<br>a hypothesis. And in the context of science, such evidence has led to<br>remarkable results. Just look at today's advancements in technology and<br>medicine.<br><br>However, scientific evidence isn't the *only* type of evidence. Many<br>truths that exist cannot be proven through physical evidence. For<br>instance, we don't have physical evidence that a sunset is beautiful or<br>that the Nazis were evil. Of course, we understand these statements to<br>be true, but not because we have found physical evidence to support<br>them.<br><br>The same holds true for the existence of God. Whether you believe God<br>exists or not, He is, by definition, *immaterial* and *transcendent*. He<br>is *immaterial* because He is not composed of physical matter, not made<br>of material stuff like you and me (it is necessary for Him to be<br>immaterial because He created matter, so He must be outside of it). And<br>God is *transcendent* because He exists beyond space and time (it is<br>necessary to exist beyond space and time in order to create them). Thus,<br>when we're searching for God, we do not expect to find direct, physical,<br>scientific evidence for His existence within space and time. This fact<br>is important: **it is not just that we have not yet found such evidence<br>even though it may exist, it is that such evidence is *impossible*,<br>even in principle.** We are not going to find one of God's hairs, or<br>discover His footprint, or run a scientific experiment to see if He<br>exists.<br><br>Does that mean it is impossible to demonstrate that God exists? No. It<br>simply means that *science is not the right means,* just as a metal<br>detector is not the right tool to find a plastic cup.<br><br>The right tools, or the right proofs, are "logical" proofs, which are<br>contained in the discipline called *philosophy.* Philosophy is concerned<br>with life's most important issues, from morality to meaning to God.<br>Philosophy allows us to probe realities that can't be detected<br>through our senses; thus, philosophy provides an excellent method to<br>explore evidence for the existence of God.<br><br>Let's not forget, philosophy is not divorced from science, as if you can<br>rely on science alone, and philosophy is just pseudo-babble for PhDs to<br>discuss while smoking pipes in dimly-lit rooms. Philosophy is the<br>*foundation* of science. Science is dependent on philosophy. In fact,<br>*science is a slave to philosophy.* Bad philosophy results in bad<br>science, and good science requires good philosophy. Why? Because:<br><br>1.  Science cannot be done without philosophy. Philosophical<br>    assumptions are utilized in the search for causes, and, therefore,<br>    cannot be the result of them. For example, scientists assume (by<br>    faith) that reason and the scientific method allow us to accurately<br>    understand the world around us. That cannot be proven by science<br>    itself. You can't prove the tools of science---the laws of logic,<br>    the Law of Causality, the Principle of Uniformity, or the<br>    reliability of observation---by running some kind of experiment. You<br>    have to assume those things are true in order to do the experiment!<br>    So science is built on philosophy. Unfortunately, many so-called<br>    scientists are very poor philosophers.<br>2.  **Philosophical assumptions can dramatically impact scientific<br>    conclusions**. If a scientist assumes beforehand that only natural<br>    causes are possible, then probably no amount of evidence will<br>    convince him that intelligence created the first one-celled amoeba<br>    or any other designed entity. When Darwinists presuppose that<br>    intelligent causes are impossible, then natural laws are the only<br>    game in town. Likewise, if a creationist rules out natural causes<br>    beforehand (and we don't know of any who do), then he also risks<br>    missing the right answer. But a scientist who is open-minded to both<br>    natural and intelligent causes can follow the evidence wherever it<br>    leads.<br>3.  Science doesn't really say anything---scientists do. Data are<br>    always interpreted by scientists. When those scientists let their<br>    personal preferences or unproven philosophical assumptions dictate<br>    their interpretation of the evidence, they do exactly what they<br>    accuse religious people of doing---they let their ideology dictate<br>    their conclusions. When that's the case, their conclusions should be<br>    questioned, because they may be nothing more than philosophical<br>    presuppositions passed off as scientific facts.<br><br>Philosophy typically offers evidence in the form of *arguments*. In<br>fact, thinkers over the years have identified no fewer than twenty<br>arguments for God, arguments that range from the clear and simple to the<br>extremely complex. Some of these arguments appeal to the universe or<br>history, others to the existence of reason and beauty.<br><br>We can approach the God question from many angles, and there is no one<br>best way. But I think there is one argument that is not only clear and<br>convincing, but easy enough to understand.<br><br>Now, I know that sometimes, terms like "arguments" or "evidence" bother<br>people. If they bother you, you might instead consider these arguments<br>as "clues" that converge and point to a common conclusion, much the way<br>road signs guide you to a specific destination. A sign doesn't prove<br>that the destination exists, but it does point the way. These arguments<br>are signposts to God. So, let us look at one signpost that in my<br>opinion, presents perhaps the simplest yet most powerful argument for<br>God's existence.<br><br>The Kalam argument dates back to the Middle Ages but has been made<br>popular today by William Lane Craig, an evangelical Christian<br>philosopher. The argument is very simple; in fact, it is probably the<br>easiest of all the arguments to understand, having two premises and one<br>conclusion:<br><br>- P1: Everything which has a beginning has a cause.<br>- P2: The universe had a beginning.<br>- C1: The universe has a cause.<br><br>So let's dig in to these two premises and one conclusion:<br><br>Premise 1: This statement says everything that has a beginning has a<br>cause. It's very important that we get this right. Some atheists try to<br>refute this premise by responding, "But if everything that exists has a<br>cause, and God exists, then what caused God?" But the premise does not<br>claim, "Everything that *exists* has a cause." It says, "Everything that<br>*begins to exist* has a cause." Since God, by definition, and whether<br>you believe in Him or not, is eternal and never began to exist, this<br>first premise does not apply to Him. Therefore, the rhetorical question<br>"What caused God?" is like asking, "To whom is the bachelor married?" or<br>"What is the sound of one hand clapping?" Regardless of whether<br>bachelors or hands exist, these questions do not make sense. They are<br>literally nonsense because they confuse the meaning of terms.<br><br>Now that we have cleared away that misunderstanding, let us turn back to<br>the first premise. Is it true? Does everything that begins to exist have<br>a cause? For most people, the answer is yes; it is common sense. Almost<br>nobody denies it. The statement simply means that nothing just springs<br>into existence, randomly and without a cause. For if things did come<br>into being this way, then our world would be a wild spree of things<br>apparently popping into existence like sleight of hand magic. Only it<br>would be worse, since with sleight of hand you at least have a magician<br>who pulls rabbits out of a hat. However, in a world that violates this<br>first premise, rabbits would pop in and out of being even without<br>magicians or hats. Few sane people believe the world works this way.<br>Even the great atheist David Hume said, "I never asserted so absurd a<br>proposition as that something should arise without a cause." So, through<br>experience and reflection most people, even most honest atheists, agree<br>that everything that begins to exist has a cause.<br><br>Premise 2: This claim is slightly more controversial than the first<br>one. In fact, no less a thinker than St. Thomas Aquinas says that the<br>truth that the world had a beginning of its duration is only<br>conclusively known by faith and not by reason. Nonetheless, a host of<br>the greatest minds from antiquity to the present, including St.<br>Bonaventure in the Middle Ages and William Lane Craig today, offer<br>arguments that purport to defend this truth. An example of one of these<br>arguments, one which St. Bonaventure includes in his paradoxes of the<br>infinite, goes as follows: If the world has always existed, then there<br>would be an infinite number of past days. However, if there were an<br>infinite number of past days, we never would have been able to arrive at<br>the present day because an infinite series, by definition, cannot be<br>traversed. Since we have arrived at today (and today is the end date of<br>history), it follows that there must have been a beginning of time (a<br>beginning date).<br><br>Modern physics also seems to give weight to this position. Despite<br>cyclic cosmological models advanced by some physicists in recent years,<br>since the advent of the big bang theory in the twentieth century, the<br>scientific consensus is that the universe did have a beginning roughly<br>fourteen billion years ago. Alexander Vilenkin, a leading non-Christian<br>cosmologist, was invited to speak at a colloquium for Stephen Hawking's<br>seventieth birthday. There, in front of the greatest scientists in the<br>world, Vilenkin said, "All the evidence we have says that the universe<br>had a beginning." It is rare for scientists to speak with this measure<br>of conclusiveness, but Vilenkin stated his opinion that it is not just<br>that *some* of the evidence points to a beginning of the universe, or<br>even the *majority* of evidence, but that *all* of the evidence points<br>that way today.<br><br>Conclusion: The two premises are widely accepted today: everything<br>that begins to exist has a cause, and the universe began to exist. If<br>that is the case, then the third statement, the conclusion of the<br>argument, logically follows. We cannot avoid the fact that if everything<br>that begins to exist has a cause, and the universe began to exist, then<br>the universe must have had a cause.<br><br>It's important to note that the Kalam Cosmological Argument doesn't<br>prove that God created the universe. It only proves that the universe<br>must have had a cause. But that logical conclusion leads us to wonder:<br>if the universe had a cause, *what* is that cause? The cause certainly<br>could not have been anything *within* the universe or even *the universe<br>itself*, since things can't cause themselves to come into existence.<br>This idea defies logic. Thus, the cause of the universe must be<br>something *beyond* the universe, something beyond all matter, energy,<br>space, and time. In other words, it must be transcendent (beyond the<br>universe), it must be immaterial (beyond matter and space), it must be<br>eternal (beyond time), and if it has created something so massive and<br>complex as the universe, it must be tremendously powerful and<br>intelligent (the Law of Causality tells us that an effect must resemble<br>its cause). Well, a transcendent, immaterial, eternal, supremely<br>powerful, and intelligent cause of the universe---what does that sound<br>like to you? As Thomas Aquinas pithily puts it, "This is what most<br>people mean by 'God.'"<br><br>Now of course, this doesn't tell us anything about *which* God exists,<br>or anything about that God. It simply is a logical proof which shows<br>that logically-speaking, a creator God must exist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
