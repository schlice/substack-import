<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [First of all, the concept of a personal thermonuclear<br>device is ridiculous. We already have the most efficient tool for<br>killing a specific individual available to us.\<br>\<br>Individuals do not have the right to kill mass quantities of people.<br>Governments sometimes believe that they do (or at least be able to<br>defend themselves against others who believe they do), which is why they<br>have tactical nukes.\<br>\<br>Since individuals aren\'t killing mass quantities of people,<br>thermonuclear devices for individuals do not make logical<br>sense.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
