<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>See, here's the thing.<br><br>All these women are out there campaigning for a sex strike until someone<br>brings *Roe* back. First, before I go any further, *Roe* is dead. That<br>law is now in the history books, just like *Plessy v. Ferguson* was when<br>*Brown v. Board* came along and overturned it. *Roe* is dead, and the<br>courts will never make it a right again. The people can, but the courts<br>cannot.<br><br>Anyway, these women and this sex strike. You see, they're out there<br>saying that we should have a sex strike because that'll make men relent<br>and re-enact *Roe*.<br><br>The subtext there is that they are implying that somehow, *men enjoy sex<br>more than women do. Women can hold out; men can't.*<br><br>The thing is: they're right. ***And feminism has been lying to them<br>about that for the past 50 years.***<br><br>For decades, feminists have been told that they are equal to men in all<br>things! Including their sex drive! Women can enjoy sex just as much as<br>men can! Women have been told that their sexual nature is no different<br>from male sexual nature---just as men can enjoy sex with no commitment<br>and even anonymous sex, so can women. Women, feminism insisted, have<br>been socialized into believing such sex does not accord with their<br>nature.<br><br>Ask women if their sexual natures are identical to a man's, and you'll<br>likely find that most of them will tell you that they are. They'll say<br>that their inborn sex drive is identical to a man's. In fact, the more<br>college-educated they are, the more they will deny that there is any<br>difference between the sex drive of the sexes.<br><br>But yet here they are, clamoring for a sex strike to force men to<br>relent, because somehow, despite what they've been told for the past 50<br>years, men desire sex more than women.<br><br>The implication here is huge, and the irony is so thick, you can cut it<br>with a knife. With regard to the sexes, **most of what women have fought<br>for has benefitted men and hurt women.**<br><br>Brainwashing women into believing that their sexual nature was identical<br>to a man's only benefitted men.<br><br>The hookup culture only benefitted men.<br><br>And abortion as a form of birth control definitely benefited men. Just<br>ask anyone who has worked at a Planned Parenthood or a crisis pregnancy<br>center how many young women showed up there *because their boyfriends<br>pressured them into being there*. Abortion on demand meant men could<br>have sex with as many women as they chose with zero consequences.<br>Abortion on demand meant men don't have to pay child support.<br><br>The irony is that the "right" that you've been championing benefitted<br>men more than it benefitted you.<br><br>And you bought the lie; hook, line and sinker.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Do you support the sex strike over Rowe v. Wade? How long do you think<br>it will take before the complete lack of feminist sex partners bring the<br>anti-abortionists to their knees (figuratively)?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
