<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The military is not a democracy because often, superiors have to give<br>subordinates distasteful orders. They may even have to give orders that<br>they have a reasonable suspicion might result in their men being<br>injured. Or dying. But those orders must still be given, and those<br>orders must be obeyed, without question. \"The discipline which makes<br>the soldiers of a free country reliable in battle\" is only achieved<br>when soldiers, sailors, and airmen follow orders.<br><br>We have a structure of rank, and a system by which lower-ranking<br>personnel are *subordinate* to higher-ranking personnel. This means<br>that when the higher-ranking personnel provide orders, the lower ranking<br>person is required by military law to follow them, unless they are<br>unlawful orders.<br><br>A democracy in the military simply wouldn\'t work.<br><br>That said, I heed the famously misattributed words of Patton: \"No<br>bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the<br>other poor bastard die for his country.\"<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
