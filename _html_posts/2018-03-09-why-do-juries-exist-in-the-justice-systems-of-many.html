<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The primary reason that we have a Sixth Amendment in the United States<br>is the same reason we have a Second Amendment: **resistance to<br>tyranny**.<br><br>Tyranny exists when absolute power rests in a single person. Thus,<br>governmental tyranny can exist when judges (appointed representatives of<br>the government) are the ones who make the ultimate decision in a trial.<br>This does not mean that all non-jury systems are examples of tyranny,<br>but they are examples of situations in which tyranny *can* exist.<br><br>Jury trials are the exact opposite of tyranny because it is *the<br>people*, not the government, who have the final say on what should<br>happen to you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
