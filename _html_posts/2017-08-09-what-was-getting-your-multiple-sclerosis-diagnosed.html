<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Well, it explained my symptoms. And it explained a few other things too,<br>that were unexplained from at least a year or more earlier.<br><br>Beyond that, I was numb for a while. I got my first MRI and got a call<br>back from the doctor the same day (FYI, that's never a good sign to<br>begin with). He said you need to find a good neurologist, because your<br>MRI shows all the signs of someone with MS.<br><br>I was numb all the way through that first appointment. I remember going<br>home with stacks of swag and literature from all of the drug<br>manufacturers and thinking to myself, "If they can afford this much swag<br>for someone *who hasn't even started on their drug yet,* they're really<br>fighting for my dollars because these drugs probably all do the same<br>thing, but with different levels of effectiveness." That much was true.<br>What was also true was the route of administration, as well as the side<br>effects, were all different. MS medicines have lots of side effects. And<br>the ones with the least amount of side effects have to be taken most<br>frequently.<br><br>I started on Copaxone within six months of my diagnosis. At that time,<br>the Copaxone formulation was a daily injection. It was easy enough to<br>add to my routine, but the inconvenience of needles was a bit much.<br>Traveling with my medicine was a challenge too, and I was on a fairly<br>full-scale travel schedule at that time.<br><br>Once I got through the numb phase, I experienced all of the other<br>emotions that anyone who has experienced a loss experiences: grief,<br>fear, anger, compromise, and eventual acceptance. It probably took me<br>about four months to go through the full range of emotions and come out<br>on the other side.<br><br>A few things that helped me: I know that MS is not fatal. It can produce<br>side effects which can be life threatening, but the disease itself<br>cannot kill you. And I have always held to the belief that *that which<br>does not kill me only makes me stronger*. So MS must, therefore, make me<br>stronger. It certainly doesn't make me physically stronger, but it did<br>make me mentally tougher. I experience things that my non-MS friends and<br>family will never experience, and I'm still standing and still fighting.<br>I also know that everyone has *something* that they have to deal with.<br>You can't always see those things that others deal with, but there is<br>always something.<br><br>I also learned that I have been given this disease for a reason. I still<br>don't know what that reason is, but I'm doing what I can, in forums like<br>this one and others, to help people who have been diagnosed, know what<br>to expect and to be able to work through it. And that's something.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
