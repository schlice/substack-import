<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Megabus failed to provide disability service for a wheelchair user.<br>How should I protect my rights?**<br><br>> I made the proper reservation for the mobility devices of my mom<br>> however the Megabus \staff\ failed to reserve the handicap space for<br>> us and he stopped the wheelchair from boarding. My mom just hurt her<br>> leg a few days ago. The \inability\ to use wheelchair on board makes<br>> her suffered a lot. The complaint email was not helpful. The \staff\<br>> just replied that they report the problem to manager then they never<br>> feedback. What should I do under this situation to project my legal<br>> right, like which organization should I ask for help? Should I have a<br>> consultation with some law office?<br><br>I am going to presume you took your Megabus trip in the United States.<br>If you did not, you will have to seek answers from an attorney in the<br>country in which you reserved and started/ended the trip.<br><br>If you feel you have a case, you should absolutely contact a civil<br>rights attorney in your area, preferably one who specializes in cases<br>involving the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). You stated that the<br>fact that she couldn't use her wheelchair on board caused her suffering.<br>If you can detail exactly how she suffered because Megabus failed to<br>properly account for her disability, then you may have a case.<br><br>I strongly suggest you contact a civil rights attorney in your area as<br>soon as possible.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.
