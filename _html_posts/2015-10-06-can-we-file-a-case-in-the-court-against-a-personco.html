<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You cannot sue a company because their UI is difficult to<br>use.\<br>\<br>First off, you voluntarily use their software. No one forces you to use<br>the software.\<br>\<br>Second, your discomfort is not an actionable offense, especially when<br>you affirmatively choose to actually use their software, and thus<br>consent to inflicting your discomfort upon yourself.\<br>\<br>Your legal remedy in such a case is to choose with your wallet. Don\'t<br>use their service. Use a competitor\'s service with a better UI. And if<br>a competitor\'s service with a better UI does not exist, I think you<br>just found yourself a business opportunity.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
