If you<br>  send a text in order to get some free thing (a program, a picture, a<br>  newsletter, etc), or because they promised things like cheap<br>  mortgages, credit cards, or debt relief services, they have your<br>  number and can start sending you unsolicited messages, *which may be<br>  legal because* *you* *started the transaction!* This is likely how<br>  her number made it on to someone's list.<br>- Treat your cell phone number like it is protected personal<br>  information. You don't give your Social Security number out to anyone;<br>  don't give your cell phone number out either. If you end up getting on<br>  a spammer's list, you may be on it for life. It may then be resold a<br>  hundred times. Unfortunately, the only remedy in that case would be to<br>  get a new number from your carrier.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-XAngv){.citation_index} [[Text Message<br>Spam](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=592a65&url=https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0350-text-message-spam){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ftc.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
