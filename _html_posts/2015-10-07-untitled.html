<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [*If your right in what you say, then how can states like<br>California and New York prevent you from buying assault rifles.*\<br>\<br>First of all, the \"assault weapons\" ban expired (rightly), but states<br>can impose restrictions to Constitutional rights if the restriction<br>furthers a compelling state need, and the restriction does so in the<br>\"least restrictive\" manner to the right.\<br>\<br>*Yes you have the right to a weapon, but there are and can be<br>restrictions placed upon it. Any gun owner who thinks he/she is to good<br>to take a firearms safety class has no business owning a gun. Again if<br>you can\'t be bothered with learning how to use, handle and store a<br>weapon, then you don\'t deserve or want it.*\<br>\<br>You must be cautious in mandating things like training, because doing so<br>can actually restrict access to firearms by making it so that only<br>people who can afford the training will be able to possess guns, and<br>that is tantamount to preventing an entire class of people (the poor)<br>from owning guns.\<br>\<br>There are a difference between rights and liberties. You\'re right that<br>rights can\'t be taken away, but liberties can be.\<br>\<br>In the United States, guns are rights. Like it or not, that\'s how<br>strongly the Framers felt that people should be allowed to possess them.<br>They made it a right, just like the right to life and liberty, the right<br>to keep and bear arms is right up there.\<br>\<br>*Guns are a liberty, they can be taken away if you\'re a wife beater, a<br>felon and numerous other reasons and you don\'t get the liberty of a<br>trial.*\<br>\<br>Guns are a right, but that right can be restricted if it meets a<br>compelling state interest. Protecting women from wife beaters is a<br>significant enough state interest that those accused lose their guns.<br>They get them back, but to protect women, the right is temporarily<br>restricted. Felons are adjudicated in court, so you do get a trial.\<br>\<br>*Yes the majority of gun owners are responsible and follow the laws, but<br>if you want to keep your guns and keep politicians off your back then<br>take the extra effort to show them that you are deserving of that<br>weapon.*\<br>\<br>To exercise a right, you do not need to show why you want to exercise<br>that right. You don\'t need to show that you deserve to exercise that<br>right. If it\'s a right, it cannot be infringed.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-do-British-police-officers-manage-to-stop-knife-wielding-suspects-safely-when-they-dont-carry-firearms-A-knife-wielding-suspect-is-likely-to-be-shot-by-North-American-police/answer/Samuel-Agboola<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
