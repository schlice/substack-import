<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So sorry Paul, I'm stealing your tagline. Here's *the rest of the<br>story.*<br><br>On the *All-In* podcast, which is a Silicon Valley podcast which<br>discusses all things tech, angel investor Jason Calacanis told Trump<br>that the U.S. needs to be able to legally retain more high-skilled<br>workers, a problem which has affected nearly the entire tech industry.<br><br>\"Can you please promise us you will give us more ability to import the<br>best and brightest around the world to America?\" Calacanis said.<br><br>\"I do promise,\" Trump said. \"But I happen to agree, otherwise I<br>wouldn\'t promise\... You graduate from a college, I think you should<br>get automatically as part of your diploma a green card to be able to<br>stay in this country and that includes junior colleges too.\"<br><br>This, of course, threw everyone into a tizzy. Like our questioner here,<br>people were asking, "What happened to *America First*?" And what will<br>this mean, specifically? Like, is it *any* person who graduates from<br>*any* college? What if you're an illegal immigrant who was allowed to<br>complete college under some crazy Federal grant?<br><br>The Trump campaign quickly responded, adding more details to Trump's<br>statement. They said that only after \"the most aggressive vetting<br>process in U.S. history\" would \"the most skilled graduates who can<br>make significant contributions to America\" be able to stay.<br><br>So Trump didn't really elaborate on the podcast about the idea, but his<br>campaign did. And it's not a terrible idea. If valid student visa<br>holders graduate from US colleges in fields in which we desperately need<br>to retain, it only makes sense to open a pathway to citizenship. This<br>encourages people to come to the US on valid student visas and graduate<br>into career fields which we want to retain, and only after we have<br>vetted them properly. This indicates that they are not here illegally,<br>and they have truly been vetted.<br><br>This, actually, is the right way to do immigration. How can I say that?<br>It's literally what ***every other first-world country on this planet<br>does.*** You are vetted before you can become a citizen, and part of<br>that vetting determines *what benefit you can bring to that country*.<br>Surely, no country willingly wants to import someone who would simply be<br>a drain on social resources. Don't believe me? Try becoming a Canadian<br>citizen. Really. Check out the website which discusses naturalizing as a<br>Canadian citizen.<br><br>So rather than following the Democrat playbook (see a small problem,<br>turn to a one-size-fits-all mega-solution which hurts more than it<br>helps), Trump is offering a way forward for the types of immigrants who<br>will benefit the United States to more easily become citizens.<br><br>It's an *olive branch*, and it's a way for Trump to appeal to those<br>single-issue voters who believe he is anti-immigrant. He's never been<br>anti-immigrant. He's always been anti-*illegal* immigrant. And he's<br>proving that he actually does care about legal immigration.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
