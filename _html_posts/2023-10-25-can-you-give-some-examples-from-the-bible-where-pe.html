<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Well, I can give you the obvious answer of the inverse: people who were<br>cursed for failing to follow their calling.<br><br>Just read the story of Jonah.<br><br>Jonah was told to go to Nineveh to preach the gospel. Nineveh, at the<br>time, was like Las Vegas. Sin City. Imagine being told to go to Vegas<br>and to preach the gospel. Yeah, not fun.<br><br>Well, Jonah was having none of it. He decided to try to run from God.<br><br>Didn't work out so well.<br><br>Eventually, when Jonah finally gave in and went to Nineveh, God took<br>care of him and it was a great experience. So in the end, I guess you<br>could say that Jonah was indeed blessed for following God's calling. But<br>it did not start out that way.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
