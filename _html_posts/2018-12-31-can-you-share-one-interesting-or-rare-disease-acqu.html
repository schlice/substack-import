Yeah, say that five<br>times fast.<br><br>PML is basically like multiple sclerosis (MS) on steroids. It is a<br>disease characterized by progressive destruction of the white matter of<br>the brain. And it's fatal. It has a mortality rate of 30--50% within the<br>first few months of contracting it, and those who survive are usually<br>left with permanent neuropathy (nerve death) and permanent neurological<br>damage and disability.<br><br>The disease is caused by the [[JC<br>Virus](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6a2af9&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JC_virus){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, named after the first<br>person to be diagnosed with PML (John Cunningham). The JC virus is<br>present in anywhere between 70 and 90% of all humans, but is normally<br>kept in check by the immune system. However, people on certain<br>immunosuppressant therapies, or people who are otherwise<br>immunocompromised, can potentially suffer an activation of the virus and<br>contract PML.<br><br>[Tysabri(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c18f05&url=http://www.tysabri.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="tysabri.com"}]{.qlink_container}, a drug to treat MS, has<br>been linked to JC virus activation.
