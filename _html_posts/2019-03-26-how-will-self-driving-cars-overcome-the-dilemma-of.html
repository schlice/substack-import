<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How will self-driving cars overcome the dilemma of a child stepping in<br>front of the car? Because most people would swerve into danger if there<br>was no time to brake but a self-driving car will choose the safety of<br>the driver as number 1 priority.**<br><br>That's not necessarily true. It depends on how the car is programmed.<br><br>The car may be programmed to protect its occupants above all else. Or<br>the car may be programmed to protect pedestrians above all else.<br><br>To solve this question, let's ask what the most complex computer that<br>drives cars currently would do: you.<br><br>*What would you do?*<br><br>You would evaluate the situation, and you would swerve to avoid the<br>pedestrian, placing yourself in harm's way to avoid hitting the<br>pedestrian.<br><br>If that's how we would react, there is no reason to believe we would<br>program a self-driving car to do otherwise.<br><br>It is clear, therefore, that self-driving cars will not eliminate<br>accidents, as this scenario clearly illustrates. But they should reduce<br>accidents as they reduce driver inattentiveness and distractedness.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
