<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Many of these things have been tried over the years. Most<br>often, they fail because they are ineffective against deadly force. Any<br>weapon which can fire as fast as a bullet will have as devastating an<br>impact as a bullet, because of the kinetic energy involved in propelling<br>the projectile. Tranquilizers take too long to work, are too variable<br>amongst people, and have little effect on people high on certain drugs.<br>And if someone has an allergic reaction to the tranquilizer, they can<br>still die.\<br>\<br>We need to determine why we are looking to replace the firearm. Are you<br>concerned that people are dying when they shouldn\'t? Or are you saying<br>that cops shouldn\'t be allowed to wield deadly force? Or are you saying<br>that cops don\'t have enough tools on their continuum of force to<br>effectively stop someone without so much of a potential for causing<br>death?\<br>\<br>Cops have a number of tools at their disposal that comprise the<br>\"continuum of force\" from least to greatest force:\<br>]<br><br>- Bare hands<br>- Pepper Spray<br>- Baton/impact weapon\<br>- Taser<br>- Firearm\<br><br>Are you proposing to make a tool that *supplants* one of these tools, or<br>is an *addition* to the bag-o-tricks that an officer has at his<br>disposal?\<br>\<br>If you are going to supplant (replace) an officer\'s firearm, the weapon<br>has to have similar characteristics. It has to be a weapon that:\<br><br>- fires as fast as a bullet. A .40 S&W Remington Golden Saber 180 Grain<br>  Jacketed Hollow Point has a muzzle velocity of 1015 fps. For<br>  comparison, a Taser dart flies at about 150 fps, about 1/10th of the<br>  speed of a bullet.<br>- has the stopping power of a bullet. A .40 S&W Remington Golden Saber<br>  180 Grain Jacketed Hollow Point has muzzle energy of 412 ft/lbs.<br>  You have to be able to knock down and stop large attackers who may be<br>  high on drugs and immune to a great deal of physical pain.<br>- Has the range and accuracy of a bullet. A decent marksman can hit<br>  targets at 30 yards (around 90 feet) consistently. Tasers are only<br>  effective at a much closer range (around 25 feet for the police<br>  model), so if you stand outside the range of the Taser, it\'s useless.<br>  Granted, this is a greater range than a baton or pepper spray, but it<br>  has to be something that is highly accurate at 30 yards.\<br>- is as reliable as a firearm. It can\'t have complex electronics that<br>  could fail. It should be a simple mechanical device to ensure that it<br>  can be deployed consistently, and has at least four 9\'s reliability<br>  (i.e. will work 99.99% of the time).\<br><br>Unfortunately, something that fires at 1000+ fps and with a stopping<br>power of 400+ ft/lbs is going to be a deadly weapon. Therefore, the<br>firearm is used as the method to apply deadly force.\<br>\<br>There are two main reasons why firearms are the preferred method for<br>applying deadly force:\<br><br>- *Firearms are the most reliable method to stop the act*. Firearms<br>  are simple, reliable, compact, and have the largest degree of<br>  certainty that they will stop the act. No other method has such a high<br>  degree of certainty. When you hit the top of the force continuum, you<br>  have to have something that will reliably stop the act. If your pain<br>  tolerance is high enough and the darts don\'t land correctly, then<br>  it\'s possible that a Taser will be ineffective. Cops who have reached<br>  for their Taser instead of their firearm have been killed by criminals<br>  who used deadly force. A firearm is the most reliable method to<br>  deliver force to stop an act. If you are performing an act that could<br>  cause great harm to the public or the officer, and you\'re refusing to<br>  listen to reason, and you won\'t stop, the officer is duty-bound to<br>  stop you through whatever means is at his disposal. Yes, causing<br>  someone\'s death is unpleasant. We never intend to cause death, but as<br>  you rightly note, being shot leaves someone with a high probability of<br>  death. However, Tasers can also cause death. They cause death far less<br>  often than bullets, but Tasers are less-than-lethal force that can<br>  still cause death.\<br>- *Cops meet deadly force with deadly force*. If someone comes at me<br>  with deadly force, I can respond with deadly force. At that point,<br>  does the tool that provides the deadly force really matter? And what<br>  does \"deadly force\" look like? It looks like any act that could<br>  cause great harm to the public or to the officer. An act that can<br>  cause great harm combined with a suspect who is belligerent, fails to<br>  follow directions, and is uncooperative are a recipe for getting shot.<br>  Understand that using a Taser leaves an officer or the public<br>  vulnerable to harm. It\'s not foolproof. If it doesn\'t work quickly<br>  and reliably, it\'s not useful as a tool to stop someone; you\'re<br>  still going to need deadly force. You don\'t meet lethal force with<br>  less-than-lethal force. That\'s a recipe for disaster.\<br><br>In a continuum of force where the upper limit of that force is deadly<br>force, a firearm is still the most effective method to deliver that<br>deadly force.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
