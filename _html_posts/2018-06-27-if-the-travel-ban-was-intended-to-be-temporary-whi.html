<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If the travel ban was intended to be temporary while the<br>administration worked out better procedures, why haven\'t they already<br>identified those procedures a year and a half later?**<br><br>The problem is not with US procedures. The problem is with the countries<br>with whom the ban has taken place.<br><br>The way visas work:<br><br>1.  Someone wants to visit America on a visa.<br>2.  Their consulate sends a visa request to the US.<br>3.  The US asks for certain information about the person wishing to<br>    travel.<br>4.  The home country sends that information to the US.<br>5.  The US reviews that information, and provides a yes/no on the visa<br>    application.<br><br>The problem with these countries: their process breaks at step 4.<br>They either never send information about the applicant, or they don't<br>send the information asked (usually basic criminal history information).<br><br>Additionally, not all countries treat all crimes the same, so things we<br>consider crimes are not necessarily treated as crimes in other<br>countries. So again, step 4 tends to be a problem if the home country<br>looks the other way on retribution murders, for example. Not saying any<br>of the target countries do, just an example off the top of my head.<br><br>When the host country is uncooperative, and when the host country does<br>not provide the information we need to make appropriate decisions about<br>visa applicants, we can't process those visas correctly. And if we can't<br>properly determine the intent of the visitor and whether or not it's<br>hostile to the US, the situation becomes potentially unsafe for us.<br><br>This is why we stopped travel from those countries.<br><br>That they are mostly majority Muslim nations is a red herring.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
