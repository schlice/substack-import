<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How can\'t license, patent, and copyright exist in socialism?<br><br>Because Socialism is the political philosophy which states that the<br>means of production, distribution, and exchange are owned or regulated<br>by the community. This also means that everything you produce is owned<br>by the community, not you. There is no private ownership of anything.<br><br>Therefore, since you don't own your creative ideas, you cannot patent or<br>copyright them. You cannot license out your ideas to others to use,<br>because you do not own those ideas.<br><br>In Socialism, everything is produced by the cooperative efforts of<br>people, so there is no "individual ownership" of anything.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
