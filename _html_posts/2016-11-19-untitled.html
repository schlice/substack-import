<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>For a nation as large as ours, a national popular vote would never work.<br>Especially with popular votes as close as ours, could you imagine how<br>painful recounts and charges of voter fraud would be, especially when<br>every vote counts so much? We wouldn\'t know who the winner is for<br>months!<br><br>And yes, a national popular vote would encourage voter fraud; all you<br>would need to do to influence the election is to concentrate on one<br>place where it is easy to get away with it, and you could easily cause a<br>several hundred thousand point swing.<br><br>The EC also helps to narrow down the field to just two candidates who<br>have a realistic chance of making it to 270. Could you imagine if you<br>had six or seven candidates with significant amounts of votes? You could<br>have a fringe candidate win by a very small percentage (like 5% or<br>less), and you\'d be right back into recounts and challenges. The EC<br>keeps the fringe on the fringe. With enough candidates receiving votes,<br>you could have a candidate win by the slimmest margin, which makes it<br>possible for a fringe candidate to actually win.<br><br>The only reason Hillary won the popular vote was California. Without<br>them, she would have lost by over a million votes. Do you really want<br>California alone determining who the next president is? Without the EC,<br>candidates would spend all of their time in New York and Texas and<br>California so they could get the most votes, and the rest of the country<br>would be ignored. Any state with a small population would become<br>invisible. The Founders put the EC in place to prevent exactly this from<br>happening. The EC did exactly what it was supposed to do: ensure that<br>the candidate has the widest acceptance across the country. Hillary did<br>not do that, which is why she lost.<br><br>So hate it you may, but it is the fairest system you can come up with.<br>It\'s not going away without a constitutional amendment anyway, and you<br>won\'t get 75% of states to agree to that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-protesters-just-accept-that-Hillary-lost-and-Donald-Trump-was-elected-fairly/answer/Chris-Donnelly<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
