<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [First, thanks for being honest about your question, and I<br/>understand it and it makes sense. As you well know, we have already<br/>given up many of our rights and we\'re quite tired of continuing to do<br/>so. But as you also know, every Right we have comes with an associated<br/>Responsibility, and we must be allowed to legislate common-sense rules<br/>that enforce those responsibilities. Finally, as you also know, the<br/>biggest problem we have with violence is not guns, but the mentally<br/>unstable people that wield them. Some of the things we must do:\<br/>\<br/>]<br/><br/>- We must find a way to balance privacy concerns and still be able to<br/>  determine reliably whether or not someone is mentally unstable. If<br/>  that means that mental illness is documented in NICS, so be it. But<br/>  this also means that a single prescription for Xanax doesn\'t label<br/>  you as \"mentally ill.\" This will require a major sea-change in the<br/>  mental health industry, something that is going to take more than<br/>  \"concessions by the pro-gun advocates\" to advance.<br/>- Similarly, we must do a better job with how we treat the mentally<br/>  deficient in our society. Do you know where the biggest mental<br/>  facilities are in this country? The three biggest mental institutions<br/>  in this country are prisons. Essentially, our legal system currently<br/>  treats the mentally ill as criminals, and usually the system doesn\'t<br/>  even kick in until there is a legal charge against them. If this does<br/>  not change, it doesn\'t matter whether or not we vaporize all weapons<br/>  with a single button-push, senseless killings will continue.<br/>- If we can accomplish these things, we must be able to repeal some of<br/>  the more stupid laws passed in the name of \"gun control\" like<br/>  magazine size bans and remove restrictions on law-abiding citizens<br/>  around the country owning and possessing firearms. States like<br/>  Illinois and New York which all but completely ban private firearm<br/>  ownership in any meaningful way should have their Draconian laws<br/>  repealed.<br/>- Gun laws should be normalized across the country. This quagmire of<br/>  legal red-tape between states is exactly why we created a federal<br/>  government in the first place. Federal concealed carry laws would be a<br/>  great place to start.<br/>- Allow our \"armed forces\" to carry arms. Some of our most highly<br/>  trained weapons experts in the world are disarmed while in the US. How<br/>  stupid is that? Do you think the tragedy in Fort Hood would have<br/>  happened if our armed forces were actually \"armed\"?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
