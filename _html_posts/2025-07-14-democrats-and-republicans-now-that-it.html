<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The thing is, God can use anyone to do anything He wants to do. So sure,<br>God could have intervened to keep Trump alive so that Trump could do<br>something which furthered His plan.<br><br>But God's plan may not be saving our country. It may not have even been<br>in Trump's best interest. God's plan is God's plan, and He's not<br>normally in the business of telling people His plans:<br><br>> *It is the glory of God to conceal a matter. --- Proverbs 25:2*<br>><br>> *Truly You are a God who hides Himself. --- Isaiah 45:15*<br>><br>> *No one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. --- 1<br>> Corinthians 2:11*<br>><br>> *The secret things belong to the Lord our God --- Deuteronomy 29:29<br>> NKJV*<br>><br>> *As you do not know the path of the wind, or how the body is formed in<br>> a mother's womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the Maker<br>> of all things. --- Ecclesiastes 11:5*<br>><br>> *"For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My<br>> ways," declares the Lord. "As the heavens are higher than the earth,<br>> so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts higher than your<br>> thoughts." --- Isaiah 55:8--9*<br><br>So Trump being saved is certainly part of God's plan, but the Bible<br>seems to tell us that it's unlikely that we're even going to know what<br>God's plan is.<br><br>But that doesn't make Trump a good person. God uses flawed people all<br>the time. Just look at the characters in the Bible. They certainly<br>weren't what you would consider "good people." David was an adulterer<br>and a murderer. Paul used to be Saul, a ruthless slaughterer of nascent<br>Christians. Solomon had a *harem* for crying out loud. But God used all<br>of those flawed people to advance His plan.<br><br>So it's clear that Trump was saved to do something which will further<br>God's plan. *What* that something is remains a mystery, and will likely<br>remain a mystery until we get to ask Him about it face to face.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
