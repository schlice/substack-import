  the abortion rate has dropped, and countries such as Netherland with no restrictions
  on abortion have fewer abortions per capita than the U.S.?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer: *correlation does not equal causation.*<br><br>From 1973 (when *Roe* was passeed) until 1990, the number of abortions<br>climbed steadily until it hit a peak at 1.6 million in 1990. Since then,<br>the number of abortions has experienced a "slow but steady decline."<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-73069cab637471977da8a0158bb34b1b){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-73069cab637471977da8a0158bb34b1b" master_w="541"<br>master_h="823"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(image courtesy* [[*Pew Research<br>Center*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4da312&url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2023/01/11/what-the-data-says-about-abortion-in-the-u-s-2/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="pewresearch.org"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br>There are a number of reasons for this, but primarily it has to do with<br>the proliferation of, and proper education on, contraceptive use and its<br>growing acceptance. In other words, the *need* for abortions has<br>decreased as people got better with, and more comfortable using,<br>contraceptives.<br><br>This is proved out when you look at abortion rates around the world,<br>and compare "developed" countries to "developing" countries. Guttmacher<br>has great data on this, and here's what they found:<br><br>> \A study\ found that between 1990 and 2014, the overall number of<br>> abortions per 1,000 women of childbearing age (15--44 years old) in<br>> developed countries dropped from 46 to 27, while in developing<br>> countries, it changed little, from 39 to 37, a nonsignificant<br>> difference. The study's findings appear in an article, \"[[Abortion<br>> incidence between 1990 and 2014: global, regional, and subregional<br>> levels and<br>> trends](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5a25f9&url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30380-4/abstract){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="thelancet.com"}]{.qlink_container},\" by [[Gilda<br>> Sedgh](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cc2bb9&url=https://www.guttmacher.org/media/experts/Sedgh.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="guttmacher.org"}]{.qlink_container} et al., published in<br>> 2016 in [[*The<br>> Lancet*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=437990&url=http://www.thelancet.com/){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="thelancet.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br>><br>> The researchers also found that although the global abortion rate<br>> declined slightly during the 25-year period studied, the absolute<br>> number of abortions per year increased as a result of population<br>> growth. Globally, the annual number of abortions grew by almost 6<br>> million, from 50.4 million in 1990--1994 to 56.3 million in<br>> 2010--2014. The estimated abortion rate in 2010--2014 was 35 per 1,000<br>> women. Broken down by marital status, it was 36 per 1,000 for married<br>> women and 25 per 1,000 for unmarried women. Some 73% of all abortions,<br>> or 41 million, were obtained by married women.<br>><br>> The authors also estimate that in 2010--2014, a quarter of all<br>> pregnancies worldwide ended in abortion. The percentage dropped in<br>> developed regions, from 39% in 1990--1994 to 28% in 2010--2014. By<br>> contrast, it changed very little in developing countries---from 21% to<br>> 24% over the same time span. However, the proportion of pregnancies<br>> ending in abortion increased in Latin America and the Caribbean (from<br>> 23% to 32%), South and Central Asia (from 17% to 25%), and Southern<br>> Africa (from 17% to 24%).<br>><br>> \"These trends suggest that women and couples in the developed world<br>> have become more successful at avoiding unintended pregnancies---the<br>> cause of most abortions---over the last two decades,\" says Dr. Sedgh,<br>> lead author of the study and a principal research scientist at the<br>> Guttmacher Institute. \"High abortion rates are directly correlated to<br>> high levels of unmet contraceptive need. Our findings indicate that in<br>> many developing regions, women lack the contraceptive services they<br>> need and are unable to prevent pregnancies they do not want to have.\"<br>><br>> When countries were grouped according to their abortion laws, the<br>> researchers found no significant difference in abortion rates for<br>> 2010--2014 between countries where abortion is legal and where it is<br>> restricted. In countries where the procedure was prohibited altogether<br>> or permitted only to save a woman's life, the abortion rate was 37 per<br>> 1,000, and in countries where it was available on request, the<br>> abortion rate was 34 per 1,000.\[1\](#OQwck){#cite-OQwck<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>Here's the pull quote: **women and couples in the developed world have<br>become more successful at avoiding unintended pregnancies---the cause of<br>most abortions---over the last two decades.**<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-OQwck){.citation_index} [[Abortion Rates Declined<br>Significantly In the Developed World Between 1990 and<br>2014](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d2a848&url=https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2016/abortion-rates-declined-significantly-developed-world-between-1990-and-2014){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="guttmacher.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
