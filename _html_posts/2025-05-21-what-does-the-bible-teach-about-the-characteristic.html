<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There's quite a lot! But you're not going to find it just in Ezekiel.<br><br>> *And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within<br>> you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you<br>> a heart of flesh. \-- Ezekiel 36:26 ESV*<br><br>What is being described here is a process Christians call<br>*regeneration*. Back in the day, we called it "being born again" from<br>Jesus' discussion with Nicodemus in John 3. Nicodemus was very wise, and<br>wanted to talk to Jesus about His earthly ministry, but he couldn't<br>afford to be seen by the other rabbi. So he visited Jesus at night:<br><br>> *Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the<br>> Jews. This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, "Rabbi, we know<br>> that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs<br>> that you do unless God is with him." Jesus answered him, "Truly,<br>> truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the<br>> kingdom of God." \-- John 3:1--3 ESV*<br><br>"Born again?" So what, I have to crawl back up inside my mother's womb?<br>Nicodemus was rightly perplexed.<br><br>> *Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he<br>> enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?" --- John 3:4<br>> ESV*<br><br>Jesus continued.<br><br>> *Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of<br>> water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which<br>> is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is<br>> spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'<br>> The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not<br>> know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who<br>> is born of the Spirit."*<br>><br>> *Nicodemus said to him, "How can these things be?" Jesus answered him,<br>> "Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these<br>> things? Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear<br>> witness to what we have seen, but you do not receive our testimony. If<br>> I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you<br>> believe if I tell you heavenly things? No one has ascended into heaven<br>> except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man. And as Moses<br>> lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be<br>> lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life." \--<br>> John 3:5--15 ESV*<br><br>Jesus says that to be "born again," to experience *regeneration*, one<br>must be born of "water and the Spirit." What did Jesus mean by that?<br>There are several possible ways to interpret that statement, but I think<br>the most compelling is this: being born of the Spirit is clearly a<br>reference to accepting Christ, but the aspect of water is less sure. The<br>most reasonable interpretation is that "water" refers to the spiritual<br>cleansing which accompanies repentance. But that does not mean that<br>baptism is mandatory for salvation. John the Baptist\'s ministry of<br>baptism happened before Jesus' ministry. In other words, faith in Christ<br>is an absolute requirement for salvation. The physical ritual of baptism<br>is not (cf John 3:16, 36; Ephesians 2:1--10; Titus 3:5).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
