<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If your intent is to shoot down a drone, or cause it to crash, then what<br>you're doing would be illegal. You do not have the right to cause a<br>drone to crash simply because you don't want it to fly above your house.<br><br>If, however, your goal is to simply ensure your privacy on your<br>property, I would suggest you go about it a different way. If you<br>instead erected towers at each corner of your property and stretched<br>camouflage netting across it, preventing drone operators from flying<br>below it or looking through it, you might get away with it. I imagine<br>you'd be running afoul of some local ordinance about construction of<br>posts above a certain height, unless the posts were no higher than the<br>maximum height of your house.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
