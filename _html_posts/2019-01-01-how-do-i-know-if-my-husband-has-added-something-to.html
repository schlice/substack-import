<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do I know if my husband has added something to my phone where he<br>can see what I\'m doing?**<br><br>There are two basic ways to detect and remove spyware from your phone:<br><br>1.  Run an antispyware application<br>2.  Wipe your phone and reinstall everything.<br><br>Antispyware: There is antispyware for your phone, and it can detect<br>whether or not spyware is installed.<br><br>- If you're an Apple iPhone user, install [[Certo<br>  iPhone](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=539f7d&url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/certo-mobile-security/id1274429896?mt%3D8){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="apple.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br>- If you're an Android user, install<br>  [Incognito(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8450a2&url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Dcom.dvtech.incognito%26hl%3Den_US){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>Running one of these antispyware apps will tell you if there is any<br>spyware on your phone, and help you remove them. It will also tell you<br>whether or not your phone was rooted/jailbroken without your knowledge.<br><br>Wipe your phone: Admittedly, this is kinda the "using a sledgehammer<br>to drive in a finishing nail" sort of approach to uninstalling offensive<br>applications, but once you do, you can be sure there is no monitoring<br>software on your phone.<br><br>In order to ensure that *only* apps you choose are installed on your<br>phone, you have to *wipe your phone.* I know, that sounds pretty harsh,<br>and in truth, it is a pretty ham-handed way to clean up your phone. But<br>two things will definitely happen: 1. your phone will run really well,<br>and 2. you'll be sure that there is no spyware on your phone.<br><br>For an iPhone:<br><br>1.  First, make sure you have a good backup, either in your iCloud or in<br>    iTunes. You will need that backup to restore your apps and data.<br>2.  Navigate to Settings \> General \> Reset<br>3.  Tap on Erase All Content and Settings.<br>4.  Tap on Erase iPhone.<br>5.  Tap on Erase iPhone again to confirm.<br><br>Your iPhone will wipe, and your installed applications from your last<br>backup will be restored. Be sure to check that entire list of<br>applications and don't install any apps you are unsure of.<br><br>For an Android phone:<br><br>1.  First, make sure you have good current backups in your Google Play<br>    account.<br>2.  In current versions of Android, go to **Settings \> General<br>    Management \> Reset**.<br>3.  Click Factory Data Reset.<br>4.  You will have to Confirm your choice and then enter your PIN in<br>    order to proceed.<br><br>Your Android device will reset, wipe and re-install its base OS. It will<br>re-initialize as if it was a new phone. Once you log back in to your<br>Google account, it will ask to restore your apps and settings. In that<br>list of apps, make sure they are all apps you want to re-install and are<br>not spyware apps.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
