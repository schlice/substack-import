<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer is no, you don't have to go to a church in order to be<br>saved.<br><br>But going to church helps you in your faith, in a number of ways:<br><br>- You learn more about the Bible, and grow your understanding about<br>  current events and what the Bible says about them. Pastors tend to<br>  pick a book of the Bible and then work through that book every week<br>  (We just finished Ecclesiastes, a very challenging book to work<br>  through). In doing so, you learn more about the book, and you learn<br>  more about how it applies to you in your everyday life.<br>- You gain *community* with other believers, which is vital to encourage<br>  you in your faith walk. The Bible does make it clear that it is<br>  important for Christians to spend time with and love one another.<br>  Going to church gives you that community.<br>- That community helps you learn how to pray, and can pray for you, and<br>  with you. Prayer is, of course, vital to your faith walk, so learning<br>  more about it can't be a bad thing. Having others pray with you, and<br>  pray for you, are immense comforts. Having someone who is there for<br>  you when you run into the big struggles of your life, and someone who<br>  is there for you when you have to deal with the little niggles that<br>  sometimes invade our daily thoughts is priceless, and it's really<br>  tough to do that on your own.<br>- Going to church holds you accountable. I know, you are perfect and<br>  never miss opening your Bible at least daily, right? I know I'm<br>  certainly not perfect. There are many days that I get way too busy, or<br>  my disease makes me too tired, and I end up not getting in to the Word<br>  like I should. God forgives us for that, but going to church helps to<br>  hold us accountable to embracing our faith and ensuring that those<br>  important messages permeate our hearts.<br>- Going to church provides you with opportunities to serve, not only<br>  other Christians, but your community. We know that works will flow<br>  from our faith, and while it's not necessary to have a church to<br>  enable our service, it does make it really, really simple.<br>  Opportunities for service abound at your local church, just show up<br>  with a willing heart and the church will absolutely find you a place<br>  to serve.<br>- And you can't ever say enough about what it *feels like* to be<br>  welcomed into a body of believers. If no one has ever welcomed you in,<br>  as if you were old friends, even though you have never met before, you<br>  should try going to church. If you don't go through your week<br>  thinking, "man, it's so invigorating and enjoyable to go to my church<br>  and to worship with other Christians who are so passionate in their<br>  faith! I can't wait to do it again!" then you are absolutely missing<br>  out.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Do I have to go to a church to study and worship with other believers?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
