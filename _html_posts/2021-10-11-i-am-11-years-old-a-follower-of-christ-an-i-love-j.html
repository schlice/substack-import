<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I am 49 years old, and I've done more bad than I care to remember. It<br>took me waaaaay longer to come to know Christ than it did for you. You<br>should count yourself lucky that you know Christ at such a young age!<br><br>Since none of us can go back and undo anything we have done, all we can<br>do is work from today forward. Remember the only things that God<br>requires of us, right now, to secure our salvation: repent and<br>believe. Right? Isn't that what is required of the believer? Repent<br>of (or be sorry for) your sins, and believe that Christ is the risen<br>Lord who died on the cross to pay for our sins.<br><br>So the question then becomes: *have you done this*? Have you truly<br>repented of your earlier bad things? And do you believe that Christ is<br>your savior and he died on the cross to take the punishment for your<br>sins?<br><br>If you do, then your debt has been paid, and you have nothing more to<br>worry about.<br><br>So how do you know? If you have truly repented of your sins and have<br>accepted Christ into your heart, you should start to see a change in<br>your life. You should start to see those old, sinful ways of thinking<br>and acting begin to fade away. In other words, the *desire* to do those<br>things will start to fade. You'll think about those things and say,<br>"Meh, I don't want to do that. I want to honor God and respect his rules<br>instead." Over time, it will become easier and easier to choose God's<br>way instead of man's sinful ways.<br><br>You've already made great strides being where you are at your age, and<br>I'm very proud of you! Now, *believe what you've said* and live by<br>that faith. Keep God in your mind. Be deliberate about thinking about<br>God when you wake up, and be deliberate about thinking about him before<br>you go to bed. Think about your love for Christ as you interact with<br>other people. It will get easier and easier, I promise!<br><br>Remember: God will never give up on you. He will never turn his back on<br>you. He will always love you. There is nothing you can do that will<br>separate you from his love. Now, you just have to accept it.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I am 11 years old, a follower of Christ, an I love Jesus so much, but<br>I've done so many wrong things and bad sins that I feel ashamed and not<br>forgiven. Please help? :(<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
