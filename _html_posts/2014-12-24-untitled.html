<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Are you saying that but for the testimony of Wilson, the<br>indictment would have been brought?\<br>\<br>You can only make the claim that the grand jury was rigged if it was a<br>slam dunk other than for the exculpatory evidence brought by the<br>\"defendant\" (as there is no defendant in a grand jury). Since that is<br>not the case here (forensic evidence was clearly exculpatory), you<br>can\'t state that the grand jury was rigged. You can state that the<br>process was flawed or skewed, but you can\'t claim that it was rigged<br>just because Wilson was called to testify about what<br>happened.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-do-police-officers-think-of-the-current-uproar-towards-the-lack-of-indictments-of-officers-who-have-used-lethal-force-against-unarmed-men/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
