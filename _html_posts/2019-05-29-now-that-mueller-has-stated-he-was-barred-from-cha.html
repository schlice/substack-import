<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Now that Mueller has stated he was barred from charging President<br>Trump, should Congress proceed with impeachment?**<br><br>Mueller didn't need to say this. It was in the introduction of Volume II<br>of his report. So for anyone who bothered to read the whole Mueller<br>report (yes, I'm looking at you, Congress), it was already stated in<br>there. But he re-iterated it again today. He didn't recommend charges<br>because you can't charge a sitting president. He said, specifically,<br>regarding the opinion he gave in the report:<br><br>> *First, the opinion \...\ explicitly permits the investigation of a<br>> sitting president because it is important to preserve evidence while<br>> memories are fresh and documents available. Among other things, that<br>> evidence could be used if there were co-conspirators who could be<br>> charged now.*<br>><br>> *And second, the opinion says that the Constitution requires a process<br>> other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting<br>> president of wrongdoing.*\[1\](#TNBjq){#cite-TNBjq .citation_link}<br><br>We've said all along that Congress' remedy is impeachment, not<br>re-investigating the Mueller investigation. Mueller made it **crystal<br>clear** today by re-iterating what's already in his written report that<br>if Congress wants to act, they must impeach.<br><br>If they want to open an impeachment inquiry, they should pass a<br>resolution stating so, and get to the business of impeachment.<br><br>So yes, Congress should either shit or get off the pot. Either impeach<br>him, or leave it alone and get back to making laws.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-TNBjq){.citation_index} [[READ: Special Counsel Robert<br>Mueller\'s Full<br>Statement](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f82f07&url=https://www.npr.org/2019/05/29/727889232/read-special-counsel-robert-muellers-full-statement){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="npr.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
