<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I feel like this is a disingenuous question because I feel like I'm<br>going to answer it and the OP will then say, "Well, why did X case go on<br>for Y years and this person was captured 3,245,233,184 times on video<br>selling drugs and still not arrested" but like the gullible person I am,<br>I'll answer it anyway. So be aware, if you respond to me with one of<br>these comments, I will delete it out of hand. If you're the OP, I will<br>report the question as not seeking genuine answers.<br><br>Evidentiary requirements can be satisfied with a single incident. They<br>are not satisfied in every case. You cannot generalize and say that<br>every case has enough evidence to be brought after only one recording.<br>There may be other factors that the DA is considering. But as far as the<br>question goes, since they are talking about cops having enough evidence<br>to make an arrest, one recording will suffice. Whether or not the DA has<br>enough evidence to make a conviction stick is another story. The police<br>will likely have enough evidence to make an arrest after one video<br>recording.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
