<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there a time limit after completing the questionnaire that you will<br>not be called for jury duty?**<br><br>Every jurisdiction is different. It is completely up to the jurisdiction<br>how they run their juror system.<br><br>Here in El Paso County (Colorado), we have a one day, one trial<br>system. If you are called for duty and you report, if you're not<br>selected to sit on a jury, you're done. Your obligation for the year is<br>over. If you are selected to sit on a jury, you will only sit on one<br>jury for that year. In this way, it's very clear how much time you'll<br>spend in the juror room.<br><br>On your day, we will often see all of the juries empaneled by about<br>10:30 am. If you haven't been called by then, you will normally be<br>released, and your service is over.<br><br>But that's just El Paso County. As I said, every county is different.<br><br>I suggest you contact the County Clerk's office for the county in which<br>you live and ask them these questions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
