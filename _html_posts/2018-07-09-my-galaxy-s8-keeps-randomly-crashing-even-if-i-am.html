This will wipe and re-install your<br>    phone, and your apps will download from Google again. Bear in mind<br>    that any data which is not stored in Google or Samsung Cloud will be<br>    lost; make sure you have good backups of any critical data.<br>2.  If the issue still persists after a factory reset, contact your<br>    carrier's Technical Support. Make sure you tell them you just did a<br>    factory reset, because that will be their first suggestion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
