<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there a principle of law that says that the House needed to use the<br>courts to coerce witnesses, that they needed to make a serious effort,<br>before declaring obstruction?**<br><br>Yes, it is the principle of Separation of Powers.<br><br>The House (part of the Legislative Branch) attempted to use subpoenas to<br>force the White House (part of the Executive Branch) to give testimony<br>and documents. While the Legislative Branch has subpoena power under<br>their Constitutional directive to be able to impeach, the Executive<br>Branch has Executive Privilege, which allows advisers to freely talk to<br>the President without fear that those conversations will leak outside<br>the White House.<br><br>Both the Legislative and Executive Branches have equal powers under the<br>Constitution.<br><br>The Judicial Branch must sort out whose privilege takes precedence in<br>any particular case.<br><br>Obstruction was a silly charge because the Executive Branch was<br>exercising its Constitutional authority to withhold privileged<br>information. The courts should have been engaged to rule on those<br>subpoenas (which is what happened in the last two impeachments), but the<br>House chose to not take them to court.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
