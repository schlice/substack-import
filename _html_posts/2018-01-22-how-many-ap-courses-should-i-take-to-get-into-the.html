<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How many AP courses should I take to get into the Air Force Academy?<br>What about to become an astronaut?**<br><br>AP courses are not required in order to get into the Air Force<br>Academy. There is not a set number of AP courses you must take in order<br>to be admitted.<br><br>The Air Force Academy admissions process looks at two major academic<br>performance indicators:<br><br>- your Prior Academic Record (PAR)<br>- your College admissions test scores (SAT or ACT)<br><br>Prior Academic Record:<br><br>> Your Prior Academic Record (PAR) is a measure of classroom<br>> performance based on a combination of *your rank in class* and *your<br>> GPA*. When class rank is not provided, the PAR is based on our<br>> evaluation of your transcript, school profile and senior year<br>> schedule.<br>><br>> To be academically competitive for an appointment to the Academy, we<br>> recommend completion of the following high school courses:<br>><br>> - four years of English (with a college preparatory class in writing)<br>> - four years of math (strong background in geometry, algebra,<br>>   trigonometry and pre-calculus)<br>> - four years of science (lab-based and should include biology,<br>>   chemistry and physics)<br>> - three years of social studies (to include a course in U.S. History)<br>> - two years of a modern foreign language<br>> - one year of computer study<br>><br>> HIGH SCHOOL CLASS RANK<br>><br>> Generally, candidates must rank in the top 40 percent of their high<br>> school class. However, the average of recent entering classes is the<br>> top three percent. Adjustments are made to the PAR for students<br>> attending unusually competitive schools with a rigorous college prep<br>> curriculum and/or where honors and Advanced Placement courses are NOT<br>> weighted in the school's calculation of class rank and/or<br>> GPA.\[1\](#EliGL){#cite-EliGL .citation_link}<br><br>AP credit is generally given when you have a score of 4 or 5 on your AP<br>exams, and that credit counts toward core course placement, the exams<br>for which you will take during Basic Training.<br><br>College Admissions Test Scores:<br><br>> Students may take the SAT and ACT as many times as they'd like. Only<br>> the highest scores will be counted. Your test results must be received<br>> by Academy Admissions to be considered for an appointment. When you<br>> register for the tests, request your scores be sent to the Air Force<br>> Academy. The SAT code for the Academy is 4830, and the ACT code is<br>> 0530.<br>><br>> Students who score below 580 verbal and 560 math on the SAT Reasoning<br>> and below 24 English/reading and 25 math/science reasoning on the ACT<br>> normally will not be competitive for an<br>> appointment.\[2\](#sjuxh){#cite-sjuxh .citation_link}<br>><br>> :::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>> ::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>> !(images/qimg-2f8bd5fbced0d5c337593164fec3ae3f){.landscape<br>> .qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>> master_src="images/qimg-2f8bd5fbced0d5c337593164fec3ae3f"<br>> master_w="393" master_h="338"}<br>> :::<br>> ::::<br><br>Make sure you visit the [[Academy<br>Admissions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60e33c&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} website to learn<br>what you need to do in order to be competitive for an appointment.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-EliGL){.citation_index} [[Academic Performance \| Air<br>Force<br>Academy](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=da52c0&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/the-application-process/academic-performance/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-sjuxh){.citation_index} [[Academic Performance \| Air<br>Force<br>Academy](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=da52c0&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/the-application-process/academic-performance/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
