<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are no solid statistics, because most states do not require guns<br>to be registered. I wish I could make the answer a little more detailed,<br>but there simply aren't any good statistics related to registered<br>firearms because there are no standards requiring states to register<br>firearms.<br><br>But I might ask you, to what end would register a gun? Registration is<br>not necessary in order to track "stolen" guns. Most gun owners I know<br>keep meticulous records of the serial numbers on their own firearms so<br>that they can report this information to the police should the weapon be<br>stolen. I gifted a gun to my brother, and within a week of him owning<br>the gun, it was stolen from the house he was renting. Because I had the<br>serial number, I was able to provide it to the police. The gun was,<br>sadly, never recovered.<br><br>But what good would registration do? What benefit is there to register a<br>gun? We don't register other major purchases we make. We don't register<br>steak knives, but those kill more people in domestic disturbances than<br>guns do. We don't register chain saws or axes. We register cars, but<br>that's mostly to ensure that the vehicle has paid the taxes required by<br>the state to maintain the roads on which that car will drive.<br><br>So I ask again: why register guns?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
