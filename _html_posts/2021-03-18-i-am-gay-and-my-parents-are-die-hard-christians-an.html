<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I am gay and my parents are die-hard Christians and are against gays.<br>How do I tell them?**<br><br>I'm going to add to [[Dan<br>B](https://www.quora.com/profile/Dan-B-1472)]{.qlink_container}'s<br>perfect answer about coming out (even though I probably should leave it<br>alone, but it's weighing on me) and address the other side of what you<br>said.<br><br>You said that "your parents are die-hard Christians and are against<br>gays." This statement is an oxymoron.<br><br>**If your parents were actually die-hard Christians, they would not be<br>against gays.**<br><br>Why do I say this?<br><br>- Show me where in the Bible it says to love your neighbor as yourself<br>  unless they're gay.<br>- Show me where in the Bible it says, about anything, to hate your<br>  neighbor if he is a sinner.<br>- Show me where in the Bible it says that it's up to you to judge people<br>  for their actions.<br><br>In fact, the central message of the Bible contradicts this. The<br>Gospel. The Good News.<br><br>What is that good news? *While we were still sinners**, Christ died<br>for us.* (Romans 5:8)<br><br>While we were sinners. *We.* Not you, not me, not him over there,<br>we. We are all sinners. We have all fallen short of God's<br>expectations for us. Every single one of us, including your die-hard<br>Christian parents. Not one of us measures up to God's standards.<br><br>Jesus laid out God's standards during his famous Sermon on the Mount.<br><br>> You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, \"Do not<br>> murder,\" and \"anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.\" But<br>> I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject<br>> to judgment ... You have heard that it was said, \"Do not commit<br>> adultery.\" But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully<br>> has already committed adultery with her in his heart. --- Matthew<br>> 5:21-22, 27-28 (NIV)<br><br>Wow. Anyone who is angry with his brother? Anyone who has ever had a<br>lustful thought? Doomed! We're all doomed! Me especially, I'm doomed<br>like a hundred times over!<br><br>Well, yes. *Apart from God*, we are all doomed. The point Jesus was<br>trying to make is that there is no way that any of us can meet that<br>standard without God. We are *all* sinners. But Jesus paid for our sins<br>with his death and resurrection.<br><br>And what are we commanded to do in the meantime?<br><br>> "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?"<br>><br>> Jesus replied: "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with<br>> all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest<br>> commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as<br>> yourself.' All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two<br>> commandments." --- Matthew 22:36--40 (NIV)<br><br>Love your neighbor. Not "Love your neighbor unless he is a sinner." Not<br>"Love your neighbor unless he is gay." Not "Love your neighbor unless<br>you disagree with his lifestyle." Love your neighbor. I see a period at<br>the end of that sentence, not a comma. There is no but. Just love.<br><br>Your parents should love you, period. Because unless I missed it, that's<br>what the Bible commands.<br><br>And I'll be so bold as to say that if they don't love you because you<br>are gay, they are not the Christians they believe themselves to be.<br><br>I am Christian. And I love you.<br><br>Period.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
