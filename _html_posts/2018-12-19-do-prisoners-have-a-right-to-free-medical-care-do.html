Do retired people on<br>Social Security & Medicare have a right to free medical care? Should<br>prisoners have rights that people who chose not to break any laws ever<br>are denied?**<br><br>I see what you did there. You asked three questions and tried to make it<br>like a logic problem.<br><br>You said, in other words:<br><br>- Prisoners have a right to free medical care.<br>- Retired people on Social Security and Medicare routinely have<br>  treatment denied because of a lack of coverage.<br>- Is it right that prisoners (who have broken the law) don't get denied<br>  coverage but retirees do?<br><br>Your argument starts from a fundamentally flawed position: **people have<br>a right to free medical care.**<br><br>In the United States, no one has a right to free medical care, as<br>medical care is not a right. It's also not a privilege. It's a business<br>transaction. And health insurance isn't real insurance either, it's just<br>a pre-payment plan with costs shared by you and your employer. You also<br>seem to claim that prisoners are never denied treatment, and this is<br>also not true. Many treatments available to retirees are simply not<br>available to prisoners, the most notable of these is quality mental<br>health care. \[1\](#QJPIC){#cite-QJPIC .citation_link}<br><br>With this understanding, how do prisoners receive medical care? Who pays<br>for their medical care? We taxpayers pay for prisoners' healthcare.<br>Prisoners cannot work for themselves, they don't pay for their own<br>healthcare, and they can't supplement their coverage. The state pays for<br>their healthcare and it is wrapped up in the cost of administering the<br>prison.<br><br>Who pays for retirees healthcare? **Retirees pay for their own<br>healthcare**. Their care is *supplemented* by programs like Medicare and<br>Medicaid, but those programs don't completely pay for their healthcare,<br>and like most health plans, not everything is covered. The difference?<br>Retirees can supplement their health plans with their own funds, or even<br>with supplemental insurance, sometimes called "gap coverage." Prisoners<br>do not have this option.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-QJPIC){.citation_index} [[Incarceration<br>nation](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=403bb9&url=https://www.apa.org/monitor/2014/10/incarceration.aspx){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="apa.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
