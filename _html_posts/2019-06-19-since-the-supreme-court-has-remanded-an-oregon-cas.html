<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Since the Supreme Court has remanded an Oregon case involving a same<br>sex wedding cake and a similar case recently, what can be concluded<br>about the original 2018 decision? Will it be reversed or further<br>narrowed in light of the new cases?**<br><br>From your own Wikipedia link (emphasis mine):<br><br>> \A\ case from Oregen, [[*Klein v. Oregon Bureau of Labor and<br>> Industries*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bc6744&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_v._Oregon_Bureau_of_Labor_and_Industries){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, had reached the Oregon<br>> Supreme Court before the Supreme Court heard *Masterpiece*.<br>> The Oregon Supreme Court declined to overturn an anti-discrimination<br>> ruling made against a bakery by the Oregon Court of Appeals, with the<br>> baker petitioning the federal Supreme Court to hear the case. In June<br>> 2019, the Supreme Court granted certiorari, and in a summary<br>> judgement, vacated the Appeals Court ruling and required the case be<br>> heard again in light of the decision on *Masterpiece*.<br><br>Essentially, the Oregon Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from<br>the Oregon Court of Appeals, which ruled against Aaron and Melissa<br>Klein, finding that they did discriminate in their decision to not bake<br>a cake for a same-sex wedding ceremony.<br><br>This SCOTUS ruling basically vacates the standing ruling by the Oregon<br>Court of Appeals, requiring them to hear the appeal in light of their<br>findings in the *Masterpiece* case. Essentially, SCOTUS is requiring OCA<br>to hear the appeal and consider the fact that the state may be acting<br>with anti-religious bias in its decision to fine the bakers for<br>exercising their religious preference.<br><br>I suspect that if OCA does not find evidence of religious bias in the<br>lower court's ruling, this case will be appealed again to SCOTUS, and<br>SCOTUS will rule exactly as they did in *Masterpiece*. However, I<br>suspect that OCA will view the vacating of their standing ruling as a<br>rebuke against the lower court's lack of finding of anti-religious bias,<br>and will admonish them to ensure an equal balance between civil rights<br>and religious rights.<br><br>If courts continue to discriminate against the free exercise of<br>religion, I suspect SCOTUS will eventually have to take another case so<br>that it can clarify the line between the free exercise of religion under<br>the 1st Amendment and discrimination under the Civil Rights Act, a line<br>which they have not clarified to date.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
