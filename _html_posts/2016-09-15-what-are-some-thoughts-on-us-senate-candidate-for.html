<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I love the ad. He shows that he knows what he's doing with a rifle, but<br>he didn't say he supported "universal" background checks in the ad. He<br>only said he supported "background checks so that terrorists can't get<br>their hands on one of these." This does not necessarily equate to<br>"universal" background checks.<br><br>Once again, as we have said a million and one times, every person who<br>has committed a mass shooting sans one has *passed* every background<br>check the government has thrown at them. Their guns were purchased<br>legally; no amount of additional background checks would have prevented<br>any mass shootings we have had in the US.<br><br>Perhaps he is worried about personal sales between people within the<br>same state, sometimes incorrectly referred to as the "gun show<br>loophole." First of all, it's not a loophole because that would mean<br>that someone is doing something within the confines of the law, but able<br>to achieve a goal outside the intent of the law. Private sales were<br>specifically allowed without background checks when NICS was<br>established. Private citizens do not have access to NICS, so it would<br>hamper all sorts of private transfers (including gifting and<br>bequeathing, which would be an unusual challenge in and of itself) if<br>you required every transaction to go through a background check. So<br>until the government expands NICS to the point where it can be publicly<br>accessible to anyone, having everyone do a background check every time<br>they do a personal firearms transaction is challenging at best.<br><br>Some states (i.e. Colorado) have already enacted rules requiring all<br>firearms transactions to go through a FFL dealer for a background<br>check\[1\](#DfYEh){#cite-DfYEh .citation_link}. Note that they have<br>specifically exempted gifting and bequeathing, but the law still has<br>problems. For example, during the fires and floods we experienced, guns<br>were transferred to family and friends for safe storage out of the<br>danger and/or evacuation zones. This is technically illegal under the<br>law. You can do a temporary transfer for under 72 hours, but that's it.<br>Local sheriffs have called the law "unenforceable," some refusing to<br>enforce the law at all. Of all of the investigations performed by CBI,<br>only 5% were for private party transfers. Clearly, we're not making an<br>impact.<br><br>Much like the 10-round magazine limitation (which just forces people to<br>drive to the State Line Store to purchase their PMAGs in Wyoming or<br>Nevada), the laws are just "feel-good" laws which have little to no<br>appreciable effect on criminal activity.\[2\](#IUWih){#cite-IUWih<br>.citation_link}<br><br>So while it's great that he supports "background checks so terrorists<br>can't get guns," we already have those. What exactly does he support?<br>The ad doesn't say, and it's a bit of a sympathy-bait straw man.<br>Possibly an effective ad to gain support, but doesn't say anything of<br>real substance.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-DfYEh){.citation_index} [[Universal Background Checks and<br>the "Private" Sale Loophole in<br>Colorado](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2d78a4&url=http://smartgunlaws.org/private-sales-in-colorado/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="smartgunlaws.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-IUWih){.citation_index} [[Enforcement light on Colo. gun<br>restrictions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=598fb2&url=http://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/2015/03/28/enforcement-light-colo-gun-restrictions/70616030/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="coloradoan.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
