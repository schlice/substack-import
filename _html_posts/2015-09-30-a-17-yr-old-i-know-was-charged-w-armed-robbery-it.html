<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The answer is that you may or may not be able to find out<br>the information about the trial.\<br>\<br>Contact the clerk of the court and provide the defendant\'s name and<br>date of trial, and as long as the verdict is not sealed, the clerk of<br>the court should be able to provide you with the verdict.\<br>\<br>Since the defendant was under 18, they may not have tried him as an<br>adult. If he was tried as a YO, his court records are sealed. But since<br>he\'s so close to 18, and he committed an aggravated \"top 5\" he may<br>have been charged as an adult, in which case his trial information will<br>be public.\<br>\<br>(The top 5 are murder, arson, rape, robbery, and<br>kidnapping)]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
