<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>That section in the Bible really isn't all that long, it's fairly easy<br>to read, too.<br><br>Here, I'll quote it for you, and I'll even highlight the answer to your<br>question. You're welcome.<br><br>> Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight and was full of violence. God<br>> saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had<br>> corrupted their ways. So God said to Noah, "I am going to put an end<br>> to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them.<br>> I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. So make yourself<br>> an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside<br>> and out. This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be three<br>> hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high. Make a<br>> roof for it, leaving below the roof an opening one cubit high all<br>> around. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and<br>> upper decks. I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy<br>> all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life<br>> in it. Everything on earth will perish. But I will establish my<br>> covenant with you, and you will enter the ark---you and your sons and<br>> your wife and your sons' wives with you. You are to bring into the ark<br>> two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with<br>> you. Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every<br>> kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to<br>> be kept alive. You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten<br>> and store it away as food for you and for them."<br>><br>> Noah did everything just as God commanded him. --- Genesis 6:11--22<br>> NIV<br><br>Note that I highlighted where the Bible says that two of every kind of<br>animal "will come to you." So Noah just had to build the ark, and the<br>animals would come.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
