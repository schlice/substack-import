<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What\'s the status of the eight senators from both parties who asked<br>Trump to explain by April 13 the "clear, substantial reasons for<br>removal" of the Intelligence Committee Inspector General Atkinson? It\'s<br>now April 14 and I haven\'t seen anything.**<br><br>The status? The Senators are still waiting for answers. Hopefully<br>they're not holding their breath.<br><br>The Senators have no authority to compel the Executive to explain his<br>personnel decisions. Just as the President has no authority to compel<br>the Senators to explain why they hire and/or fire personnel on their<br>staffs, Congress has no oversight over Executive branch staff decisions.<br>Trump could literally fire someone because he doesn't like how they<br>smell, and Congress has no authority to demand any explanation.<br><br>They can "request" an explanation, and if the President chooses, he can<br>give them one. Or not.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
