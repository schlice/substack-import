<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, there are no perfect people. The last time a perfect<br>person was on this planet, He was nailed to a cross.<br><br>Secondly, God is not looking for perfection. And if you're unsure of<br>the truth of that statement, see the first one I just made. There are no<br>perfect people, so God cannot be looking for perfection, because He<br>certainly would not find it among us.<br><br>God is not looking for *perfection*, but *connection*.<br><br>God wants to hear from you! He wants you to tell Him all about your day<br>and how you're feeling and what you're worried about, and He wants you<br>to recognize that *to fix all of that,* *He is enough**.* He wants<br>you to lean on Him and ask Him to forgive you, and to protect you from<br>evil.<br><br>But if you are like me and you need to be a little more formulaic about<br>what you should include in your prayer, here are five elements of<br>prayer:<br><br>1.  Give His name *praise*<br>2.  Surrender to His *purposes*<br>3.  Request His *provisions*<br>4.  Ask for His *pardon*<br>5.  Seek *protection* from the enemy<br><br>Where did I get this? *Jesus taught us!*<br><br>> One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of<br>> his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John<br>> taught his disciples."<br>><br>> He said to them, "When you pray, say:<br>><br>> "'Father,\<br>> hallowed be your name,\<br>> your kingdom come.\<br>> Give us each day our daily bread.\<br>> Forgive us our sins,\<br>> for we also forgive everyone who sins against us.\<br>> And lead us not into temptation.'" --- Luke 11:1--4 NIV<br><br>Jesus says first, praise His name. "Father, hallowed be your name."<br>Then, Jesus says we are to surrender to His purposes. "Your kingdom<br>come." Then, Jesus tells us to request His provisions. "Give us each day<br>our daily bread." Next, Jesus tells us to ask for forgiveness. "Forgive<br>us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us." Finally,<br>Jesus tells us to seek protection from the enemy. "And lead us not into<br>temptation."<br><br>The five elements of prayer come straight out of Jesus' teaching. Jesus<br>taught us how to pray. There is no need to stress out about it. Just let<br>it flow naturally. Remember, God isn't looking for perfection, but<br>connection.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
