<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You are the *sum total* of your experiences, good and<br>bad.\<br>\<br>There are plenty of things I am ashamed of, things that I regret, and<br>things that I wish were not a part of my story. But they are. For better<br>or worse, they are all part of my story.\<br>\<br>But they make up who I am. Good and bad, all of my experiences make up<br>who I am.\<br>\<br>Owning your shame is key. As [[Bren√©<br>Brown](https://www.quora.com/topic/Bren%C3%A9-Brown)]{.qlink_container}<br>says, shame demons can\'t survive in the light. So own your story. Own<br>your shame. Understand that it is your foundation, and embrace it.\<br>\<br>And try not to repeat the things you are ashamed of.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
