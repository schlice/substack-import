<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I have \$32,000 past due on HOA now they put liens on me and not<br>taking my offer. I told them I could only pay \$1,000 monthly. What<br>should I do?**<br><br>Get a lawyer.<br><br>Your lawyer and the HOA should be able to work out a payment plan that<br>is agreeable to both parties.<br><br>The HOA should do this on their own, but not everyone can be so easily<br>convinced to do the right thing every single time.<br><br>If worse comes to worse and the HOA will not negotiate, you'll have to<br>take out a loan for the amount that you owe, and then you'll be able to<br>pay your loan back over time. Otherwise, the HOA can foreclose on your<br>lien and sell your house to get the money they are owed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
