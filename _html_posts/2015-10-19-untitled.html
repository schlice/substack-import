<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [The Air Force eschewed the \"inside the boot\" method in<br>the late 90s because oftentimes, remains can be dismembered in an<br>aircraft crash. The boot seemed like a good place at the time, because<br>boots survived a fire (usually were the only article of clothing to<br>survive an aircraft fire). But more often that not, a violent crash left<br>a servicemember without his boots (and the feet that went along with<br>them), so putting the dog tags in the boots was forbidden.\<br>\<br>Aircrews are still required to wear both dog tags<br>today.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-are-military-dog-tags-and-who-uses-them/answer/Jeff-Kay<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
