<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>That is certainly one interpretation of Jesus performing miracles.<br><br>The answer, then, rests on your definition of "miracles."<br><br>Christians define a miracle as something which defies the laws of<br>physics. You actually defined a miracle as a "supernatural action" which<br>literally means "above the natural" or "outside of the natural." And if<br>God exists, and He exists outside of the laws of physics, then He can do<br>things outside of the laws of physics, such as creating an entire<br>universe and everything in it out of nothing.<br><br>In short, if God exists, miracles are possible.<br><br>So you now have two possible answers to the problem of Jesus'<br>supernatural actions:<br><br>1.  Jesus' miracles are attributable to the power of God.<br>2.  Jesus' miracles are attributable to the fact that our senses do not<br>    perceive reality.<br><br>Which one of these is more plausible?<br><br>Let's discuss the second one, the one you brought up. Our senses do not<br>actually perceive reality. Immanuel Kant actually proposed this idea<br>quite some time ago. He said that the structure of your senses and your<br>mind forms all sense data, so you never really know the thing in itself.<br>You only know the thing *to you* after your mind and senses form it.<br><br>To get a handle on this, look for a second out the window at a tree.<br>Kant is saying that the tree you think you are looking at appears the<br>way it does because your mind is forming the sense data you're getting<br>from the tree. You really don't know the tree in itself; you only know<br>the phenomena your mind categorizes about the tree. In short, you can<br>never know the real tree in itself, only the tree as it appears to you.<br><br>This is a pretty incredible statement. We're supposed to believe that<br>the average Joe Schmuckatelli on the street doesn't doubt what he sees<br>with his own two eyes, but supposedly brilliant philosophers do?<br><br>This slightly tongue-in-cheek question is actually more accurately<br>phrased as a *self-defeating logical claim*. It is self-defeating<br>because it violates the Law of Noncontradiction. Kant contradicts his<br>own premise by saying that no one can know the real world while he<br>claims to know something about it, namely that the real world is<br>unknowable! In effect, Kant says the truth about the real world is that<br>there are no truths about the real world.<br><br>Additionally, this is a logical fallacy known as the "nothing but"<br>fallacy, which implies "more than" knowledge. In essence, in order for<br>Kant to know that his senses are not actually perceiving the thing that<br>he's looking at, he has to be able to see *beyond* his senses to the<br>thing which he claims cannot be perceived by the senses. In other words,<br>Kant is claiming that we can't see beyond what our senses tell us, but<br>Kant is claiming to know what exists beyond our senses, without him<br>being able to sense anything beyond our senses. In other words, in order<br>for Kant to differentiate the thing in the real world from that which<br>his mind perceives, he would have to be able to see both. But this<br>is exactly what he says no one can do. He says only the *phenomena* of<br>the mind can be known, not the *noumena* (his term for the real world).<br><br>Clearly, since he is claiming to have knowledge beyond senses (which he<br>claims is impossible), there is no way we can rely on his information.<br><br>\<br><br>To that end, it is not even within the realm of possibility that the<br>physical world is just a concrete representation of our abstract<br>consciousnesses interacting. It's far more likely that our senses<br>accurately portray the world around us (otherwise, they'd be pretty poor<br>at their job), and miracles are exactly that: events which only God can<br>perform, and function as signs of God.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
