<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If there is a law in your jurisdiction that says that<br>public urination and public defecation is illegal (there is in most<br>jurisdictions) and the law specifies that for minors, the<br>parents/guardians receive the ticket, then there is nothing at all wrong<br>about it.\<br>\<br>For toddlers who are just learning to potty-train, sometimes they can\'t<br>make it to the bathroom in time. I get that. I\'ve been there. A police<br>officer has to make a judgment call about that situation. Is the<br>caregiver honestly trying to get the child to a bathroom and there is<br>simply none around (and the toddler \"can\'t hold it anymore\"), or do<br>they simply not care about the law and they let the child pee<br>wherever/whenever he wishes because he\'s a child?\<br>\<br>Are you asking if it\'s wrong-headed to have such laws? Normally, these<br>laws exist because of health/safety concerns. But the secondary concern<br>for non-toddlers is a charge of indecent exposure. Walking home drunk<br>and stopping to pee behind a tree and inadvertently exposing yourself to<br>someone could land you on the sex offender registry.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
