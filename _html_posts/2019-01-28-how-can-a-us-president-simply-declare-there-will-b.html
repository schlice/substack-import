<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can a U.S. president simply declare there will be an emergency<br>some number of days in the future, specifically pending the outcome of a<br>funding measure?**<br><br>I can only assume you're talking about President Trump declaring that<br>there exists a national emergency at our southern border.<br><br>The President can say whatever he likes; that alone doesn't constitute<br>an official declaration of national emergency. An official declaration<br>of a national emergency is made in accordance with the National<br>Emergencies Act. The National Emergencies Act essentially allows the<br>President to declare that a national emergency exists. What this allows<br>the President to do is to "short-circuit" a law, bypassing certain<br>checks and processes written into that law, in order to implement a<br>portion of a law or activate special legal processes or protections that<br>would normally have to go through Congress to activate. Note that the<br>process allowing a President to bypass a portion of a law using a<br>national emergency *is actually written into that law.* In other words,<br>*Congress already allowed the President to declare a national emergency<br>and bypass a Congressional check in the law that* *they* *passed.*<br><br>Presidents declaring national emergencies is not new, but you haven't<br>heard about it because the media hasn't told you. In case you were<br>unaware:<br><br>- Jimmy Carter declared two national emergencies, one of which is still<br>  active.<br>- Ronald Reagan declared six national emergencies, and none are still<br>  active.<br>- George H.W. Bush declared four national emergencies, and none are<br>  still active.<br>- Bill Clinton declared seventeen national emergencies, six of which are<br>  still active.<br>- George W. Bush declared twelve national emergencies, ten of which are<br>  still active.<br>- Barack Obama declared thirteen national emergencies, eleven of which<br>  are still active.<br><br>Here is the list of the 28 national emergencies which are still active:<br><br>1.
