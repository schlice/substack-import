<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Thanks for the A2A.<br><br>Regardless of whether or not your dad does have it, multiple sclerosis<br>itself does not cause death. In advanced cases of MS, patients can die<br>from complications surrounding MS (i.e. choking because of poor<br>swallowing, etc). But by itself, MS is not fatal.<br><br>With proper treatment, people with MS will have a similar lifespan to<br>those who do not have the disease.<br><br>Now, on to the disease itself. It is likely that MS will manifest with a<br>finding on an MRI, but it is not a requirement. However, a single<br>symptom is not an indication of MS. In fact, you cannot positively<br>diagnose MS with a single symptom and a negative MRI. You can call it<br>\"possible MS\" but his neurologist should be doing other tests to see<br>what else could cause paralysis attacks. There are several other<br>diseases and medical conditions which can cause paralysis. His<br>neurologist should be chasing those down.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
