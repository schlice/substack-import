<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Hiring a hitman is, at best, aiding and abetting, at<br>worst, conspiracy to commit murder, which is charged as harshly as the<br>murder itself. The thought plays not into it at all, as it is the act of<br>money exchanging hands that constitutes the overt action of committing<br>the crime of conspiracy.\<br>\<br>Verbalizing a Threat, or conveyance of a threat by other means is a<br>crime already. Making a threat has been a crime the whole time. It is<br>the act of conveying the threat through spoken words or through printed<br>or electronic means of conveyance that make it a crime.\<br>\<br>We don\'t need a new crime to supplement a crime we already have. It\'s<br>like making a new crime called killing when we already have crimes for<br>murder and manslaughter that cover the instances when you unlawfully<br>take the life of another.\<br>\<br>Hate crimes are generally modifiers to existing crimes. A hate crime is<br>generally charged more severely than the actual crime itself. And the<br>only thing we are determining is the thought, the attitude, behind the<br>person committing the crime. It\'s, in my opinion, a criminalization of<br>thought, and in all cases (until *Minority Report* becomes a reality) is<br>subjective, and shakily so: trying to determine what someone was<br>thinking based on actions.\<br>\<br>I just don\'t think it makes for good law.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Do-Americans-believe-freedom-of-speech-allows-the-right-to-speak-hate/answer/Jacob-VanWagoner<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
