<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'m really disturbed to hear that.\<br>\<br>I am not deaf, but I have my own disability to deal with. At least being<br>deaf, you know you\'re going to wake up the same way you went to bed. I<br>don\'t have that luxury. I may wake up and my legs won\'t work (had that<br>one). Or one of my eyes won\'t focus (had that too). Or I might not be<br>able to balance (well, there\'s always tomorrow).\<br>\<br>I am on the board of directors for my company\'s disability employee<br>resource group. We actively fight against this kind of discrimination,<br>which is why I find it so frustrating that this sort of thing is still<br>happening.\<br>\<br>I will do what I can to help, but that\'s not right.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-it-ever-okay-for-a-hearing-person-to-work-in-a-Deaf-job/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
