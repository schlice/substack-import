<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, states are indeed independent, but there are no<br>requirements for a US citizen to become a resident of a new state.<br>Residency rules are different for every state, and in some states,<br>simply spending a certain amount of time in the state qualifies you as a<br>state resident. In most states, you generally need to own property in<br>that state in order to be considered a state resident. A current utility<br>bill or some other form of state government issued ID (like a driver's<br>license) is usually all that's required to establish state residency.<br>Note you can only have a driver's license from one state, but you can be<br>a state resident in multiple states. For example, I can live on a state<br>border town and work in the neighboring state. I have residency in my<br>primary state because I own property, and I have residency in the<br>neighboring state because I work 40 hours a week there.<br><br>To that end, if someone "resides" in a state for a certain period of<br>time, or spends a specific amount of time working in that state, they<br>become state residents under that state's residency rules.<br><br>If a state wanted to prevent non state residents from living in their<br>state, they could do one of several things, including but not limited<br>to:<br><br>- Decrease the amount of time required before an out-of-stater becomes a<br>  resident, thus removing the problem<br>- Creating an "out-of-state tax" charged to non state residents, which<br>  is higher than the regular state resident tax rate<br>- Taxing businesses who employ people who do not reside in the state<br><br>I'm sure there are others, but this is all I could think of.<br><br>The problem with such a scenario is it doesn't make sense to discourage<br>people from coming to your state any way you can get them. When they<br>work in your state, they generate income tax revenue. When they spend<br>money at the store in your state, they generate sales tax revenue. And<br>if they're in your state long enough, they become residents and register<br>their cars and pay road use tax and property tax and all kinds of other<br>taxes. So for a state, it's counterproductive to keep people out. States<br>are doing everything they can to keep people in.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
