<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We know that time and space began to exist. The evidence for this is<br>abundant and growing. You can start with the Second Law of<br>Thermodynamics, and move to the expanding universe, the radiation echo<br>from the Big Bang, galaxy seeds, and Einstein's Theory of General<br>Relativity, among many others, and you can see that **all time, all<br>space, all energy and all matter** began at a single point.<br><br>The Law of Causality tells us that everything which begins to exist has<br>a cause. The universe, from all of the evidence we have today, began to<br>exist. Therefore, the universe had a cause.<br><br>Something caused the universe to come into existence. And because that<br>something existed before the universe did, that something must be<br>*outside* of the universe. It must be outside of time (timeless),<br>outside of space and matter (immaterial), and outside of energy<br>(omnipotent). And in order to create as massively complex a universe as<br>it did, it must be extremely intelligent.<br><br>So the cause of the universe, therefore, is timeless, immaterial,<br>omnipotent and incredibly intelligent. That "thing," the eternal,<br>immaterial, omnipotent, intelligent cause of the universe, is what most<br>people refer to as "God."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
