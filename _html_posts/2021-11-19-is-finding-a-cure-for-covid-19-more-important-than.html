Connecticut*) **can be<br>eliminated if the need is great enough.**<br><br>We can *force* you to get a vaccine against your will. I'm old enough to<br>remember "my body, my choice." Not any more, pumpkin. Your body, MY<br>CHOICE. You don't get to choose what you put in your body, the State<br>does.<br><br>And yes, it's "slippery slope thinking," but if it's *this easy* to<br>eliminate a Constitutional right, what other Constitutional rights are<br>easy to eliminate? You know, like that pesky right to free speech. We<br>need free and fair elections, we must have information distributed by<br>the State only to ensure that. And guns? Only the police should have<br>those. Well, and bad guys too, but that makes it easy to tell who is a<br>bad guy. If you have a gun and you're not a police officer, you're a bad<br>guy. See? If we just eliminate your rights, things get so simple!<br><br>And by the way, there is no "cure" for COVID-19. We will never get to<br>100% vaccination. The virus will become endemic, just like Influenza. It<br>becomes more virulent, but less dangerous. You'll get a fever, chills,<br>sniffles, body aches, etc., and that's about it. We'll get a combined<br>flu + COVID shot every year for perpetuity. And you can still not get<br>the shot, and still risk getting the flu or COVID. And life will go on.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is finding a cure for Covid-19 more important than the United States<br>Bill of Rights or even the U.S. Constitution?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
