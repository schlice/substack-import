<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [That\'s not true at all. Android phones are more prone to<br>viruses because Google has fewer controls on what apps end up in the<br>Google Play store. There has been more than one occasion when a<br>malicious app has ended up in the Google Play store and has been<br>distributed.\<br>\<br>The Apple App Store has much tighter quality controls around the apps<br>that get approved for their store.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
