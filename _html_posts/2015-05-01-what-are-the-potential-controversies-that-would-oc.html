<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If we get into a scenario where we can genetically modify<br>humans and make them \"perfect,\" then only perfect people would be<br>allowed to live. Imperfections would be eradicated from the gene pool.<br>Anyone found with a genetic imperfection would be terminated. Life would<br>not be valued for humanity, it would be valued for perfection.\<br>\<br>If you can\'t imagine what this would look like, read \"Brave New<br>World\" by Aldous Huxley. I first read this book in high school, and it<br>so touched me that I\'ve re-read it at least annually. This book is a<br>classic, and it discusses exactly what you have asked. So if you really<br>want to know what could happen if we allow genetic modification of<br>humans, read that book.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
