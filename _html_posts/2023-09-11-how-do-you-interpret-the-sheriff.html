<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Pointing a gun at someone is a felony. In Florida, [[Florida Statute<br>ยง<br>784.021](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6de044&url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode%3DDisplay_Statute%26URL%3D0700-0799/0784/0784.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="state.fl.us"}]{.qlink_container} defines aggravated assault<br>as "an assault with a deadly weapon without intent to kill or with an<br>intent to commit a felony." At a very minimum, pointing a gun at someone<br>is an aggravated assault.<br><br>If someone points a gun at me, I would be in fear for my life. In order<br>to use deadly force, someone must be engaging in a felony which places<br>me in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm.<br><br>I believe, therefore, that if someone is pointing a gun at me, I am<br>within my rights to use whatever force I can to stop that felony, up to<br>and including deadly force.<br><br>So if the Sheriff (I assume you're talking about [[the case out of<br>Flagler<br>County](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=31e697&url=https://www.news-journalonline.com/story/news/crime/2023/05/30/flagler-sheriff-florida-man-threatens-to-shoot-woman-in-driveway-rage/70270332007/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="news-journalonline.com"}]{.qlink_container} just a few<br>months ago) said that if someone points a gun at you and cocks it you<br>can shoot them, he's referring to the fact that you can defend yourself<br>against an aggravated assault with a deadly weapon with deadly force.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
