<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [First of all, you can\'t \"make\" someone fall in love<br>with you, Godly or otherwise. It will happen when it happens and not a<br>second sooner.\<br>\<br>In order to find the person you\'re looking for, make sure you\'re<br>looking in the place you want to find the person you\'re looking for.\<br>\<br>You may be pretty active in the church, but are you active in the place<br>where single men are expecting to find single women? Are you active in<br>the singles groups in your church? I attend a Christian church, and we<br>have singles groups that do monthly social functions.\<br>\<br>What about your friends? I assume they are churchgoers as well; do they<br>go to other social functions with similarly-churched people? Have you<br>tried attending any of those functions?\<br>\<br>And finally, to add a more Christian bent to my answer, have you asked<br>God about this? God will bring the right person into your life when He<br>is ready to do so. Telling God that you want Him to bring you someone<br>*right now* is the height of arrogance. Who are we to place demands on<br>God? When God is ready, He will place the right man in your life.<br>Because the timetable is not up to us, is it?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
