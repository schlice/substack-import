<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Sanctuary cities notwithstanding, I can see lawsuits<br>against the city for harm caused by specific people failing for that<br>reason; lawsuits against police departments alleging specific harms<br>caused by police action or inaction have failed for similar reasons.\<br>\<br>The case law has shown that police have a general duty to protect<br>citizens, but the police do not have a specific duty to protect any<br>individual unless special arrangement has been made beforehand, or the<br>police have you in a custodial situation in which you cannot protect<br>yourself.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
