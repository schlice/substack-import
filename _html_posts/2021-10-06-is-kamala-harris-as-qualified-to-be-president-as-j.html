You<br>have to be a natural-born citizen who is at least 35 years old, and who<br>has been a resident in the US for at least 14 years.<br><br>So from that respect, yes she is qualified.<br><br>But I suspect you are asking about the "other" qualification, the one<br>where you are fully capable of doing the job. And this one is not a<br>simple yes/no, but is a matter of opinion.<br><br>In that respect, we really don't fully know. She was a Senator from<br>California, and was the Attorney General for California as well. Does<br>that provide you with the requisite leadership training to be President?<br>Does it provide you with enough understanding to successfully execute<br>the duties of the office of the President?<br><br>I think that most would argue that it does not. I would say that a<br>governor of a state would have the most closely applicable experience to<br>be President. Or, perhaps, a CEO of a major corporation (but that is<br>questionable and depends very much on the person). We have elected<br>Senators and Congressional representatives to the Presidency, so it<br>seems that people believe that serving in Congress is appropriate<br>qualification. We have also frequently elected military veterans, so<br>clearly the people believe that military leadership is a good quality to<br>have.<br><br>*Could* she be a good president? Tough to say. But in my opinion, based<br>on her actions as a Senator and as AG, I'd say that she would govern<br>from the *far* left, probably about as far left as Biden himself. And I<br>don't think that *any* President whose governing philosophy includes<br>*far* anything makes a good President.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is Kamala Harris as qualified to be president as Joe Biden?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
