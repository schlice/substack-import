<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I was born with a disability and in order to have ssi I can\'t have<br>any money to my name. Well my grandma started something for mine and my<br>sisters college fund thats been growing. Since I legally can\'t have<br>money it would be a sin to use it right?**<br><br>First of all, it sounds like you're trying to connect doing something<br>which is legal and doing something which may be a sin.<br><br>It's important to remember that not all illegal things are sinful, and<br>not all sinful things are illegal.<br><br>Simply using money is not sinful. Using money you *know* you should not<br>be allowed to have, but doing it anyway, is an attempt to defraud, and<br>would indeed be sinful.<br><br>In order to qualify for SSI, you need to have less than \$2000 in<br>deemable assets. This is because these resources are calculated in order<br>to determine whether or not you qualify for SSI. However, not all<br>resources count towards SSI qualification. Some of the resources which<br>are exempt from SSI calculation include:<br><br>- The home you live in and the property it is on<br>- Burial spaces for you and your spouse<br>- Your household goods and personal effects<br>- Money set aside specifically for burial (up to \$1500 per person)<br>- Life insurance policies with a face value of \$1500 or less<br>- One vehicle, regardless of income, provided you use it to transport<br>  yourself or your spouse<br>- retroactive SSI or Social Security benefits for up to nine months<br>  after you receive them (including payments received in installments)<br>- grants, scholarships, fellowships, or **gifts set aside for<br>  educational expenses** for 9 months after receipt<br>- **up to \$100,000 of funds in an Achieving a Better Life Experience<br>  (ABLE) account established through a State ABLE<br>  program**\[1\](#lpDiT){#cite-lpDiT .citation_link}<br><br>So to answer your specific questions:<br><br>- It is legal for your grandmother to put money aside for you. You don't<br>  own the assets, so they do not count as deemable assets.<br>- It is legal for you to receive gifts from the money your grandmother<br>  set aside for you; so long as you spend the money on education and you<br>  spend it within 9 months of receiving it, it does not count toward<br>  your SSI calculation<br>- if your grandmother deposits her savings into a state ABLE account, it<br>  can be in your name and it can contain up to \$100,000 before being<br>  counted towards SSI.<br><br>Here's some more information about [[state ABLE<br>accounts](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=431974&url=https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/spotlights/spot-able.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ssa.gov"}]{.qlink_container} and more information about<br>[[SSI benefits and deemable<br>assets](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=294c11&url=https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-resources-ussi.htm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ssa.gov"}]{.qlink_container} from the Social Security<br>Administration.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-lpDiT){.citation_index} [[Understanding SSI - SSI<br>Resources](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=294c11&url=https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-resources-ussi.htm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ssa.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
