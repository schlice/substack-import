<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Bible was never intended to be a political manifesto. There are<br>plenty of other human rights violations that the Bible also does not<br>condemn, but that wasn't the purpose of the Bible.<br><br>The other thing to consider is that Americans tend to look at slavery in<br>the past, because we successfully freed the black slaves in the American<br>South. **But slavery still exists today, in the United States and around<br>the world.** It's estimated that over 27 million people in the world are<br>victims of slavery today: forced labor, sex trade, inheritable property,<br>etc.<br><br>So why does the Bible not speak out strongly against slavery? Why does<br>the Bible, in fact, seem to support the practice of human slavery?<br><br>The Bible never demanded that every slave owner immediately emancipate<br>their slaves. Instead, the apostles gave instructions to slave owners to<br>act in godly ways *within the existing social system.*<br><br>> Masters, do the same to them \treat them with goodwill\, and stop<br>> your threatening, knowing that he who is both their Master and yours<br>> is in heaven, and that there is no partiality with him. \-- Ephesians<br>> 6:9 ESV<br>><br>> Masters, treat your bondservants justly and fairly, knowing that you<br>> also have a Master in heaven. \-- Colossians 4:1 ESV<br><br>So why didn't the Bible writers immediately command slave owners to<br>emancipate their slaves?<br><br>*They didn't need to.*<br><br>God's Word affects people *individually*. Those changed people, in turn,<br>go on to change the lives of their families, their communities, and<br>eventually, their nations. Christianity is not a political movement, but<br>over time, it naturally affects political policy. In countries where<br>Christianity spread, the abolition of slavery was often influenced by<br>the actions of converted individuals.<br><br>The Bible does contain the foundations of what people need to end<br>slavery: the truth that all men are created by God and made in His image<br>(Genesis 1:27), condemnation towards those who kidnap and sell a person<br>(Exodus 21:16; cf. 1 Timothy 1:8--10), and that a slave can truly be "a<br>brother in the Lord" (Philemon 1:16). Born-again Christians used these<br>truths to influence their communities and eventually bring slavery to an<br>end.<br><br>But evil still exists, and so the slave trade is alive and well, despite<br>the efforts of Christians worldwide. The fight is not over until He<br>destroys evil once and for all.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
