<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The use of force was legal. The police ordered the man<br>away from the house and he refused to comply. Yes, the homeowner was<br>trying to save his home. But the article is clearly biased against law<br>enforcement, so you don\'t see the other side of the story from the<br>people charged with ensuring public safety.\<br>\<br>The situation was unsafe. While the homeowner has the right to protect<br>his home, what would have been the outcome if the police allowed the man<br>to stand there and he got burned, or worse? Again, the police would have<br>been sued for not keeping him safe. Sometimes, the police have to<br>protect you *even if you don\'t want to be protected.*\<br>\<br>Also, it\'s the firefighters job to protect the property, as well as<br>neighboring properties. Even though they had not yet arrived, anyone<br>with fire experience knows that a property which is that far involved in<br>a fire won\'t be mitigated by a garden hose.\<br>\<br>Fires are tragic property losses. No need to compound them by adding<br>threatening the loss of life as well.\<br>\<br>(EDIT) I didn\'t answer the second part of the question, which was how<br>would this apply to suicide prevention. Suicide intervention is a<br>completely different animal, as occasionally the suicidal person will<br>\"force the hand\" of the police by intentionally threatening the life<br>of an officer to get him to use deadly force against him, which was his<br>goal from the start. This action is colloquially known as \"suicide by<br>cop.\"\<br>\<br>Police need to be especially tactful and cautious if they encounter an<br>individual who is prepared to take his own life, as often these<br>situations are very volatile as the victim is generally not in a stable<br>frame of mind. Therefore, actions which might seem completely illogical<br>to you would seem totally normal to the victim, and so a situation like<br>this can get out of hand very quickly.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
