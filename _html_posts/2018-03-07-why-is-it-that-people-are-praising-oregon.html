<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is it that people are praising Oregon\'s \"New\" gun law, when<br>many states like Colorado have had this law for decades? Isn\'t it<br>federal law that domestic abuse is a reason to fail a background<br>check?**<br><br>Looks like a little media sensationalism here. Clearly, it's only the<br>first "new" law since the Parkland shooting, but you're right, Colorado<br>has barred DV convicts from owning guns. The new Oregon law also bars<br>people who are convicted of "stalking" from owning guns. M'kay.<br>Anywaaaaay, the new feature of the law allows Oregon to **seize existing<br>guns** from people convicted of domestic violence or stalking.<br><br>Which makes our point about the second question: **Isn\'t it federal law<br>that domestic abuse is a reason to fail a background check?**<br><br>Indeed it is. Under 18 USC ยง 922 (d)(9), you fail a background check<br>if you've been convicted of DV.<br><br>But what if you already own a gun, you are unaffected. You simply can't<br>buy a new gun.<br><br>Oregon's law allows them to seize existing guns from those convicted of<br>domestic violence or stalking, just as Colorado does (minus the stalking<br>thing).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
