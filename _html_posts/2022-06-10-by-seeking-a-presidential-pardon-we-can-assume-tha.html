<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> By seeking a Presidential pardon we can assume that you committed a<br>> crime and you know you did?<br><br>Actually, maybe.<br><br>In the landmark case *Burdick v. United States, a* grand jury was<br>investigating whether any Treasury Department employees were leaking<br>information to the press. George Burdick, city editor of the New York<br>Tribune, plead the Fifth and refused to reveal the source of his<br>information. He was handed a pardon by US President Woodrow Wilson in a<br>bid to force him to testify (because the Fifth Amendment does not apply<br>if the person is immune from prosecution). Burdick refused to accept the<br>pardon, and refused to testify. He was fined \$500 and thrown in jail<br>until he testified.<br><br>The Supreme Court ruled that a pardon can be rejected. But of note to<br>this question, the opinion in that case stated that a pardon carries "an<br>imputation of guilt and acceptance of a confession of it." In other<br>words, the Supreme Court, in the text of their opinion on *Burdick,*<br>stated that accepting a pardon can be viewed as an acceptance of guilt<br>and a confession, since rejecting a pardon is a way to retain your Fifth<br>Amendment rights against self-incrimination.<br><br>However, it is important to note that whether or not accepting a pardon<br>is an admission of guilt has never actually been decided by any court.<br>It's simply written in the text of the opinion in a case which was<br>unrelated to that question.<br><br>> Will we find out the names of the Congressmen who sought pardons from<br>> Trump and will they be criminally investigated?<br><br>No. And whether or not they will be criminally investigated will hinge<br>on whether or not they are alleged to have committed a crime, not<br>whether or not they asked for a pardon. *Seeking* a pardon is different<br>from *receiving* a pardon, which is also different from *accepting* a<br>pardon. Seeking a pardon is not an admission of guilt. Receiving a<br>pardon is not an admission of guilt. *Accepting* a pardon *may* be an<br>admission of guilt.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
