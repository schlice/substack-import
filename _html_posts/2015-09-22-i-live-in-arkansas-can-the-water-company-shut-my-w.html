<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Unless they say they sent you certified mail, it\'s<br>certainly possible that letters they sent you never reached you.\<br>\<br>Did you pay your bill on time, every month? If you have records that<br>show your water bills that you paid every month and the checks you wrote<br>and the cancelled checks that came back to you, you can go to the water<br>company and fight the shutoff, and make them credit you for the time<br>they had your water shut off. But you have to show that you paid your<br>bill, and that they accepted your check. You can work with your bank to<br>confirm that the checks you mailed to the water company were cashed.\<br>\<br>If you don\'t have any records that show you paid your water bill on<br>time, every month, it\'s their word against yours. You can claim you<br>never received a notice that you haven\'t paid your bill. They can claim<br>they never received a payment. Who wins in that case? The one providing<br>the service for a fee. You don\'t pay, you don\'t get<br>service.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
