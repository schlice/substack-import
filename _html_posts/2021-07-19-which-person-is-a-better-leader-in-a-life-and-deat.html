<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>False equivalence.<br><br>The assumption underlying your question (which isn't really a question,<br>but instead is a statement that atheists possess logic while theists do<br>not) is that all theists are dispossessed of any ability to think<br>logically or critically and act on that assumption. You presuppose that<br>a theist, in a life-and-death situation, would sit idly by and wait for<br>God to intervene.<br><br>Of course, this is illogical. God gave us brains. He gave us<br>*reason* and *logic*. He expects us to use those. So in a life-and-death<br>situation, he would expect that we would be able to use our brains and<br>figure out the best method to get out, just like the atheist.<br><br>The truth is that the one who is better in a life-or-death situation is<br>the one who has had leadership training and has been trained to stay<br>cool under pressure. Their religion has no bearing on the situation at<br>that particular moment.<br><br>The *difference* between the two would come after the situation was<br>over. The atheist would shout, "Thank you, Mother Nature, for allowing<br>this brain to spontaneously, accidentally evolve over thousands of years<br>such that I could figure out this life-or-death situation all by my very<br>lonesome! Ha, who am I kidding? Why am I thanking Mother Nature? That's<br>just a child's myth. I just fell together out of spare parts and<br>electricity, so there's no one to thank. If I have to thank something,<br>it will be this purposeless, amoral, and meaningless universe which my<br>logical brain is telling me gave me logic and reason and morals, because<br>chaos creates order, randomness creates fine-tuning, and non-life<br>creates life, and that's perfectly logical! Oh well, off to another<br>personally meaningful but ultimately pointless endeavor. I'll learn and<br>grow from this experience, and I'll teach others about it, but what's<br>the point? We all die anyway, and then there's nothingness for all of<br>eternity."<br><br>In contrast, the theist would say, "Thank you God for setting the laws<br>of nature in motion such that this brain that allowed me to think my way<br>out of the situation was able to develop. Thank you for giving me this<br>life that you clearly are saying isn't over yet. You still have more<br>work for me to do, and I'll do my best. I'll learn and grow from this<br>experience and I'll teach others about it, and about you, and especially<br>that this life is not the end, and we have more to look forward to for<br>all of eternity."<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Which person is a better leader in a life and death scenario? An atheist<br>who can figure out the best method to get out or a strongly religious<br>person who will pray for God\'s interventtion?<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance<br>for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough<br>shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion<br>masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your<br>own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.<br>If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"<br>don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything<br>vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a<br>block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br>*With this answer in specific, any ad hominem attacks will be blocked<br>and reported instantly, so don't bother. Feel free to dissect my logic<br>if you must, but if I see any attacks for believing in a nonsensical<br>mythical sky daddy, it's into the bit bucket with your comment.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
