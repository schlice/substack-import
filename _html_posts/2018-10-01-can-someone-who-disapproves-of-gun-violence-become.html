<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can someone who disapproves of gun violence become a police officer<br>and choose not to use the gun they are provided?**<br><br>In short, no. You'll never be admitted into the academy if you admit<br>that you won't fire a weapon. In order to be certified by the state as a<br>law enforcement officer, you must fire your weapon proficiently.<br><br>However, there are other jobs within law enforcement that are unarmed<br>jobs. Some Community Service Officers are unarmed, while the Police<br>Auxilliary and Reserve Deputies in some communities are also unarmed.<br><br>If you are interested in law enforcement but you don't want to be armed,<br>you might consider volunteering in one of those other roles.<br><br>If, however, you are insinuating that you would fire your weapon in<br>training but would never fire it in practice, that's a recipe for<br>disaster. **A sworn officer must be armed and must be prepared to use<br>that firearm. Failing to do so when needed would be a dereliction of<br>duty, and puts the lives of other officers as well as the public at<br>risk.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
