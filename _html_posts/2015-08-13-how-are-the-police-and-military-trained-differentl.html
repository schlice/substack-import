<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [(Answer specific to the United States)\<br>\<br>They are each trained for their unique mission.\<br>\<br>The police are a law enforcement organization, and so they are very<br>heavily trained in the laws which they are charged with enforcing. It is<br>a very broad-based training, as a police officer works mostly<br>autonomously and can respond to any call for service. They are trained<br>in the use of all of the tools on their toolbelts, including the Taser,<br>the baton, and of course, their sidearm. They are heavily trained in<br>arrest control, vehicle operations, and firearms.\<br>\<br>The military is a force projection tool for the government, charged with<br>supporting and defending the Constitution from all enemies. It is very<br>compartmentalized, so their training is top-down, and specific to their<br>job function. All recruits are given similar basic military training,<br>which includes military decorum (how to salute, how to march, etc),<br>physical conditioning, military history, and military rules and<br>standards. Once they complete that training, they are assigned to a<br>\"specialty\" which performs a specific military function. They receive<br>specialized training in that function. For example, a military member<br>assigned to Communications and Computer Systems will attend a special<br>school to learn the basics of that job. Once they complete their \"tech<br>school\" as it is called, they are assigned to an active unit. They then<br>learn the specifics of working in that unit, usually through OJT<br>(on-the-job training) which can be formal or informal.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
