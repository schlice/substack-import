I don\'t think the people<br>who were walking around the aircraft were actually security police. I<br>have a feeling that they were there mostly for show.<br><br>Real Air Force security police officers never go on patrol without being<br>armed. The ones with the M9s will carry 30 rounds, and the ones with the<br>M-16\'s carry 120 rounds.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
