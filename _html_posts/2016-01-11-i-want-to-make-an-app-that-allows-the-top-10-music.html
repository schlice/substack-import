<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No one truly downloads songs for free. Someone always pays for the<br>music.<br><br>Unlike what you may have read or heard somewhere, if you\'re downloading<br>songs for free and no one is paying for the music, you are *stealing.*<br>Unless the author has released the music royalty-free, someone is<br>supposed to be paying for that music.<br><br>Therefore, for you to make an app that allows people to download songs<br>for free, you have to work out who pays for the music, because clearly<br>you don\'t want the consumer to foot the bill. If you are hosting the<br>music, you must pay royalties every time the song is downloaded. Maybe<br>you can show them an ad before the download starts. That way, you can<br>pay the royalties with the ad revenue. Good luck making any money that<br>way though.<br><br>If, however, you are just pointing to songs hosted somewhere else, it is<br>up to the hosting provider to pay the royalties however they choose to<br>do so.<br><br>If you point to songs you know are illegally hosted, or you know the<br>provider is not paying royalties to stream the music which is not<br>released royalty-free, you can face fines as well.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
