<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If the camera was there to enforce the left turn rule, and you violated<br>the rule, the registered owner of the vehicle (based on the license<br>plate) will get a ticket in the mail.<br><br>Depending on the laws in your state, but true in most places, the ticket<br>is not a moving violation, so you won't incur points or lose your<br>license if you don't pay. But if you don't pay, they'll turn the ticket<br>over to collections and it will ding your credit score, and you'll have<br>a collection agency hounding you to pay.<br><br>If the registered owner of the vehicle was not driving the vehicle at<br>the time of the incident, he/she can have the ticket thrown out, as<br>he/she was not driving the vehicle at the time.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What happens if I accidentally turn left on an intersection but it's<br>prohibited to turn left from Monday-Friday from 3-7pm and there was a<br>surveillance camera?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
