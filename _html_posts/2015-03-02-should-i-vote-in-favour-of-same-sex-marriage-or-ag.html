<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You\'re not looking at this from the correct viewpoint.<br>While these votes tend to be a referendum on the LGBTQ lifestyle,<br>that\'s not what they should be.\<br>\<br>No one has the right to question whether LGBTQ people have the right to<br>marry. All they have to do is find a church that believes similarly and<br>they can be married. End of story.\<br>\<br>But there\'s this whole thing about \"marriage licenses\" and being<br>\"recognized under the law as being married.\" The question you need to<br>answer is: *why does the government care who you marry?*\<br>\<br>If you can answer that question, then you can determine whether or not<br>you think it\'s right that government be involved in that decision at<br>all.\<br>\<br>The reason this is an issue is because government, for better or for<br>worse, still holds the belief that children are best raised in a<br>household with their biological parents.\<br>\<br>*Yeah, but what does that have to do with gay marriage?*\<br>\<br>The reason government licenses and incentivizes marriage in the first<br>place is so that adults will structure their lives to best suit the<br>children that they may produce.\<br>\<br>*Yeah, but you still haven\'t answered the question.* ***What does this<br>have to do with gay marriage?***\<br>\<br>Again, for better or worse, the government, knowing that gay couples<br>cannot produce children, doesn\'t include them in the legislation<br>surrounding how people should best arrange their lives to support<br>children.\<br>\<br>THIS IS AN INJUSTICE THAT SHOULD BE CORRECTED!\<br>\<br>Since gay couples can adopt children and raise them, they should be<br>afforded the same privileges under the law as married couples, because<br>if we are looking at \"the best interests of the children,\" then we<br>should give gay couples who adopt a child as much parental support as we<br>give the biological parents of a child.\<br>\<br>There are as many studies that show that children do best when raised by<br>their biological parents as there are that show that children who grow<br>up in gay households do as well as their biologically-oriented<br>counterparts. So I don\'t think relying on studies is going to help us<br>in this instance.\<br>\<br>While we\'re waiting for *that one definitive study* (don\'t hold<br>your breath), families are not getting equal support from their<br>government because the structure of their family doesn\'t meet some<br>government standard.\<br>\<br>You can fix that.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
