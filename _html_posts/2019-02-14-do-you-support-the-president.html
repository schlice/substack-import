<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you support the President\'s coming Declaration of a National<br>Security emergency to build the border wall?**<br><br>Whether or not I support his decision is irrelevant. He's been setting<br>this up for quite a while, and I suspect he's going to do it.<br><br>Democrats in the House are going to sue him. The courts will not rule on<br>it because once the President declares a national emergency, he has the<br>legal authority to use military funding to assist the military in their<br>duties.<br><br>The military has been spending the last month and change laying<br>concertina wire, which does not a permanent fence make.<br><br>This fulfills the legal obligation needed to support building more<br>permanent border barriers to assist the military at the southern border,<br>once a national emergency has been declared (see 10 USC ยง 2808(a) for<br>the legal justification, or he could use the counterdrug mission in 10<br>USC ยง 284, but in either case, legal justification is there).<br><br>Since this becomes a political question and not a legal question,<br>Democrats will instead call the move an "abuse of power" and will<br>impeach him. The Senate still won't remove him from office.<br><br>Sorry, did I just reveal the script for the remainder of this year?<br>Oops, spoiler alert...<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
