<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is exactly why we visit our neurologists regularly. We manage the<br>disease and maintain a good quality of life.<br><br>So what will you and your neurologist do?<br><br>- Manage the disease. You'll keep tabs on the disease progress, and make<br>  sure the disease is progressing as slowly as possible. You'll do this<br>  by using diagnostic tools like the MRI and neurological exams to check<br>  the progress of the disease, and you'll control its progress by taking<br>  one of the approved MS therapy drugs.<br>- Maintain a good quality of life. Learn what you can and can't do.<br>  Don't push yourself so hard that you hurt yourself, but exercise as<br>  you can. Be cautions of overheating, as heat is the enemy of MS.<br>  Remember: *progress, not perfection.* Give yourself some grace; MS is<br>  insidious and it tries to keep you from moving. Don't let it win.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional medical advice.
