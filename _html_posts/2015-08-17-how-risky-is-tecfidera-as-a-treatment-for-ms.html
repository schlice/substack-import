<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Tecfidera is \"up there\" in the list of MS medicines that<br>carry some moderate to severe risk, as Tecfidera is one of the MS<br>medicines (along with Tysabri and, quite possibly, Gilenya, although<br>that is still being determined) which can cause PML ([[progressive<br>multifocal<br>leukoencephalopathy](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9f0d6d&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_multifocal_leukoencephalopathy){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}). PML is a fast-moving<br>viral infection caused by the [[JC<br>virus](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6a2af9&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JC_virus){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} and exacerbated by<br>certain medications and treatment regimems for certain diseases such as<br>AIDS and MS. PML is usually fatal, but survival rates are improving.<br>[[One<br>esitmate](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=61fc24&url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/pml/pml.htm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nih.gov"}]{.qlink_container} says that the mortality rate is<br>around 30-50% in the first few months of identification of the disease.\<br>\<br>Tecfidera can also cause allergic reactions and GI symptoms.\<br>\<br>Talk to your neurologist about all your treatment options and your<br>entire treatment regimen. If you do decide to start Tecfidera, make sure<br>you get (at least) annual JC virus tests (unless you\'re positive for<br>JC, then you only need to have it done once). Whether or not you have<br>been exposed to the JC virus should factor in to your decision as to<br>which medicine to take.]<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
