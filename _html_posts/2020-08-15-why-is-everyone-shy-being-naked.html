Is there an explanation for<br>that?**<br><br>Depends on who you ask.<br><br>Christians and Jews will tell you that it was the events in the Garden<br>of Eden which brought about our knowledge that we were naked.<br><br>> When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and<br>> pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took<br>> some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her,<br>> and he ate it. **Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they<br>> realized they were naked;** so they sewed fig leaves together and made<br>> coverings for themselves.<br>><br>> ---Genesis 3:6--7 (NIV)<br><br>Science and physiology tells us that around age three or four, we begin<br>to differentiate between what's private and what's public, and develop a<br>sense of modesty not long after that.\[1\](#kOLFk){#cite-kOLFk<br>.citation_link}<br><br>Finally, as always, there are cultural influences. In the United States,<br>people feel that the body is very private, and nudity has been<br>sexualized.
