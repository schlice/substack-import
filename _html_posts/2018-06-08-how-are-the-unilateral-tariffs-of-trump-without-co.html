<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How are the unilateral tariffs of Trump without congressional approval<br>legal and/or constitutional?**<br><br>Because over the course of American history since the Constitution was<br>written, Congress has spent its time handing over its power of tariffs<br>to the President.<br><br>Over its long history, Congress has proven that it is absolutely<br>terrible at national economic planning. Also, the power to levy tariffs<br>tends to land more with matters of foreign policy, and foreign policy is<br>squarely in the President's wheelhouse, not Congress.<br><br>So little by little, Congress has granted tariff authority to the<br>President. Initially, it was only for foreign policy reasons, but since<br>FDR, the office of the president has had nearly complete control of<br>tariffs, even in cases like Trump's tariffs which are not manifestly<br>foreign policy related. Trump is just scoring points with the aluminum<br>and steel industries, not projecting a foreign policy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
