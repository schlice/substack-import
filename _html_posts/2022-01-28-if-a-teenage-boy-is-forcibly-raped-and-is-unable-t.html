<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Child support is a function of the state, and has nothing to do with the<br>characterization of the pregnancy.<br><br>It's all about the baby.<br><br>The state has a compelling interest in protecting babies. Child support<br>is awarded to ensure the baby has enough money to have its needs met<br>while it grows.<br><br>Let me ask a hypothetical: If the biological father could "refuse" child<br>support because he was raped, and the mother is in jail for the rape,<br>who pays for raising the baby? Taxpayers? Well, ultimately they might,<br>but the taxpayers in most states have decided that the biological<br>parents of the baby should pay for the baby's upbringing.<br><br>If a state wants to make it so that a rape victim does not have to pay<br>for child support, they must provide alternate funding to support that<br>baby during its formative years, and that would most likely come from<br>taxes, and right now, no one wants to raise taxes.<br><br>Therefore, the biological parents of the baby pay child support for that<br>baby. It does seem a little injust that a boy can be forcibly raped and<br>then, to add insult to injury, has to *pay* for the progeny he created<br>against his will. Understanding that child support is not a punishment<br>or a reward helps, even though it doesn't lessen the sting.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If a teenage boy is forcibly raped and is unable to do anything about it<br>and gets the girl pregnant can he legally refuse child support? And if<br>not what will happen to him if he refuses to do so? This is only out of<br>curiosity.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
