<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's a logical fallacy to think that Jesus "modified" the old law when,<br>in Matthew 5:21, he said "You have heard that it was said...But I say to<br>you...". If we truly believe that Jesus is God, and the Old Testament is<br>God's inspired word, then Jesus cannot contradict what was written,<br>because He essentially wrote both. And God is unchanging. In Malachi<br>3:6, God says, "I am the Lord. I do not change."<br><br>What He was doing in that passage was that He was clarifying the old,<br>incorrect interpretations of those passages. The Pharisees and the<br>scribes had, in essence, *perverted* the original meaning of those<br>passages, so He was restoring the true meaning of those passages, not<br>changing or refuting them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
