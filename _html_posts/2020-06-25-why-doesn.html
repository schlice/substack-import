<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why doesn\'t Trump just resign and let Pence take over and then have<br>Trump run everything from behind the curtain?**<br><br>If the problem was Trump, then that would be the easy solution, wouldn't<br>it?<br><br>However, the problem isn't Trump. Trump is a *symptom* **of the<br>problem.**<br><br>It's iceberg theory. Getting rid of Trump won't fix the underlying<br>problem that created the conditions which allow for a Trump presidency.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-b85e723633e0052c988785e684d17baa){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-b85e723633e0052c988785e684d17baa" master_w="691"<br>master_h="392"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>The problems began long before Trump, and long before Obama. To be fair,<br>both Obama and Trump are symptoms of the problem.<br><br>Even if Trump stepped down and allowed Pence to become President for the<br>next few months (or even if he did it in January right after he is sworn<br>in for his second term), people will still be fighting with each other.<br>Cops will still be evil, and Antifa and BLM will still be a thing. Not<br>having Trump as president won't magically make any of this go away.<br><br>This is a problem a long time in the making. And it's a problem that is<br>going to take a similarly long time to fix. But at the rate we're going,<br>it doesn't seem like anyone wants to fix it. Why not? Easy: because they<br>*benefit* from it.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for<br>everyone.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
