<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why does the media continue to focus on gun control when most of the<br>recent shooters have been on psychiatric drugs?**<br><br>You have two questions here:<br><br>- Why does the media focus on gun control<br>- Do recent shootings have a correlation to psychiatric drugs?<br><br>To your first question, the media focuses on gun control because it<br>sells. It makes them money. When they focus on guns, people<br>watch/listen/read. When people do that, the media outlet gets more<br>money. This really isn't that difficult.<br><br>To your second question, there may be a *correlation* between mass<br>shootings and psychiatric drugs. I am reasonably certain this is what<br>your article is pointing out.<br><br>However, let's not confuse *correlation* with *causation*. Just<br>because there is a correlation between mass shootings and psychiatric<br>drugs does not mean that there is a *causal link*. In other words, there<br>is no evidence that psychiatric drugs cause mass shootings.<br><br>For example, there is a positive correlation between US crude oil<br>imports from Norway, and drivers killed in collisions with railway<br>trains.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-7ff9ae998cda40b8392aa94c9b91951c){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-7ff9ae998cda40b8392aa94c9b91951c"<br>master_w="2080" master_h="820"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(Image courtesy*<br>[*tylervigen.com*(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=50be2c&url=http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="tylervigen.com"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br>Should we conclude that in order to reduce the number of deaths caused<br>by collision with railway trains that we should reduce US crude oil<br>imports from Norway? Of course not. That is because *correlation does<br>not imply causation.*<br><br>Similarly, while there may be a correlation between mass shooters and<br>psychiatric drugs, this does not mean that those mass shootings were<br>caused by the drugs.<br><br>If anything, it points out the fact that these people were under the<br>care and guidance of physicians who could prescribe them psychiatric<br>drugs. That's all it indicates.<br><br>However, were the people in counseling? Were they making progress?<br>Psychiatrists (physicians who specialize in mental diseases and<br>conditions) don't often perform counseling; that is usually left to<br>counselors. Counselors and psychologists (PhDs in mental diseases and<br>conditions) cannot prescribe psychiatric medications. And ne'er the<br>twain shall meet. Yet another problem with our mental health system in<br>America. The people who prescribe the drugs don't do the counseling, and<br>vice versa. Unless there is tight coordination between the two (and in<br>most cases, there is not), it is highly unlikely that one knows much<br>about what the other is doing, or why.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
