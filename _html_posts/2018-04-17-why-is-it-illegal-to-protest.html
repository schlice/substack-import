<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why is it illegal to protest?<br><br>While the question itself is a little thin, it actually raises a very<br>valid point.<br><br>In the United States, it is not illegal to protest. In fact, your right<br>to peaceably assemble and seek redress for your grievances from the<br>government is Constitutionally protected.<br><br>HOWEVER<br><br>That doesn't mean you get to protest *wherever and whenever* you want.<br><br>Every right in the United States tends to follow one simple rule:<br><br>Your right to swing your arm ends at my nose.<br><br>This means that your rights end when they begin to impact my rights.<br><br>For example, I have the right to use the roadways which I have funded<br>with my tax dollars. Does this mean you can't organize a protest and<br>march down a city street? Not at all! You just have to coordinate with<br>the City so that they can properly close those roads and re-route<br>traffic so that other people can enjoy their rights as well.<br><br>And think about this:<br><br>- There are trucks carrying freight in order to conduct business using<br>  those roads that you are unlawfully blocking. Do those businesses have<br>  to lose money for your cause? (Note that there is a separate law<br>  related to disrupting lawful commerce that you are also violating by<br>  unlawfully blocking a road)<br>- There are *ambulances* trying to transport *critical patients* to the<br>  hospital on those roads that you're unlawfully blocking. Do those<br>  people have to die for your cause?<br>- There are police officers trying to get to emergency situations on<br>  those roads you are blocking. Do the people who have called the police<br>  have to needlessly suffer for your cause?<br><br>No one is denying you the right to protest. However, you are most<br>definitely denied the ability to block a road without coordinating with<br>the city so that others can freely exercise their rights as well.<br><br>So let's be clear: unlawfully blocking a roadway without a permit<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-53625390fd1d2afd0dc3cc2a5cff0249){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-53625390fd1d2afd0dc3cc2a5cff0249" master_w="800"<br>master_h="534"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-1c9375edc45837899f73d9da209100d1){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-1c9375edc45837899f73d9da209100d1" master_w="960"<br>master_h="649"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>in order to "peaceably protest" is not legal. Your right to protest<br>is not at issue. Unlawfully disrupting traffic and unlawfully blocking<br>roadways is.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
