<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Suppressive fire. That\'s the only situation that makes<br>sense. Get lots of bullets downrange, don\'t much care where they land.<br>Full auto is a very poor mode in which to shoot an M-16 rifle. With a<br>cyclic firing rate of 700-950 rounds/min (depending on model), you can<br>empty a standard 30-round magazine in just a few seconds (1.89-2.57),<br>and accuracy is terrible.\<br>\<br>The M-16, the standard-issue rifle for the infantryman (now somewhat<br>being replaced by the M4, but let\'s use M-16 as an example), has not<br>had a \"full auto\" setting since the A2 version, when it was switched<br>to the more bullet-friendly \"burst\" mode, which fires in a three-round<br>burst instead of full-auto. So in burst mode, you pull the trigger, fire<br>three rounds, re-aim, and pull the trigger again. You can still get lots<br>of bullets downrange and you can be slightly more accurate with their<br>placement. In burst mode it now takes ten trigger pulls to empty a<br>magazine instead of one. You can still empty the magazine in almost the<br>same amount of time (if you choose), but you can\'t simply hold down the<br>trigger and \"spray and pray\" anymore.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
