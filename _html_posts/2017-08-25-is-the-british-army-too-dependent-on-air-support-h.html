<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>[[Arthur<br>Radford](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ac78be&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_W._Radford){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} penned the following in<br>1954:<br><br>> Today, air power is the dominant factor in war. It may not win a war<br>> by itself, but without it, no major war could be won.<br><br>63 years later and the message is the same. The army doesn't matter,<br>whether it's the US Army or the British Army. If you're going to win a<br>war, you must have control of the air. Period. No army is "too"<br>dependent on air power. *Every* army depends on air power. If they<br>don't, it's because they don't really want to win.<br><br>So the message is clear: you must control the air to win the war; no<br>major war can be won without controlling the air.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
