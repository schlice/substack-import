<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, to correct a little bit of semantics in your question,<br>"Chief Justice Roberts" did not "rule" anything. The Supreme Court voted<br>6--3 that the Tennessee law in question did not violate the Equal<br>Protection Clause of the Constitution. The Chief Justice merely wrote<br>the opinion of the majority.<br><br>The SCOTUS ruling was exceedingly narrow. They did not rule on the<br>merits of the law itself, only whether the law violated the Equal<br>Protection Clause. He left the rest to state legislatures.<br><br>If you're a Constitutionalist, this is the best result you can hope for<br>out of a Supreme Court. They literally only decide the Constitutionality<br>of a law, that's all. The Tennessee law in question prevents medical<br>providers from delivering puberty blockers and hormones to facilitate a<br>minor\'s transition to another sex. It also targets healthcare providers<br>in the state who continue to provide such procedures to gender-dysphoric<br>minors, opening these providers up to fines, lawsuits and other<br>liability.<br><br>*United States v. Skrmetti* was one of the most closely watched cases of<br>this term, with potential ripple effects for ongoing legal battles over<br>transgender rights, including bathroom access and participation in<br>school sports. The ruling could also serve as a legal pretext in future<br>cases involving LGBTQ+ protections, including whether sexual orientation<br>qualifies as a \"protected class\" on par with race or national origin.<br><br>\"The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor<br>does it afford us license to decide them as we see best,\" wrote Chief<br>Justice Roberts, who wrote the opinion of the majority. \"Our role is<br>not 'to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic' of the law before us<br>\...\ but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection<br>guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we<br>leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected<br>representatives, and the democratic process.\"<br><br>Also at issue was the *level of scrutiny* that courts should use to<br>evaluate the constitutionality of state bans on transgender medical<br>treatment for minors, such as the Tennessee law, and whether these laws<br>are considered discriminating on the basis of sex or against a<br>\"quasi-suspect class,\" thus warranting a higher level of scrutiny<br>under the Equal Protection Clause. SCOTUS today emphatically declared<br>that these state bans do not violate the Equal Protection clause.<br><br>On its face, \the Tennessee law\ incorporates two classifications: one<br>based on age (allowing certain medical treatments for adults but not<br>minors) and another based on medical use (permitting puberty blockers<br>and hormones for minors to treat certain conditions but not to treat<br>gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, or gender incongruence).<br>Classifications based on age or medical use are subject to only rational<br>basis review, and do not enjoy heightened scrutiny.<br><br>This is a huge win for the Constitution. These laws can now be<br>judged on their merits, and at the state level, with the elected<br>representatives of those states, without having to fight over whether or<br>not the law, by its very nature, violates the Constitution.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
