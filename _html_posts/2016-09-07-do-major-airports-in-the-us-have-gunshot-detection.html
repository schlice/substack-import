<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer to any question that is worded in the **why doesn't X have Y<br>technology which is currently available** is the same: money.<br><br>When you are deciding whether or not to make a purchase (such as buying<br>gunshot detection systems for an airport), you do what's known as a<br>*cost-benefit analysis.* You have to compare the cost to the benefit you<br>will receive from the purchase. If the benefit exceeds the cost, you<br>make the purchase. If not, you do not. It's actually far more nuanced<br>than that, but that's the basic thrust of the argument.<br><br>In order for a gunshot detection system to be cost-effective, it must<br>address a frequent problem in a better/more efficient/faster way than it<br>is currently being addressed. So to start, you have to address a<br>frequent problem. This, most assuredly, is not. So right off the bat,<br>we're not addressing a frequent problem, so the cost will likely be<br>considered too high to offset the minimal benefit you will see from<br>implementing the system.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
