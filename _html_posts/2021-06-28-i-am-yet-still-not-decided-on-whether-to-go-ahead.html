<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Make up your mind sooner rather than later.<br><br>Because being vaccinated with a *partially effective* vaccine is better<br>than not being vaccinated at all.<br><br>And the longer you go without a vaccine, the more chance you get of<br>either contracting COVID, or passing it on to someone else who can't<br>make up their mind.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to shame you if you choose to not get<br>the vaccine. That's your choice. You get to live with the consequences<br>of your choice, and so do all of the other unvaccinated people around<br>you, including those who, for one reason or another, may not be able to<br>be vaccinated.<br><br>But don't delay vaccination just because you can't decide which flavor<br>of vaccine you want. Flip a coin if you must. Believe it or not, that's<br>precisely what I did. I flipped a coin and ended up with the Pfizer<br>vaccine.<br><br>But seriously, just do it. And do it *soon*.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I am yet still not decided on whether to go ahead and get the<br>Astrazeneca vaccination or not because I am not getting a satisfying<br>response on how helpful it is. What should I do?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
