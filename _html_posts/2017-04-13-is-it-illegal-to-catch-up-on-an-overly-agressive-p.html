<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Police takedowns look inherently violent. They look aggressive. They<br>look painful. In some respects, they are intended to look this way. They<br>present an image of force, an image of control. They are designed to<br>remove the threat, which is not so much physical. The threat is<br>*mental*. A person who has the will to resist will continue to resist.<br>Once that person has mentally decided that it is not in his best<br>interest to resist, then he will stop.<br><br>But that action looks very aggressive. What you may see as a "brutal<br>arrest" is in fact a lawful takedown procedure, executed correctly, and<br>when performed correctly, stops the aggressor without causing excessive<br>physical harm (there may be some minor cuts and bruises, but no major<br>broken bones, no internal damage, etc) and convinces the aggressor<br>that continuing in his resistance will not net him any additional gain.<br>*That's* the big victory: getting the aggressor to *believe* that he<br>should not continue being aggressive.<br><br>And that's only the beginning, as we have only discussed appearances<br>here.<br><br>Legally, you have no authority to intervene when a police officer is<br>carrying out his lawful duties. "But a brutal arrest isn't lawful!" you<br>may say. It may be lawful, it may not be lawful. The only entity in the<br>United States which has the legal authority to decide whether or not it<br>is lawful is a court of law. Not you, not the police officer, not the<br>suspect. Only the court. It's up to the police to get the suspect into<br>custody and in front of a court so it can make that determination.<br><br>*So what can you do?*<br><br>Your best option is not to intervene. Your best option is to **record<br>everything you see**. If you don't have a phone that can record video,<br>be a good witness. Remember everything you can, in as much detail as<br>you can. Remember to answer the who/what/when/where/why questions when<br>you are focusing on remembering what was happening.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
