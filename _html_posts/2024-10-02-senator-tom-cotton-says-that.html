<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>100%. Walz basically confirmed that the only way Obamacare works is to<br>forcibly expand the risk pool, a move which was largely shouldered by<br>the young and healthy. In practice, it would have burdened people who<br>make less than \$50,000 a year the hardest.<br><br>If the individual mandate were replaced, this would violate Harris'<br>pledge not to raise taxes on anyone making less than \$400,000 a year.<br><br>Of course, he defends his actions by looking at just one small part of<br>the ACA: pre-existing conditions. He notes that before the ACA was<br>passed, we didn't have legal protections for pre-existing conditions, so<br>therefore (in his mind) the ACA is the best thing since sliced bread.<br><br>And Vance made a good point, which also addressed Trump's comments<br>during his own debate about how "we have some options" with how to deal<br>with the issue. Vance said, "Donald Trump has said that if we allow<br>states to experiment a little bit on how to cover both the chronically<br>ill, \and\ the non-chronically ill, it\'s not just a plan. He actually<br>implemented some of these regulations when he was president of the<br>United States. And I think you can make a really good argument that it<br>salvaged Obamacare, which was doing disastrously until Donald Trump came<br>along.\"<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
