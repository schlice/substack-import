<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If the second amendment protects the right to own a firearm then how<br>can it be justifiable for a police officer to shoot someone for having a<br>gun?**<br><br>Your question has a statement and then a question, and the two are<br>completely unrelated.<br><br>the second amendment protects the right to own a firearm<br><br>Yes, it does.<br><br>**how can it be justifiable for a police officer to shoot someone for<br>having a gun?**<br><br>It's not. Police officers don't shoot people *because they have a gun*.<br>Police officers shoot people because their lives were threatened with<br>deadly force, or they are trying to stop an act which might result in<br>death or grave bodily harm to the officer or bystanders.<br><br>Instead of "having a gun," perhaps the person in question didn't merely<br>just "have" the gun in his possession. Maybe he was "brandishing" the<br>gun, which is a crime. Maybe he was wildly waving it around, risking<br>death or grave bodily harm to people around him. Maybe he was acting<br>threatening. Maybe he wouldn't disarm when instructed to do so.<br><br>I think you misunderstood why the particular police officer shot the<br>particular person in question who you believe was shot "for having a<br>gun." You probably want to either present us with a little more<br>information to help you understand, or read up a little more on the case<br>you are citing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
