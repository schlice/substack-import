<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I define God as "The transcendent, immaterial, eternal, supremely<br>powerful, and intelligent cause of the universe."<br><br>I believe that because logically-speaking, this definition is required<br>in order to meet our scientific understanding of the universe, its<br>beginning, and its creation.<br><br>I'll go through these for you:<br><br>- Immaterial and transcendent: Whether you believe God exists or<br>  not, He is, by definition, *immaterial* and *transcendent*. He is<br>  *immaterial* because He is not composed of physical matter, not made<br>  of material stuff like you and me.<br>  - It is necessary for Him to be *immaterial* because He created<br>    matter, so He must be outside of it. He cannot be comprised of the<br>    matter He created, or He would have to exist before He existed, and<br>    there would also have to be a "before" He existed, meaning He is<br>    subject to time. But we know that is not true, because time was also<br>    created at the beginning of the universe.<br>  - God is *transcendent* because He exists beyond space. It is<br>    necessary to exist beyond space in order to create space, for the<br>    same reasons that He needs to be immaterial when He created matter.<br>- Eternal: It is necessary for God to be *eternal* in order for Him<br>  to be the "First Cause." This is due to the Law of Causality, which<br>  states that everything which has a beginning has a cause. It's very<br>  important that we get this right. Some atheists try to refute this<br>  premise by responding, "But if everything that exists has a cause, and<br>  God exists, then what caused God?" But the premise does not claim,<br>  "Everything that *exists* has a cause." It says, "Everything that<br>  *begins to exist* has a cause." Since God, by definition, and whether<br>  you believe in Him or not, is eternal and never began to exist, this<br>  does not apply to Him. Therefore, logically, God must have ***no<br>  cause***. So even if you did ask the question "What caused God?" the<br>  answer would be nothing and it would be logically and inductively<br>  accurate. Because if everything which has a beginning has a cause,<br>  then everything which does not have a beginning does not have a cause.<br>  God is the great "uncaused cause."<br>- Powerful and Intelligent: If this "necessary creator" has<br>  created something so massively complex as the universe, it must be<br>  tremendously powerful and intelligent.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
