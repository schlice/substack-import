<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Easy.<br><br>*Define "protecting abortion rights."*<br><br>Does that mean "100% unfettered access to abortions throughout all nine<br>months of pregnancy"? Because that's what Democrats were asking for when<br>they tried to pass Federal abortion rights legislation. And most<br>Republicans do not support abortion for this length of time. In fact,<br>most Americans don't support abortion for this length of time.<br><br>Does that mean "Abortions restricted to the first 15 weeks of<br>pregnancy"? Because most Americans across the political spectrum<br>actually want that. Support for abortion past 15 weeks drops off<br>dramatically.<br><br>Even moderate pro-life Republicans support some level of abortion, just<br>limited to the first 15 weeks of pregnancy. In fact, 90% of all<br>abortions occur during the first 15 weeks of pregnancy. Therefore, this<br>is a fairly "centrist" position on abortion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
