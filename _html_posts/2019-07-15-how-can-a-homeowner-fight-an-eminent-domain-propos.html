<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How can a homeowner fight an eminent domain proposition?<br><br>First and foremost, if your property is affected, hire an eminent domain<br>lawyer. Not in a month, not in a week, now.<br><br>The 5th Amendment gives the government the power to take property.<br>However, like most provisions in the Constitution, it is not an<br>unlimited power. For example, the taking must be valid and legal. If it<br>is not, your eminent domain attorney can help you fight that.<br><br>If it is valid and legal, your lawyer will make sure you get full and<br>fair compensation for any property taken.<br><br>This is why it is critical that if you are affected by an eminent domain<br>action, you immediately retain an eminent domain attorney.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice. This<br>answer does not create an attorney-client relationship, nor is it a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice. This answer is for GENERAL<br>INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. If you ignore this warning and convey<br>confidential information in a private message or comment, there is no<br>duty to keep that information confidential or forego representation<br>adverse to your interests. Seek the advice of a licensed attorney in the<br>appropriate jurisdiction before taking any action that may affect your<br>rights. If you believe you have a claim against someone, consult an<br>attorney immediately, otherwise there is a risk that the time allotted<br>to bring your claim may expire.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to legal questions are intended<br>third-party beneficiaries with certain rights under Quora\'s* [[*Terms<br>of Service*](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
