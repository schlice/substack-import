<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: you don't.<br><br>If you are trying to make peace with spending eternity in Hell, then you<br>are responding incorrectly to something that is *convicting* you. There<br>is a logical step that happens before trying to make peace with spending<br>eternity in Hell.<br><br>The logic goes like this:<br><br>1.  I recognize that I am a sinner, and without someone saving me, I'm<br>    headed to the hot place when I die.<br>2.  I now have two choices:<br>    1.  Make peace with spending eternity in hell, or<br>    2.  Admit my guilt, admit that I have sinned, and **repent and be<br>        saved.**<br><br>Since there is no peace in hell (it is a place of eternal torment), then<br>attempting to make peace with something which cannot be made peaceful is<br>an invalid response.<br><br>Once you have reached Step 1 and you realize that we are all sinners and<br>we have all fallen short of the glory of God, and that truth ***convicts<br>us*, the valid response** is to repent of that sin, and accept<br>Christ as our savior who takes away the stain of that sin.<br><br>Christ has already done everything necessary to save you. Now all you<br>have to do is *accept that gift*. Repent of your sin. Admit that you<br>are a sinner. Turn away from your sin and be saved.<br><br>That's the correct response.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
