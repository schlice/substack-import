<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So let's get all the stupid out of the way right up front.<br><br>Yes, she died of a complication of OG COVID-19, a blood clot. Yes, she<br>*may* have benefitted from a vaccine.<br><br>NO, SHE WAS NOT AGAINST VACCINES. SHE WAS AGAINST VACCINE<br>*MANDATES*. She claimed, as most Conservatives do, that vaccines are<br>a personal choice, and should not be forced on the population.<br>If you want one, get one, and if you don't, don't.<br><br>As you can see, the only person who failed to benefit from Kelly Ernby's<br>contracting COVID-19 is Kelly Ernby. She made a decision. She could have<br>made a different one, and she may still be with us today had she done<br>so. But that was her decision. She went into it with her eyes wide open.<br><br>She had the right to make that decision. And she did it. *Of course* you<br>feel sorry for her family. You can feel sorry for her, but it's kind of<br>a wasted emotion, as it's too late for her to change anything now, isn't<br>it. But *of course* you feel sorry for her family's loss. What kind of<br>psychopath doesn't at least feel some sympathy for that family?<br><br>I have had other people in my life die in exactly the same way. They<br>made a decision to be unvaccinated and it cost them their life. But they<br>died as they lived: *free to make their own decisions*.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What are your thoughts about the death of Republican Kelly Ernby from<br>COVID-19 at only 46? She was against masking and vaccines, she even said<br>Covid wasn't a big deal. Do you feel sorry for her?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
