<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is yes you can. However, for an existing neighborhood, how<br>you go about starting an HOA is crucial to understand what you'll end up<br>with when you're done.<br><br>The reason: there is a big difference between *voluntary* and<br>*mandatory* HOAs.<br><br>Mandatory HOAs are attached to the property. Generally, they exist<br>before the property is sold for the first time, as they are established<br>by the developer. You cannot choose whether or not you will belong to<br>the HOA, because it is part of the property. If you buy the property,<br>you're in the HOA.<br><br>Voluntary HOAs are akin to club memberships or affinity groups. You can<br>join and leave as you choose. You may receive benefits from such<br>membership, such as clubhouse or pool access.<br><br>If you're trying to create a mandatory HOA, you will probably need<br>permission from 100% of the homeowners in the neighborhood. It can be<br>done, you just need more permission. You will need assistance from a<br>real estate attorney to file the paperwork and collect the legal<br>signatures to modify the deeds of all of the homeowners to indicate the<br>HOA.<br><br>You can create a voluntary HOA with a much smaller percentage of<br>homeowners, and it's much easier to implement.<br><br>If you really are serious about going forward with establishing an HOA<br>in your area, talk to a real estate attorney in your area who<br>specializes in HOA law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
