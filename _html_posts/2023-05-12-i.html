<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First off, good for you being able to stay on Tysabri for 8 years! I<br>lasted 18 months on Tysabri before I had to move off. Tysabri has better<br>efficacy than any other MS med out there.<br><br>That said, there are plenty of other medications, and which one is right<br>for you is dependent on lots of factors. And I know this is going to<br>sound dismissive, but you really need to work with your neurologist on<br>this. Your neurologist can help you choose a different medicine with a<br>different mode of administration (injectable or pill) that has decent<br>efficiacy and manageable side effects.<br><br>If it were me (and it was), I'd look to pills at this point. For me, I<br>moved to Gilenya from Tysabri, and just a few years ago, my neurologist<br>moved me to Zeposia (which works nearly the same as Gilenya, but is<br>safer). But I started out on injectables (Copaxone) before I went to<br>Tysabri.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional medical advice.
