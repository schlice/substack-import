<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You should always talk to your doctor before you make decisions about<br>vaccines, and you should consider your current health situation and your<br>current medications, and any other risk factors you may face. Don't ask<br>the Internet if taking a vaccine is a good idea.<br><br>*In general* (not specifically for you), the vaccine is beneficial for<br>most healthy people. In general, the vaccine reduces your chance of<br>contracting the virus, and if you do, you have a greater chance of only<br>experiencing mild or moderate symptoms. You *greatly* reduce your risk<br>of being hospitalized with the virus if you get the vaccine.<br><br>Bottom line: if you're thinking about getting vaccinated, talk to your<br>doctor or healthcare provider, but the vaccine is generally beneficial<br>for most people.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Should I take the Covid-19 vaccine?<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice. This answer is for GENERAL<br>INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. If you think you are experiencing a medical<br>emergency, call your local emergency number (in the United States, 911)<br>immediately.* *ALWAYS SEEK THE ADVICE OF YOUR DOCTOR* *before<br>starting or changing treatment.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to health-related questions are<br>intended third-party beneficiaries with certain rights under Quora\'s*<br>[[Terms of<br>Service](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
