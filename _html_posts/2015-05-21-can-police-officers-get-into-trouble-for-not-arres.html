<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Officers can balance the need to execute the law with<br>professional discretion. Line officers are the \"gatekeepers\" to the<br>legal system, and professional discretion is part of the job. There are<br>certain mitigating circumstances that could lead an officer to not<br>arrest an individual. Some of them may be:\<br>]<br><br>- The seriousness of the crime<br>- Prior criminal record<br>- Strength of the evidence<br>- Preference of the victim<br>- Relationship between the victim and suspect<br>- Demeanor of the suspect<br>- Characteristics of the victim<br>- Behavior<br>- Visibility of the event (i.e. media or witnesses)\<br>- Neighborhood characteristics<br>- Individual officer characteristics \1\\<br><br>However, if an officer was supposed to arrest someone and they chose to<br>exercise professional discretion, they can certainly face repercussions<br>from that decision. If the decision was found to have been inappropriate<br>for any number of reasons, the officer could face re-training,<br>reassignment, or other disciplinary actions.\<br>\<br>\1\ Gaines, L.
