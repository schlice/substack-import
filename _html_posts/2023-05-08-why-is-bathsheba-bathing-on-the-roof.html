<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a common misunderstanding of this verse, and it's due to Leonard<br>Cohen.<br><br>Leonard Cohen wrote a song about the story of David and Bathsheba called<br>*Hallelujah* in 1984. It wasn't very popular until John Cale re-released<br>the song in 1991, which was featured in the movie *Shrek*. The song's<br>popularity took off after that.\[1\](#aNPFt){#cite-aNPFt<br>.citation_link}<br><br>At the beginning of verse 2, the lyrics go:<br><br>> Your faith was strong but you needed proof,\<br>> You saw her bathing on the roof,\<br>> Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya.<br><br>The second line contains a misplaced modifier (probably in order to<br>make it rhyme). In the actual story from the Bible, *David* was the one<br>on the roof, and he saw Bathsheba, *in a house lower than where he was,*<br>taking a bath:<br><br>> One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of<br>> the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing. The woman was very<br>> beautiful. --- 2 Samuel 11:2 NIV<br><br>Misplaced modifiers are common English language issues. Here's another<br>example of a misplaced modifier: purple women's shoes. Purple is the<br>misplaced modifier, because when you say it like that, it looks like the<br>women are purple, not the shoes. Similarly, when you say "You saw her<br>bathing on the roof," it sounds like she was on the roof, not you seeing<br>her from your own roof.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-aNPFt){.citation_index} [[Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen<br>song) -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d86ff0&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallelujah_(Leonard_Cohen_song)){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
