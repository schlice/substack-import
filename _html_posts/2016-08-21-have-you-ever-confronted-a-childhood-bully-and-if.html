<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I beat him senseless. And it was the worst experience of my life.<br><br>We were in Junior High school, so I was probably 13 or 14 at the time. I<br>can remember exactly where I was in the school, during what you would<br>call a "passing period" today. He had been bullying me (verbal<br>harassment) non stop, daily, for months. I guess it was just bottled up<br>for too long, and I lost it. He said something that I don\'t remember<br>from right behind me (something about his supposed sexual exploits with<br>my mother, I think), and I snapped. My vision clouded over. I threw my<br>books down. I spun around, grabbed him around the neck with my arm, and<br>punched him in the face. A lot. I also think I ran him into a locker.<br><br>I don\'t remember much after that. He was on the ground, very bloody,<br>but most of it was probably from his lips getting cut up on his braces.<br>It\'s all pretty hazy after that, but the next thing I remember is being<br>seated in the Dean\'s office. I looked down at my hands, and they were<br>still balled into fists. I tried to open them, but I couldn\'t. I forced<br>myself to open them, and found it very difficult to do so, and when they<br>finally opened, I saw nail cuts on my palms from my own nails. I was<br>traumatized and inconsolable for quite some time.<br><br>It was an absolutely terrible experience.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
