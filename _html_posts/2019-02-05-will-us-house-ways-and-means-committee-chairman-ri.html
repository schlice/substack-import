<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will U.S. House ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal be<br>successful with plans to subpoena President Donald Trump\'s tax<br>returns?**<br><br>We don't know, because it's never been really tested.<br><br>There is a law ([[26 U.S. Code ยง<br>6103](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=36f48b&url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6103){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cornell.edu"}]{.qlink_container}) which allows the Chairman<br>of the Ways and Means Committee to request tax returns from the<br>Secretary of the Treasury.<br><br>In the past, secretaries have complied with these requests. The<br>possibility exists, especially with Trump's general refusal to release<br>his tax returns, that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin may refuse the<br>request.<br><br>If he does, Congress can hold him in contempt. They could then subpoena<br>the returns, and the whole case would end up in court.<br><br>If such a court case were to actually appear, whether or not the court<br>would enforce the subpoena would turn largely on whether or not the<br>request is for a legitimate purpose, or if it is just being used to<br>embarrass or harass the president. There is precedent for Congress to be<br>able to exercise its oversight authority with respect to the IRS, and<br>that alone is justification to request those returns. Additional<br>justification for release would be in relation to Special Counsel Robert<br>Mueller's investigation into Trump-Russia collusion. If his report<br>includes anything which would be found in a tax return, then the<br>legitimacy of the request would be nearly self-evident. Therefore, it's<br>likely that a court would uphold the subpoena, and the requested returns<br>would be released.<br><br>In any case, the request would have to be limited to any filings made<br>while Trump was in office (to gauge whether or not Trump's interaction<br>with the IRS was legal while he had authority as president).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
