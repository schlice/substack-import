<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can a child be arrested for keying a car?<br><br>While destruction of property is, in most places, a misdemeanor (which<br>means you can indeed go to jail for it, for up to a year), most adult<br>laws do not directly apply to children.<br><br>Children are adjudicated (when the are) by the **juvenile justice<br>system**. The system is goaled towards rehabiliting youthful offenders.<br>Parents and children can face a variety of consequences, such as<br>mandatory counseling, probation, community service, youth court, and in<br>the most severe of cases, youth incarceration.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
