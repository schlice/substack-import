<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [To expound on [[Suzanne<br>Walsh](https://www.quora.com/profile/Suzanne-Walsh-5)]{.qlink_container}\'s<br>answer\<br>\<br>Does it cause real harm? Depends on what you call \"real harm.\" Does it<br>perpetuate an agenda instead of pure, unadulterated fact? Absolutely.\<br>\<br>Is that \"harmful?\" Only insofar as people will listen to exactly what<br>they want to hear, and not the pure, unadulterated truth. It \"harms\"<br>people because it doesn\'t allow for individuals to think for<br>themselves. It provides the facts, and also provides an opinion about<br>those facts.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
