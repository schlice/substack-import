<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [There are two parts to this answer: Yes, Americans have a<br/>right to know the laws. In a nation of laws, the citizen has not only<br/>the right to know, but the responsibility to educate themselves on the<br/>laws they are required to follow.\<br/>\<br/>However, a lack of knowledge of the law is not an excuse for violating<br/>the law. The same penalties are applied to someone who violates the law<br/>whether they knew the content and meaning of the law or<br/>not.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
