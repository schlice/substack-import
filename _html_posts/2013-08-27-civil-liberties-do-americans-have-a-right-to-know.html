<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There are two parts to this answer: Yes, Americans have a<br>right to know the laws. In a nation of laws, the citizen has not only<br>the right to know, but the responsibility to educate themselves on the<br>laws they are required to follow.\<br>\<br>However, a lack of knowledge of the law is not an excuse for violating<br>the law. The same penalties are applied to someone who violates the law<br>whether they knew the content and meaning of the law or<br>not.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
