<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Good on you for stretching your evangelical legs.<br><br>I think first you need to define terms. What will they accept as<br>"proof?" Is the only proof they will accept discovered through the<br>scientific method? When they look for "proof," does that mean only<br>something that they can see, hear, taste, touch or smell?<br><br>That certainly wouldn't make sense. If God exists, then He is<br>*necessarily* immaterial (He exists outside of the material universe<br>which He created). So if God is not material, why would you use material<br>tests to try to find Him? It's like using an X-ray machine to find a<br>plastic cup. It's the wrong tools.<br><br>So if you're going to prove that God exists, you have to use tools of<br>inquiry which are *not* based on the material. Those tools of inquiry<br>are collectively part of the discipline of *philosophy*. Philosophy<br>allows us to probe truths that are beyond what science is capable of<br>understanding.<br><br>But let's not fail to realize that philosophy is not divorced from<br>science, as if you can rely on science alone, and philosophy is just<br>pseudo-babble for PhDs to discuss while smoking pipes in dimly-lit<br>rooms. Philosophy is the *foundation* of science. Science is dependent<br>on philosophy. In fact, *science is a slave to philosophy.* Bad<br>philosophy results in bad science, and good science requires good<br>philosophy.<br><br>Why? Because:<br><br>> 1.  Science cannot be done without philosophy. Science is really<br>>     nothing more than a search for causes. Scientists try to figure<br>>     out what causes what. Philosophical assumptions are utilized in<br>>     the search for causes, and, therefore, cannot be the result of<br>>     them. For example, scientists assume (by faith) that reason and<br>>     the scientific method allow us to accurately understand the world<br>>     around us. That cannot be proven by science itself. You can't<br>>     prove the tools of science---the laws of logic, the Law of<br>>     Causality, the Principle of Uniformity, or the reliability of<br>>     observation---by running some kind of experiment. You have to<br>>     assume those things are true in order to do the experiment. So<br>>     science is built on philosophy. Unfortunately, many so-called<br>>     scientists are very poor philosophers.<br>> 2.  **Philosophical assumptions can dramatically impact scientific<br>>     conclusions**. If a scientist assumes beforehand that only natural<br>>     causes are possible, then probably no amount of evidence will<br>>     convince him that intelligence created the first one-celled amoeba<br>>     or any other designed entity. When Darwinists presuppose that<br>>     intelligent causes are impossible, then natural laws are the only<br>>     game in town. Likewise, if a creationist rules out natural causes<br>>     beforehand (and we don't know of any who do), then he also risks<br>>     missing the right answer. But a scientist who is open-minded to<br>>     both natural and intelligent causes can follow the evidence<br>>     wherever it leads.<br>> 3.  Science doesn't really say anything---scientists do. Data are<br>>     always interpreted by scientists. When those scientists let their<br>>     personal preferences or unproven philosophical assumptions dictate<br>>     their interpretation of the evidence, they do exactly what they<br>>     accuse religious people of doing---they let their ideology dictate<br>>     their conclusions. When that's the case, their conclusions should<br>>     be questioned, because they may be nothing more than philosophical<br>>     presuppositions passed off as scientific<br>>     facts.\[1\](#VxqpY){#cite-VxqpY .citation_link}<br><br>Once we have determined that we have to use philosophy to discover the<br>truth of God's existence, we next need to learn the *arguments* for the<br>existence of God.<br><br>If you really want to learn this stuff, there is a great book you should<br>absolutely read. It is by Dr. Norm Geisler and Dr. Frank Turek, and it<br>is called *I Don't Have Enough Faith To Be an Atheist*. It is not a<br>difficult read (so it's not like you're learning about Kierkegaard or<br>Freud in school), and it lays out the philosophical and scientific<br>truths which act as the "signposts" that point us to the existence of<br>God. These signposts alone don't prove that God exists, but they lead us<br>to the knowledge that we can be certain, *beyond a reasonable doubt,*<br>*but not beyond all doubt**, that a creator God exists.*<br><br>[https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Have\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=770f5b&url=https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Have-Enough-Faith-Atheist/dp/1433580756){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-VxqpY){.citation_index} [[I Don\'t Have Enough Faith to Be<br>an Atheist: Geisler, Norman L., Turek, Frank, Limbaugh, David:<br>9781433580758: Amazon.com:<br>Books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=770f5b&url=https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Have-Enough-Faith-Atheist/dp/1433580756){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
