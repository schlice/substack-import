<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The information about ongoing cases is restricted and<br>cannot be released. Once the case is closed, the information must be<br>released upon receipt of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. If<br>someone were to make a FOIA request for that information, and it was not<br>protected because it was an ongoing case, and it didn\'t reveal<br>\"private information\" (i.e. protected medical information, etc), it<br>must be released. The sensibilities of the victim are not usually taken<br>into consideration, with the notable exception of certain crimes against<br>the victim, such as rape and/or domestic violence.\<br>\<br>The simple fact is that if you were murdered in a brothel, you are no<br>longer alive to defend your honor, so your case for protecting that<br>information becomes moot with your death.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
