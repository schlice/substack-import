<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **Isn\'t Nancy Pelosi violating President Trump\'s right to a speedy<br>> trial by delaying transmission of the articles of impeachment to the<br>> Senate?**<br><br>No, because it isn't a *judicial* *trial*. It's a political<br>proceeding that looks like a trial. In either the House or the Senate,<br>you don't really have the right to a speedy trial, because it's not<br>really, at its core, a trial.<br><br>> **Isn\'t she obstructing Congress by delaying the transmission to the<br>> Senate?**<br><br>Most definitely yes. McConnell & Co should issue subpoenas for the<br>Articles of Impeachment and should hold her in contempt of Congress if<br>she refuses to produce them, along with beginning criminal proceedings<br>against her in order to force her to comply with the subpoenas.<br><br>Doesn't that strike you as odd? Pelosi says that Trump was obstructing<br>Congress by failing to turn over state secrets he protected under<br>executive privilege, but now she finds it perfectly acceptable to ***do<br>exactly the same thing*** with the Senate? How come Trump's is<br>obstruction of Congress, but hers is not?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
