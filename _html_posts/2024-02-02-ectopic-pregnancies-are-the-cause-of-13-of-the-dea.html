<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Get abortions.<br><br>An "ectopic pregnancy" is a misnomer. It's not actually a pregnancy that<br>can be carried to term. The baby cannot survive outside of the uterus.<br>It's not like a 5% chance that it could survive, or a 1% chance, but a<br>0% chance. And if the baby is left where it is to continue to grow, it<br>will rupture the Fallopian tube in which it is (usually) incorrectly<br>implanted and likely cause fatal hemorrhaging.<br><br>Calling it a "pregnancy" is a misnomer. It is only a "pregnancy" when<br>the baby is growing, healthy, in the uterus, not in the Fallopian tube<br>within which neither the baby nor the mother can survive. It is only a<br>"pregnancy" when "doing nothing" means the baby grows to term and is<br>born normally.<br><br>And since abortions to save the life of the mother are allowed in 100%<br>of states in which there are abortion restrictions, the answer is for<br>the mother to get an abortion of the ectopic pregnancy.<br><br>Look, there are plenty of controversies surrounding abortion out there,<br>but this is not one of them. Even pro-lifers agree with this. Let's not<br>make controversies where they don't exist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
