It<br>seems I can usually guess with good accuracy if a person has or had a<br>serious long-term drinking problem but I am not sure why.**<br><br>You're not wrong. Alcohol abuse, and the liver disease it causes,<br>actually causes several signs and symptoms on the skin that you've<br>probably subconsciously noticed in alcoholics, but really never put the<br>two together.<br><br>For example, one of the earliest signs of alcohol abuse is a<br>persistently red face due to enlarged blood vessels (telangiectasia).<br>This occurs because regulation of vascular control in the brain begins<br>to fail with regular alcohol abuse. I often notice the redness of the<br>nose and the cheeks first.<br><br>Flushing of the skin often occurs with alcoholics due to acetaldehyde,<br>the main chemical result of the breakdown of alcohol. A histamine<br>response to acetaldehyde causes the flushing.<br><br>If the alcohol abuse continues on to liver disease, other skin changes<br>can be noted, such as:<br><br>- spider telangiectasis (spider veins) appear on the face, the v of the<br>  neck, arms, chest, hands, and abdomen.<br>- Jaundice<br>- skin darkening around the eyes, mouth and legs<br>- nail changes<br>- skin cancers<br><br>There are others, but these are probably the ones you've noticed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
