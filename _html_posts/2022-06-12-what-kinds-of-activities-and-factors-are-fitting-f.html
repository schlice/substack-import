<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Activities? That depends on your specific MS and what your symptoms are.<br><br>Most people with MS are adversely affected by heat. So if you happen to<br>live in a hot climate (like me), you must be very careful to not allow<br>yourself to overheat. On those days, frequent breaks in the shade or in<br>a cool location (perhaps with air conditioning) will be required.<br><br>But because MS is so variable, what you are able to do and for how long<br>will also vary. Listen to your body and don't push yourself.<br><br>Enjoy your life, but maintain sensible limits.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
