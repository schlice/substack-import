<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **Can I call it consensual rape because I let him do as he pleased and<br>> didn\'t put up a fight, even though I didn\'t want it?**<br><br>There is a lot of confusion among my esteemed colleagues as to whether<br>or not this is rape.<br><br>The answer is *it depends*.<br><br>The reason is because what you're referring to is what we call<br>"affirmative consent." You did not provide affirmative consent, but<br>you did not also reach the legal level under which the entire<br>country considers to be rape: as [[Matthew<br>Bates](https://www.quora.com/profile/Matthew-Bates-27)]{.qlink_container}<br>indicated: you are of legal age and sober, and you did not say "no" or<br>some form of "no," and you did not physically indicate no by pushing<br>away or kicking away.<br><br>Therefore, *you did not say no, but you also did not say yes.*<br><br>Whether or not a lack of affirmative consent constitutes rape will<br>[[depend on where you<br>are](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ba3431&url=http://affirmativeconsent.com/affirmative-consent-laws-state-by-state/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="affirmativeconsent.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>Currently, California has a college and high school affirmative consent<br>law signed. Louisiana, Indiana, and Virginia have college affirmative<br>consent laws, but not high school. Illinois, New York, and Connecticut<br>have general affirmative consent laws in place (i.e. not<br>school-related). All other states either have no affirmative consent, or<br>legislation pending.<br><br>So your actions, depending on whether or not your state requires<br>affirmative consent, and whether or not you are in school, *may* be<br>considered rape if you were in a state that has some form of affirmative<br>consent law in place and your situation meets those state requirements.<br>Otherwise, if you didn't say no or otherwise indicate no, it's not rape.<br><br>And also, there is no such thing as "consensual rape." It is, or it<br>isn't.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
