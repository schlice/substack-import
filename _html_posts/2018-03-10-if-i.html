<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If I\'m getting pulled over, but the road is very poorly lit and the<br>next well-lit area is five miles away, would it be legal to pull over<br>five miles down the road?**<br><br>The short, uninformed, simple answer is no, it is not legal.<br><br>This simply means that in most jurisdictions (there may be some out<br>there that have been modifed), there is no law which allows you to<br>determine that the area in which you are being stopped is unsafe, so you<br>can proceed to an area you think is safer.<br><br>Legally-speaking, any time you attempt something like this, you risk<br>being charged with failure to stop, since like we mentioned, the law<br>doesn't allow for your choice.<br><br>But reality is ever-changing, and the law doesn't always keep up with<br>it.<br><br>If you feel so strongly that you cannot stop because you believe it is<br>unsafe, your best bet would be:<br><br>- Slow down, move over towards the shoulder, turn on your hazard<br>  flashers.<br>- Immediately call 911 and inform the dispatcher of the situation<br><br>If you can't do both of these things together, I would suggest stopping<br>but telling the officer of your concern as soon as he makes it to the<br>window. Telling him something like, "I think it would be safer for both<br>of us if we proceed down the road to the next well-lit area" is an idea.<br>Remember that legally it's up to the officer where you stop, not you, so<br>he may refuse your request, and you'll have no choice but to be<br>uncomfortable with his choice of stopping location. You can always feel<br>free to report him to his supervisor if you believe his conduct was<br>incorrect at best, or violated department policy at worst.<br><br>Again, you must understand that there is no law which allows you to do<br>this, but common sense (and current events) necessitate a deviation from<br>what is written in the law. *Even if you're right*, you can still be<br>charged with failing to stop. If you have a good lawyer, you may be able<br>to get that charge dropped for those reasons, if it's well-argued and<br>you did everything else you were told to do.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
