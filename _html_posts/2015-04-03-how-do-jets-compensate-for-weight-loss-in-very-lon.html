Controlled<br>flight means (among other things) keeping these forces in balance.\<br>\<br>Addressing your question, when weight decreases, and all else is equal,<br>you must decrease lift in order to maintain altitude. This can be done<br>in a number of ways:\<br>\<br><br>- Change the AOA of the aircraft<br>- Decrease throttle<br><br>\<br>When an aircraft is on a long-distance flight, based on what we\'ve<br>discussed, the aircraft will slightly gain lift, and so must compensate.<br>Under normal circumstances, this would mean throttling back to decrease<br>lift. However, aircraft are expected to keep up a certain speed to avoid<br>interaction with other aircraft in the same flight lane. ATC may make an<br>aircraft speed up to maintain spacing, in which case it will have to<br>speed up and change AOA to maintain its altitude.\<br>\<br>In practice, once the aircraft reaches cruising altitude, it will enable<br>autopilot to keep it on the same heading and altitude. Since autopilot<br>controls the yoke, not the throttle, autopilot would adjust the AOA to<br>maintain altitude. The autopilot works in conjunction with the<br>autothrottle in speed mode to maintain the aircraft\'s speed.\<br>\<br>So to answer the question, in practice, autopilot and autothrottle will<br>keep the aircraft straight, level, and at speed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
