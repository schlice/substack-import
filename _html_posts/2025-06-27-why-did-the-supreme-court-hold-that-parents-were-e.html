<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why? It's simple. The parents argued that without an opt-out provision,<br>their First Amendment religious freedoms were violated.<br><br>Writing for the court majority, Justice Samuel Alito agreed, saying<br>parents challenging the board\'s introduction of the<br>\"LGBTQ+-inclusive\" storybooks, along with its decision to withhold<br>opt-outs, are allowed to excuse their children from the classes related<br>to the books while the litigation proceeds.<br><br>Alito wrote, \"The parents are likely to succeed on their claim that the<br>Board\'s policies unconstitutionally burden their religious exercise.\"<br><br>The school board, for its part, noted that it did initially allow<br>opt-outs from specific lesson plans, but it removed that ability when it<br>became too onerous and disruptive to manage all of the opt-outs. The<br>board argued that while it is easy enough to facilitate single-class<br>opt-outs, as the school district provides for sex education, it is much<br>more challenging to take children from the classroom every time that a<br>book mentions same sex parents or gay and lesbian kids.<br><br>To that end, parents are now able to excuse their children from those<br>classes related to those books while the lawsuit regarding opt-outs<br>continues.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
