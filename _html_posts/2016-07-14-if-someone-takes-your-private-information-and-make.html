<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Question Details:*<br>><br>> *For example, if I were to post someone\'s private information and<br>> someone else took that information and used it for identity theft,<br>> would I be legally responsible for both actions? Both civilly and<br>> criminally?*<br><br>A2A<br><br>Short answer: yes and no. Also bear in mind that this is a general<br>answer; laws may be different from state to state. Always consult with a<br>licensed attorney in your area.<br><br>You may be able to make the case in civil court that the person<br>responsible for the leaking of the personal information is financially<br>responsible for the damages caused by such a leak. That's not a terrible<br>stretch, and the purpose of the civil court is the renumeration of<br>financial losses, so the case can be made.<br><br>Criminally, you are only responsible for the crime you committed, not<br>the crimes that others commit. You could be charged with criminal<br>negligence in allowing the identity theft to take place, but that's<br>still not a charge of identity theft, because that person did not commit<br>identity theft. Generally, you are only responsible for the crimes you<br>personally commit. There is one exception I know of off the top of my<br>head: the felony murder rule. Let's say you and your four closest<br>friends are robbing a bank in the middle of the night. A security guard<br>startles one of your cohorts and he shoots and kills the guard. All five<br>of you are on the hook for the murder. If, during the commission of a<br>felony, a murder is committed, everyone committing the felony can be<br>charged with the murder, even though only one person committed the<br>murder.<br><br>Beyond that, you are only criminally responsible for the crime you<br>committed. So the person leaking your personal information would be<br>responsible for whatever crime caused him to come into possession of<br>your personal information in the first place, and possibly criminal<br>negligence in allowing the identity theft. The person who took the<br>information and committed identity fraud would be responsible criminally<br>for the identity fraud.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
