<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because a "sophisticated being created in the very image of God" also<br>has free will.<br><br>Additionally, temptation is not a sin. Even Jesus was tempted, and He<br>lived a sinless life.<br><br>The serpent *deceived* Eve by tempting her. It's a common tactic used by<br>Satan all the time.<br><br>But while *temptation* is normal and expected, *acting on temptation* is<br>abnormal and unexpected (when that temptation leads us to sin).<br><br>Eve sinned because she was na√Øve. She believed that the promise of<br>knowledge was better than believing God's promises.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
