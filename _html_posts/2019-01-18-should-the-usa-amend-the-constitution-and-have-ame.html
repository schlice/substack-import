<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should the USA amend the Constitution and have amendments to the<br>Constitution added by a two thirds majority vote of the whole population<br>instead of the current system?**<br><br>Yes. We should do this at the same time that we amend the Constitution<br>to repeal Article II, Section 1, and the relevant section of the 12th<br>Amendment which allows for the Electoral College. That way, not only can<br>we have a direct popular vote to amend the Constitution, but we can have<br>a direct popular vote for President, instead of this whole outdated<br>Electoral College thing.<br><br>You'll still need to get such an amendment passed under the current<br>rules (2/3 majority in both houses of Congress or a Constitutional<br>Convention called by 2/3 of the states, and the amendment ratified by<br>3/4 of the states) to make it pass.<br><br>So 38 states will have to vote to give up their sovereignty in order to<br>pass this amendment. I'd say your amendment has a snowball's chance in<br>Hell of passing, but that's giving the amendment too much credit.<br><br>While you're at it, you should probably add the following amendments,<br>too:<br><br>- Get rid of states. Call them "provinces" or "Federal operating<br>  regions," but get rid of them altogether. No more state Constitutions.<br>  One Federal constitution. One set of Federal laws that applies to<br>  everyone. That's more fair, isn't it?<br>- In order to get 2/3 of the whole population to vote, you're going to<br>  have to make it mandatory to vote. While only 2/3 of the country is<br>  eligible to vote (it was estimated in 2016 that 250,056,000 citizens<br>  were eligible to vote), only 55% of that number, or 138,847,000,<br>  actually did vote. So only half of the eligible voters voted.<br>  Therefore, you will have to make it illegal not to vote if you're<br>  eligible. That will be the only way you can ever get 2/3 of the<br>  country to actually vote.<br><br>All of these have about an equal likelihood of passing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
