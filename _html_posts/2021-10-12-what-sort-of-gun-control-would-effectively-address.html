Criminals can<br>use any variety of tools to commit crimes, and guns have more uses than<br>just committing crimes. Guns make crime *easier*, guns do not make crime<br>*possible*.<br><br>[[Don<br>Woods](https://www.quora.com/profile/Don-Woods-11)]{.qlink_container} is<br>hinting at what we can do to impose better "criminal control" instead of<br>focusing on the tool the criminals use. We can begin with mandatory<br>charges for crimes committed with guns (i.e. charges which cannot be<br>plea bargained away). Criminals use guns to commit crime because they<br>know they'll never be charged with a gun crime. Prosecutors often use<br>the lesser gun charge as leverage to convince criminals to confess or<br>roll over on higher-level criminal bosses. In other words, they offer to<br>waive the gun charge in exchange for testimony against some upper level<br>crime boss. But what this does is make criminals completely fear-free<br>about using guns in their crime.<br><br>Making charges for gun crimes mandatory and not available for plea<br>bargain would be a great first step to getting criminals to stop using<br>guns. Even if the original charge is pled away, the gun charge would<br>remain, and this could be a very powerful disincentive to using guns to<br>commit crimes.<br><br>Secondly, while I am generally opposed to mandatory sentencing, I would<br>be open to it in this case. Removing the ability to plead down a<br>sentence for a gun crime would again increase the penalties for<br>committing crimes with guns, convincing criminals to not do so.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What sort of gun control would effectively address a mother using money<br>from a lawsuit against police buying guns for gang members?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
