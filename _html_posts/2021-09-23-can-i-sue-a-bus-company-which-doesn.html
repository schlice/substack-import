<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer to every legal question is "it depends."<br><br>First of all, does the bus company have an *obligation* to make everyone<br>wear masks? Is there a law in your area? Is there a state-mandated<br>business rule requiring mandatory masking for buses? If there is, the<br>correct method for redress would be to contact your state's agency which<br>implemented that mandate, and advise them of the company not following<br>the mandate.<br><br>If there is no requirement for the bus company to enforce a mask<br>mandate, you're going to have a tough hill to climb in filing a lawsuit<br>against them. Not only are you going to have to prove that they didn't<br>do something that they objectively should have been doing, you're going<br>to have to prove that you were harmed by this policy. Did you get sick<br>because you rode the bus? And more importantly: *can you prove that you<br>got sick on the bus?* I think you'll have a hard time making that case.<br><br>Anyway, the only way to know for sure if you have a case is to contact a<br>personal injury attorney in your area if you are claiming that you were<br>harmed by the lack of masks and you can prove that you were harmed on<br>the bus.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can I sue a bus company which doesn\'t enforce passengers wearing masks?<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice. This answer is for GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.<br>Seek the advice of a licensed attorney in the appropriate jurisdiction<br>before taking any action that may affect your rights. If you believe you<br>have a claim against someone, consult an attorney immediately, otherwise<br>there is a risk that the time allotted to bring your claim may expire.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to legal questions are intended<br>third-party beneficiaries with certain rights under Quora\'s* [[*Terms<br>of Service*](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
