<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The only reason a police officer would ask for your consent to search<br>your home or property is because they don't have a warrant.<br><br>If they have a valid warrant, they don't need your consent. The only<br>reason they would ask you anything at all is so they don't break your<br>doors down.<br><br>And I'd suggest getting identification before you let anyone you don't<br>know into your house, especially if they're asking to search your house.<br>And in that case, you should be asking to see their warrant.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
