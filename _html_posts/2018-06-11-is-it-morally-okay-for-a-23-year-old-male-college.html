Morals are derived from your<br>upbringing and perhaps your religion. Morals are not dictated by<br>society. Morals are yours. What's morally acceptable to you may not be<br>morally acceptable to me, and vice versa.<br><br>Legally, it's a different story. There are no laws about who can date<br>whom, regardless of age. There are indeed laws about sex, and they are<br>different in every state. Usually, the age of consent is 18 in the<br>United States. There may be a "close in age" law which means that you<br>have to be more than X years apart and one person below the age of<br>consent before statutory rape laws kick in, it really depends on the<br>state.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
