<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Well, from your question, you seem to indicate that being<br>"works-focused" is not how God wants us to be. Therefore, as a<br>Christian, I want to live in the way that God wants me to live, which<br>from your question would be not works-focused.<br><br>To use my own understanding instead of how you worded your question, I<br>believe in *sola fide*, which means that we are saved by faith alone. We<br>are not saved by faith plus anything. We are not saved by faith plus<br>works. We are not saved by faith plus membership in the right church. We<br>are not saved by faith plus eating a wafer of bread and drinking from a<br>cup of wine every week.<br><br>The Bible makes it clear that it is faith alone which saves you. *Sola<br>fide* is a key difference between not only Protestants and Catholics but<br>between biblical Christianity and almost all other religions and<br>teachings. All other religions are founded on human achievement, but<br>biblical Christianity is unique in that it is focused on what God has<br>accomplished through Christ\'s finished work, not on anything that<br>humans have done. "Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to<br>him as a gift, but as an obligation. However, to the man who does not<br>work but trusts God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as<br>righteousness\" (Romans 4:4-5). The Bible teaches that we are saved by<br>God\'s grace through His gift of faith (Ephesians 2:8--9), not by our<br>own works as most faiths and cults instruct their followers.<br><br>*Sola fide*---the doctrine of *justification* by faith alone apart from<br>works---is simply recognizing what is taught over and over in Scripture:<br>at some point in time God declares ungodly sinners righteous by<br>*imputing Christ's righteousness to them* (Romans 4:5, 5:8, 19). This<br>happens without any works and before the individual actually begins to<br>become righteous (a process we call *regeneration*). This is an<br>important distinction between Catholic theology that teaches righteous<br>works are meritorious towards salvation, and Protestant theology that<br>affirms the biblical teaching that good works are the *result* (and<br>evidence) of a person who has been *justified* by God and *regenerated*<br>by the power of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>Let's repeat that last line in another way: *good works are a result of<br>God's grace; God's grace is not a result of good works.*<br><br>That's not to say that people who are not saved do not do good works;<br>they absolutely can, and very often do. It *is* to say that those good<br>works do not *earn* you God's grace. It is *faith alone* which earns you<br>that grace. It is *faith alone* that justifies you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
