Therefore, you will never have "solid<br>evidence" that Kavanaugh didn't do something.<br><br>You can only prove a positive. You can prove that Kavanaugh did<br>something, with evidence.<br><br>The FBI, the US Congress, and every news agency in the country has<br>literally been scouring under every rock and shrub looking for *any*<br>piece of evidence to show that Kavanaugh did anything which one person<br>alleged he did.<br><br>After seven background investigations and countless people<br>searching, *not one shred of corroborating evidence has been found.*<br><br>*While it's possible that he could have done it and managed to elude<br>notice by anyone, its just not likely.*<br><br>So on balance, is it right to destroy someone's life and to deny a<br>Presidential nomination simply because of one, unsubstantiated,<br>uncorroborated allegation?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
