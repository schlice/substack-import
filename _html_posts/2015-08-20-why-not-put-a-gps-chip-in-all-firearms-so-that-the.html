title: '"Why not put a GPS chip in all firearms so that the gun would no longer function
  if the chip were removed? If you really want to curb gun violence, why not promote
  that idea?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [First of all, what\'s a GPS chip? Are you talking about<br>the GPS receiver \"chip\" like you have in your mobile phone?\<br>\<br>Okay, let\'s glue a GPS chip to a gun. Now what? It doesn\'t do anything<br>on its own. So you need a battery to power the chip, another smart<br>controller to read the GPS data off of the chip, interpret it,<br>and send it to somewhere where (presumably) someone can do<br>something with it. The myriad of new problems you now have:\<br>]<br><br>- Battery. Where are you going to store the battery? Will it be<br>  removable? What happens if the battery has no juice? Will the gun not<br>  fire? I can\'t rely on my gun if it might not fire.\<br>- Reading GPS data: What component is going to do this? What operating<br>  system? Who is going to maintain it?<br>- Interpreting GPS data: You have a location. Now what? What are you<br>  going to do with that location data?<br>- Sending the GPS data: I presume you think that you\'re going to use<br>  mobile cellular networks to send this data. Who exactly is going to<br>  pay for the monthly service to send this data? And what happens if<br>  you\'re not in coverage? Will the gun not fire? Again, if I can\'t<br>  rely on my gun to fire exactly when I need it to fire, it\'s useless<br>  to me.\<br>- Location to send data: Again, I presume you\'re going to send the data<br>  to some central location. Where is that going to be? What hardware and<br>  storage will that data be located? Will it be tagged with the user ID<br>  and the serial number from the gun? Do you not see a HUGE privacy<br>  issue right here?<br>- Someone to interpret the data: Who, again, is going to pay for the<br>  personnel and infrastructure to interpret the GPS data from 300<br>  million guns?\<br><br>So you took an inherently simple device (a device valued for its<br>reliability and simplicity) and made it infinitely more complex. The<br>beauty of a gun is that it\'s a simple mechanical device. Besides the<br>fact that it would be next to impossible to make a gun that wouldn\'t<br>fire without a working GPS device, it would make it far more expensive<br>and far less reliable.\<br>\<br>It\'s not a matter that we don\'t really want to curb gun violence.<br>It\'s that this proposal is simply just not feasible. It\'s not<br>practical, it\'s not workable, it\'s not sustainable, and it takes a<br>simple mechanical tool and makes it infinitely more complex. It just<br>won\'t work.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
