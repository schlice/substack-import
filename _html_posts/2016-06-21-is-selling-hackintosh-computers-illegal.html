<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>Short answer: yes, selling Hackintosh computers is illegal.<br><br>Longer answer: The EULA for OS X is very clear on how it can be used:<br><br>> The grants set forth in this License do not permit you to, and you<br>> agree not to, install, use or run the Apple Software on any<br>> non-Apple-branded computer, or to enable others to do so.<br><br>It doesn't matter how you purchased the software (if you purchased it at<br>all). You don't actually "own" the software. You are not permitted to<br>run it on "whatever hardware" you like. When you "buy" the software, you<br>are really just buying the right to use it (a license), and you must<br>remain in full compliance of the EULA bundled with the software when you<br>do so. And according to that EULA, it is, for all intents and purposes,<br>illegal to install on any hardware other than Apple hardware.<br><br>The question though was: can you sell it?<br><br>If you ask the courts that handled the Psystar case, ruling in favor of<br>Apple, the answer would be a most definite no.<br><br>Psystar was an interesting case. The company actually sold computers<br>pre-designed to accept OS X as a native operating system. As much as<br>Psystar tried to circumvent the EULA by proving a bundled copy of OS X<br>and not actually installing the software itself, Apple's lawsuit was<br>successful, winning damages and multiple appeals against Psystar, which<br>has since been permanently barred from selling its Hackintosh<br>systems.\[1\](#SYVFF){#cite-SYVFF .citation_link}<br><br>What can happen to you for doing it? Most likely, nothing will happen.<br>Just like most likely nothing will happen to you if you copy a music<br>file off of Pandora and insert it into your personal music collection.<br>But let's look at the unlikely. What could happen? Apple could sue you<br>for violating the licensing agreement. That amounts to breach of<br>contract, copyright infringement, breaches of the DMCA (Digital<br>Millennium Copyright Act), etc. The amount of money it will cost you in<br>legal fees alone would make it prohibitively costly to sell them.<br>Additionally, while Apple \*probably\* wouldn't go after you for<br>building a Hackintosh for your own personal use (they may, and they have<br>the right to do so, so *caveat emptor*), they are far more likely to<br>go after you if you attempt to profit off of the violation of their<br>EULA. Just as if you rip a song from Pandora, make a million copies, and<br>sell them, you're more likely to get sued if you attempt to profit from<br>the theft than if you just build one yourself for fun.<br><br>There is a fundamental difference between OS X and Windows. Microsoft is<br>a software company. They design software which is made to run on a wide<br>variety of platforms. Apple, on the other hand, is a hardware company<br>which also makes value-added software to run on its hardware. Its<br>profits come from the hardware, not the software. This is why Microsoft<br>Office retails for well over \$100, while iWork can be purchased for<br>around \$30, IIRC. If you could run OS X on a PC for around \$30 instead<br>of paying the \$1000 that Apple charges for its hardware, Apple is<br>losing its primary source of revenue.<br><br>So while Microsoft doesn't really care what platform you run their<br>software on, Apple very much does. This is why it is not legal to run OS<br>X on any hardware other than Apple-branded hardware.<br><br>And I definitely wouldn't sell them.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-SYVFF){.citation_index} [[Are Hackintosh Computers<br>Legal? -<br>LockerGnome](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a77599&url=http://www.lockergnome.com/osx/2012/02/24/are-hackintosh-computers-legal/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="lockergnome.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
