<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can, but a "clerical error" is not likely to change the outcome of<br>the ticket.<br><br>If there is a material error on the ticket, such as the wrong license<br>plate, or the wrong make and model of the car, you can claim that it was<br>not actually your car that was stopped, and you may have a claim to get<br>the ticket tossed.<br><br>But clerical errors are not cause to get the ticket thrown. You can try<br>to dispute it, but don't be surprised if the judge lectures you about<br>"being a grown up" or some such similar lecture topic.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
