<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I have a friend who says men should be the protectors. Is there<br>anything wrong in Biblical terms with women being in the military?**<br><br>This is a great question. What does the Bible say about women in the<br>military?<br><br>The Bible doesn't have a lot of entries regarding women in military<br>positions. That's because only men were counted to go to war (Numbers<br>1:2--3, 1 Samuel 8:11, Genesis 14:14--15). Wives and children did not go<br>to war (Deuteronomy 3:19--20). Daughters served in domestic roles (1<br>Samuel 8:13). Women welcomed men back from war, they did not return with<br>them from war (1 Samuel 18:6--7).<br><br>When discussing women in the military, the Bible doesn't rely on *gender<br>roles* as much as it reinforces the role of a *wife* and *mother*. The<br>Biblically-correct interpretation is to understand that the primary role<br>of a woman *in a family* is as a wife and mother. Military service<br>may involve deployments, which would interfere with a married woman's<br>highest responsibility: a wife and a mother. A single woman should have<br>no such duties placed upon her, so it is likely Biblically acceptable<br>for a single woman to be in the military.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
