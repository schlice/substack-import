<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As long as you use the words "should perish" correctly, yes.<br><br>If you mean "Unbelief in Christ should rightly result in the second<br>death in the lake of fire," you're right. If you mean, "I think that<br>those who do not believe in Him should perish," you would be making an<br>incorrect implication about me personally. "Should" in this context does<br>not refer to my desire, it refers to God's imperative.<br><br>Yes, some will not be saved. And yes, those who will be saved are the<br>ones who believe in Him. Logically, therefore, those who will not be<br>saved are the ones who do not believe in Him. He was very clear about<br>this:<br><br>> Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes<br>> to the Father except through me." --- John 14:6 NIV<br><br>But this is by design. He values our free will *so much* that He will<br>allow people to make their own choice about their eternal destiny. We<br>should do no less. We should accept that people should be allowed to<br>make that choice freely.<br><br>But we should ensure that they *know what they're rejecting.* They<br>should understand that they are rejecting eternal life, eternal<br>communion with God.<br><br>I don't have a problem with a person rejecting Him. But know what you're<br>rejecting, and reject it with your eyes wide open.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
