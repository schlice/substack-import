<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [*This is a winning issue in 2016, and will be in 2020.*\<br>\<br>In what universe is this a \"winning issue\"? Obama didn\'t run on a gun<br>control platform; if he did, his presidency would be characterized as an<br>unmitigated failure. States have become more lax in their gun laws over<br>the past 6 years, not more stringent. Obama\'s record on gun control has<br>been abysmal.\<br>\<br>Gun control is political *suicide*, that\'s why no one touches it. Even<br>in the wake of Sandy Hook, the Colorado Planned Parenthood shooting<br>(which is probably as politically-motivated as you can get, although we<br>don\'t know for sure) and the San Bernardino terrorist action, we have<br>nothing. No significant gun control measures at all. Even when Colorado<br>legislators enacted a 10-round magazine limit, they were *recalled*.<br>This would be the time to act, and politicians have done squat. Why?<br>Because gun control is political suicide.\<br>\<br>We have the most left-leaning president we have had since FDR (or<br>Carter) in the White House and he won\'t touch it with a ten-foot pole.<br>I ask again: in what universe is this a \"winning<br>issue\"?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-the-American-government-just-ban-guns/answer/Jim-Ryan-16<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
