<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not at all. But *how* you question is important.<br><br>The other thing to understand is that Christians *should* be prepared to<br>defend their faith, but most are not. Most do not understand enough to<br>be able to articulate what they believe and why. So many Christians will<br>become defensive and fall back on illogical statements like "I believe<br>the Bible is the word of God because the Bible says so." Christians<br>should be prepared to explain why they believe as they do, but many are<br>not.<br><br>This is on them, not on you. Their response indicates their level of<br>understanding of their own faith, and their illogical and sometimes<br>emotional responses exist because your question *convicts them*. They<br>should know how to answer those questions, but they do not.<br><br>Why should they know? Jesus told them they should know:<br><br>> All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking,<br>> correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God<br>> may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. --- 2 Tim 3:16--17 NIV<br>><br>> He answered, "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all<br>> your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and,<br>> 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'" --- Luke 10:27 NIV<br><br>Paul says in his letter to Timothy that the Bible is useful for<br>teaching, training, correcting and rebuking, so that the servant of God<br>may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. Jesus said to love the<br>Lord with all your mind. How do you do that? By learning everything you<br>can, and being prepared to defend your faith, which only increases your<br>own understanding of your faith.<br><br>\<br><br>Accordingly, it would be wrong to denigrate the entire belief system<br>because some adherents are not fully prepared to explain and defend<br>their faith. Every religion has adherents who exercise blind faith, even<br>atheists. I would say *especially* atheists, but that's a question for<br>another answer.<br><br>So back to my opening statement. How you ask is important. If you are<br>asking because you're just trying to find a Christian who is unprepared<br>to answer, that's an issue. But if you are truly questioning, find<br>someone who at least has a modicum of training in apologetics who can<br>attempt to answer your question. It may still be insufficient for you,<br>but at least you'll get *an* answer and it won't be illogical.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
