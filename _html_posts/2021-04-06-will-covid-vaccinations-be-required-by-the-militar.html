<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is an excerpt from my favorite newspaper, Military.com:<br><br>> Despite the popular belief that the Pentagon can inject troops with<br>> anything it wants, military leaders are unable to force service<br>> members to get the COVID vaccinations at this time because the shots<br>> are approved only under an emergency-use authorization. Troops<br>> deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan were required to get a series of<br>> shots against anthrax, but that inoculation was fully approved by the<br>> FDA.<br>><br>> Navy leaders have already openly discussed their desire to make the<br>> vaccine mandatory. Last month, Vice Adm. Andrew Lewis, commander of<br>> the U.S. Second Fleet, told reporters that the Navy is \"probably<br>> going to make it mandatory as soon as we can, just like we do with the<br>> flu vaccine.\"<br>><br>> And the Navy has given ships the OK to relax strict coronavirus rules<br>> if all crew members get vaccinated, including eliminating weeks of<br>> pre-deployment quarantining, enforced social distancing, and<br>> restrictions on port calls and other breaks.<br>><br>> Nearly one-third of troops have turned down the vaccine, Pentagon<br>> officials told lawmakers last month\[1\](#FWTDf){#cite-FWTDf<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>**TL;DR: While troops don't have the ability to refuse a vaccine<br>approved by the DOD, the DOD cannot make a vaccine mandatory when it is<br>only authorized by an Emergency Use Authorization.**<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-FWTDf){.citation_index} [[Military May Revisit Making<br>COVID-19 Vaccines Mandatory After FDA Grants<br>Approval](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=50b396&url=https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/03/01/military-may-revisit-making-covid-19-vaccines-mandatory-after-fda-grants-approval.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="military.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
