<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are some situations where you are legally permitted to resist<br>police arrest?**<br><br>There is no law in any state in which I am aware that allows you to<br>lawfully resist a lawful arrest.<br><br>Whether or not an arrest is deemed lawful is a determination made by the<br>court, not at the side of the road. Therefore, if the officer is<br>operating "under color of law," you must assume the arrest is lawful<br>until you can prove otherwise in court.<br><br>Therefore, you have no legal recourse to resist arrest, since you cannot<br>prove during the situation that an arrest is unlawful. You would have to<br>defend yourself against assault charges in court later on **(which is<br>very rarely successful)**, rather than allowing the arrest to take place<br>and then proving the arrest unlawful and having the entire arrest thrown<br>out.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
