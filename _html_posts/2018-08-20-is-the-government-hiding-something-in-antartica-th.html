<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is the government hiding something in Antartica that they don\'t want<br>us to see? Is that why planes can\'t fly over Antartic?**<br><br>Ice. Lots and lots of ice. That's what the government doesn't want you<br>to see.<br><br>To be more specific, they don't want you to see ice *up close and<br>personal.*<br><br>The problems with overflying the Antarctic:<br><br>1.  Cold weather affecting the aircraft<br>2.  Rescue/recovery efforts over such uninhabited, remote, and<br>    difficult-to-reach areas<br>3.  Commercial aircraft would be required to carry cold weather gear for<br>    all passengers<br><br>You could save thousands of hours of flying time and fuel consumption by<br>going over the poles, but the aircraft requirements to do so, including<br>the increased weight carrying cold weather gear, would limit the number<br>of passengers such a flight could hold, and would be extremely dangerous<br>if an aircraft went down.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
