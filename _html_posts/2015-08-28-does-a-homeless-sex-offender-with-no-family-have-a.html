<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [So what you\'re really asking is, \"Has the sex offender<br>registry actually done any good?\"\<br>\<br>I mean, we don\'t have the \"Convicted murderer registry,\" do we? We<br>don\'t have the \"Convicted Armed Robbery Registry,\" do we? And who<br>knows? We might need those, right? I mean, I think I\'d want to know if<br>my neighbor is a convicted murderer or armed robber.\<br>\<br>First of all, the fact that someone has to register means that there is<br>no possibility for reform, and that is simply not true. Sometimes,<br>people will be added to the registry because they did something stupid.<br>I know of at least one person who was required to register as a sex<br>offender because he was drunk and while stumbling home he decided to<br>relieve himself against a building. A family with small children saw<br>him, and called the police. The public urination charge wasn\'t<br>humiliating enough. The fact that he exposed himself in public meant an<br>automatic requirement to get on the sex offender registry. Because he<br>got drunk and stupid, he\'s ruined for life.\<br>\<br>It\'s for this reason alone that we should get rid of the registry. It<br>is ruining lives.\<br>\<br>But if we\'re not going to get rid of the registry, we need to be<br>reforming who gets put on it. Mandatory registration should only be<br>required of the worst offenders, violent offenders and those who have<br>violated against children (and this doesn\'t include the 18 year old who<br>has consentual sex with a 16 year old after she lied to him about her<br>age. It does mean the over 20-something who has non-consentual sex with<br>a minor).\<br>\<br>Judges need to have flexibility on who gets added to the registry, and<br>understanding the ramifications of adding someone to the registry, they<br>must do so with prudence. And there should be a civilian oversight<br>committee that reviews people added to the registry.\<br>\<br>\<stepping off of soapbox\>\<br>\<br>Now, back to you and your question. What do you tell someone who is on<br>the registry? You\'re right, it is very hard, because once you\'re on<br>the registry, you never get off.\<br>\<br>But who will hire a sex offender? Why not use the registry to your<br>advantage? The registry also shows where sex offenders work; ergo, the<br>registry can show you workplaces that will hire sex offenders. Advise<br>the homeless person to go to the registry and look at the registered<br>offenders in their area and where they work, and then seek out<br>employment from those companies.\<br>\<br>Who else will hire a sex offender? As reported by<br>[sexoffenderjobs.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b06263&url=http://www.sexoffenderjobs.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="sexoffenderjobs.com"}]{.qlink_container}, most companies<br>will not hire sex offenders for minimum wage jobs because there is<br>usually too much customer interaction and they simply can\'t afford the<br>risk. However, all is not lost. Jobs that make from \$10-\$30/hour are<br>generally jobs that require doing some sort of manual labor (if you<br>don\'t have a degree). Reportedly, they will hire \"anyone\" and don\'t<br>really care much about your past. And most of the time, these jobs are<br>simple to get, they just take persistence. So while nearly all minimum<br>wage jobs are out, there are definitely other opportunities. Check the<br>website, they have a pretty comprehensive list of companies that have<br>hired sex offenders in the past.\<br>\<br>How about this one: if a company won\'t hire you, make your own! If<br>you\'re passionate about something, turn that passion into a business!<br>Entrepreneurship is a great way to be your own boss. The sexoffenderjobs<br>website talks about a barber who primarily services Black clients and<br>cuts amazing and beautiful pieces of art into their hair. He charges<br>between \$30 and \$60 per client (which people will gladly pay), and<br>everyone knows he is a convicted sex offender who molested children, but<br>no one cares because his haircuts are just too good to pass up.\<br>\<br>Remember this: If you have a pulse, you have a purpose. You may not know<br>what it is, but you have one. Your job is to find it.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
