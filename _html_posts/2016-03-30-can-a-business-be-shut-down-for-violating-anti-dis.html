<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Your other posters are spot-on. Generally, business regulations do not<br>have the power to close a business because of violations of<br>anti-discrimination laws. They can absolutely use violations of those<br>laws as a basis for filing lawsuits, which will eventually become so<br>costly that it will impact the business financially, rendering it unable<br>to stay open.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
