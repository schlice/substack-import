<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can an HOA threaten to evict people for working from home during<br>the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic?**<br><br>Homeowner's Associations have broad authority to control what happens<br>within their areas of jurisdiction.<br><br>Many HOAs have rules about the kinds of activities that can take place<br>inside of a home when they may impact the outside of the home. For<br>example, if you wanted to open up a barbershop in the garage of your<br>residential home in your neighborhood, the HOA might be concerned with<br>things like increased traffic flow and parking, citing safety concerns<br>about the abnormal amount of traffic endangering children playing in the<br>neighborhood.<br><br>But when everyone is social distancing and the only people with jobs are<br>essential workers or people who can telework or work remotely, the rules<br>should not apply.<br><br>There are always corner cases like this one, but this is exactly that: a<br>corner case. The fact of the matter is that many more people are now<br>working from home, and it doesn't impact the community because they<br>haven't opened a business or increased traffic into the neighborhood.<br><br>If you have a condo complex and, maybe, you have shared Internet<br>bandwidth, you may have to establish a rule that says you must buy your<br>own individual Internet plan so that you don't bottleneck the network<br>for everyone else, but even then, you can work around the issue.<br><br>But enforcing a rule because "that's what the words on the paper say" is<br>stupid. I'm certain those 28 people could get together and file a class<br>action lawsuit against the HOA and collect a tidy sum, get their units<br>back, and get the rule changed, all at the same time.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
