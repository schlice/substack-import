They<br>can even post it online.<br><br>What they *cannot* do is use the picture for commercial gain. If the<br>picture is on their website where they used it to advertise a product or<br>sell something or make money for profit, this is illegal.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not legal advice, nor is it intended to be used as a<br>substitute for legal advice. This answer is for GENERAL INFORMATIONAL<br>USE ONLY. If you have a legal problem which would require legal advice,<br>consult with a licensed attorney in your area.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to legal questions are intended<br>third-party beneficiaries with certain rights under Quora\'s* [[*Terms<br>of Service*](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
