<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [For your convenience, I added \"Hypothetical Scenarios\"<br>to the list of question topics, as this is an absolutely hypothetical<br>scenario.\<br>\<br>The law provides no exceptions to assault (or assault and battery). Any<br>exception you can think of would be an affirmative defense to the<br>charge, not an exception to the law.\<br>\<br>So to answer the specific question, if a police officer asks you to<br>punch them and you do, they can arrest you for assault (and usually<br>assault on a peace officer is an aggravating circumstance).\<br>\<br>You can then use \"he told me to hit him\" as an affirmative defense.<br>You would have to prove that he told you to hit him. I hope one of your<br>friends was recording the whole thing. Ultimately, I don\'t know how<br>much difference it would make in your sentencing.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
