<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Generally, no. There is no law against being a jerk. Your best bet would<br>be to file a complaint with her practice. If she is a solo practice, I<br>would leave the practice and find a new doctor, and write her a bad<br>online review because she is a jerk.<br><br>If her characterization of you led you to suffer some harm (i.e. her<br>characterization of you led you to get fired from a job), this is called<br>\"slander\" and then becomes actionable.<br><br>But beyond that one scenario, just calling you a name is not illegal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
