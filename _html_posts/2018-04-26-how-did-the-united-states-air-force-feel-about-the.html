While most of the details were sketchy<br>and very much made up (I guarantee you there are no basements, let alone<br>sub-basements, under NORAD), I think the crew did a great job.<br><br>And deep down, I really would have loved to work for Don Davis. I think<br>he would have been the best commander ever, and I worked for some<br>stellar officers.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
