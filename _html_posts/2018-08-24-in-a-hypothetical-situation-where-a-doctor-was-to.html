Even<br>in a hypothetical scenario, people are physiologically different, and<br>there will always be one or the other (profession aside) who will have a<br>better chance of surviving.<br><br>Once you rate the percentage chance of survival, if you can only treat<br>one (which is the hypothetical I'm assuming you are referring to), you<br>treat the one with the higher percentage chance of survival.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
