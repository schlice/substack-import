<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How often did NORAD lock the big vault door?<br><br>Not very often. The door only gets locked during an actual threat event<br>against the United States. We simulate locking the door during every<br>exercise, but under most normal circumstances, the doors remain open.<br><br>We also will lock the doors during routine blast door maintenance.<br>There's a large piece of Plexiglas on the back side of both of the<br>doors, so you can see the locking mechanism at work, and you can see the<br>bolts slide into place. It's a surreal feeling being inside the mountain<br>when the doors actually do lock.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
