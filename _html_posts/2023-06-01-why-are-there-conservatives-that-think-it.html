<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because political affiliation says nothing about whether or not you're a<br>Christ-like person.<br><br>You, dear questioner, have conflated "conservatism" with "Christianity."<br>While it's true that most Christians are conservative, it does not work<br>the other way round. Most Christians are conservative because<br>Christianity comports nicely with conservatism: most of the values held<br>by conservatives mirror the values held by Christians.<br><br>However, you don't have to be Christian to be conservative. To wit:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-01b71480a5258cdfa5d4afe19fdb4eef){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-01b71480a5258cdfa5d4afe19fdb4eef" master_w="900"<br>master_h="900"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Ben Shapiro. Conservative, and a Jew.<br><br>Christianity does not hold a lock on conservatism.<br><br>Some conservatives are assholes as people (I'm not talking about Mr.<br>Shapiro, who happens to treat people as they deserve to be treated, even<br>though he is not Christian). Some (other) conservatives treat people<br>like shit. But they're still conservative when it comes to things like<br>defense spending, fiscal policy, social programs, etc.<br><br>Being conservative doesn't mean you're automatically a nice person.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
