<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>"High crimes and misdemeanors" is not a legal term, but a political one.<br><br>Therefore, abuse of power *can* be a "high crime and/or misdemeanor,"<br>and the agency charged with oversight of that office could call for<br>impeachment proceedings if they can *substantiate* a charge of "abuse of<br>power."<br><br>But what, exactly, is "abuse of power?" It can also be called<br>"malfeasance in office" or "official misconduct." It is the commission<br>of an unlawful act, in an official capacity, which affects the<br>performance of official duties. It is also using official power for<br>personal gain.<br><br>So in order to substantiate a charge of abuse of power, you have to show<br>that the officiant:<br><br>- Committed an unlawful act in an official capacity<br>- And that this unlawful act affected the officiant's ability to<br>  perform his or her duties<br><br>or that the officiant:<br><br>- Used official powers of the office for personal gain<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
