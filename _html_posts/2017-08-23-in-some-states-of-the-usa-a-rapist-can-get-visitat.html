<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the eyes of the court, a child needs a family. The rapist (for better<br>or worse) is the father of the child. Regardless of how he came to be<br>the father, he is. Since he is the biological father, he retains his<br>right to visitation with his child, because ultimately, it's not the<br>"sensibilities" of the adults which are at issue, it is the needs of a<br>child which are at issue.<br><br>The father can request visitation and it can be granted. Conditions can<br>be applied, and the mother would likely demand such conditions (such as<br>supervision during visitation, etc).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
