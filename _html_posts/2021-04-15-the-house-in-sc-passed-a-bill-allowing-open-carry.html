<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**The House in SC passed a bill allowing open carry of guns without a<br>permit. What are your thoughts on this, now that Tennessee\'s Governor<br>is passing a similar bill?**<br><br>I lived in Colorado for more than 20 years where permitless open carry<br>was legal. Not for me personally (I never open carried in Colorado,<br>always held a CCW). I have never had a problem with others doing it. I<br>see a person with a firearm in a proper holster and I'm proud that we<br>don't deny people the right to carry a firearm if they choose. It<br>doesn't bother me. I saw a guy with a 1911 in a belt slide eating lunch<br>with his family and literally the first thing I thought was, "Man, I bet<br>that barrel gets dirty." But the one that I loved the most was seeing a<br>woman with several kids in line at Sam's Club and a pistol on her hip,<br>and it was no big deal for anyone.<br><br>Now I live in Florida, where there is no open carry, but concealed carry<br>permits are easy and relatively inexpensive to get. Here, if I were to<br>see an open carry weapon, it would be unusual. But it shouldn't be.<br>Someone carrying a gun in a proper holster should not be a threat to<br>anyone.<br><br>To me, it seems the law drives the culture. In this case, the law which<br>bans open carry makes it uncomfortable to see a firearm in public when<br>seeing a firearm should be a non-event.<br><br>So it will be a challenge for SC to go from previously no open carry to<br>open carry. I'm sure they'll get through it though.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
