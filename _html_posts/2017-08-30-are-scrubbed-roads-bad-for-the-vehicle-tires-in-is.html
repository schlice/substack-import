<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>While your picture is incorrect, grooved pavement was something that was<br>[[invented by NASA in the<br>50s](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1255f6&url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/Groove.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nasa.gov"}]{.qlink_container}. The idea is that cutting<br>grooves into road surfaces will funnel excess water away from the road<br>surface where aircraft and spacecraft landing tires make contact with<br>the runway, and would reduce hydroplaning, and thus reduce accidents<br>where aircraft slide off the end of the runway in rainy weather.<br><br>In the 60s, the technology started to make its way onto commercial<br>runways instead of just NASA runways. The airline industry noted that<br>aircraft tire friction performance had increased 200 to 300 percent when<br>using grooved pavement.<br><br>In the late 60s, the technology started to make its way to highways. In<br>California, wet road accident frequency was reduced by 98 percent in<br>some road sections.<br><br>The question related specifically to wear on vehicle tires. Since there<br>is less tire surface impacting the road on a grooved surface, tires<br>should wear less (albeit by a very small amount) as they drive over a<br>grooved surface. Even if grooved road surfaces caused wear to increase<br>(at a small rate, but increase over non-grooved surfaces), the benefits<br>in improving traction and preventing hydroplaning and accidents in wet<br>weather far outweigh any wear issues which would be caused.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
