<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Before you can answer that question, you must answer the question about<br>how we discover truth.<br><br>Buckle up, this is going to be a long one, but it is ***absolutely<br>necessary*** to learn why, in the vast majority of cases, you can't<br>*PROVE* with 100% certainty that someone's opinion is true or false.<br><br>Skip down to the next section if you don't want to learn about the why's<br>behind the answer.<br><br>\<br><br>The process of discovering truth begins with what we call "First<br>Principles." They are "first" because there is nothing behind them. They<br>are self-evident because they are inherent in the nature of reality. You<br>don't "learn" First Principles, you just *know them*. Everyone<br>intuitively knows them, even if they haven't thought about them.<br><br>Two of these principles are the Law of Noncontradiction and the Law of<br>the Excluded Middle. The Law of Noncontradiction says that a statement<br>and its negation cannot both be true at the same time and in the same<br>sense. In simpler terms, something cannot be both A and Not-A<br>simultaneously. So if I say, "This is a cat," then I cannot say of the<br>same creature "This is not a cat."<br><br>The Law of the Excluded Middle tells us that something either *is* or<br>*is not,* and those are the only two possibilites for any one given<br>thing. So for example, a coin can be *either heads or tails*. There is<br>no middle position where a coin is not either heads or tails on any one<br>coin flip. It is either heads or tails. There is no third option. So I<br>can say "I am either wearing a blue jacket or I am not wearing a blue<br>jacket." There is no third option.<br><br>Those First Principles are the tools we use to help us discover truth.<br>But those principles alone cannot tell us whether or not a proposition<br>is true. Let's take a look at an example:<br><br>- All men are mortal.<br>- I am a man.<br>- Therefore, I am mortal.<br><br>The self-evident laws of logic tell us that the conclusion, *I am<br>mortal*, is a valid conclusion. It draws naturally from the premises.<br>This process is called deduction: lining up premises to come up with<br>a conclusion. But in order to provide a *valid* conclusion, deduction<br>relies on the fact that the individual premises are true. Therefore,<br>*IF* all men are mortal and *IF* I am a man, then the conclusion<br>that I am mortal must be true. But the logic doesn't tell us whether or<br>not all men are mortal or whether or not I am a man. Logic by itself<br>can't tell us one way or the other. Let's use a valid argument that<br>isn't true to illustrate the point.<br><br>- All men are four-legged reptiles.<br>- I am a man.<br>- Therefore, I am a four-legged reptile.<br><br>In this case, the logic is correct; the conclusion draws naturally from<br>the premises, but the output is false because the premises themselves<br>are not true, because they do not correspond to reality.<br><br>So logic only gets us so far. Logic can tell us whether or not an<br>argument is true or false, but it can't tell us if the individual<br>premises are true. So how do we know that the premises are true?<br><br>We observe the specifics about the world around us, and we draw general<br>conclusions from those observations. When you observe something<br>repeatedly, you might conclude that some general principle about that<br>observation is true. This method of drawing general conclusions from<br>specific observations is what we call *induction*.<br><br>Most of what we know, we know through induction. In fact, you probably<br>used induction to conclude that the first premise in the incorrect logic<br>above wasn't true, because every man you've ever observed has been a<br>two-legged mammal, not a four-legged reptile. You also used induction to<br>know that the first logic postulate was true, because every man you know<br>of who has ever existed has died, so you know they are all mortal. Those<br>two conclusions (the mammal and the mortal) are inductive conclusions.<br><br>Most importantly, ***what we learn through induction can never be 100%<br>certain.*** It can only be *highly probable.* For example, are you<br>absolutely, 100% sure that all men are mortal? No, because you haven't<br>seen all men die. Maybe someone in the past didn't die, or maybe someone<br>in the future may not die.<br><br>So if information we learn through induction is never 100% certain, can<br>we trust it? Yes, but to varying degrees of certainty. Since no human<br>being possesses infinite knowledge, most of our inductive conclusions<br>can be wrong¹. But even when we don't have complete or perfect<br>information, we can still be *certain enough* about most questions in<br>life to make reasonably certain conclusions. Since virtually everyone<br>has been observed to die, when we conclude that all men are mortal, we<br>can consider that conclusion true *beyond a reasonable doubt*. It's 99+%<br>certain, but not beyond *all* doubt. It does take a small amount of<br>faith to believe it (though not much).<br><br>\<br><br>If you followed along in the last section, good! Establishing the<br>background for the answer is extremely important. If you already know<br>all of that stuff, then that's good too! You have a great foundation in<br>logic and discernment of truth.<br><br>So now that we have the fundamentals out of the way, let's answer the<br>question. **Is it possible to prove someone else's opinion as true or<br>false?**<br><br>The answer is *it depends*. Is their opinion about something we can<br>observe and test? This is the basis of the scientific method. So if<br>their opinion is, "I believe that water at sea level can boil at 90<br>degrees F," we can observe and test that opinion. And in the vast<br>majority of cases, we would say that this opinion would be false beyond<br>a reasonable doubt². We still can't prove that the opinion is 100%<br>false, but it would be false beyond a reasonable doubt because it is<br>testable and observable.<br><br>If their opinion is about something which would be covered by a *perfect<br>induction*, then we can say with 100% certainty that it is true or<br>false. For example, if I held a baseball bat and I said, "I believe that<br>this baseball bat is made of Swiss cheese," we could dissect that<br>baseball bat from top to bottom and discern that it is made out of 100%<br>wood. In that case, we could prove that the opinion is 100% false,<br>but we can only do that in the case of the *perfect induction*, where<br>all the particulars are known.<br><br>But let's say that the person holds the opinion, "I believe that God<br>exists." If God exists, then He is *necessarily* immaterial, so our<br>normal tools of testing, observation and induction cannot be used to<br>test that opinion. So in that case, we would not be able to<br>prove that such an opinion was either true or false³.<br><br>\<br><br>¹ with the exception of the *perfect induction*, where we know all of<br>the particulars. For example, I could say "all of the letters on this<br>page of this book are black," and I could be 100% certain about that<br>because I can observe and verify that all letters on that page of that<br>book are indeed black.<br><br>² It's not *impossible;* at sea level, for water to boil at 90 degrees<br>Fahrenheit, a pressure of approximately 10.2 in Hg (or approximately<br>10.2 psi) would be required. Average air pressure at sea level is around<br>29.92 in Hg. So that would be an *incredibly* low air pressure; not<br>impossible, but highly unlikely.<br><br>³ We can use other tools, such as the tools in philosophy, to *point to*<br>whether such an opinion might be true, or even plausible. We still<br>cannot prove with 100% certainty that God exists, but we can at<br>least say that such an opinion might be plausible.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
