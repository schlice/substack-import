<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I am very sick of life. Sick of having multiple sclerosis and sick of<br>my life and the mess this disease and I have made it. What is the best<br>way to leave?**<br><br>I added Suicide as a topic, since you intimated that you're interested<br>in "leaving life."<br><br>About MS messing up your life, the best thing you can do is to<br>*beat it at its own game*.<br><br>MS tries to mess up your life. Beat it by showing it that it doesn't.<br><br>Oftentimes, when people feel this way, it's because they are isolated<br>and feel like no one else has it quite as bad as they do. I would<br>encourage you especially to find a support group near you. There are<br>many support groups offered by various MS organizations, but here's one<br>way to find them in the US:<br><br>[[Find<br>Support](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=abc4a6&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Resources-Support/Find-Support){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>If that doesn't work, search for support groups near where you live.<br><br>Once you get in with a support group, find ways to cope with the<br>symptoms you have. The neat thing about MS (and also the frustrating<br>thing) is that there is no one symptom which is unique to MS. Every<br>symptom you experience with MS is also experienced with other diseases.<br>So while there may not be an MS group near you, there may be a support<br>group for a different disease which experiences the same symptom. There<br>are coping skills you can learn to help you deal with the symptoms and<br>make them more bearable.<br><br>Lastly, don't give up hope. We are in an amazing time right now in the<br>history of this disease, and we've come so far in our treatment and our<br>research into this disease. Based on current research, I expect that<br>within my lifetime, we'll see something akin to a functional cure (i.e.<br>you still have the disease, but functionally, it has no impact on your<br>life).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
