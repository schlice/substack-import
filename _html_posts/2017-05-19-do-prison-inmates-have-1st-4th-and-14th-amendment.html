<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's go through these one at a time, and understand that these are<br>different in every state:<br><br>- 1st Amendment: While inmates retain this right, it is most definitely<br>  restricted. Prisons generally restrict certain religious practices,<br>  they don't restrict religious belief. For example, some things may be<br>  restricted due to safety in the prison population, such as wearing<br>  certain religious symbols, dietary restrictions, and other practices<br>  which might cause a safety concern in a prison. Prisoners' speech<br>  rights are most often called into question when it comes to sending or<br>  receiving mail, and who and when prisoners can communicate or meet<br>  with. In general, if the prison can show a safety concern served by<br>  the restriction, the prison gets deference.<br>- The 4th Amendment is the one which is probably the most restricted,<br>  both in prison and on parole. Prisoners can most definitely be<br>  searched, physically as well as in their cells, at any time of the day<br>  or night, or in any way which the prison or PO feels is necessary to<br>  promote safety or to ensure the parolee remains in compliance with the<br>  details of their sentence. This is an overriding concern in prisons,<br>  and searching prisoners for contraband is part of that safety<br>  protocol.<br>- However, the courts have found that prisoners do have 14th Amendment<br>  rights, most notably the Equal Protection clause. They are protected<br>  against unequal treatment based on race, color, creed, sex, or<br>  national origin.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
