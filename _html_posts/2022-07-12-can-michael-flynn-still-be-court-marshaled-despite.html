<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: yes, but not for the crime for which he received a pardon.<br><br>Since Flynn is a military retiree and presumably receives retirement<br>pay, he is still subject to the UCMJ. In general, however, the court<br>martial authority is reserved for those who have retired and refuse to<br>return to active duty if they are recalled.<br><br>While the case law surrounding whether or not it is Constitutional to<br>apply UCMJ to retirees is still rolling, even today, currently it is<br>possible that a retiree can be court martialed.<br><br>But when it comes to presidential pardons, they also apply to cases<br>under UCMJ. Therefore, Flynn cannot be court-martialed for the crime for<br>which he has already received a presidential pardon.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
