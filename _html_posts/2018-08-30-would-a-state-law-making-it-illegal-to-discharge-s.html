You can own it, but not fire it.**<br><br>Yes, this is unconstitutional.<br><br>In the same way that a 10,000% tax on ammunition is unconstitutional, a<br>law which states that it is illegal to fire a weapon would violate the<br>right to keep and "bear" arms. Bearing arms implies the potential use of<br>that firearm, not just holding them and carrying them.<br><br>If a law prevents a gun from being used for a lawful purpose, that would<br>be considered an unconstitutional law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
