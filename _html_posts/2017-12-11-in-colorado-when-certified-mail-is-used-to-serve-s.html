<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In Colorado, when certified mail is used to serve someone with a<br>traffic ticket, do they have to sign for it to be considered served?<br>What laws and/or case law govern this matter?**<br><br>The only "traffic tickets" which can be served through certified mail<br>are red light camera violations. Initially, these will come through<br>regular mail, with an included option on how to waive your rights and<br>pay the fine.<br><br>But here's the trick:<br><br>***Before you are served, it's not a violation. And if you don't get a<br>certified letter, you're still not served.***<br><br>There are three ways you can be officially served:<br><br>- The citation is handed to you by a police officer or process server<br>- The citation is left at your home with someone who is 18 years of age<br>  or older,<br>- The citation is mailed to you as a certified letter, return receipt<br>  requested.<br><br>Colorado Revised Statute 42-4-110.5 requires that, in the case of a<br>traffic violation detected by an "automatic vehicle identification<br>system" (like a traffic camera), the city must "serve the penalty<br>assessment notice or summons and complaint for the alleged violation on<br>the defendant no later than ninety days after the alleged violation<br>occurred." [[There have been<br>reports](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=22959a&url=http://kdvr.com/2017/09/13/drivers-can-legally-avoid-paying-red-light-camera-citations-in-colorado/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="kdvr.com"}]{.qlink_container} of city agents serving summons<br>at 6 am in some cases, so be aware of that.<br><br>The second notice could come as a certified letter.<br><br>If you don't sign for the letter within 90 days of the alleged offense,<br>the fine is no longer valid. **But if you do sign for the letter, you've<br>been served,** and you are expected to pay. Failing to pay would subject<br>you to civil punishments, not criminal (i.e. it will never add points to<br>your driving record). You could get a negative hit on your credit, and<br>your delinquent payment would be sent to a collection agency.<br><br>\<br><br>*As you know, I am not a lawyer. This is not legal advice.
