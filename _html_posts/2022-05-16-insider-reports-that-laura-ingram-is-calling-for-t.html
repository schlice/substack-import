<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Marshal of the Supreme Court is already investigating. The Marshal,<br>if he finds evidence of criminal wrongdoing, will turn his evidence over<br>to Federal prosecutors. If the Marshal's office needs assistance, they<br>can absolutely call in the FBI as they see fit. But calling on someone<br>else to do the investigation which is already taking place is probably<br>unnecessary.<br><br>But I am noticing that plenty of people are on Quora answering this<br>question and saying that there was no violation of law. That answer is,<br>simply, wrong. Here is just a potential list of crimes which the leaker<br>could be charged with:<br><br>- Disclosure of confidential information (18 USC § 1905) is most<br>  certainly still on the table, as it doesn't require the documents to<br>  be classified to be "confidential." The unfinished work product of<br>  Supreme Court justices is most certainly not eligible for public<br>  release.<br>- A law which came on the books as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of<br>  2002, Corruptly Influencing an Official Proceeding (18 USC §<br>  1512(c)(2)) is on the table if the leaker intended to sway the Court's<br>  opinions using public pressure brought on by the leak.<br>- And while it has only been tried once and the case never concluded, a<br>  determined prosecutor could make the case that Conspiracy to Defraud<br>  the US (18 USC § 371) also applies. In 1919, Ashton Embry, a clerk to<br>  Supreme Court Justice Joseph McKenna, sent an opinion to some Wall<br>  Street executives ahead of a judgment involving a railroad company. He<br>  was indicted for having violated § 371. The prosecution's theory was<br>  that, by releasing the opinion early, the clerk and his<br>  "co-conspirators deprived the Court of the right to announce its<br>  decisions at the customary time." At the very least, the Embry case<br>  puts to rest the argument that law clerks have never been prosecuted<br>  for leaking Court documents.<br><br>There are others, but they are less likely to be able to stick. For<br>example, Theft of Government Documents (18 USC § 1691) may not apply if<br>the clerk didn't actually "steal" the documents because they already had<br>legal access to them. So that one may not stick.<br><br>However, this should at least tell you that when people say that "there<br>is no criminal statute" that makes leaking draft court opinions<br>"illegal," they are simply incorrect.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
