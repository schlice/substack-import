<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Sometimes I don\'t feel the mood to pray.<br><br>Oh, I know that feeling. There are plenty of times that my mind isn\'t<br>in a good place to pray.<br><br>What we must remember during those times is truth. God\'s Word is<br>true. It\'s true whether we feel like it is true or not. It\'s true<br>whether we feel like being obedient or not.<br><br>In other words, *God\'s Word is true regardless of how we feel.*<br><br>And our response to the truth of God\'s Word is praise.<br><br>So if God\'s Word is always true, then it\'s also true that **we are to<br>give Him praise, even in the times we don\'t necessarily feel like it.**<br><br>He is always good, and we need Him when times are good as well as when<br>times are not so good, especially when we don\'t feel like it.<br><br>> I also have a throat disease so I can\'t pray always.<br><br>Sure, maybe you can\'t pray out loud, no big deal! Unlike the demons,<br>God hears your thoughts. The prayers you pray deep in your heart are<br>heard by God. You can rest assured that even if your throat fails you.<br>*God never will.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
