<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What made your military career unexpectedly short?<br><br>*Multiple Sclerosis.*<br><br>The memory issues I had at the beginning of my disease impacted my<br>ability to pass the required PME (professional military education)<br>courses in time, and I hit high year of tenure and was discharged. Three<br>months later, I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis.<br><br>So now, I'm a disabled veteran, receiving benefits from the Veteran's<br>Administration, for my service-connected disability. But because they<br>can't prove that my memory issues caused the PME failures, there will be<br>no medical retirement for me. Just a pat on the back and a "good luck in<br>your future...disease management."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
