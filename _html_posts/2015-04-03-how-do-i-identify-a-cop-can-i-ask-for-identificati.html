<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It\'s unlikely that an ID card gets faked, but it\'s far<br>more likely that a badge or shield gets faked.\<br>\<br>You can always ask for ID, even of officers in uniform. I have never<br>heard of an agency that does not require their officers to carry their<br>ID cards along with their badges. It\'s part of an officer\'s<br>\"credentials,\" or \"creds\" for short.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
