<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Yes, an officer in uniform is not under any obligation to<br>show you his/her ID card unless you ask for it. Otherwise, they\'d wear<br>it instead of a badge.\<br>\<br>Before you open your door, you have the right to ask to see ID at any<br>time of any person claiming to be a law enforcement officer. There is no<br>jurisdiction that I know of that does not require that a police officer<br>carry their ID while in uniform, even if they are wearing a badge. They<br>are required to show you their ID, or you could have a valid suspicion<br>that the person in front of you is just playing dress-up.\<br>\<br>If you ask a police officer for their ID and they do not show you, I\'d<br>call 911 right away. Tell the dispatcher that \"police officers\" are at<br>my house and they did not show me ID when I asked; are these real police<br>officers? The dispatcher will tell you whether or not there are police<br>assigned to be at your residence; if not, they will send real police<br>officers to verify. If they are real police officers, you can treat them<br>as real police officers. Continue to do what they tell you and make sure<br>you file a complaint with the department.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
