If not, why do people still pay<br>them?**<br><br>I think what you're referring to are tickets from "red light cameras."<br><br>In most states, while there is no impact to your *driving record* for a<br>ticket from a red light camera, if you fail to pay the ticket, there<br>will probably be a negative impact on your *credit rating* as your<br>ticket will go to a collections agency.<br><br>If you're pulled over and given a ticket by a police officer for running<br>a red light, you'd better believe that there would be a future effect to<br>your continued driving privilege. Accumulate enough of those unpaid<br>tickets, and you might even spend some quality time in the Gray Bar Inn.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
