<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, you can be sued for slander. The question is, can he collect<br>damages.<br><br>In order for the photographer to collect damages from you, he has to<br>prove that your statement:<br><br>- was false,<br>- affected his business, trade or profession, and<br>- implies he committed a crime, or leads to the conclusion that he has a<br>  loathsome disease (such as a sexually transmitted disease).<br><br>But here's the trick: **the absolute defense to slander or libel charges<br>is the truth.** If, in fact, the photographer had sexual assault<br>allegations made against him, and those allegations can be proven, then<br>the statement you made was not false. Slander (spoken) or libel<br>(printed) require knowingly passing on a false statement. If the<br>statement is provably true, then slander does not apply.<br><br>Slander also only applies when the statement is a false statement *of<br>fact*. If you are passing on your opinion, such as if you told the model<br>that you believed the photographer was unprofessional, or you didn't<br>like working with him, these are not slanderous as they are statements<br>of opinion, not of fact. But because you said that the photographer had<br>a sexual assault allegation made against him (which is a statement of<br>fact), this part does not apply.<br><br>If the statement is actually false, however, the photographer could<br>collect if he can prove that your false statement affected his business.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice.
