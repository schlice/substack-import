<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Bladder problems are a big issue with MS. It\'s one of the most common,<br>actually. Bladder problems are present in around 80% of MS patients.<br>Incontinence is one of the possibilities, but so too is inability to<br>urinate or completely empty the bladder.<br><br>Incontinence can be very effectively treated with medication.<br>There's more than a dozen different medications available to treat<br>incontinence. Talk with your doctor about your symptoms so that the two<br>of you can choose a medication that may be right for you.<br><br>There are other treatments available, including:<br><br>- Physical therapy, including pelvic floor strengtheing<br>- Percutaeneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) is a therapy which has<br>  been shown to reduce urinary frequency, urgency, nighttime urination<br>  and incontinence. In this therapy, a small needle is inserted next to<br>  the tibial nerve in the ankle, stimulating the nerve. Sessions<br>  generally run 30 minutes a week for 12 weeks.<br>- InterStimÂ® is a small device surgically implanted under the skin that<br>  stimulates the sacral nerves and is used to treat overactive bladder,<br>  urinary retention and some types of bowel dysfunction.<br><br>Inability to completely empty the bladder is another MS-related<br>bladder issue which can cause bladder infections and other secondary<br>problems. Besides pelvic floor physical therapy, intermittent<br>self-catheterization can help people who have difficulty emptying their<br>bladder completely. There are also medications available which can help<br>to relax the muscles surrounding the urethra and to aid in stimulation<br>of the muscles around the bladder. Working with your doctor on any of<br>these treatments will be important in finding which one will be right<br>for you.<br><br>Other surgical interventions are also available for when a patient does<br>not respond adequately to any of these therapies.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
