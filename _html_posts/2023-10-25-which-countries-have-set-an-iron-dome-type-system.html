<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>While I can see your leading question, it actually has real answers.<br><br>1.  Azerbaijan. Purchased in May, 2021. Protects from rockets from<br>    Armenia.<br>2.  South Korea. A few months after Azerbaijan's system, South Korea<br>    announced a purchase of their own to defend against North Korea.<br>3.  United States. We have purchased our own version of the Iron Dome<br>    here in the US, based on the same Tamir missiles used in Israel. But<br>    it doesn't look like we're going to take delivery, as it appears<br>    that Israel needs those missiles.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
