<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would increased enforcement of existing gun laws create reductions in<br>US gun crimes?**<br><br>Yes, in general. But while *Project Guardian,* the program proposed by<br>the Attorney General, is functionally workable, it is not necessarily<br>the "right" way to go about it.<br><br>First, let's provide a little background. When a person is charged with<br>a gun crime, it is usually in conjunction with another crime (i.e. drug<br>trafficking, robbery, etc). Prosecutors will *very frequently* plea<br>bargain the gun charge away in exchange for cooperation on the main<br>charge. And criminals know this. They will often agree to increased<br>cooperation in exchange for dropping the gun charge.<br><br>So when we talk about "enforcing existing gun laws," this is<br>specifically what we mean.<br><br>We also know that while criminals may be misguided and often have moral<br>failings which prevent them from fully appreciating the harms they<br>cause, they are often not stupid. If they knew that they'd go to jail<br>for a minimum of five years mandatory just for doing the crime *with<br>a gun*, they'd seriously think twice about doing the crime with a gun.<br><br>Project Guardian is one of [[a number of Federal<br>programs](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7b09bb&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States%23Gun_buyback_programs){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} over the years which<br>encouraged cooperation between Federal, State and local law enforcement<br>to bring Federal gun charges against criminals who use guns in the<br>commission of violent crime.<br><br>From the quoted article:<br><br>> As part of the program, U.S. prosecutors will coordinate with state<br>> and local law enforcement officials to consider potential federal<br>> charges when a suspect is arrested for weapons possession, is believed<br>> to have used a gun to commit a violent crime or drug-trafficking<br>> offense or is suspected of being a violent gang member.<br><br>We know this works. [[Project<br>Exile](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d23bb1&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Exile){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} proved that this strategy<br>of Federal gun charges and working with state and local officials to<br>bring those Federal charges works. Richmond (where Project Exile was<br>tested) saw some of the largest decreases in gun crime ever:<br><br>> During the first year of Project Exile (1998), homicides in Richmond<br>> declined 33%, for the lowest number since 1987, and armed robberies<br>> declined 30%. In 1999, homicides declined another 21%.<br>><br>> By 2007, homicides in Richmond were down to 57 compared to 122 in the<br>> year before Project Exile\[1\](#qBHuQ){#cite-qBHuQ .citation_link}<br><br>While it is true that violent crime was declining in the United States<br>during that same time period, Richmond's decline was so sharp and so<br>sustained that it is generally presumed to be a result of Project Exile.<br><br>Ideally, states should be enacting rules similar to what the Feds are<br>doing: mandatory sentencing, no plea bargaining of gun charges,<br>mandatory charging of a gun crime when a gun was used to commit a crime,<br>etc. These should be implemented by all of the states individually.<br>Until that eventuality comes to pass, however, this program will have to<br>do. And it's a great start and a good way to get the states acting in<br>the right direction as well.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-qBHuQ){.citation_index} [[Project Exile -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d23bb1&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Exile){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
