<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Absolutely. Income inequality is a good thing, and your own life proves<br>it.<br><br>I know no one like to watch videos, but please take five minutes out of<br>your life and watch this video. It's narrated by John Tamny, who is the<br>editor of RealClearMarkets:<br><br>[https://youtu.be/1e35Vf-9n8E(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a300b1&url=https://youtu.be/1e35Vf-9n8E){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>If you won't take five minutes to watch the video, then read the<br>transcript (emphasis mine):<br><br>> There has been a lot said and a lot written about income inequality --<br>> about how unfair it is that a few people are very rich and the rest of<br>> us aren't; that the income gap between the wealthy and even the<br>> middle-class, let alone the poor, is so large.<br>><br>> There's only one problem with this complaint.<br>><br>> It's wrong.<br>><br>> Income inequality is actually a good thing \-- *when* **it is<br>> the product of a free market economy. And your own life proves it!**<br>><br>> An economy is made up of millions of individuals making decisions<br>> about their own lives -- where and how much they want to work, what<br>> they want to buy, and so on. You are one of those individuals. In a<br>> country like the United States, you are free to pursue a path in life<br>> that you believe best suits your talents. That talent might be<br>> teaching, or making music, or banking, or starting a small business,<br>> or raising a family. Whatever it is, this freedom helps to make life<br>> enjoyable, exciting and meaningful.<br>><br>> But it's also an expression of inequality. This is simply because<br>> we're all different. We have different talents, different<br>> temperaments, different ambitions.<br>><br>> That's okay because -- again in a free society -- **we can seek out<br>> opportunities that play to our personal strengths**; that distinguish<br>> us from others.<br>><br>> If you find what you're really good at and work hard, you might have<br>> great success and make a lot of money. If you're an outstanding<br>> athlete, I'll buy a ticket to see you play. If you're a savvy<br>> investor, I'll give you some of my money to invest.<br>><br>> **As long as you have the freedom to guide your own destiny, you have<br>> a chance to reach your full potential -- achieving success, however<br>> you define it**. But if someone, say, a government bureaucrat, told<br>> you that your ambition had limits, that there was a ceiling above<br>> which you could not rise, I doubt you'd be happy about it. You'd feel<br>> like you were in a straitjacket.<br>><br>> **Forced equality means less opportunity to pursue what makes you<br>> individually great.**<br>><br>> But what about the growing gap between the rich, the 1%, and the rest<br>> of us, the 99%, that one hears so much about? Isn't that a bad thing?<br>><br>> Again, the answer is no.<br>><br>> Here's why:<br>><br>> In a free market economy people become wealthy making what the rich<br>> enjoy today into something almost everybody can enjoy tomorrow. The<br>> rich are the test buyers.<br>><br>> Consider the cell phone. Now we all have them, but when Motorola<br>> manufactured the first one in 1983 it was the size of a brick, had a<br>> half-hour of battery life, reception was terrible, and calls were very<br>> expensive. It cost \$4000. But if no one had bought that \$4000 brick,<br>> there wouldn't be a \$40 cell phone today.<br>><br>> In the 1960's a computer cost over a million dollars. Nowadays, thanks<br>> to billionaires like Michael Dell, we have incredibly advanced<br>> computers that cost us a few hundred dollars.<br>><br>> Remember what an out-of-reach luxury flat screen TV's once were? Only<br>> the rich could afford them. Today your living room is essentially your<br>> own private cinema.<br>><br>> The free market is about turning scarcity into abundance. What was<br>> once available to the few is now available to the many. Wealth<br>> inequality is an important corollary to that truth.<br>><br>> So, should I resent the people who became wealthy because they have<br>> more money than I do, or should I be grateful for the economic system<br>> that allows them to enrich my life and the lives of millions of other<br>> people?<br>><br>> This feature of the free market -- income inequality -- can appear<br>> terribly unfair. But with a little further investigation, the real<br>> picture becomes clear. Income inequality makes what once seemed like<br>> impossible luxuries available to almost everyone; it provides the<br>> incentive for creative people to gamble on new ideas; it promotes<br>> personal freedom, and rewards hard work, talent, and achievement.<br>><br>> In sum, income inequality signals that individual liberty,<br>> opportunity, and innovation are all present in a free economy. Pretty<br>> good for something that's supposed to be so bad.<br>><br>> Two final points:<br>><br>> The 1% Club is always open to new members. And you don't have to be in<br>> the top one percent to have a very good life. And that, not the<br>> existence of the very wealthy, is what matters<br>> most.\[1\](#hHhPG){#cite-hHhPG .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-hHhPG){.citation_index} [[Income Inequality is<br>Good](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=90df1b&url=https://www.prageru.com/courses/economics/income-inequality-good){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="prageru.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
