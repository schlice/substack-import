<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why would you be sad? They made a choice. They made an active,<br>knowing-full-well choice to reject God. They looked at what God was<br>offering and what Satan was offering and they knowingly chose what Satan<br>was offering.<br><br>They exercised their free will. Why would that make you sad?<br><br>They chose their fate. They chose a little temporary pleasure on earth<br>instead of everlasting communion with God. They knew what they were<br>doing, as the truth is written on the hearts of all people:<br><br>> Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things<br>> required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they<br>> do not have the law. They show that the requirements of the law are<br>> written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and<br>> their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even<br>> defending them. --- Romans 2:14--15 NIV<br>><br>> For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel<br>> after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my law within them,<br>> and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they<br>> shall be my people. --- Jeremiah 31:33 ESV<br>><br>> "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days,<br>> declares the Lord: I will put my laws on their hearts, and write them<br>> on their minds," --- Hebrews 10:16 ESV<br><br>And even if they ignore what is written on their hearts, they cannot<br>ignore what is all around them:<br><br>> For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities---his<br>> eternal power and divine nature---have been clearly seen, being<br>> understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.<br>> --- Romans 1:20 NIV<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
