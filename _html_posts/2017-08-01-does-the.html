<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The 25th Amendment was designed to lay out the succession of power<br>should the president become unable to carry out his duties.<br><br>Congress does not need to be involved in the approval unless the<br>President is upright and breathing and still retains his faculties.<br><br>The VP, and a majority of the Cabinet, tells the Speaker of the House<br>and the President pro tempore of the Senate that the VP is taking over<br>as President, and they are done. The amendment does not require<br>Congress' approval.<br><br>Section 4:<br><br>> Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal<br>> officers of the executive departments or of such other body as<br>> Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of<br>> the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their<br>> written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the<br>> powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately<br>> assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.<br><br>Then, the President gets to rebut the claim, and the original group gets<br>to rebut the rebuttal:<br><br>> Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore<br>> of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his<br>> written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the<br>> powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a<br>> majority of either the principal officers of the executive department<br>> or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within<br>> four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker<br>> of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the<br>> President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.<br><br>*THEN*, it goes to Congress to decide if the President is really<br>unfit to serve. They have to approve the usurper's claim with a<br>supermajority (2/3 in both Houses) before the usurpation sticks.<br><br>So "someone authorized by law" says "You are unable to serve." President<br>says, "No I'm not," and the usurper says, "Yes you are." Then Congress<br>decides who is right.<br><br>"Unfit to serve" means physically incapable of carrying out the duties<br>of the office. It doesn't mean doing so *poorly*. It means being<br>*unable to do so at all.* The President can be embarrassing or crude<br>or even irreverent. None of that is grounds for removal from office<br>under the 25th Amendment. And Congress knows it. You'll get a lot of<br>Democrats to go along with it, but with both houses controlled by<br>Republicans, you'll never get a supermajority out of Congress for this.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
