<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The only difference between the two is the process by which<br>investigations happen.<br><br>The cop has to go through more investigation that the civilian does. The<br>District Attorney will review the shooting and will determine whether or<br>not charges will be brought. Even when the DA finds that the shooting<br>was in self-defense and chooses not to press charges, the cop will face<br>an internal Use of Force (UOF) review, whereby the cop\'s reports will<br>be scrutinized by his/her chain of command. They will ensure that the<br>force was reasonable, was within department UOF policy, and whether or<br>not any disciplinary or retraining actions need to be taken. Even if the<br>cop is not tried in criminal court, he could still face disciplinary<br>action within his department for violations of policy.<br><br>The civilian will only face the DA. If the DA decides that no charges<br>will be filed, the civilian does not face any other reviews.<br><br>Granted, I was not discussing civil lawsuits for wrongful death, but<br>those follow. The difference there: if the officer was acting within the<br>confines of his department\'s rules, he will be represented by the<br>department\'s attorney. A civilian would have to find his own counsel to<br>represent him in a civil suit.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
