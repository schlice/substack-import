The police presence does not cause<br>crime. The police are called after something already happens. The police<br>are called after the crime happens, not before. The police aren\'t<br>roaming around the neighborhood saying, \"hey, let\'s find a little<br>black kid to kill.\" If you really believe this, then there is nothing<br>that can convince you that the boogeyman isn\'t right around the corner<br>waiting to snatch you away in the night and throw you back into the<br>chains of slavery.\<br>\<br>Really?\<br>\<br>I thought race relations have come so much farther than that in the last<br>70 years.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-is-it-that-it-doesnt-even-make-sense-to-try-Darren-Wilson-in-a-court-and-let-a-real-jury-decide/answer/C-Lang-17<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
