<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The simple answer:<br><br>Murder is defined as \"the *unlawful* taking of a life with<br>forethought and malice.\" An execution is not murder because the taking<br>of the life is not unlawful.<br><br>Execution is a lawful taking of life because it follows a legal process<br>documented in state law. Therefore, execution, when conducted by a state<br>after the state-determined process is completed (in accordance with the<br>law), does not meet the standard of murder.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
