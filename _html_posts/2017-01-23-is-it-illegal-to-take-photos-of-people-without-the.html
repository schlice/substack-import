<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer, as with all things legal, are "it depends." Also, this<br>answer is specific for the United States.<br><br>The biggest things that will determine whether or not someone can be<br>photographed legally:<br><br>- Where the person is at the time you take the picture<br>- If they were in a public place, what you intend to do with the photo.<br><br>If you are in a public place, or a place with no reasonable expectation<br>of privacy (i.e. a sidewalk), you can pretty much take a picture of<br>anyone. There are some rules about when a person may not be in a public<br>place, so your mileage may vary, but in general, if you're just out in<br>public, you can photograph anyone. States vary on whether or not a<br>particular location is subject to the reasonable expectation of privacy<br>rule. If a person is in a house, but is standing in front of an open<br>window, most states say that this does not constitute a reasonable<br>expectation of privacy, while some do.<br><br>You can also pretty much do whatever you like with that photo (even post<br>it online), assuming you don't:<br><br>- attempt to sell the picture for profit,<br>- or miscategorize the person with the picture, or claim something false<br>  about the person (called slander or libel), which causes them<br>  demonstrable harm by your categorization of them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
