<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You shouldn\'t have to be responsible for the actions of<br>another human being. You are not their parent, you are their spouse.\<br>\<br>The only way that I would consider taking any responsibility for that<br>person\'s actions is if I specifically told that person that whatever<br>activity they were doing was perfectly legal. If I was personally<br>misinformed about the law, and then I told that person that their action<br>was legal, I might then feel partially responsible for that person\'s<br>illegal activities.\<br>\<br>You shouldn\'t blame yourself, and you shouldn\'t feel responsible for<br>the actions of another person. Each person has the ability, and the<br>responsibility, to act in accordance with the law. Each adult personally<br>shares the responsibility to understand what the local laws are and to<br>act accordingly. It\'s part of the social contract, part of the<br>responsibility we take on when living in a society and a nation of<br>laws.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
