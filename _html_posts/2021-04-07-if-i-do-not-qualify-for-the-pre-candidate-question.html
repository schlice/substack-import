<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If I do not qualify for the Pre Candidate Questionnaire for the Air<br>Force Academy, does that mean I am disqualified from applying or can I<br>still attempt to apply?**<br><br>In order to complete the Pre Candidate Questionnaire, you need the<br>following information:<br><br>- Full legal name, birth date and Social Security number<br>- Mailing address, home phone and email address<br>- High school name, class size<br>- Class rank and grade point average (on a weighted 4.0 scale)<br>- \*One or more test scores: PSAT, PreACT, SAT and/or ACT<br><br>I don't know which one of these you don't have, but let's just assume<br>for a moment that it's the standardized test, since that's the most<br>common one that candidates are missing. You must submit a standardized<br>test score in order to submit the Pre Candidate Questionnaire.<br><br>Unfortunately, if you have not taken the SAT, ACT, PSAT, or PreACT, you<br>cannot apply for the Air Force Academy. However, it's really easy to<br>take them. Just search "take the PSAT" in Google and you'll get all the<br>information you need to take it. You need to take one of those tests and<br>you need to have a competitive score in order to be accepted.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
