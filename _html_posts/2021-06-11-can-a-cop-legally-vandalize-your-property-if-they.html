<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a tough question to answer, because when the police are done<br>with a search warrant, they are under no obligation to put anything back<br>that they tore apart. So it sure looks like someone vandalized your<br>property.<br><br>But where they look and how much they tear apart is dependent on what<br>they are looking for.<br><br>For example, if they are looking for something the size of a 65″ TV,<br>they won't ransack your dresser drawers, because you can't fit a 65″ TV<br>in a dresser drawer. They can't break open a table lamp to search for a<br>TV. But if they're looking for something the size of, say, a ring box or<br>a thumb drive, they can go through *everything*. And like I said, they<br>don't have to put anything back the way they found it when they're done.<br>They can dump the contents of all of your dresser drawers on to the<br>floor to search, and they don't have to fold your clothes and put them<br>away when they are concluded with their search. If anything breaks while<br>they are executing the search, they will not fix it; you will usually<br>have to pursue legal action to get the item's cost reimbursed.<br><br>And if, for example, they find a locked room, they should give you the<br>option to open it before they break down the door.<br><br>Ultimately. their actions must be *reasonable*. They can't intentionally<br>destroy *everything* while they're looking for *something*.<br><br>So in a way, yes, a cop can legally vandalize your property if they have<br>a warrant to search your house, but it's more nuanced than that.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can a cop legally vandalize your property if they have a warrant to<br>search your home?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
