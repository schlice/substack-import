<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Violence is a subset of evil, and God didn't create evil.<br><br>*WAAH BUT GOD CREATED EVERYTHING!*<br><br>Yes but evil isn't a "thing" which can be created. Evil is a state of<br>disobedience to God's will. Evil is an absence of good. For example, we<br>all know that holes exist, but you can't "create" a hole. You make a<br>hole by removing dirt. So while a hole exists, it's not created. It's<br>just an absence of something else. You can't have a hole without<br>something else within which a hole exists.<br><br>Evil is the same way. Evil wasn't explicitly created. It was always a<br>possibility for creatures who have free will. The angels who have free<br>will also chose evil by disobeying God, and they were cast out of heaven<br>into the place especially created for them --- hell.<br><br>So all that was needed for evil to occur was to have a created being<br>with the capacity to choose to do good (by obeying God) or evil (by<br>disobeying God).<br><br>When Adam and Eve disobeyed God, committing the world's first sin, they<br>were cast out from the Garden, and they physically changed. They knew<br>the pain of childbirth. They knew sickness, disease, and ultimately<br>death, after they sinned and introduced sin into the world. We all live<br>in a fallen state because of that choice.<br><br>Violence is a result of evil, which is a result of us living in a fallen<br>world, in fallen bodies. God didn't create that because **He didn't have<br>to create it**. It's a natural consequence of choosing to disobey God<br>and thus living in a fallen world.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
