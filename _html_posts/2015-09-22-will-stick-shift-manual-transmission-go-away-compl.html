<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [As long as gas-powered engines remain, manual<br>transmissions will remain. Gearheads (or as you call them in the UK,<br>petrol heads) will insist on it. Just ask Jeremy Clarkson, who believes<br>a car just isn\'t a car if it doesn\'t have a \"proper gearbox.\" Even<br>some flappy-paddle manuals are more electronic then electromechanical.<br>Supercars with flappy-paddle shifters are electromechanical. Mid-level<br>sedans with \"auto-manual\" transmissions are just electronic; not a<br>proper gearbox, so to speak.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
