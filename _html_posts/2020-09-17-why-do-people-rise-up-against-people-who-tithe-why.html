<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why do people rise up against people who tithe? Why is there such<br>animosity between the givers and the people who think the church is<br>greedy so they don't give? When will these groups realize with God all<br>things are possible?**<br><br>My guess is that people don't understand that our money is not ours.<br>Everything that we possess is a gift from God. The money we earn is<br>because God allowed it to happen (maybe even enabled it to happen).<br><br>There are plenty of Biblical references that explain that everything<br>belongs to God and we are just stewards of those resources we are given.<br>A few examples:<br><br>> *Beware lest you say in your heart, 'My power and the might of my hand<br>> have gotten me this wealth.' You shall remember the Lord your God, for<br>> it is he who gives you power to get wealth, that he may confirm his<br>> covenant that he swore to your fathers, as it is this day. ---<br>> Deuteronomy 8:17--18 ESV*<br>><br>> *Every tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the<br>> fruit of the trees, is the Lord\'s; it is holy to the Lord. ---<br>> Leviticus 27:30 ESV*<br>><br>> *For every beast of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand<br>> hills. --- Psalm 50:10 ESV*<br><br>We return a portion of that which we steward back to further the<br>kingdom. When we show that we can do this with small amounts, God<br>blesses us abundantly.<br><br>People don't tithe because they are fearful. They are afraid that if<br>they give, then they won't get anything in return. But of course, this<br>stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of who owns that money. If<br>it's God's money and we are just stewards of it, then who are we to say<br>that we should not return a portion of it back to further God's kingdom?<br>If that's the case, we are not very good stewards of what we have.<br><br>It's also a problem of *relinquishing control*. As a Christian, you turn<br>your life over to God. *All of your life,* not just the parts which you<br>find comfortable to give up. This includes control over your finances.<br>You tithe knowing that God will not leave you high and dry.<br><br>I've seen evidence of this in my life. God has always provided when we<br>have been generous with him. He sees we trust him and he blesses us.<br>That control is difficult to relinquish for some.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
