<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I had a good bout of Optic Neuritis which never really fully healed. I<br>still have trouble with fluorescent lighting, and running causes my<br>eyesight to go all wonky and I see double vision. I hate running now.<br><br>I also have weakness on the entire right side of my body. I frequently<br>trip over nothing because I haven't raised my foot up enough. I also<br>frequently drop things from my right hand because my grip isn't as<br>strong as I think it is. Going up stairs is a fun challenge. If I'm not<br>actively concentrating on walking, I'll usually trip.<br><br>I've been fortunate to be on medication from the very first symptom I<br>ever had, so I've been able to at least slow down the progression of my<br>disease. Beyond the symptoms I've described, I seem to have managed to<br>keep my MS from getting worse.<br><br>For now.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
