<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Civilians can indeed be summoned before a military court-martial, if the<br>court determines that the civilian is a material witness and is subject<br>to the jurisdiction of the United States (foreign nationals can<br>participate with the approval of their host nation). Generally, that<br>summons is performed through a subpoena. A subpoena is the normal tool<br>used to bring a witness to trial. The subpoena is not necessary if the<br>witness attends voluntarily.<br><br>If a civilian witness refuses to appear at a court-martial to which he<br>has been subpoenaed, a warrant of attachment may be necessary to compel<br>the witness to appear. It may be issued only when you have probable<br>cause that the witness was actually served with a properly issued<br>subpoena, that fees and mileage were paid to the witness, that the<br>witness is material, that the witness refused or willingly neglected to<br>appear at the time and place specified on the subpoena, and that no<br>valid excuse is given for the witness' failure to appear. The warrant is<br>attached to the subpoena and any supporting documents, and is delivered<br>to the U.S. Marshals Service, who will take the witness into custody,<br>and present the witness to the court.<br><br>Civilian witnesses can be held in contempt of court should they refuse<br>to testify. The witness will be held by the Marshals Service until such<br>time as the person decides to cooperate.<br><br>There are likely reasons that a civilian would not want to testify, such<br>as the testimony might be self-incriminating. Remember that you retain<br>all of your Constitutional rights in a military court-martial. Granted,<br>you don't have Article 31 rights because you're not subject to the UCMJ,<br>but you do have 5th Amendment rights to not incriminate yourself. You<br>should work with the military counsel who subpoenaed you to secure<br>"testimonial immunity" so that you can testify without risking being<br>arrested for what you testified about. But once you get "testimonial<br>immunity," you have to testify.<br><br>Civilian witnesses have the same fears about testifying in a<br>court-martial that they would in a civilian court, so all of the same<br>remedies apply in a court-martial where you have been called to testify.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
