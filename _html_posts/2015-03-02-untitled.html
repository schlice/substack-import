<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [[[Cliff<br>G.](https://www.quora.com/profile/Cliff-G-13)]{.qlink_container}<br>answered a similar question with a story that I am about to butcher<br>horribly; Cliff, please forgive me up front, but I\'m trying to make a<br>point.\<br>\<br>Cliff was at his girlfriend\'s apartment when he walked out to his car<br>to retrieve something. As he did so, he noticed a police car by the<br>mailbox, and at least one officer there. As he left his car and started<br>walking back towards his girlfriend\'s apartment, he was hit with a<br>spotlight and asked to approach the car. They asked him his name and<br>what he was doing at the apartments.\<br>\<br>At this point, did he have to answer that question? No, of course he did<br>not. He could have said \"I want a lawyer, I know my rights.\" But he<br>did answer (as he had nothing to hide), and he explained that he was at<br>his girlfriend\'s apartment. While he spoke with an officer outside, a<br>female officer went to his girlfriend\'s apartment to make sure she was<br>okay and to verify his story. Once the female officer returned, he was<br>free to leave.\<br>\<br>As it turns out, the officers were there on a DV (domestic violence)<br>call, and Cliff fit the description of the suspect (as I suspect about<br>75% of the residents and guests there did too). Had he not answered<br>their questions, had he chosen to say that he had the right to remain<br>silent and he wanted a lawyer, he likely would have been \"detained\"<br>and potentially arrested until his story could be verified or they<br>caught the actual assailant. But the fact that (up to a point) he was<br>cordial and answered their questions ensured his speedy return to his<br>life. Had they started asking prying questions, leading questions, or<br>questions pertaining to a specific incident, Cliff said that he would<br>have stopped being quite so cordial and would have asked for a truly<br>custodial interrogation.\<br>\<br>Cliff\'s approach to dealing with the officers was the right way to go.<br>Officers want nothing more than to do their jobs and to limit their<br>interaction with you. They know it\'s uncomfortable. *But they\'re not<br>all out to get you*. They\'re not trying to pin some bogus charge on<br>you. Believe me, they have way better things to do than to waste<br>time making up stories about you. And chances are, if they\'re talking<br>to you, it\'s because you\'re a suspect, or you fit the description of a<br>suspect. So it\'s best to say what you\'ve been up to so you can clear<br>yourself of suspicion. If you refuse to answer questions and make<br>yourself look *more* suspicious than you have to, you will be<br>arrested until they can determine whether or not you are actually<br>involved. You will be cleared eventually, but at great personal expense<br>(both time and money) to everyone involved.\<br>\<br>If you cooperate, you can be eliminated as a suspect immediately and<br>sent on your way.\<br>\<br>I suppose it\'s your choice; you can be adversarial, or you can be<br>cordial. You can say nothing at all beyond \"Hello,\" or you can answer<br>some basic questions that have no bearing on anything at all, like your<br>name. You can be cleared much more quickly if you are cooperative than<br>if you are adversarial.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-in-the-US-everyone-will-answer-the-police-by-I-dont-answer-questions-and-or-I-need-my-lawyer/answer/Sacha-Grace<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
