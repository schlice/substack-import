<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [In the military, you are accountable for everything you<br>are issued.\<br>\<br>At the start of your shift as a Security Forces officer, you are issued<br>from the armorer an empty weapon and a full magazine. Which weapon you<br>get depends on your post for that shift. If you are receiving a pistol,<br>you insert the muzzle into the clearing barrel, load the magazine, close<br>the slide, turn the safety off, drop the weapon in your holster, and<br>there it rides until the end of your shift. They used to tell us that<br>your weapon comes out of your holster for one of two reasons: it\'s the<br>end of your shift, or you\'re going to shoot someone. The \"ready<br>position\" is thumb break open, hand on backstrap. Air Force security<br>forces did not \"draw down\" on people. We would gesture with our<br>non-firing hand, and our firing hand was on the backstrap. I could draw<br>and fire pretty quickly, so I wasn\'t really worried. If you are<br>receiving a rifle, you make sure the safety is on and the weapon is<br>clear, insert the muzzle into the clearing barrel, and close the slide.<br>You show the CBO (clearing barrel official) that the safety is on and<br>that the trigger won\'t move, and you can then walk away, inserting a<br>magazine into the receiver on the weapon. We don\'t chamber rounds on<br>the M16 for normal duty because it has a free-floating firing pin, and<br>we\'ve been told that 1 in every 100,000 times you chamber a round, it<br>will go off. Also, the free-floating firing pin dimples the round when<br>you close the bolt on one. And the person performing guard duty with a<br>rifle has enough time to rack a round in place before he needs to fire,<br>not so with a pistol.\<br>\<br>At the end of the shift, if you were carrying a pistol, you return to<br>the armorer\'s window, apply the safety, remove the magazine and put it<br>down, insert the muzzle into the clearing barrel, and open the slide<br>with a hand over the ejection port to catch the round in the chamber.<br>Once you have verified with the CBO that the weapon is safe and clear,<br>you can hand the weapon backstrap-first to the armorer, who also<br>verifies it is safe and clear. You then return the last round to the top<br>of the magazine and return your two full magazines to the armorer. He<br>then returns your weapons card to you once you have returned everything<br>you checked out. For a rifle, you insert the muzzle into the clearing<br>barrel and remove the magazine, You then rack back the slide, which will<br>lock open. The CBO verifies the weapon is safe and clear, and you hand<br>the rifle, butt first, to the armorer, and then hand him your three full<br>magazines. Occasionally, at the end of our shift, some random people<br>will need to block their ammo (which I discussed earlier) which sucks<br>because we really want to do nothing other than leave at that<br>point.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-tough-are-the-measures-taken-by-organisations-like-the-army-police-force-to-avoid-the-misuse-of-guns-ammunitions-or-other-equipment/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
