<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, the concept simply doesn't apply to God, if we assume that God is<br>*omnipotent* and *eternal*.<br><br>The idea of free will is the idea that we have choices at the moment of<br>decision. This implies that there is a time *before* you make a choice,<br>then you make a choice, and then there is a time *after* you made that<br>choice wherein something is different.<br><br>This does not apply to God, for two primary reasons.<br><br>First, God is not subject to time. He doesn't operate in time like<br>everyone else does. He is *outside* of time. For God, everything is<br>*now*. The past is *now*. The present is *now*. The future is *now*. He<br>sees it all because He does not exist in time as we do.<br><br>If God is not subject to time, then there is no "before" or "after" for<br>God; there is only *now*.<br><br>Second, God is *omnipotent*, lacking nothing. The ability to make a<br>choice implies that God's knowledge was somehow *incomplete* "before"<br>the choice was made, and then God learned something new and He made a<br>different decision "after" the choice was made. God's knowledge is<br>complete, lacking nothing. He cannot *not know* something and then<br>"change His mind" after learning something new.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
