<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Are Air National Guard alert fighters sufficient to defend US airspace<br>against a Black Swan event involving a Bolt Out of the Blue penetration<br>by a major adversary? Or are they only capable of intercepting hijacked<br>airliners?**<br><br>The answer is no, but not because the ANG is out of its depth. The<br>answer is primarily because it's not the ANG's job to defend the border.<br>It's the AD Military's job.<br><br>NORAD guards the border, and NORAD has alert fighters to do targeted<br>intercepts. Black Swan / Bolt Out of the Blue events are, by their very<br>definition, unexpected. The Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line is still<br>running, and holes in DEW radar are plugged within hours, by US/Canadian<br>joint agreement.<br><br>**The US military counters Black Swan / Bolt out of the Blue events by<br>doing its level best to ensure that no event goes unexpected.**<br><br>They do this through many means, but primarily using intelligence. We do<br>our utmost to track the militaries of other nations, so in theory, we<br>should get some whiff that a massive invasion force is being assembled<br>somewhere, long before those planes ever leave the ground. There are<br>many indications that an invasion force is being assembled (I won't go<br>into them here), and while you can cover up some of them, you can't<br>suppress them all.<br><br>Also, while missile flight time from Russia to the US may be only 30<br>minutes, aircraft flight time from Russia, even over the poles across<br>Canadian airspace is a flight measured in hours, not minutes. There's a<br>fair bet that *someone* would notice, and we'd have near-alert aircraft<br>in the air well within that timeframe, with many more to follow.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
