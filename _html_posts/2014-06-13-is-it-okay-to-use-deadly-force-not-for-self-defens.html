<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Cliff\'s answer is correct, generally \"defense of self\"<br/>and \"defense of others\" are interchangeable, as long as all of the<br/>criteria for \"defense of self\" are met. In other words, if you were<br/>\"the other,\" would you have a right to use deadly force, and if the<br/>answer is yes, you have the same right to use deadly force in defense of<br/>another.\<br/>\<br/>States will take a very narrow view of this statute, as Cliff said, to<br/>prevent vigilantism, but in this case, I think the state will focus more<br/>on the fact that he was a former officer (and probably carries a silver<br/>\"retired\" shield) than the fact that he was acting in \"defense of<br/>others.\"]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
