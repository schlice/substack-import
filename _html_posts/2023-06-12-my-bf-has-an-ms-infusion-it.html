<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The infusion room is generally pretty quiet, filled with a bunch of<br>La-Z-Boy (or equivalent) reclining armchairs. They're big, comfy chairs<br>that the patient will sit in while they are being infused. The nurse<br>will set you both up in the room, and she'll check you in, and then<br>she'll place a central line into (usually) the veins on the back of one<br>of his hands. Then she'll go off and retrieve the medication from secure<br>storage (it's expensive and can only be administered to the people who<br>are prescribed to get it). When she returns, she'll hang the bag on the<br>infuser, type in the infusion rate, and start the infusion.<br><br>And that's about as exciting as it gets. You can read, talk (quietly,<br>there are usually others in the infusion room receiving infusions as<br>well), eat, or otherwise just relax. When it's done, they'll usually<br>make you wait for a short time to observe for any reactions, but then<br>you're off.<br><br>The medication will determine exactly how long the infusion will take.<br>It won't be more than a few hours. It's a pretty underwhelming<br>experience, to be honest.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
