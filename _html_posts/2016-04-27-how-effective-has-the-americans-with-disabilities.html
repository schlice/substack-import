<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>ADA has done some really great things for the disabled community. Not<br>only has it equalized the workforce and how employers are allowed to<br>hire people and support individuals with disabilities, but it has<br>empowered the disabled community to be open and honest about their<br>abilities, and to seek accommodations when they are needed so that they<br>can function right alongside everyone else in today\'s society.<br>Additionally, ADA is flexible; it does not limit what conditions qualify<br>and what conditions do not. It simply states that you are a person of<br>disability if you are \"a person who has a physical or mental impairment<br>that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a person<br>who has a history or record of such an impairment, or a person who is<br>perceived by others as having such an impairment.\" So the law includes<br>both people who self-identify as having a physical or mental impairment,<br>and people who have been identified in society as a person with such<br>an impairment, either through history or records, or perception.<br><br>At the same time, ADA has shifted the *entire* burden away from the<br>disabled person, and fully towards providers of public accommodation and<br>employers, since ADA does not require the disabled to *prove* that they<br>have a disability. The disabled can demand accommodations, and providers<br>of public accommodation must comply, whether or not that person actually<br>has a disability. Consequently, the disabled person does not share in<br>the responsibility to ensure the system is not abused. The theory behind<br>the legislation says that the disabled person should not have to<br>\"prove\" that they have a disability. I agree; employers and providers<br>of public accommodation are not doctors; it\'s not their job to<br>determine whether or not someone has a disability. However, the<br>\"balance of power,\" being shifted so in favor of the disabled person,<br>with so little accountability, means that the system is *rife* with<br>abuse.<br><br>Many companies and providers of public accommodation struggle with how<br>to best offer both services to fully-abled customers and accommodations<br>to disabled customers. Just look at all the issues [[Disney has<br>had](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f64573&url=https://www.disabilityscoop.com/2016/04/08/disney-again-faulted/22152/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="disabilityscoop.com"}]{.qlink_container} with its Disability<br>Access System. In trying to balance the need to accommodate persons with<br>disabilities, and at the same time preventing abuse of the system by the<br>fully-abled (but less endowed with conscience) is proving to be a major<br>headache for the proprietor of the most popular theme park in the world.<br><br>So what can be done to correct this? One thing would be like they have<br>in the UK, a system of national identification to identify a person who<br>is entitled to receive benefits under ADA. It is administered by the<br>DMV, since it would be added to your state identification or license,<br>but it would be a nationally-recognized identifier. Similar to<br>handicapped parking spaces and their administration, handicapped hang<br>tags and handicapped license plates are accepted in all states, even<br>though they are administered state-by-state. Similarly, a simple<br>identifier on a driver\'s license would signify that the person is able<br>to receive accommodations under ADA.<br><br>Of course, such a system produces more questions than answers. What<br>about children with disabilities who need assistance? What if I am poor<br>and can\'t get a state ID? What if my doctor won\'t sign the form to get<br>the identifier added to my license? Do I not have a disability? And the<br>biggest question: is the abuse of the system worth the trouble of<br>identifying persons with disability in an official capacity?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
