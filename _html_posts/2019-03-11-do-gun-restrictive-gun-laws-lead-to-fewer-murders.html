<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do gun restrictive gun laws lead to fewer murders?<br><br>The article uses spurious logic and statistics without appropriate<br>basis.<br><br>The statistics showing city and state crime rates are not normalized.<br>Therefore, they don't account for population size or population density.<br><br>They also quote a number of 33,000 gun deaths every year, conveniently<br>forgetting to mention that 22,000 of those gun deaths are suicides, and<br>8,000 of the remaining 11,000 are gang and drug related.<br><br>Finally, while they talk about gun crime, they don't say anything at all<br>about crime in general, and how reducing the number of guns in the<br>hands of law-abiding citizens affects crime overall.<br><br>It's nothing more than a story intended to scare the uninformed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
