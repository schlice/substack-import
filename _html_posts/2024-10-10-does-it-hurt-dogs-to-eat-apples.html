<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes! It is safe for dogs to eat apples, **except for the apple core with<br>its seeds. Dogs should not eat apple seeds.** The seeds contain<br>amygdalin, which releases cyanide when chewed and digested. While<br>swallowing a couple of seeds is unlikely to cause problems, it\'s best<br>to be cautious.<br><br>Again, do not feed whole apples to your dog. Remove the core and<br>slice the apple before feeding to your dog. You can cut up apples into<br>chunks for easy chewing and to avoid choking, or you could feed your dog<br>applesauce if you choose to peel and stew your apples with a little<br>water.<br><br>[https://www.akc.org/expert-advic\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d768c0&url=https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/nutrition/fruits-vegetables-dogs-can-and-cant-eat/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="akc.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
