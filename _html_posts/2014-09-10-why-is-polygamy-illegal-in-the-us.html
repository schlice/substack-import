<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Polygamy is divided into several groups: polygyny is the<br>practice of one man taking more than one wife, polyandry is the practice<br>of one woman taking more than one husband, and group marriage consists<br>of multiple men and multiple women all being married.\<br>\<br>In most developed countries, polygamy of all forms is illegal. In some<br>countries, polygamy is allowed in some circumstances. In nearly all of<br>these cases, polygyny is the only form of polygamy allowed.\<br>\<br>Most developed countries consider it a human rights violation to allow<br>polygamy. The United Nations [[International Covenant on Civil and<br>Political<br>Rights](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6ae6b9&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} considers polygamy an<br>international human rights violation and recommends all member states<br>outlaw it in all of its forms, even though the document is probably<br>limited to polygyny, as it speaks mostly of women\'s rights violations.\<br>\<br>Polygamy is illegal in all 50 states of the United<br>States.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
