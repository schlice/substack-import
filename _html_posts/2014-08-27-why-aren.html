<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Besides the difficulty noted by my other esteemed<br>colleagues on this answer, you have to remember we don\'t shoot to<br>\"contain the situation.\" We shoot to stop the act. We don\'t<br>\"shoot to kill\" although as was pointed out already, almost any shot<br>of any consequence can cause death, and often does. Understanding this,<br>when you shoot to stop the act, and that is your goal, what is the most<br>effective method by which you can do this? If you are responding to a DV<br>and facing a knife-wielding suspect who is high on heroin and crack and<br>is charging at you (and let\'s assume he is 285 lbs and has 3% body fat,<br>and let\'s assume that another police officer struck him across the nose<br>with his 4 D-Cell Mag-Light \"swinging for the fences\" and he didn\'t<br>even break his stride, but that\'s a story for another time)? Shooting<br>him in the arm or leg is just going to piss him off, and that\'s the<br>truth. He may eventually bleed out, but you won\'t stop him. **The most<br>effective way to shoot someone to achieve your goal of stopping the act<br>is in the center of mass.**\<br>\<br>You think it\'s okay to artificially attempt to weaken your own force<br>when you know that it\'s very likely going to result in the subject\'s<br>death anyway and you have less of a chance of doing what it is that you<br>are setting out to do (stop the act)? It\'s like getting behind the<br>wheel and saying you want to run someone over \"just a little bit.\"<br>There are other non-lethal force options available to officers these<br>days (hand-to-hand, baton, TASER, pepper spray, etc) which comprise a<br>\"continuum of force\" which *ends* with the firearm. If the officer<br>feels he can safely stop the act and control the situation with a lower<br>level of force, he will use it.\<br>\<br>TL;DR: Remember the key points:\<br>]<br><br>- Guns are designed to kill, and they do so very effectively and<br>  efficiently. Modern day ammunition is not designed to maim or cause<br>  additional trauma; it is designed to kill, efficiently.<br><br><!-- --><br><br>- When an officer shoots, it is to stop the act. They don\'t \"shoot to<br>  kill\" or even \"shoot not to kill.\" Guns are designed to kill, so if<br>  you\'re shooting, someone is likely going to die. Remember that.\<br>- There is a \"continuum of force\" which *ends* with the firearm.<br>  Officers will use the lowest level of force they can safely employ<br>  which will stop the act. The firearm, while at the end of the force<br>  continuum, is still on that continuum, and if none of the other force<br>  methods can be used safely and without increased danger to the officer<br>  or the public, the firearm will be used.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
