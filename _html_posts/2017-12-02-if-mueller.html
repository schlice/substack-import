<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In order for anyone (regardless of political party) to care, Mueller's<br>investigation needs to find conclusive evidence that *candidate*<br>Trump worked directly, or through his surrogates, with Russia in an<br>attempt to influence the outcome of the election.<br><br>To this point, no such evidence exists. And until such evidence<br>exists, this is a non-starter. This whole thing is a giant waste of<br>time, money, and attention.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
