<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [As an Android user, I can change my batteries. I bought<br>two batteries and an external battery charger from Amazon for about<br>US\$20. If I\'m going somewhere with spotty coverage (where my phone<br>will be using lots of battery to search for signal) or where I know<br>I\'ll have the screen on for extended time periods, I\'ll grab the extra<br>battery and drop it in my pocket. If it dies, I swap it out. Simple.\<br>\<br>Don\'t invest in wireless charging until it becomes more integrated into<br>the actual phone itself. Otherwise, I think the systems are just to<br>kludge-y right now.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
