<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What controls are there over stopping an unhinged POTUS from making<br>false claims of crimes against people such as treason or comments to<br>incite a civil war?**<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>Nothing stops anyone from making "false claims" of anything. Just look<br>at how many men's lives have been destroyed by false claims of rape, yet<br>these still occur. What controls are in place to stop an unhinged woman<br>from making false claims of rape? In fact, the 1st Amendment prevents<br>the government from abridging speech. This allows anyone to slander<br>anyone else, but that's a claim that happens *after* the speech is made.<br>Nothing stops the person from speaking.<br><br>If someone makes a claim of a crime (otherwise known as reporting a<br>crime), the appropriate law enforcement agency investigates and<br>determines whether or not there is enough evidence to warrant further<br>investigation. Either there is, or there's not.<br><br>And as for "comments to incite a civil war," if someone were to make<br>those comments, they would be charged with inciting violence.<br><br>**And at what point are the people around the POTUS held accountable for<br>doing nothing?**<br><br>It's Congress' job to impeach the President so that he can be charged<br>with a crime. He can't be indicted while he's President, as he controls<br>all indictments in the country. All power of indictment comes from the<br>President.<br><br>If Congress knows that the President broke the law by inciting violence<br>and does not impeach him, then it's up to you, dear American voter,<br>to not re-elect those Congresspeople and instead elect some who will, oh<br>I don't know, *actually do their jobs.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
