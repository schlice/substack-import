<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>People agonize over "the unpardonable sin" all the time, but in the vast<br>majority of cases, their angst simply comes from a misunderstanding of<br>what the unpardonable sin is, and who can commit it.<br><br>Basically, the Bible says that the unpardonable sin is "blaspheming<br>against the Spirit." But that is too generic to really explain it,<br>especially considering the vast quantity and types of sins which God<br>forgave. So it's really unlikely that you "accidentally" committed "the<br>unpardonable sin."<br><br>A person who has committed "the unpardonable sin" decisively rejects<br>clear Spirit-revealed truth about Jesus *by attributing his mighty works<br>to Satan*. They *affirmatively and consciously* reject Jesus because<br>they never repent. They continue to rebel against Jesus until they die.<br>Instead of submitting to who Jesus is and recognizing that the Spirit<br>empowered Jesus' mighty works, they affirmatively reject Jesus by<br>declaring that his works are of Satan.<br><br>*The unpardonable sin is not an accidental slip of the tongue. It is<br>deliberately denying the truth about Jesus.*<br><br>We all know that God softens a heart so that a person who truly seeks<br>him can be touched by his word and be saved. We know that God does the<br>hard work of conversion in a person to save them. But you should also<br>know that *God can do the opposite.* God can harden a person's heart in<br>response to someone who truly rejects him, and not allow that person to<br>be touched by his word. The sin is unforgivable because God never<br>enables that person to repent and believe. **So this is a sin that only<br>unbelievers can commit.**<br><br>Finally, we can never know if we have committed the unpardonable sin.<br>Only God knows who is guilty of this sin. But I can tell you this much:<br>***you have to try really hard and be really committed to evil in order<br>to commit this sin.***<br><br>TL;DR: You cannot commit the unpardonable sin by accident. There is no<br>slip of the tongue or passing thought which commits this sin. It is a<br>conscious decision to utterly and completely reject God. God responding<br>by hardening the heart against his word is what makes the sin<br>unpardonable, because the person will never be able to repent.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I played an album that relayed evil to Jesus and I mistaked it for the<br>unpardonable sin and said I was in the unpardonable sin outloud thinking<br>I was guilty, not knowing it was blasphemy of the holy spirit. Have I<br>committed blasphemy?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
