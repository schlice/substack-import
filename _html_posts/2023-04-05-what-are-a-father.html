<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It depends on the state.<br><br>In most cases in most states, if the parents are married, the husband is<br>considered to be the "presumptive father" if a child is produced during<br>his marriage, and he owes child support.<br><br>If the parents are not married, either the mother or the father can<br>allege that the man is the father, and he is considered the "putative<br>father," and he owes child support.<br><br>In either case, the man can relieve himself of the responsibility of<br>paying child support by filing a Request to Establish Paternity. In<br>other words, the man can request a paternity test by filing with the<br>court. The specific form is different in each state, but the result is<br>the same: a man who doubts whether or not he is the father of a child<br>can file for a paternity test. In most states, this cannot be blocked.<br>In fact, in some states, the man can make this request before child<br>support is ordered.<br><br>If the man is determined to not be the father, he owes nothing.<br><br>TL;DR: Denying paternity counts for nothing until a paternity test is<br>done. If court-ordered child support is in force, a man denying<br>paternity must still pay until a paternity test is requested and<br>performed and paternity is established.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
