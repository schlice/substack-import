<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Bible isn't just one book, but a collection of 66 books, written<br>collectively over the course of 1500 years by no fewer than 40 authors<br>in three languages and on three different continents.<br><br>Nevertheless, with all of that diversity and length of time and<br>geographical space, there is consistency in the message of the<br>Bible. It tells the same story about how man had paradise, lost<br>paradise, and regained paradise, all through God's great plan for us.<br><br>Some things which make the Bible unique are *miracles.* Miracles are<br>sort of like the "stamp of authenticity." Miracles are things only God<br>can do which are outside of the ordinary. When God performs miracles, He<br>essentially authenticates what He says. Miracles are an act of God which<br>confirm the Word of God. The Bible is unique in this.<br><br>The other thing which makes the Bible unique, in my opinion, is<br>*prophesy.* Prophesy happens, usually, long before the actual event<br>happens, and then it happens as the prophet said. Peter Stoner wrote a<br>book called *Science Speaks* in which he calculated the probability of<br>multiple prophecies coming true in the life of one person. Remember,<br>there are over 130 prophecies in the Bible, some of which have not yet<br>been fulfilled, but of those that have, they have all come true in the<br>life of Jesus. Stoner calculated the probability of just 8 Messianic<br>prophecies being fulfilled in the life of Jesus. As you read through<br>these prophecies, you will see that all estimates were calculated as<br>conservatively as possible.<br><br>1.  The Messiah will be born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2).\<br>    \<br>    The average population of Bethlehem from the time of Micah to the<br>    present (1958) divided by the average population of the earth during<br>    the same period = 7,150/2,000,000,000 or 2.8 x<br>    \[math\10\^5\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br>2.  A messenger will prepare the way for the Messiah (Malachi3:1).\<br>    \<br>    One man in how many, the world over, has had a forerunner (in this<br>    case, John the Baptist) to prepare his way? Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or<br>    1 x \[math\10\^3\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br>3.  The Messiah will enter Jerusalem as a king riding on a donkey<br>    (Zechariah 9:9).\<br>    \<br>    One man in how many, who has entered Jerusalem as a ruler, has<br>    entered riding on a donkey? Estimate: 1 in 100 or 1 x<br>    \[math\10\^2\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br>4.  The Messiah will be betrayed by a friend and suffer wounds in His<br>    hands (Zechariah 13:6).\<br>    \<br>    One man in how many, the world over, has been betrayed by a friend,<br>    resulting in wounds in his hands? Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or 1 x<br>    \[math\10\^3\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br>5.  The Messiah will be betrayed for 30 pieces of silver (Zechariah<br>    11:12).\<br>    \<br>    Of the people who have been betrayed, one in how many has been<br>    betrayed for exactly 30 pieces of silver? Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or 1<br>    x \[math\10\^3\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br>6.  The betrayal money will be used to purchase a potter's field<br>    (Zechariah 11:13).\<br>    \<br>    One man in how many, after receiving a bribe for the betrayal of a<br>    friend, has returned the money, had it refused, and then experienced<br>    it being used to buy a potter's field? Estimate: 1 in 100,000 or 1 x<br>    \[math\10\^5\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br>7.  The Messiah will remain silent while He is afflicted (Isaiah 53:7).\<br>    \<br>    One man in how many, when he is oppressed and afflicted, though<br>    innocent, will make no defense of himself? Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or 1<br>    x \[math\10\^3\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br>8.  The Messiah will die by having His hands and feet pierced (Psalm<br>    22:16).\<br>    \<br>    One man in how many, since the time of David, has been crucified?<br>    Estimate: 1 in 10,000 or 1 x<br>    \[math\10\^4\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br><br>Multiplying all these probabilities together produces a number (rounded<br>off) of 1 x \[math\10\^{28}\/math\]{.render_latex}. Dividing this<br>number by an estimate of the number of people who have lived since the<br>time of these prophecies (88 billion) produces a probability of all 8<br>prophecies being fulfilled accidently in the life of one person. That<br>probability is 1 in \[math\10\^{17}\/math\]{.render_latex} or 1 in<br>100,000,000,000,000,000. That's one in one hundred quadrillion!<br><br>In short, the Bible is unique not because of the makeup of the book, but<br>because of the *subject* of the book. The Bible is unique because Christ<br>is unique and God's love for us is so uncharacteristically boundless<br>that the story seems almost too fanciful to be true.<br><br>*But what if it is?* Could you imagine how amazing it would be if it<br>were true?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
