<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the United States, assuming we're talking about standard outdoor<br>lighting around a house, not spotlights or floodlights which throw large<br>volumes of directed light, then no, you cannot force a neighbor to turn<br>off their outdoor lights.<br><br>There is always a matter of *reasonableness* to consider in order to<br>determine if lighting is a nuisance or not. Is the light reasonable, or<br>is the neighbor's property lit up like Times Square?<br><br>If the lighting is unreasonable, the police may find cause to cite the<br>homeowner for a nuisance. Otherwise, if the lighting is reasonable, you<br>can't really force them to turn it off.<br><br>This is where an HOA might be a useful thing to have. HOAs can easily<br>determine that a nuisance exists and issue a violation letter citing the<br>nuisance. If the nuisance continues, the HOA can fine the homeowner<br>until they comply.<br><br>On the flip side, there is nothing stopping the complaining homeowner<br>from installing window blinds or curtains to block the light at night.<br>This is probably the easiest fix to the problem<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can a homeowner force his/her neighbor to turn off their outdoor<br>lighting at night if it shines into the homeowner\'s bedroom windows and<br>keeps them up at night?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
