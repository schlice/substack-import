<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the closest way to dress like a police officer without it<br>being illegal?**<br><br>As with all legal answers, the actual answer is "it depends."<br><br>In the United States, your particular choice of fashion is protected by<br>your First Amendment freedom of expression. Want to dress like a<br>military vet? Want to dress like a cop? Go ahead. You can even slap on a<br>fake(ish) badge and a plastic gun if you like.<br><br>The line (because there's always a line between what is acceptable<br>and what is not) in most jurisdictions:<br><br>- when you start *doing the job* of the person you are dressed as<br>  without being lawfully appointed or licensed into that job<br>- when you attempt to profit or extract some monetary gain from your<br>  outfit<br><br>The first bullet should be fairly obvious. You can dress like a doctor,<br>but as soon as you start treating patients, you are practicing medicine<br>without a license and you can go to jail. Similarly, you can dress like<br>a cop, but as soon as you pull someone over in your car, you are<br>impersonating a peace officer and you can similarly go to jail.<br><br>The second bullet should also be fairly self-explanatory. Let's say you<br>dress in full military garb. Perfectly legal. But as soon as you try to<br>get a 10% military discount at Starbuck's, you're guilty of theft of<br>service.<br><br>Of course, local laws may vary, check your local laws before dressing as<br>your favorite cop, your mileage may vary, not available in all<br>locations, side effects may include nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, hair<br>loss, etc.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
