<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Your question really boils down to what you believe the<br/>job of SCOTUS is, and HOW they are supposed to interpret the<br/>Constitution.\<br/>\<br/>Some people believe that the Constitution should be interpreted as it is<br/>written, drawing from the Framers the context around how to interpret.<br/>These people are called \"strict constructioninsts.\" Others believe<br/>that the SCOTUS should exercise broad latitude in interpretation,<br/>drawing context from modern society so that they can be larger<br/>influencers in society. These people are called \"broad<br/>constructionists,\" \"loose constructionists,\" or \"liberal<br/>constructionists.\" The very first \"construction\" that was either<br/>\"strict\" or \"loose\" was the interpretation of the \"Necessary and<br/>Proper\" clause (also called the Elastic Clause) of the Constitution:\<br/>\<br/>]<br/><br/>&gt; The Congress shall have Power \... To make all Laws which shall be<br/>&gt; necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers,<br/>&gt; and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of<br/>&gt; the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.<br/><br/>\<br/>Almost immediately after the Constitution was ratified, the Founding<br/>Fathers split into these two separate groups (so this is not a new<br/>debate by any stretch of the imagination). The strict constructionists<br/>were led by Jefferson, the loose constructionists were led by Hamilton.<br/>Jefferson believed that only the strict construction of the Necessary<br/>and Proper clause would keep federal government small and allow the<br/>people the largest access to liberty. Hamilton believed that a much more<br/>powerful federal government and much less powerful state governments<br/>could propel the country to much greater and faster economic<br/>development. Only the broadest, loosest reading of the Necessary and<br/>Proper clause would allow Congress to create the laws needed to fulfill<br/>Hamilton\'s view of how government should work.\<br/>\<br/>Jefferson\'s Democrat-Republicans and Hamilton\'s Federalists became the<br/>nations first two political parties. They have been replaced by<br/>Republicans (strict constructionists) and Democrats (loose<br/>constructionists). This argument between Jefferson and Hamilton over the<br/>Necessary and Proper clause became the first major political dispute in<br/>our nation\'s history.\<br/>\<br/>So if you believe that SCOTUS should take a strict interpretation of the<br/>Constitution and they are not (or if you are a loose constructionist and<br/>SCOTUS is taking a strict view), then they are \"trampling the<br/>Constitution.\"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
