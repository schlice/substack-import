<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>They can basically kill any nominee Biden sends in.<br><br>Here's how you do it:<br><br>In a deal brokered by McConnell and Schumer, the Senate Judiciary<br>Committee was effectively split in half: 11 Republicans and 11<br>Democrats. In order for a nominee to go to the full Senate for a<br>nomination hearing, the Judiciary Committee must pass them on.<br><br>If all 11 Republicans vote no to pass on the nominee (and considering<br>the Presidential aspirations of roughly half of those Republicans, this<br>seems likely), the nomination goes *inert*. It doesn't die, but it<br>doesn't leave Committee unless a lawmaker (usually the Leader of the<br>party) brings it to the floor for four hours of debate.<br><br>A simple majority can put the nomination on the calendar for the next<br>day. But that action next day wouldn't be a nomination hearing. It would<br>be a motion to discharge, a *cloture* motion which requires 60 votes. In<br>other words, 10 Republicans would need to vote to resurrect the<br>nomination hearing for a candidate who was *effectively rejected* by the<br>Judiciary Committee, and that's unlikely to happen.<br><br>So that's how it's done: the Senate simply kills the nominations of<br>anyone Biden sends up.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What would GOP Senators have to be able to accomplish stragetically in<br>order to delay confirmation of Breyers replacement until after next<br>year's midterm elections?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
