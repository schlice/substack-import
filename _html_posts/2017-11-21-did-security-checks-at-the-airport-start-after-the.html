<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are two questions here, so we'll answer them individually:<br><br>> *Did security checks at the airport start after the 9/11 attacks?*<br><br>No, security was in place at airports before 9/11. However, airport<br>security was administered primarily by the airlines. The argument after<br>9/11 was made that a national agency needed to set and maintain<br>standards on all US airlines, so the Transportation Security<br>Administration was formed as a department under the newly-formed<br>Department of Homeland Security, and all US airport security was placed<br>under Federal control.<br><br>> ***Why did they start after the 9/11 attacks when the hijackers<br>> didn\'t fly from an airport?***<br><br>We know from the first question that there was airport security before<br>9/11. But this part of the question says that the hijackers "didn't fly<br>from an airport," which is not true. All 19 of the hijackers boarded<br>their aircraft at major airports: Logan, Washington Dulles, and Newark.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
