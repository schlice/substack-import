<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Well, yes and no. Yes, God always answers prayers, but not in the way<br>that you think. Because God isn't some cosmic vending machine where you<br>put your prayers in the little coin slot and your wish comes out the<br>little door. **God only intervenes in our lives when our prayers align<br>with His will for us.** This causes frustration for believers; they<br>sometimes feel like God doesn't hear them or He's not answering their<br>prayer. He does hear, and He does answer.<br><br>Usually, that answer will be one of these four answers: **No, Slow,<br>Grow, or Go.**<br><br>- No. What you're asking is not in line with what God has planned<br>  for your life. So praying to hit the lottery probably won't make you<br>  the next big Powerball winner. Who knows, maybe God wants you to win<br>  it big, but based on what He thinks of the love of money, I'd bet not.<br>- Slow. What you're praying for is in line with God's plans, but<br>  it's not in His time. He will make all His plans come to fruition *in<br>  His time, not in ours.* So this is a bit of "Okay, I got you, but wait<br>  for a tic."<br>- Grow. What you're praying for is in line with God's plans, and He<br>  is ready to do it, but you are not. Perhaps you need to grow more<br>  as a believer before He allows you to take on the new responsibilities<br>  which come along with what you're asking.<br>- Go. What you're asking for is in line with God's plans, and both<br>  He and you are ready for it, so *off you go*, your prayers are<br>  answered in the way you prayed them.<br><br>The TLDR here is that **God does always answer prayers, but "no" is also<br>a valid answer.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
