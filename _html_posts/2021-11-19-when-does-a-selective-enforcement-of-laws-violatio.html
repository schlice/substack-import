<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You asked when a "selective enforcement violation" applies, as if<br>practicing selective enforcement is illegal.<br><br>Not only is selective enforcement (in this context, "prosecutorial<br>discretion") legal, but in some cases, it's advisable, or even<br>necessary. For example, what if *everyone* on the Interstate is<br>exceeding the speed limit? It simply isn't practical for one police<br>officer to stop *everyone* on the Interstate and give them speeding<br>tickets; usually they just stop the most egregious violators. And in<br>some cases, giving a teen a warning instead of arresting him for<br>whatever crime he had committed is enough to "scare him straight" and<br>get him back on the right path.<br><br>Sometimes, during a riot, it's simply not practical to charge everyone<br>who has any sort of violation, or we'd literally bog down the courts<br>with all the violations.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>When does a selective enforcement of laws violation apply? Why would it<br>not apply to the lack of charges against one of Kyle Rittenhouses<br>assailants who had an illegally concealed firearm which he pointed at<br>Kyle (aggravated assault)?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
