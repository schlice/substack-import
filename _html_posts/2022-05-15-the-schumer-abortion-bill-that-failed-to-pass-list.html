title: '"The Schumer Abortion Bill that failed to pass listed, among other things
  in section 3, the viability of the fetus, was not a limitation to abortion. So was
  there there a limitation at all? Would this have made late term abortions legal

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Correct, the bill would have codified that access to abortions was to<br>remain legal for the baby's entire 9 months, up to delivery.<br><br>Clearly, the bill was not designed to pass. It was designed to create a<br>talking point for Democrat politicians seeking re-election. "I voted to<br>codify *Roe* in law, but those evil Republicans voted against it.<br>Re-elect me and I'll keep fighting for what you believe in." Or the<br>opposite, "I fought against making *Roe* the law of the land, and those<br>evil Democrats were really close to passing it. Re-elect me and I'll<br>keep fighting for what you believe in."<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>The Schumer Abortion Bill that failed to pass listed, among other things<br>in section 3, the viability of the fetus, was not a limitation to<br>abortion. So was there there limitation at all?
