<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The law doesn\'t say \"immediately slam on your brakes<br>when you see police lights behind you.\" The law says you must \"yield\"<br>to flashing lights and sirens behind you. That means you pull over so<br>the officer can pass, or you pull over so the officer can have a chat<br>with you, but either way, the law says you pull over.\<br>\<br>Since there is no provision in the law that allows you to slam on your<br>brakes and allow a police car to hit you, you would likely be at fault<br>for causing a dangerous driving condition.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
