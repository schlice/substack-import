<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I assume you mean \"outside the range,\" because every police officer<br>fires his or her gun on a regular basis in the gun range. They are<br>required to re-certify at an interval to be determined by the state in<br>question.<br><br>Outside the range, the vast majority of police officers go their entire<br>careers never firing their weapons outside the range. I will have to get<br>you statistics, but it is a very, very small number.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
