<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>To be fair, I think the "assaults" are few and far between. And some of<br>them have been shown to be fake. Remember, the media will spin and<br>sensationalize every itty-bitty story, because they don't want to report<br>the news: they want to get your eyeballs on their screen. They sell<br>airtime, that's their job. Their job isn't fairly reporting the news.<br>It's selling airtime. You'd do well to keep that little grain of salt<br>handy while you watch those entertainment programs called "newscasts."<br>And for every assault on a Muslim, gay, or colored person, there have<br>been equal or greater assaults on people wearing Trump hats (of all<br>races and genders, by the way), driving in cars with Trump bumper<br>stickers, or attending Trump rallies. I'm wondering where that falls in<br>the philosophy of "love trumps hate"<br><br>I think a lot of people want there to be tension because of a<br>controversial figure in the White House. It's the pessimist's dream.<br>"See?!? I told you this Trump thing would be nothing but trouble. But<br>did you listen to me? NOOOOOOO! You never listen to me!" You know what<br>they say, some people just want to watch the world burn. Some people<br>just want to feel justified in their beliefs. Especially Democrats who<br>didn't want Trump in the White House in the first place.<br>"Right-fighting" isn't listening. It's listening to respond instead<br>of listening to understand.<br><br>If we (on both sides of the aisle) spent more effort in trying to listen<br>so we can understand, instead of listening so we can respond, perhaps<br>we'd all spend less time assaulting and hating.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/If-you-voted-for-Trump-where-do-you-draw-the-line-on-what-you-are-willing-to-do-or-see-done-to-other-people-who-live-in-America/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
