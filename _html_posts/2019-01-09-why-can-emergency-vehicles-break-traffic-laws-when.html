<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why can emergency vehicles break traffic laws when there\'s no<br>emergency?**<br><br>The answer is because traffic laws do not apply to emergency vehicles.<br><br>Therefore, they're not "breaking" traffic laws, because in order to<br>break a law, that law has to apply to you.<br><br>Traffic laws apply to "motor vehicles." Motor vehicles are a specific<br>class of vehicle spelled out in every state's vehicle and traffic law.<br>All traffic laws apply to motor vehicles.<br><br>Emergency vehicles are a separate classification of vehicle. Not all<br>traffic laws apply to emergency vehicles.<br><br>And then there is enforcement. Who polices the police? What is the<br>penalty for a police officer who violates a traffic law?<br><br>Therefore, the law itself does not apply to emergency vehicles, but<br>department policy specifies how department vehicles are to be driven and<br>when to use lights and sirens, how fast vehicles should be driven, etc.<br><br>Enforcement is done at the department level. If you think a police<br>officer violated a department policy for safe operation of an emergency<br>vehicle, you can initiate the review process by filing a formal<br>complaint with the department.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
