<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The value of your unit would be covered through your own homeowner's<br>insurance. This means that the real value of all of your possessions,<br>and the real value of the unit, would be repaid.<br><br>But that would simply be a *reimbursement* for the loss. It would pay<br>you out of the rest of your mortgage and leave you a little bit left<br>over for appreciation.<br><br>Since the condo association didn't have insurance to cover the<br>replacement cost of the building, you can't rebuild. You won't be able<br>to cover the cost of rebuilding the structure. So in that respect,<br>you're SOL (that's an old military acronym that means *shit outta<br>luck*).<br><br>In short, without insurance, they can't rebuild. A special assessment is<br>unreasonable to cover the construction of an entire new building. They<br>would be left with razing the rubble, selling the land, and hopefully<br>having enough from the sale of the land (and in operating reserves) to<br>cover what's left of the mortgage.<br><br>So what to do? Go buy another condo in a building whose HOA is<br>responsible enough to hold appropriate facility insurance. Let your<br>insurance company handle whether or not they will sue the HOA for not<br>carrying the appropriate insurance, which may be mandated by state law.<br>The HOA will probably also have to declare bankruptcy to cover the loss<br>of the building, which they certainly still owned and had a mortgage on.<br>If they owned the building outright, they may not have to declare<br>bankruptcy --- they may just dissolve and sell the land.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If you own a condo and the condo building is destroyed by a natural<br>disaster not covered by the master policy purchased by the HOA, what<br>happens to you as a unit owner?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
