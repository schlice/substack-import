<br/><br/>Answer Comment<br/><br/><br/>Content: [\&gt;It is evidently the case - as well as palpably obvious -<br/>that fewer civilian owned guns will result in fewer civilian owned gun<br/>related deaths; to argue otherwise is to admit ignorance\<br/>\<br/>You are arguing that gun deaths are somehow better to control than other<br/>deaths, when in fact guns cause fewer deaths than the first three types<br/>of murder combined.\<br/>\<br/>Guns are an easy target emotionally because guns are the only devices<br/>purpose-built to kill. To say that we should eliminate guns means that<br/>you believe that there are no legitimate reasons for killing, and this<br/>is simply not true either. Killings are justified, as people walk free<br/>from jail after having committed all types of killings. This happens<br/>because of justification. If killings in any form can be justified, than<br/>what difference does it make what tool I use?]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Answer:<br/>https://www.quora.com/If-the-United-States-government-banned-all-guns-and-bought-back-existing-ones-would-that-make-the-United-States-a-much-safer-place/answer/Rob-612<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
