<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think I fall somewhere in between a simple yes or no answer here.<br><br>First of all, I can't see charging the gun owner for the crimes of<br>someone who steals the gun and uses it maliciously. That is patently<br>absurd. The only person responsible for the act committed with the gun<br>is the person holding it and pulling the trigger. No one else bears any<br>responsibility for *that* act.<br><br>Now, if you go through the process of mandating safe storage and<br>requiring gun owners to lock their firearms up (which *Heller* already<br>said was unconstitutional, but if you somehow hypothetically did it),<br>and you didn't follow those safe storage laws, and your gun was stolen<br>and used in a crime, while you can't be held responsible for that crime,<br>you can then be charged with some sort of contributory negligence for<br>violating the safe storage laws which then aided in the commission of a<br>crime.<br><br>**TL;DR: If we pass safe storage laws, owners can then be charged under<br>those laws. Otherwise, gun owners should not be charged for the crimes<br>of others who steal their guns and use them maliciously.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
