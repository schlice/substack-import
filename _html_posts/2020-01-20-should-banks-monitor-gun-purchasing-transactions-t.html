<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should banks monitor gun purchasing transactions to try to prevent<br>mass shootings?**<br><br>Attempting to ascertain whether or not someone possesses a *mens rea* by<br>monitoring legal activity is an exercise in futility.<br><br>Not only is a gun hobby expensive, but there is nothing that says that a<br>collector is going to be a bad actor because they spent a lot of money<br>on guns.<br><br>But the proponents of this said, "But just look how much mass shooters<br>spent on guns!"<br><br>And I answer...duh. Guns are expensive.<br><br>But does *every* person who buys more than four guns become a mass<br>shooter?<br><br>Based on the number of people who own significant quantities of guns and<br>the number of mass shooters, clearly that answer is no.<br><br>Banks can no more prevent mass shootings by monitoring gun purchase<br>habits than they can prevent obesity by monitoring how often you make<br>purchases at McDonald's.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
