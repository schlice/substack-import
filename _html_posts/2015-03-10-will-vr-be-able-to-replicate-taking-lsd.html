<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I certainly hope so. However, I think there are more<br>physical effects of LSD than the psychotropic affects in ones visual<br>cortex.\<br>\<br>You would only be experiencing a view of what someone on LSD sees, not<br>actually experiencing the psychological effects. You also wouldn\'t feel<br>any of the mood-altering effects of the drug.\<br>\<br>So in the short term, VR could provide the non-drug user a glimpse into<br>what the world looks like for an LSD user, but I doubt it would actually<br>replace the drug.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
