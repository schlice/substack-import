<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Is it valid that some people think that the COVID-19 vaccines are<br>> worthless because of the need for a booster shots,*<br><br>What I think is valid and what someone else thinks is valid are two<br>different things. Validity isn't determined by truth these days; it's<br>determined by opinion.<br><br>However, we can talk about facts and then you can determine for yourself<br>whether or not what some people think about vaccines is "valid."<br><br>This is accurate as of today (9 Jan 2022) for the United States<br>according to the<br>[CDC(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2fb4c4&url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/about-covid-19.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cdc.gov"}]{.qlink_container}, but as you know, in the face<br>of a rapidly changing viral landscape, this can change again. Always get<br>the most current guidance for your country and the time you're reading<br>this.<br><br>\<br><br>Boosters. The COVID-19 vaccines need booster shots because of the<br>fact that public health officials monitoring the vaccinated population<br>are seeing reduced protection over time. This means the longer it<br>has been since your vaccine, the less effective it has been shown to be<br>against mild and moderate illness. Does this mean that the vaccines are<br>*worthless*? I don't think so. I still think that even reduced<br>protection, or protection that must be boosted with another shot, is<br>still better than no protection at all, when it comes to illness from<br>the virus.<br><br>These next two points in this question relate specifically to Omicron<br>and how it has changed the landscape. Personally, I'm really happy for<br>Omicron. It's going to give a lot more people a more durable immunity,<br>but it's just going to do it the hard way. Oh well, *c'est la vie.*<br><br>> *and the need to get tested if exposed to someone with COVID-19,*<br><br>Testing. The guidance on testing has changed in the wake of Omicron.<br>If you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for<br>COVID-19, you need to self-isolate for five days from the date of your<br>exposure. The day you were exposed is Day 0. At the end of your five-day<br>quarantine, if you haven't developed any symptoms (fever, body aches,<br>chills), it is recommended that you self-test. You can use any test<br>provided by your state or locality at a community testing site, any<br>private healthcare facility testing, or any over-the-counter at-home<br>rapid test to test yourself, but this step isn't totally necessary, and<br>may be omitted if you do not have access to at-home test kits (which are<br>extremely hard to come by these days). If you are negative (or<br>symptom-free), you can leave your home. It is recommended by the CDC to<br>wear a mask in public until 10 days after your exposure. **This is the<br>only time that masks make sense.** Wear a good N-95 mask and make sure<br>it fits you well. This protects others. Continue to wear a mask in<br>public until 10 days after your exposure.<br><br>> *the fact that some fully vaccinated people got infected?*<br><br>Infection with Omicron. Omicron is the variant that proves the rule.<br>The rule has always been that fully vaccinated people can still contract<br>COVID-19 and can still pass it on to others. It just didn't happen very<br>often with OG COVID, or with variants like Delta.<br><br>But Omicron is a horse of a different color. Omicron is both **highly<br>virulent and less severe** than any of its compatriots. Omicron is<br>so highly virulent that it is infecting both fully vaccinated and<br>unvaccinated people equally. Some say that it is infecting fully<br>vaccinated people more, others say that it is infecting unvaccinated<br>people more, these numbers are specious and fraught. We know that<br>Omicron doesn't care whether or not you are vaccinated; it infects you<br>all the same.<br><br>The good news is that it is less severe than other variants. It does<br>not cause the debilitating respiratory illnesses that land others in the<br>ICU. It causes upper respiratory symptoms similar to those of influenza.<br>In other words, it burns through quickly, it can be ridden out at home,<br>and then you're done.<br><br>The even gooder news is that once you've had it, you now have<br>*immunity*, and testing is showing that cross-immunity to other variants<br>is present in those who contracted Omicron and recovered. Don't listen<br>to the hogwash about "having the virus doesn't give you immunity."<br>That's utter nonsense and flies in the face of virology. The truth is<br>that it's a virus and it behaves like any other virus. Once you've had<br>it, you have immunity. Durable, long-lasting, cross-variant immunity.<br>And ultimately, that's good news for everyone, because *this* is<br>what will slow the spread of the virus. The actual term is "herd<br>immunity," but that term seems to have received some negative press<br>recently, so we'll just say "it's a good thing."<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it valid that some people think that the COVID-19 vaccines are<br>worthless because of the need for a booster shots, and the need to get<br>tested if exposed to someone with COVID-19, the fact that some fully<br>vaccinated people got infected?<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
