There are some professions which do have a duty to<br>report (i.e. health care workers have a duty to report child abuse and<br>neglect should they discover it as part of an examination), but most<br>citizens do not have a duty to report crimes they become aware of.<br>Reporters do not have any mandatory duty to report crimes they learn of,<br>either.<br><br>There are a few states that impose that similar duty to report on<br>civilians for crimes like sexual abuse (two, IIRC), but it is very<br>limited, and it has never been prosecuted.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
