<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [No. You\'d get them from the district attorney\'s office,<br>and only if your Kik texts were involved in a police investigation in<br>which the police seized your texts directly from Kik, with a judge\'s<br>warrant, and turned them over to the DA. You could then retrieve the<br>same information from the DA\'s office as part of the discovery phase of<br>the trial, so that you can use it to plan your defense.\<br>\<br>Otherwise, the police have less access to your Kik texts than you do.\<br>\<br>The police can\'t get your Kik texts, as I already mentioned, unless<br>they have a warrant]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
