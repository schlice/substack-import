<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Aside from the impossible "coward" excuse - what possible reason would<br>an armed cop have for standing around watching Cruz shoot up the school<br>for 6 minutes?**<br><br>The simple fact is we don't know.<br><br>The way most police departments around the country train in "code red"<br>scenarios (active shooter) is that a solo person waits for two to three<br>other officers before entering a live-fire scenario. A solo officer<br>never enters a live fire situation on his own. Two people is the bare<br>minimum to enter an active shooter environment, and that's only during<br>extreme emergencies, such as when there is literally no other backup;<br>ideally 3--4 officers in a military diamond formation should enter.<br><br>Yes, we all want to believe that a solo officer could have run in there<br>and killed the shooter armed with a rifle, just using his sidearm. But<br>the odds are terribly stacked against him. He is way outgunned in such a<br>scenario.<br><br>Two things are certain:<br><br>1.  There is nothing in the law that requires that a police officer go<br>    in solo and risk dying to try to stop an active shooter. We all may<br>    want to "Monday-morning quarterback" the situation and say we would<br>    have run in to confront the shooter (I know I feel that way), but<br>    until you're actually facing live gunfire *coming at you*, you<br>    don't know exactly how you'll react. But the fact of the matter is<br>    that a police officer's job description does not say "Gets killed<br>    when necessary." And many years of case law backs this up: police<br>    have a general duty to protect the public at large; they have no<br>    specific duty to protect any one person or any group of people. So<br>    legally, he did not abdicate his duty or anything like that. He<br>    contained the situation, which is legally permissible.<br>2.  We also don't know the code red rules in that department. Was the<br>    deputy required to hole up and wait for backup? Was he directed to<br>    not enter the school until backup arrived? In other words, did he<br>    follow his department's rules? We don't know any of that either. But<br>    we do know that a dead officer won't do anyone any good. He<br>    certainly contained the situation even if he didn't go in, and that<br>    meets the legal standard of "doing his job." The department hasn't<br>    come out and said yet whether or not the officer was following<br>    orders, or following department operating procedure for code red<br>    scenarios. Interesting why they haven't said anything. Probably has<br>    something to do with the fact that the answer may be tough for<br>    people to hear.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
