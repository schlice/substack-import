<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If I build a privacy fence on common property, does the Homeowner<br>Association own it?**<br><br>Yes they do. If you build a fence on someone else's property, that<br>someone else (whether it be a private owner or an HOA) can tear down the<br>fence and bill you for the cost of doing so.<br><br>If you want a fence on that property, petition the Board for a fence.<br>Tell the Board you'll be happy to pay the entire cost of the<br>installation of the fence. Perhaps the Board will approve your request.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
