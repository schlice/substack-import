<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I \"rode along\" on an extradition from Colorado to New<br>York.\<br>\<br>How was it? Very anti-climactic.\<br>\<br>Picked him up at the El Paso County CJC, he was handcuffed. Took him to<br>the airport, walked him around the security checkpoint, got on to the<br>plane (first), sat in the back of the plane, and once the door was<br>closed, his handcuffs were removed (it was FAA policy at the time,<br>don\'t know if it still is). When we landed, the handcuffs went back on,<br>and we left the plane (last), and he was picked up by uniformed officers<br>at the end of the jetway. Easy peesey.\<br>\<br>There are probably other transports that Federal Marshalls could tell<br>you about, since for the most part, prisoner transportation is handled<br>by the U.S. Marshall service.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
