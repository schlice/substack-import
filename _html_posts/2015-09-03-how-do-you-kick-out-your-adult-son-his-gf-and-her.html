<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You show them the mortgage document with your name on it,<br>and not theirs.\<br>\<br>As long as they don\'t own the house along with you, legally you are not<br>required to allow them to live there without a rental agreement. And you<br>may not be able to sublet your house depending on the neighborhood<br>zoning laws in place, so you may not even be legally allowed to rent<br>them a room.\<br>\<br>Legally, they are considered guests in your house, staying there at your<br>pleasure.\<br>\<br>I don\'t know why you are kicking them out, but if these people are<br>adults (your son and his girlfriend), then you are under no obligation<br>to house them in your home. That requirement ended when your son reached<br>the age of majority. His girlfriend and her child are not related to<br>anyone in your house, so they are literally guests as well, and have<br>been so from the moment you allowed them to stay.\<br>\<br>They stay as long as you allow them to stay. They leave when you tell<br>them to leave. It is your house, not theirs.\<br>\<br>The worst part of the situation is when you will have to call the police<br>to come out and \"escort\" them off of your property because they refuse<br>to leave. You can pretty much bet that will be the last time you see<br>them.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
