<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are many components which go into whether or not a telehealth<br>session, in general, is HIPAA-compliant. Just conducting the session on<br>FaceTime does not make the entire session HIPAA-compliant or not.<br><br>But looking at FaceTime, in isolation, one can see that it can be used<br>in a telehealth setting and provide a HIPAA-compliant experience.<br><br>FaceTime is peer-to-peer, uses end-to-end encryption, and Apple does not<br>store any FaceTime sessions on their servers, nor do they have the<br>ability to decrypt live FaceTime sessions. With this information in<br>mind, we can say that FaceTime is a HIPAA-compliant video chat solution,<br>when employed with all of the other HIPAA safeguards that a clinician<br>and a patient would normally employ. Doctors must still protect Personal<br>Information as they normally would, and only provide it in accordance<br>with pre-determined sharing agreements, just as a face-to-face<br>appointment would work. Transitioning a traditional, fully<br>HIPAA-compliant doctor-patient relationship to a virtual one by<br>inserting FaceTime would allow the relationship to continue to be<br>HIPAA-compliant.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is FaceTime HIPAA compliant for telehealth?<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice.
