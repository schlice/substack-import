<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There is no fruit or vegetable that prevents or gets rid<br>of diabetes. People with diabetes benefit from the same healthy diet as<br>everyone else.\<br>\<br>Fruits and vegetables are healthy for you, but they also contain<br>carbohydrates. Their carb load (and incidental sugar load) have to be<br>included in meal planning.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
