<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should Republicans skip hearings on a replacement for RBG and go<br>straight to a floor vote in the Senate?**<br><br>I think the prospective Justice should have the ability to give a speech<br>on the floor of the Senate, and then the Senate should move directly to<br>debate on the floor and a vote.<br><br>Questions are pointless. We never learn anything productive about the<br>new Justice that we don't already know from all of the provided<br>questionnaires and closed-door meetings that the Justice has with<br>Senators who request it. The question and answer period is nothing more<br>than an opportunity for Senators to speak and produce sound bites and<br>talking points. We can hear Senators speak any time. Let them make their<br>arguments in the debate over the vote. Don't waste time with hearings.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
