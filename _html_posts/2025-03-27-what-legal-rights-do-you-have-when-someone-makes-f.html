<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with all legal answers, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>Any time someone makes a false statement about you, it is called<br>*defamation*. Spoken defamation is called "slander" while written<br>defamation is called "libel." Any type of defamatory statement is<br>actionable, including claims about your mental health. And in all cases,<br>the truth is an affirmative defense against a defamation action.<br><br>There are three required elements of defamation:<br><br>- A spoken or written statement about you which expresses a false<br>  statement of fact<br>- Publication or transmission of that statement to a third party, and<br>- Harm to your reputation caused by the statement.<br><br>In the US, a plaintiff can recover compensatory damages for defamation<br>when they show "actual injury" without regard for "actual malice." In<br>other words, the person who defamed you didn't need to do so with intent<br>to cause actual injury before you can recover damages.<br><br>There are also 33 states which have a "retraction statute." These<br>statutes generally require a plaintiff to ask a media outlet to retract<br>the allegedly defamatory statement as a condition to claiming damages,<br>and sometimes even before the plaintiff may pursue litigation at all. A<br>timely retraction by the defendant usually will limit a plaintiff's<br>recoverable damages.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
