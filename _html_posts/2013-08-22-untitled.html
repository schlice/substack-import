<br/><br/>Answer Comment<br/><br/><br/>Content: [\ I think what has been happening to Jon is<br/>terrible. I have come to the inevitable conclusion that people suck.<br/>There\'s so many people that are just so stupid, it frightens me for the<br/>future of our society. My reply is in no way intended to discount or to<br/>disregard anything that Jon has said.\<br/>\\<br/>\<br/>I want to clarify a little for everyone\'s benefit. We all tend to throw<br/>around the term \"racism\" very easily, but I think we should be<br/>cautious in using the term. Rory Young\'s answer above is a prime<br/>example of racism: a class system in which a ruling class and a subclass<br/>exist, and the subservience of the subclass is ingrained in the laws and<br/>culture of all the people. Someone who believes in racism believes that<br/>the ruling class is genetically, socially, and racially superior to the<br/>subservient class. It is possible that there were racist ideals that<br/>drove the people with whom Jon interacted, but we cannot be sure.<br/>\"Race\" itself is a fuzzy term; there is no scientific definition of<br/>race. In the taxonomic structure, \"race\" is non-existent. The only<br/>humanoid life on earth is the species \"homo sapiens,\" so<br/>scientifically speaking, we are all part of the \"human race.\" Starting<br/>in roughly the 1700s, \"race\" had started to be used to denote<br/>differences in ethnicity, and so when we say someone is of a \"different<br/>race,\" this generally means that they have different ethnic origins.<br/>For the purposes of this discussion, we will use the term \"race\" in<br/>the colloquial sense defining sub-species by ethnicity. It is more<br/>likely that Jon was a victim of prejudice and bigotry than racism.\<br/>\<br/>Prejudice is the act of \"pre-judging\" someone based on limited,<br/>superficial information such as race, ethnicity, sex, religious<br/>affiliation, etc. Believe it or not, we all are guilty of one form or<br/>another of prejudice. Not all prejudice is malicious, the vast majority<br/>is not hateful. Pre-judging allows the human mind to \"fill in the<br/>gaps\" when unknowns exist. Humans do not like uncertainty; the mind<br/>will use what limited information it has and judge whether or not a<br/>threat exists. It is a natural human defense mechanism. Prejudice allows<br/>the mind to execute the \"fight-or-flight\" protocol. For example, when<br/>looking at a creature, the brain asks \"Is that creature a threat?\" It<br/>then uses the characteristics of the creature, which includes previous<br/>encounters with the creature, propensity of the creature\'s species<br/>towards violence, the current state of agitation of the creature, etc,<br/>to determine whether or not the creature is a threat. It then makes the<br/>\"fight or flight\" decision based on that. The prejudice that Jon<br/>experienced, however, is hateful. People can, and do, prejudge based on<br/>race.\<br/>\<br/>Bigotry is a narrow-minded, intolerant life perspective that doesn\'t<br/>allow someone to see things from someone else\'s point-of-view. Like<br/>prejudice, bigotry can be about things that have nothing to do with<br/>race, such as sex, sexual orientation, or religion. Bigotry also<br/>includes intolerance for the views or opinions of the bigoted person.<br/>The bigotry that Jon experienced is clearly based on ethnicity.\<br/>\<br/>So we know that he experienced prejudice and bigotry. He likely did not<br/>experience racism because, in the United States anyway, we have<br/>de-institutionalized any racist practices which used to be in place<br/>(i.e. Dred Scott). So we don\'t have a culture or a structure of racism<br/>in this country, but prejudice and bigotry will always exist. It is up<br/>to us to understand why they exist, and to curb or eliminate them<br/>whenever we can. The best way to do that is through knowledge.\<br/>\<br/>Which is why I hate stupid people. So I would say that yes, I am bigoted<br/>against stupid people. I need to work on that.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Answer:<br/>https://www.quora.com/Have-you-ever-been-a-witness-to-or-encountered-racism/answer/Jon-Mixon-1<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
