<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Most likely no.<br><br>While it is true that most covenants give HOA Board members and Officers<br>the authority to enter *property* when it is necessary to protect the<br>community or neighboring property, in the vast majority of cases the<br>*inside of the home* is off-limits.<br><br>We would frequently enter property when there was something like a<br>sprinkler system failure and water was spraying everywhere and running<br>into neighbors' yards; we'd be able to get to the shutoff vale to stop<br>the chaos until the homeowner returned home and was able to fix the<br>broken pipe.<br><br>Presumably, there *could* be a clause in the Governing Documents that<br>allowed an HOA Board member or Officer to enter a home in the event of<br>exigent circumstances which might lead to damage of neighboring<br>property, but I have never heard of it and I highly doubt any HOAs have<br>it.<br><br>This could be something I could see happening in a Condo Association,<br>but in a single-family HOA, unlikely.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
