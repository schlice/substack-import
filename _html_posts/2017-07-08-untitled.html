<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Rock climbers and skydivers are required to wear appropriate safety<br>> gear*.<br><br>Not everywhere, or free climbing wouldn\'t be a thing. There are no<br>state laws which require you to wear safety gear.<br><br>> *They likely also sign waivers and pay extra insurance premiums too.*<br><br>Again, not everywhere. And the difference, again, is that there are no<br>state laws which require you to carry "rock climbers insurance" and if<br>you\'re caught without it you lose your rock climbing license. So the<br>analogy still does not hold.<br><br>> *\I<br> the US at least I'm sure that there are health insurance<br>> companies that refuse coverage for a 'pre-existing condition' when<br>> people are morbidly overweight*.<br><br>Probably, but usually only if the obesity has no medically identifiable<br>cause. If there is a cause, then the cause is treated, and the obesity<br>is considered a secondary response to the underlying condition.<br><br>Otherwise, obesity is considered a lifestyle condition. If it wasn\'t,<br>elective stomach stapling surgery wouldn\'t work.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-illegal-to-not-wear-your-seatbelt/answer/Liam-Crowleigh<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
