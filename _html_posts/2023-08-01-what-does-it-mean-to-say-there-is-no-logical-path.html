<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Here is the strained logic:<br><br>- God does something.<br>- If I were God, I would not do it that way.<br>- Therefore, there is no God.<br><br>Unfortunately, this does not logically follow. You cannot get from "If I<br>were God, I would not have done it that way" to "there is no God"<br>without some intermediate step showing how me not being God means that<br>God does not exist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
