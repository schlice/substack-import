<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Wow, there's a lot to unpack here. But let's start with the basics:<br><br>*Have you discussed your feelings with your wife?*<br><br>The hallmark of a healthy marriage is open communication. I can tell<br>things to my wife that I wouldn't dare tell anyone else. Not my pastor,<br>not my parents (if I spoke to them anyway), not my military service<br>buddies, no one.<br><br>Don't be afraid to talk to her. If she truly loves you, then she loves<br>you for your beautiful soul, not your femur bone.<br><br>Think about it. If you got fat, would she still love you? If you lost<br>all your hair, would she still love you? My guess is that the answer is<br>most likely yes.<br><br>Let's be honest with ourselves: you may never physically be the same man<br>you were before your accident. But does she love your legs, or does she<br>love *you*? I think you might be surprised to hear the answer.<br><br>Your feelings are natural. Men are supposed to be the head of the<br>household, the strong leaders who guide their families with a<br>rock-steady foundation. And your broken leg is making you feel like you<br>may not ever be able to be that man ever again.<br><br>But that's a lie. Your feelings are whispering lies to you, and you're<br>listening. Don't listen to the lies. You can still be a great husband<br>and a great father if you gained weight, lost your hair, or if you<br>aren't physically the same man because of your leg.<br><br>I know. I developed Multiple Sclerosis. I thought I'd never be the same<br>man I was. I thought I could never be a good husband or a good father<br>with MS. I had those same feelings of inadequacy. But I discussed them<br>with my wife, and together we worked through them.<br><br>I implore you: talk to your wife. Let her know how you are feeling. If<br>you need to, seek counseling to talk through your feelings.<br><br>Suicide is never the answer to any question we may ask ourselves. Your<br>life is worth more. You are worth more than that. Don't let your fears<br>lead you down a path that will only hurt your family.<br><br>You are loved!<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I\'ve been nursing suicidal thoughts for quite some now\...I have a wife<br>and a four year old daughter but ever since I had an accident and<br>fractured my femur bone\...I feel inadequate and feel like I will never<br>be the same person my wife and daughter love so much\...is suicide<br>selfish? Am I being selfish for thinking about taking my life?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
