<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because God isn't fair. He never has been. *And you should be<br>thanking Him for that beautiful truth.*<br><br>He doesn't compare people to each other and ensure that their outcomes<br>are equal. He doesn't say, "Well, since person A was saved, I need to<br>save everyone in order to make things fair." Or worse, He doesn't say<br>"Well, person X is going to hell, so I have to send everyone to hell to<br>make things fair."<br><br>**Thank God that He is not fair. Because I don't think you want God to<br>be fair.**<br><br>\<br><br>God is not fair. God is *just*.<br><br>Rather than being fair, God is just, which means that *everyone gets the<br>exact outcome that they deserve.* So if they love Him and believe Jesus<br>is their savior and have repented of their sins, they are saved. And if<br>they reject the truth of His presence all around them and the truth in<br>their hearts, and they live their lives in defiance of Him, then He<br>allows them to remain in their sin, and die in their sin, eternally<br>separated from Him. That is *just*, not fair.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
