<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The short answer to the question is no.<br><br>The longer answer is no, but it's hard to know whether or not they have<br>probable cause or reasonable suspicion because they don't have to tell<br>you.<br><br>In the landmark case *Terry v. Ohio*, the court allowed the police to do<br>a cursory pat-down of a person in order to check for weapons to ensure<br>their own safety while they continued asking questions. This cursory<br>pat-down is called a *Terry* *stop*, and it only requires reasonable<br>suspicion that a crime was committed or is going to be committed. It<br>also only permits a quick pat-down for weapons, not a complete search.<br><br>If the police have probable cause to arrest you, they can do a complete<br>search.<br><br>But here's the catch: **they are under no obligation to tell you why<br>they have reasonable suspicion or probable cause.**<br><br>Once you're arrested and you go to your arraignment hearing, the judge<br>asks the police officer to detail his or her reasonable suspicion and/or<br>probable cause. *That is where the police officer must articulate the<br>reasonable suspicion and/or probable cause*. They don't have to tell<br>you, they only have to tell the judge. That information will be in the<br>arrest report, but the judge can question the officer on it if he or she<br>chooses.<br><br>If the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to conduct a *Terry*<br>stop, anything found during that stop is suppressed and can't be used as<br>evidence. If the officer did not have probable cause to effect an<br>arrest, the arrest is suppressed and you are released from custody. You<br>and your lawyer will work through all of those details.<br><br>So if you're in a situation where the police may have unlawfully<br>searched you, make sure you have a good criminal defense attorney and<br>tell him or her everything.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can a cop search me without probable cause or reasonable suspicion?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
