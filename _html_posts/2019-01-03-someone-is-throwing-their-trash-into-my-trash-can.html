<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Someone is throwing their trash into my trash can. Is this legal? Can<br>I file a police report?**<br><br>Technically, yes this is illegal, with caveats.<br><br>Most people in the United States pay for their own trash service, out of<br>their own paychecks. Therefore, someone using your trash can is<br>considered *theft of service.* In California, this would be considered a<br>petty offense; however, if this were to be a charged offense, since the<br>service in question costs less than \$50, the theft would be charged as<br>an infraction, and the thief would be fined no greater than \$250.<br><br>If you don't pay directly for your own trash services (i.e. perhaps your<br>town provides trash service out of everyone's taxes), it's at least<br>questionable whether or not you could personally consider this theft of<br>service.<br><br>But let's be honest with ourselves. You actually think the police will<br>make it out to your house before the service thief gets away? I doubt<br>it. And even if they do, they give the guy a stern talking-to, and he's<br>on his way.<br><br>It does sound like this guy is doing this because he wants to avoid<br>paying for trash service. You can indeed file a police report, but it is<br>at best questionable whether any action will be taken. It's easy enough<br>to convince the man to sign up for his own trash service, but it's the<br>part about getting the police out there to actually confront the service<br>thief that will be challenging.<br><br>Your best bet: public shaming.<br><br>You say you've already recorded photos and video. Post them on your<br>neighborhood website, or on your neighborhood forum, or on YouTube. Then<br>notify the Call for Action desk (or similar consumer protection group)<br>at your local TV station and tell them where they can check out the<br>video themselves. If you get some traction with your local TV station,<br>perhaps the local police will take more interest when a reporter comes<br>asking about why the police haven't stopped this service thief yet.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
