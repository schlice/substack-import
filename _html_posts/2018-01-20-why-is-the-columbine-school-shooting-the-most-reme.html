<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Columbine High School shooting was a *watershed moment* in<br>United States history that changed many different facets of child<br>development and public school education in the blink of an eye on April<br>20, 1999.<br><br>The shooting changed the way schools think about bullying, and caused<br>bully prevention programs to be completely overhauled in schools. The<br>topic of school security became mainstream, and instead of "duck and<br>cover" drills, schools now do "active shooter" drills. Columbine changed<br>American primary schooling forever.<br><br>Columbine also marked a pivotal change in how law enforcement reacts to<br>these types of situations. It coined new terms, like active shooter,<br>and changed the entire paradigm of how law enforcement deals with those<br>situations.<br><br>Secondarily, Columbine sparked intense debate in the country over teen<br>use of antidepressants, and violence in video games. It brought the<br>"goth culture" into the fore, and made the "social outcast" into a<br>veritable pariah.<br><br>Columbine was a situation where the killers went in with their end goal<br>of *killing students*. They knew they were not coming out alive. They<br>wanted to go down in a blaze of glory, and take as many students with<br>them as possible. While this kind of thing happened occasionally, it<br>rarely happened at grade schools.<br><br>Before and during the Columbine shooting, law enforcement's role was to<br>contain the situation, and to attempt to use hostage negotiators to<br>de-escalate the situation. Previously, these situations would be<br>hostage negotiation situations, and the perpetrator generally *wanted<br>something* from law enforcement: a getaway vehicle, time on the local<br>news, an amount of money, someone released from prison, etc. Columbine<br>was different in that the school was not a *means to an end*, but was<br>*the end itself*. The students were innocent victims of the<br>perpetrators' delusions, and high school bullying became the impetus for<br>mass killings.<br><br>Law enforcement had to completely re-tool. They could no longer afford<br>to contain and de-escalate. They had to immediately go in and stop the<br>active shooter, knowing that the shooter's goal was to kill as many<br>innocent people as he could, and he likely planned on taking his own<br>life when law enforcement eventually made it in. The goal, therefore,<br>was to accelerate that end-game, so that the loss of innocent life was<br>as minimal as possible. The idea now is overwhelming force as quickly as<br>is humanly possible. The sooner armed response can get in and confront<br>the shooter, the better chance of saving lives. Police departments<br>around the country re-trained their officers, and now conduct regular<br>Active Shooter Training in schools.<br><br>Schools had to radically change the way they do business. Now, all<br>exterior doors to schools are locked from the outside, except for the<br>main entrance (which in some schools is also locked and you must be<br>physically buzzed in). Security cameras were added to most schools. All<br>people in the school now enter through a choke point, all people within<br>the school are accounted for, and school staff is accountable for the<br>roster of people within the school at all times. Armed school security<br>is now a thing, and most schools have some form of armed security at all<br>times. Many secondary schools have representatives from the local police<br>department permanently stationed there (known as School Resource<br>Officers, or SROs), who would ultimately coordinate emergency response<br>to active shooter situations.<br><br>Also, schools had to re-tool their bully prevention programs, to attempt<br>to stop the kind of bullying that drove Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris to<br>plan out and perform their killing spree. Bullying behavior is<br>relentlessly pursued and eliminated.<br><br>Many schools have adopted a "zero-tolerance policy" to any bullying or<br>gun-related behavior, which frankly goes too far in many cases. One such<br>example of extreme school policy:<br><br>[[Boy, 7, suspended for shaping pastry into<br>gun](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9643a0&url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/03/05/boy-7-suspended-for-shaping-pastry-into-gun-dad-says.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="foxnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Ultimately, Columbine marked several pivotal changes in public school<br>education in the United States, including how we think about bullying<br>behavior and social outcasts, how we think about defending the students<br>within a school, and how we think about stopping active shooters.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
