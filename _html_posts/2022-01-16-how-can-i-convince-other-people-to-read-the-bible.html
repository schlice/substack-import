<br><br><h2>Space Submission</h2><br><div><br><br>Space name: Christians & Christianity<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's really, really simple.<br><br>**Live a life which makes them question you.\<br>Live a life which makes them question why you always smile.\<br>Live a life which makes them question why you can look at all of the<br>evil in this world and still be hopeful for the future.**<br><br>And when they do (question you, that is), you can tell them *why* you<br>are so hopeful. It's because you are saved not by what you have done.<br>It's because you are saved not by the fact that you've been baptized.<br>It's because you are saved **by grace, through faith, in Christ, for his<br>glory alone. By, Through, In, For.** In fact, you can shorten it down to<br>"ByThruIn4." Don't forget that. In fact, I wear a bracelet with that<br>phrase on it:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-3cf653a17996acac1df2062b2646ce91){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-3cf653a17996acac1df2062b2646ce91"<br>master_w="3000" master_h="4000"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(Please forgive my gross arms and my other bracelet.)*<br><br>By Grace\<br>Through Faith\<br>In Christ\<br>For (4) His Glory Alone.<br><br>*That's* why I'm so hopeful.<br><br>Then, after you've convinced them that there *is* something to be<br>hopeful *about*, then you can tell them that ***literally everything we<br>believe*** is in that book. No secrets. No "levels of knowledge."<br>Nothing gets unlocked later on. *Literally everything we believe* is in<br>there, nothing is hidden. Want to know *why* we have faith? Want to<br>know *who* we believe in? It's all in the book.<br><br>TL;DR: You can't convince someone to read the Bible. You have to<br>make them *want* to read it *themselves*, so that they can learn "the<br>secret" of what you already know.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How can I convince other people to read the Bible and be saved?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
