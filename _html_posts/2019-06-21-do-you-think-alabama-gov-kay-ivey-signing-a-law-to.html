Kay Ivey signing a law to allow a Birmingham<br>megachurch to form its own private police force to protect its<br>affiliated school campuses a good idea?**<br><br>I think it's a non-issue. School campuses all over the country have<br>their own private police forces; you probably know them as "campus<br>police." Most school districts in the United States have their own<br>private security as well.<br><br>Churches all over the country have their own private security, armed and<br>unarmed. The only difference here is that now this church can do exactly<br>as college campuses do to protect their sprawling school campuses: hire<br>campus police who can arrest suspects who commit crimes on their<br>property.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
