<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How many more school shootings? How many more children are murdered<br>before our legislators cease worrying about being reelected and enact<br>sensible gun laws?**<br><br>There already *are* sensible gun laws. Heck, there are *ridiculous* gun<br>laws. There is already an *insane* amount of gun laws.<br><br>So answer this, questioner: *What new gun law would stop a shooter?*<br><br>This shooter probably broke about 10 different laws just bringing a gun<br>onto school property. Clearly, the laws we have preventing guns on<br>schools didn't stop someone from doing it.<br><br>Wanna know why?<br><br>**Laws don't prevent people from doing bad things. Laws provide a<br>framework for us to prosecute people who violate them**.<br><br>If you want to *prevent* bad behavior, *laws are not the answer.*<br>Laws help you to prosecute people who violate them. Laws don't stop<br>people from doing bad things.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
