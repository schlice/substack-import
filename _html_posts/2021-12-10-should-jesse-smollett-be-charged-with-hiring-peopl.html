<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Jussie Smollett was charged with breaking laws which actually exist.<br><br>There is no law against "hiring people to commit a hate crime." You can<br>contract with someone to commit a crime, but the contract is illegal and<br>unenforceable. If they were to actually commit the crime, the people<br>committing the crime would be charged with committing the crime, and you<br>would be charged with conspiracy to commit a crime.<br><br>But that's not what happened here. Smollett hired actors to pretend to<br>beat him up. Any physical contact was consensual, so the assault was not<br>a crime. Therefore, none of what actually occurred was a crime. The<br>crime happened when he tried to lie to the police about what happened.<br><br>There are laws against falsely reporting a crime (which in Illinois are<br>encapsulated under their disorderly conduct statutes), and that's what<br>he was convicted of. He was convicted on two counts of lying to<br>detectives about a battery, one count of lying to detectives about a<br>hate crime, one count of lying to a police officer about a battery, and<br>one count of lying to a police officer about a hate crime.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Should Jesse Smollett be charged with hiring people to commit a hate<br>crime? He did pay two men to assault a gay black man and if he isn\'t<br>charged, what message does this send to other people considering<br>committing hate crimes?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
