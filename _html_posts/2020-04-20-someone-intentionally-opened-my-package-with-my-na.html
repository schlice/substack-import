<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Someone intentionally opened my package, with my name on it, and used<br>the content. Is this illegal?**<br><br>On multiple levels, yes.<br><br>This is literally the best definition of the *Federal* crime of mail<br>theft:<br><br>> Because the United States Postal Service is a federal agency,<br>> mailboxes are considered federal property, and mail theft is charged<br>> as a federal offense. If you are charged with mail theft, you could<br>> face up to five years in federal prison and fines of up to \$250,000.<br>> It is also a crime to injure, deface or destroy any mail deposited in<br>> a mailbox. For each act of vandalism, you could be imprisoned for up<br>> to three years and fined up to \$250,000. Depending on the manner in<br>> which the mail theft is committed, you could face other criminal<br>> charges, such as assault, and breaking and entering. If personal<br>> identifying information, such as names, dates of birth, addresses,<br>> telephone numbers, tax I.D. numbers, Social Security numbers and<br>> driver's license numbers, was stolen you could also face identity<br>> theft charges.\[1\](#HlzrF){#cite-HlzrF .citation_link}<br><br>In addition to the Federal charge, most states have also criminalized<br>mail theft. Some states (like California) charge it *more harshly* than<br>even Federal law does; check with your state laws to see what the<br>punishment could be for mail theft.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-HlzrF){.citation_index} [[Consequences for Mail<br>Tampering](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4e6474&url=https://legalbeagle.com/12122431-consequences-mail-tampering.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="legalbeagle.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
