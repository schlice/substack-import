<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I need to correct some of your understanding. You said this:<br><br>> **I'm afraid of going to hell and feel like I want to be rebaptized<br>> because I want to have my many sins forgiven**<br><br>So know this:<br><br>*Baptism doesn't save you. Baptism is what saved people do.*<br><br>Scriptures are abundantly clear on this (see John 3:16; Ephesians 2:8-9;<br>Titus 3:5). You don't need to be baptized in order to be saved.<br>Requiring anything other than faith in Christ for salvation is<br>considered to be "works-based salvation." In other words, it's a belief<br>that you need to "do" something in order to be saved, and Scripture is<br>clear that the only thing you need to be saved is faith in Christ.<br><br>In short, baptism is an *outward* sign of the *inward* salvation we<br>already have in Christ. Baptism is us proclaiming to the world: "I am a<br>sinner, but I am saved. I have been buried with Christ, and raised again<br>in new life."<br><br>Baptism is an act of obedience to God *after* we have already been<br>saved. The Bible says that believers are to be baptized, not that<br>baptism is necessary to be saved, or that baptism does anything special<br>for you. It doesn't "cleanse you of sin", only Christ does this when you<br>repent of your sin.<br><br>\<br><br>And as for baptism cleansing you of your blasphemous thoughts, I have<br>bad news for you. *You're always going to have blasphemous thoughts.*<br>But not because you're a bad person, because you're a *fallen* person.<br>You are a fallible human, living in a frail, sinful, fallen body. It is<br>the nature of our life on earth that we are bathed in sin. There is<br>nothing to be done for it.<br><br>We simply must recognize that our minds are sinful and will always turn<br>to sin if we allow them to run around unchecked. Just know that when you<br>have those thoughts, it is simply because you live in a sinful body. Do<br>not let the thoughts win. You and Christ, together, are stronger than<br>the thoughts. Christ gives you the power to overcome the thoughts when<br>you ask Him to help you. And He will, because He is faithful to keep His<br>promises.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
