<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>For full time police officers, their police powers never go away. They<br>are always police officers 24x7. Their duty to enforce state law and to<br>protect the public at large does not end at the end of the shift. To<br>that end, their bosses (police chiefs and city councils) want them to be<br>prepared to utilize that training and authority and to be ready to<br>intervene at any time, whether on duty or off duty. Those bosses will<br>*mandate* that those officers carry at a minimum their firearm and their<br>credentials at all times. State law usually indicates the same thing<br>(i.e. because a full-time police officer retains his police powers when<br>off duty, they can carry firearms at any time).<br><br>This is different from part-time officers (i.e. Reserves, Augmentees,<br>Auxiliary, etc). Part time officers only have police powers (depending<br>on agency) while they are on duty. Once off duty, they are civilians.<br>(Interesting note: our Sheriff still wanted us Reserves to carry while<br>off duty, so in order to be compliant with the law, on the back side of<br>our Sheriff's Office ID cards is printed a Concealed Weapons Permit.<br>Full time deputies do not require this extra step).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
