<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It depends on if it's a Primary election, or the General election.<br><br>If it's a Primary, I'm going to be looking for someone "Trump-like."<br>That means I'm going to be looking for someone who has similar ideas to<br>Trump on how to repair the economy, and how to grow jobs, and how to<br>enact sensible limits on abortion nationwide, and how to reduce the<br>burden of unconstitutional laws on our right to keep and bear arms,<br>while still prosecuting criminals to the fullest extent of the laws we<br>do have. Hopefully, someone like that runs, and they'll get my vote. But<br>I'll be looking for someone without all the "baggage" of Trump. Trump's<br>biggest problem is Trump. He is his own worst enemy. His inarticulate<br>speech gets him into trouble. His brashness tends to overshadow the good<br>work that he tries to do. So in a Primary, I'm looking for someone who<br>is "Trump-like," but probably not Trump.<br><br>If it's a General and the party has seen fit to nominate Trump, I'm<br>voting for Trump. Better Trump than *any* Democrat. Every plank in the<br>Democrat party platform is evil. Every. One. Not a single one of them<br>does what they claim it will do, and they actually have proven that they<br>have ulterior motives which are actually evil. So if it's Trump or a<br>Democrat, it's Trump.<br><br>This is not really that difficult to understand.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
