<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>While laws are different between states, the general rule is that your<br>charge is based on the laws that were in place at the time you were<br>charged and convicted. Since you were convicted as a felon, you are<br>still a felon.<br><br>Some states allow citizens to seek expungement for certain non-violent<br>felonies. It would be best to seek the advice of a criminal defense<br>attorney to see what your options are in this case.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
