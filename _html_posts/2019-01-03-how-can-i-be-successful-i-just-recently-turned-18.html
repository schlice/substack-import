<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can I be successful? I just recently turned 18 but have been<br>diagnosed with multiple sclerosis on my birthday, September 17.**<br><br>First of all, I'm sorry to hear about your diagnosis. You're 18 now, so<br>I'm not going to sugar coat anything for you.<br><br>The next few months are going to be pretty rough. You've got a lot of<br>emotions to work through, and none of them are very much fun. You're<br>going to go through the *five stages of grief*, or commonly known as<br>DABDA:<br><br>- Denial. "Nah, I feel fine, I don't really have MS. Maybe the<br>  neurologist was wrong."<br>- Anger. "Why me? It's not fair! What did I do to deserve this?"<br>- Bargaining. Oftentimes, this involves making a deal with God for a<br>  longer life in exchange for a reformed lifestyle. "If you make this go<br>  away, I promise I'll never *\<insert_bad_thing_here\>* again."<br>- Depression. "My life is over. I have MS now, and there's no cure.<br>  What's the point?"<br>- Acceptance. "I may have MS, but MS doesn't have me" and "I may<br>  have a few issues to deal with, but I can fight this, and my life can<br>  still be great."<br><br>How much time you spend in each phase is totally up to you. You may get<br>through one phase really quickly, and you may stay in another stage for<br>weeks.<br><br>But you should know: *you will get through it*. You can't go around it.<br>You can't avoid it. You have to go through it.<br><br>Once you do come out on the other side of your grief, you'll find that<br>your life will still be full and great and you can do anything you want<br>to do. Yes, you'll have a few new issues to deal with, but if you work<br>closely with your care team and you take an approved MS medication, you<br>will be able to keep disease activity to a minimum, and you'll limit the<br>duration and intensity of relapses.<br><br>What you must remember: You are a person who happens to have MS. You are<br>not your MS. The disease must not define you, and you must not let it.<br>It's just a facet of your life; it does not define your life.<br><br>If you have specific questions, feel free to ask them. It may be a<br>little scary right now, but it will get better.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
