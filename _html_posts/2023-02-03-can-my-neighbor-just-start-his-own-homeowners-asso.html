<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sure! Anyone can start a voluntary HOA. Just remember that it is a<br>voluntary HOA. Your neighbor cannot create an HOA that is binding on<br>anyone who does not voluntarily agree to be part of it.<br><br>In most cases in most states (state law is binding here), you can only<br>start a *mandatory* HOA with the approval of 100% of the homeowners in<br>the neighborhood. Without that, the best you can do is start a voluntary<br>HOA.<br><br>It's kinda like a club. You pay dues, you get benefits. I don't know<br>what benefits would be under the control of this particular HOA, but<br>whatever they are, you'd only get those benefits if you join that HOA.<br><br>For example, let's say that you had a clubhouse. Before the old HOA<br>disbanded, those assets would go somewhere. They either would have been<br>sold or deeded to someone or some organization. And for argument's sake,<br>let's say that your neighbor owns the clubhouse now. He can start his<br>own HOA and call it the Neighborhood Clubhouse HOA, and the people who<br>join have exclusive use of the clubhouse any time they choose. Others<br>can request access, but they have to pay usage fees, and they only have<br>limited access. This would be an example of a voluntary HOA.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
