<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In some jurisdictions, seated politicians can be disqualified from jury<br>service. There are no religious objections to jury service that I am<br>aware of, so it's unlikely that you would be disqualified from jury<br>service due to religious reasons.<br><br>However, a person who holds strong religious or political views may be<br>*excused* from serving on a particular jury during an interview process<br>called *voire dire.* Potential jurors are questioned by the judge and<br>the attorneys to assess their suitability to serve on a jury. They<br>determine, among other things specific to each case, whether or not they<br>can be impartial, even if they disagree (religiously or politically)<br>with what the accused is accused of doing.<br><br>Someone participating in *voire dire* can voice their religious or<br>political reasoning during that time, and if the judge and/or the<br>attorneys agree, that person can be excused from that jury.<br><br>But there is no *permanent* excusal for religious or political reasons<br>that I'm aware of in any jurisdiction.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
