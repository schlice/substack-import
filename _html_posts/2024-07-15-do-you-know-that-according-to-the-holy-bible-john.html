<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Absolutely! God loves all of us, as *God is love*. He cannot *not* love<br>us.<br><br>He is infinitely loving, and we can't even comprehend just how loving He<br>is. But at the same time, He is also infinitely just. Everyone will get<br>what they deserve. And God perfectly hates our sin. He is the only one<br>who can perfectly love and perfectly hate at the same time.<br><br>And since we are *all* sinners, we all *deserve* hell.<br><br>But in addition to being all-loving and all-just, He is all-merciful and<br>all-gracious. *He made a way for justice to still be served, but for<br>someone else to take the punishment for our sin that we so richly<br>deserve.*<br><br>He made it so that Jesus would take the punishment for our sin, *if we<br>choose that path.*<br><br>Are you suggesting that He will simply pardon the sin of all of those<br>sinners simply because He loves us?<br><br>Not even close.<br><br>He would not cheapen the sacrifice of His son at the hands of a band of<br>hateful religious zealots by making it so that sacrifice was not<br>necessary. The Bible is abundantly clear that it is only faith in Christ<br>which saves us, despite how much God loves us and hates to see us choose<br>something that is not Him. But He loves us so much that He is willing to<br>allow us to reject Him if we choose it.<br><br>TL;DR: God's love is infinite. God's ***salvation*, though, is<br>not.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
