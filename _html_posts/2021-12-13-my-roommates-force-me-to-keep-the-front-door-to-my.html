<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It is unreasonable of them for you to be unsafe in the apartment simply<br>because they feel inconvenienced by having to reach for a key. It's also<br>unreasonable for you to have to leave the apartment unlocked, even when<br>you leave, because they feel inconvenienced by having to remember to<br>take their keys.<br><br>But there is a simple and inexpensive solution. Find out if your<br>apartment will allow you to install a keypad lock. I would suggest one<br>that incorporates *both* a key and a keypad. Something like this:<br><br>[https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBas\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cb335d&url=https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Traditional-Electronic-Keypad-Deadbolt/dp/B07J4VLVPF){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-6ea134914effcad7d37532f43fb9174c){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-6ea134914effcad7d37532f43fb9174c" master_w="290"<br>master_h="405"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>The reason I linked this one is that it is *cheap*. It's less than \$50.<br>Note that it doesn't have all the whiz-bang smart features that more<br>expensive keypad locks have, but it achieves the purpose you're looking<br>for: your roommates will never be locked out again.<br><br>This particular lock also features an *auto-lock* function, customizable<br>from 10--99 seconds after it is opened. So *you* don't have to worry<br>about whether or not *you* locked the door. And if everyone has a code,<br>it doesn't matter if it is locked or unlocked.<br><br>Additionally, you can give the landlord one of the new keys and they<br>won't need to remember a code, so it shouldn't inconvenience your<br>landlord at all. Just keep all the old hardware (and the old keys) so<br>you can reinstall their old lock when you leave.<br><br>The last complex I lived in allowed us to install locks like this, so<br>long as we gave the landlord a copy of the new key, and we put it back<br>the way we found it when we left. Of course, you would be responsible<br>for any damage to the door you cause by doing this, but that goes<br>without saying. Just be careful and you'll be just fine.<br><br>Finally, if this is something that is really important to your<br>roommates, they'll happily chip in on the cost. For about \$15 a piece<br>if there are at least three of you, you can eliminate the problem of<br>lost or forgotten keys completely.<br><br>And if your complex doesn't allow you to change the door lock, start<br>locking the door anyway. Letting them get locked out a few times will<br>certainly help them to remember their keys next time.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>My roommates force me to keep the front door to my apartment unlocked<br>all day, every day. They say it's because they forget their keys or<br>don't want to reach into their pockets to grab the keys. What should I<br>do?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
