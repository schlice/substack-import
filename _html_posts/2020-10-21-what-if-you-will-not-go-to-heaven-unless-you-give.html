<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What if you will not go to heaven unless you give others your material<br>possession? Explain please.**<br><br>It is only faith in Jesus that brings eternal life.<br><br>> *For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that<br>> whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. ---<br>> John 3:16 NIV*<br><br>Notice the text: whoever believes in him, which means that anyone<br>who believes that he is God and he died for your sins is eligible. Then<br>it says shall not perish, which means that those who choose to not<br>believe *shall perish*. Finally, it says but have eternal life,<br>which indicates the reward for believing.<br><br>However, if you have been saved, wouldn't that generate good deeds<br>(which include helping the poor by donating things)? The Bible says that<br>it will.<br><br>> *Don't you remember that our ancestor Abraham was shown to be right<br>> with God by his actions when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?<br>> You see, his faith and his actions worked together. His actions made<br>> his faith complete. And so it happened just as the Scriptures say:<br>> "Abraham believed God, and God counted him as righteous because of his<br>> faith." He was even called the friend of God. So you see, we are shown<br>> to be right with God by what we do, not by faith alone. --- James<br>> 2:21--24*<br><br>Faith and action work together. You don't have faith without action.<br>This is why you'll often see people say "faith without works is dead."<br>So if you say you have faith but you do not do good works, do you really<br>have faith?<br><br>There isn't a set requirement for what you must do, but God expects us<br>to do good works to complete the faith.<br><br>The faith saves you, the works complete you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
