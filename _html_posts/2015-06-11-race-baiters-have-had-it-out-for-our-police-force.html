<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In actuality, cops are six times more likely to be shot by<br>someone who is black than the other way around. Around 98% of black<br>shooting deaths do not even involve the police.\<br>\<br>The meme exists because the race baiters want to continue to push the<br>false anti-cop narrative because the race game makes them money. The<br>race business (which contain businesses such as the NAACP) is big money,<br>and they have done a great job of monetizing white guilt. Perpetuating<br>racial prejudice, real or perceived, is their job, their business, their<br>livelihood, and they make lots of money from doing it. If the truth<br>about racism were to come out, the NAACP and their ilk would stand to<br>lose a great deal of income.\<br>\<br>As with any of these things, it comes down to money. Follow the money,<br>and you\'ll find the reasoning.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
