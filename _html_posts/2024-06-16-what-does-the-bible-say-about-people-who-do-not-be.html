<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Jesus taught this at His famous Sermon on the Mount. I'm going to paste<br>quite a bit of it here, try to read it with an open mind and an open<br>heart. Let the words speak to you.<br><br>> "Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing,<br>> but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. By their fruit you will<br>> recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from<br>> thistles? Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree<br>> bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree<br>> cannot bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is<br>> cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will<br>> recognize them.<br>><br>> "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of<br>> heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in<br>> heaven. Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not<br>> prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your<br>> name perform many miracles?' Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never<br>> knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'<br>><br>> "Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into<br>> practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain<br>> came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that<br>> house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.<br>> But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into<br>> practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain<br>> came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that<br>> house, and it fell with a great crash." --- Matthew 7:15--27 NIV<br><br>Notice in that second paragraph where it talks about the people who did<br>all the good deeds but didn't believe? That's the answer to your<br>question. They did all the good things, but because they didn't believe,<br>they will still be told, at the end, "Away from me, you evildoers.<br>*I never knew you."*<br><br>And look at all the amazing things they did! They prophesied in Jesus'<br>name! (I bet you'll see plenty of pastors in hell after the last day<br>because of this). They *literally used the power of Jesus to cast out<br>demons!* But doing all those amazing things alone did not save them.<br><br>And that's the point. Works alone will not save you. Works *grow out<br>of salvation*, not the other way around. The works are important,<br>therefore, because *they indicate the salvation*. If you don't see the<br>works, you can bet that there's no salvation.<br><br>But importantly, you *can* still see the works *without* the salvation.<br>The source of the works matters though, because when there's no<br>salvation, the works come from yourself. When you are saved, the works<br>come from the spirit of God.<br><br>Who are you representing when you do good works? Are you representing<br>yourself, or are you acting as a beacon of God's love? Which love is<br>more lasting? Which love matters more?<br><br>\<br><br>(EDIT) Since it seems this answer is causing confusion, let me give<br>another Bible answer which illustrates what the Bible says is the<br>ultimate destination of those who do not believe in God but are still<br>good people. *Can they earn their way to salvation?*<br><br>Matthew 19 has the story of the rich man which may also help our<br>understanding regarding this:<br><br>> Just then a man came up to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing<br>> must I do to get eternal life?"<br>><br>> "Why do you ask me about what is good?" Jesus replied. "There is only<br>> One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments."<br>><br>> "Which ones?" he inquired.<br>><br>> Jesus replied, "'You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery,<br>> you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your<br>> father and mother,' and 'love your neighbor as yourself.'"<br>><br>> "All these I have kept," the young man said. "What do I still lack?"<br>><br>> Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions<br>> and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come,<br>> follow me."<br>><br>> When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great<br>> wealth.<br>><br>> Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for<br>> someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you,<br>> it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for<br>> someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."<br>><br>> When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked,<br>> "Who then can be saved?"<br>><br>> Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with<br>> God all things are possible." (Matthew 19:16--26 NIV)<br><br>The first thing we note in this story is that the rich man is asking a<br>good question: "What good deed must I do to have eternal life?" In<br>asking the question, he acknowledges the fact that, despite all his<br>efforts to be a good person thus far, there is something lacking, and he<br>wants to know what else must be done to obtain eternal life. However, he<br>is asking the question from the wrong worldview---that of merit ("What<br>good deed *must I do?*"); he has failed to grasp the true meaning of the<br>Law, as Jesus will point out to him, which was to serve as a tutor until<br>the time of Christ (Galatians 3:24).<br><br>The second thing to note is Jesus' response to his question. Jesus asks<br>a question in return: why is he inquiring into what is good? Jesus gets<br>to the heart of the matter, namely, that no one is good and no one does<br>good except God.<br><br>The young man is operating under a false premise: **that a good person<br>is able to earn his way into heaven.** This is the focus of the OP's<br>question: what the Bible says about someone who is loving and kind but<br>does not believe; what happens to those who believe that they can earn<br>their own way into heaven without belief in God or Christ.<br><br>To make His point, Jesus says that, if the young man wants eternal life,<br>he should keep the commandments. In saying this, Jesus is not advocating<br>a works-based righteousness. Rather, Jesus is challenging the young<br>man's suppositions by showing the man's shallow understanding of the Law<br>and human ability.<br><br>The young man's response is telling. When told to keep the commandments,<br>he asks Jesus, "Which ones?" Jesus continues to gently show the man the<br>error of his ways by giving him the commandments that deal with our<br>relationships to other people. You can almost sense the frustration in<br>the young man's response when he tells Jesus that he has kept all of<br>these since his youth---he insists that he's been a good person.<br><br>Jesus then tells him that, if he wishes to be perfect---a truly good<br>person---he must sell all that he has and come follow Him. Jesus has<br>perfectly diagnosed what the young man truly "lacks"---his attachment to<br>his wealth. The man's great wealth has become an idol in his life. He<br>claimed to have kept all the commandments, but in reality, he couldn't<br>even keep the first one, to have no other gods before the Lord!<br><br>The young man turned his back on Jesus and walked away. His god was his<br>wealth, which he chose over Jesus.<br><br>Jesus then turns to His disciples to teach them a principle: "Again I<br>tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle<br>than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God." This was<br>shocking to the disciples, who held the common idea that riches were a<br>sign of God's blessing. But Jesus points out that riches often are, in<br>their tendency to fuel self-sufficiency, an obstacle to faith. His<br>disciples ask, "Who then can be saved?" Jesus answers by reminding the<br>disciples that salvation is of God: "With man this is impossible, but<br>with God all things are possible."<br><br>Who then *can* be saved? If left up to man alone, no one! **Why is being<br>a good person not enough to get you into heaven? *Because no one is<br>a "good" person!*** There is only One who is good, and that is God<br>Himself. No one can keep the Law perfectly. The Bible says that all have<br>sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). The Bible<br>also says that the wages of our sin is death (Romans 6:23a).<br>Fortunately, God did not wait until we somehow learned to be "good;"<br>while we were still sinners, Christ died for us (Romans 5:8).<br><br>Salvation is not based on *our* goodness but on *Jesus*' goodness. If we<br>confess with our mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in our hearts that<br>God raised him from the dead, we will be saved (Romans 10:9). This<br>salvation in Christ is a precious gift, and, like all true gifts, it is<br>unearned (Romans 6:23; Ephesians 2:8--9). The message of the gospel is<br>that we can never be good enough to get to heaven. We must recognize<br>that we are sinners who fall short of God's glory, and we must obey the<br>command to repent of our sins and place our faith and trust in Jesus<br>Christ. Christ alone was a "good person"---good enough to earn<br>heaven---and He gives His righteousness to those who believe in His name<br>(Romans 1:17).<br><br>Back to the original question. What does the Bible say about someone who<br>does not believe? **If they do not confess with their mouth that Jesus<br>is Lord and believe in their hearts that God raised Him from the dead,<br>they will not be saved.** Regardless of how loving or kind they are.<br>Regardless of what deeds they have done. Regardless of anything they<br>even have the ability to *do*. The only thing that will save you is<br>repentance and belief. Salvation without belief is impossible.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
