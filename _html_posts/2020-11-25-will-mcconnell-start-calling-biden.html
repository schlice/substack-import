<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It is not the presence or absence of a transition team that makes one<br>the president-elect. The president-elect is the president-elect when he<br>has actually been elected.<br><br>*And despite what the media is trying to tell you, that has not happened<br>yet.*<br><br>That event will actually happen when the electoral college votes. If the<br>electoral college awards Biden more than 270 votes, he will be the<br>president-elect.<br><br>And not one second before.<br><br>The media is free to continue to call him president-elect. You are free<br>to call him president-elect. He is free to call himself president-elect<br>if he chooses.<br><br>None of that actually makes him president-elect.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
