<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's let Ryan's own words describe what Ryan meant, rather than us<br>trying to interpret what he said and inserting our own biases into an<br>answer:<br><br>> \"Let it all out, get it all out there, cleanse the organization,\"<br>> Ryan said at a breakfast event with members of the press, according to<br>> the report.<br>><br>> \"I think we should disclose all this stuff\" in the memo, said Ryan,<br>> who has previously skirted questions about it. \"It\'s the best<br>> disinfectant --- accountability, transparency, for the sake of the<br>> reputation of our institutions.\"<br><br>It appears that Ryan is discussing what is known as "institutional bias"<br>--- where members of an organization allow their personal biases to<br>affect their work, which is supposed to be objective and bias-free.<br><br>It is impossible for any investigatory body to be completely free of<br>bias, because people are involved in the process, and every person has<br>some bias. However, in the case of the FBI, and according to the<br>allegations in the memo, the levels of bias have compromised the<br>sanctity of the investigation process.<br><br>His words have nothing to do with loyalty to a person, or loyalty to the<br>Constitution. They have everything to do with the ability of a person to<br>leave their personal biases at the door and conduct a fair and impartial<br>investigation, which the memo alleges is not occurring at the FBI.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
