<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What happened to the NORAD boss after the complete failure on 9/11?<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>Because despite what [[Marc<br>Leeser](https://www.quora.com/profile/Marc-Leeser)]{.qlink_container}<br>and the OP would have you believe, **no one in the military "failed" on<br>9/11**.<br><br>Up until September 11, 2001, the military was focused on threats coming<br>from *outside* of the country. Why was that? First of all, it's because<br>*the law demanded it*. The Posse Comitatus Act and the Insurrection Act,<br>which are two of the oldest Federal laws in the country, forbids the<br>military from acting within US borders, enforcing US laws. In order to<br>get the military to engage domestically, it literally took an act of God<br>and Congress. So NORAD's air defense posture was to watch the ADIZ for<br>incoming aircraft. Read this answer for more details about that.<br><br>[[Bill Stein\'s answer to If an unidentified passenger plane flew into<br>the American mainland and ignored all attempts at communicating with it,<br>how would the military<br>respond?](https://www.quora.com/If-an-unidentified-passenger-plane-flew-into-the-American-mainland-and-ignored-all-attempts-at-communicating-with-it-how-would-the-military-respond/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>NORAD was never permitted to even so much as *look* at US aircraft,<br>operating within US airspace, with valid flight plans. That was the<br>jurisdiction of the FAA, not NORAD. Of course, NORAD had direct lines to<br>the FAA regional centers (and still does) so that we can coordinate<br>response when intruders cross the ADIZ into North American airspace, but<br>for domestic flights, we had no jurisdiction.<br><br>Therefore, on the morning of September 11th, NORAD crews saw **nothing<br>out of the ordinary**. The FAA was tracking some aircraft which had gone<br>off-course, but that was not a military concern. It was a *domestic*<br>concern, which would be handled by *domestic* law enforcement, not the<br>military.<br><br>We all saw the same thing that you saw, at the same time you saw it,<br>live, on TV, after the first plane had crashed into 1 WTC, and Paula<br>Zahn was covering it live, and the second plane crashed into 2 WTC,<br>right over her shoulder.<br><br>That's when everyone's collective minds went from, "This is highly<br>unusual but still could have been a tragic accident" to "This is<br>deliberate." But that didn't change the fact that even though US<br>military leaders had a good idea that the attack was deliberate, they<br>had no authority to *do* anything; they had no mechanism by which they<br>could do anything legally.<br><br>The military underwent some massive changes following 9/11. Besides the<br>Homeland Security Act which established the Department of Homeland<br>Security, President Bush also approved a new Unified Command Plan (UCP)<br>which created US Northern Command (USNORTHCOM). According to the UCP,<br>Northern Command\'s mission is to:<br><br>- Conduct operations to deter, prevent, and defeat threats and<br>  aggression aimed at the United States, its territories, and interests<br>  within the assigned area of responsibility and,<br>- As directed by the President or Secretary of Defense provide military<br>  assistance to civil authorities including consequence management<br>  operations<br><br>USNORTHCOM has participated in several domestic "consequence management<br>operations" since 9/11, and has remained on standby to assist the<br>President with providing military assistance to civilians.<br><br>But I bet you can already see the problem: the Posse Comitatus Act as<br>well as the Insurrection Act which still prevent the US military from<br>enforcing Federal or State laws. They did try to give NORTHCOM more<br>authority, but the nation's oldest laws held firm:<br><br>> The Military Commissions Act of 2006 lifted many restrictions placed<br>> on the military to support civilian administration by the Posse<br>> Comitatus Act, however the US Supreme Court ruled in June 2008 that<br>> significant portions of the MCA were unconstitutional. The \"John<br>> Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007\" H.R. 5122 (2006)<br>> effectively nullified the limits of the Insurrection Act when it was<br>> passed; however, the bill was amended in<br>> 2008.\[1\](#LIflo){#cite-LIflo .citation_link}<br><br>The amendment to the Defense Authorization Act in 2008 essentially<br>gutted most of the nullification of the Insurrection Act.<br><br>As you can see, there is still significant uncertainty pertaining to<br>what the military is actually authorized to do when it comes to<br>supporting state law enforcement when discussing situations internal to<br>the homeland.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-LIflo){.citation_index} [[United States Northern Command -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b3e898&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Northern_Command){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
