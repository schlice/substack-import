<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>***TLDR: Science cannot prove that God exists. Logic can prove beyond a<br>reasonable doubt (not beyond all doubt) that God does exist.***<br><br>Whether you believe God exists or not, He is, by definition,<br>*immaterial* and *transcendent*. He is *immaterial* because He is not<br>composed of physical matter, not made of material stuff like you and me<br>(it is necessary for Him to be immaterial because He created matter, so<br>He must be outside of it). And God is *transcendent* because He exists<br>beyond space and time (it is necessary to exist beyond space and time in<br>order to create them). Thus, when we're searching for God, we do not<br>expect to find direct, physical, scientific evidence for His existence<br>within space and time. This fact is important: it is not just that we<br>have not yet found such evidence even though it may exist, it is that<br>such evidence is *impossible*, even in principle. We are not going to<br>find one of God's hairs, or discover His footprint, or run a scientific<br>experiment to see if He exists.<br><br>So clearly, science is not the right tool to prove that God exists, in<br>the same way that a metal detector is not the right tool to find a<br>plastic cup.<br><br>The right tools, or the right proofs, are "logical" proofs, which are<br>contained in the discipline called *philosophy.* Philosophy is concerned<br>with life's most important issues, from morality to meaning to God.<br>Philosophy allows us to probe realities that can't be detected through<br>our senses; thus, philosophy provides an excellent method to explore<br>evidence for the existence of God.<br><br>Let's not forget, philosophy is not divorced from science, as if you can<br>rely on science alone, and philosophy is just pseudo-babble for PhDs to<br>discuss while smoking pipes in dimly-lit rooms. Philosophy is the<br>*foundation* of science. Science is dependent on philosophy. In fact,<br>*science is a slave to philosophy.* Bad philosophy results in bad<br>science, and good science requires good philosophy. Why? Because:<br><br>> 1.  Science cannot be done without philosophy. Philosophical<br>>     assumptions are utilized in the search for causes, and, therefore,<br>>     cannot be the result of them. For example, scientists assume (by<br>>     faith) that reason and the scientific method allow us to<br>>     accurately understand the world around us. That cannot be proven<br>>     by science itself. You can't prove the tools of science---the laws<br>>     of logic, the Law of Causality, the Principle of Uniformity, or<br>>     the reliability of observation---by running some kind of<br>>     experiment. You have to assume those things are true in order to<br>>     do the experiment. So science is built on philosophy.<br>>     Unfortunately, many so-called scientists are very poor<br>>     philosophers.<br>> 2.  **Philosophical assumptions can dramatically impact scientific<br>>     conclusions**. If a scientist assumes beforehand that only natural<br>>     causes are possible, then probably no amount of evidence will<br>>     convince him that intelligence created the first one-celled amoeba<br>>     or any other designed entity. When Darwinists presuppose that<br>>     intelligent causes are impossible, then natural laws are the only<br>>     game in town. Likewise, if a creationist rules out natural causes<br>>     beforehand (and we don't know of any who do), then he also risks<br>>     missing the right answer. But a scientist who is open-minded to<br>>     both natural and intelligent causes can follow the evidence<br>>     wherever it leads.<br>> 3.  Science doesn't really say anything---scientists do. Data are<br>>     always interpreted by scientists. When those scientists let their<br>>     personal preferences or unproven philosophical assumptions dictate<br>>     their interpretation of the evidence, they do exactly what they<br>>     accuse religious people of doing---they let their ideology dictate<br>>     their conclusions. When that's the case, their conclusions should<br>>     be questioned, because they may be nothing more than philosophical<br>>     presuppositions passed off as scientific<br>>     facts\[1\](#gUQDb){#cite-gUQDb .citation_link}.<br><br>Philosophy typically offers evidence in the form of *arguments*. In<br>fact, thinkers over the years have identified no fewer than twenty<br>arguments for God, arguments that range from the clear and simple to the<br>extremely complex. Some of these arguments appeal to the universe or<br>history, others to the existence of reason and beauty.<br><br>We can approach the God question from many angles, and there is no one<br>best way. But I think there is one argument that is not only clear and<br>convincing, but easy enough to understand.<br><br>First, if terms like "arguments" or "evidence" bother you, you might<br>instead consider these arguments as "clues" that converge and point to a<br>common conclusion, much the way road signs guide you to a specific<br>destination. A sign doesn't prove that the destination exists, but it<br>does point the way. These arguments are signposts to God. So, let us<br>look at one signpost that in my opinion, presents perhaps the simplest<br>yet most powerful argument for God's existence.<br><br>The "Kalam Cosmological Argument" dates back to the Middle Ages but has<br>been made popular today by William Lane Craig, an evangelical Christian<br>philosopher. The argument is very simple; in fact, it is probably the<br>easiest of all the arguments to understand, having two premises and one<br>conclusion:<br><br>- P1: Everything which begins to exist has a cause.<br>- P2: The universe began to exist.<br>- C1: The universe has a cause.<br><br>So let's dig in to these two premises and one conclusion:<br><br>Premise 1: This statement says everything that has a beginning has a<br>cause. It's very important that we get this right. Some atheists try to<br>refute this premise by responding, "But if everything that exists has a<br>cause, and God exists, then what caused God?" But the premise does not<br>claim, "Everything that *exists* has a cause." It says, "Everything that<br>*begins to exist* has a cause." Since God, by definition, and whether<br>you believe in Him or not, is eternal and never began to exist, this<br>first premise does not apply to Him. Therefore, the rhetorical question<br>"What caused God?" is like asking, "To whom is the bachelor married?" or<br>"What is the sound of one hand clapping?" Regardless of whether<br>bachelors or hands exist, these questions do not make sense. They are<br>literally nonsense because they confuse the meaning of terms.<br><br>Now that we have cleared away that misunderstanding, let us turn back to<br>the first premise. Is it true? Does everything that begins to exist have<br>a cause? For most people, the answer is yes; it is common sense. Almost<br>nobody denies it. The statement simply means that nothing just springs<br>into existence, randomly and without a cause. For if things did come<br>into being this way, then our world would be a wild spree of things<br>apparently popping into existence like sleight of hand magic. Only it<br>would be worse, since with sleight of hand you at least have a magician<br>who pulls rabbits out of a hat. However, in a world that violates this<br>first premise, rabbits would pop in and out of being even without<br>magicians or hats. Few sane people believe the world works this way.<br>Even the great atheist David Hume said, "I never asserted so absurd a<br>proposition as that something should arise without a cause." So, through<br>experience and reflection most people, even most honest atheists, agree<br>that everything that begins to exist has a cause.<br><br>Premise 2: This claim is slightly more controversial than the first<br>one. In fact, no less a thinker than St. Thomas Aquinas says that the<br>truth that the world had a beginning of its duration is only<br>conclusively known by faith and not by reason. Nonetheless, a host of<br>the greatest minds from antiquity to the present, including St.<br>Bonaventure in the Middle Ages and William Lane Craig today, offer<br>arguments that purport to defend this truth. An example of one of these<br>arguments, one which St. Bonaventure includes in his paradoxes of the<br>infinite, goes as follows: If the world has always existed, then there<br>would be an infinite number of past days. However, if there were an<br>infinite number of past days, we never would have been able to arrive at<br>the present day because an infinite series, by definition, cannot be<br>traversed. Since we have arrived at today (and today is the end date of<br>history), it follows that there must have been a beginning of time (a<br>beginning date).<br><br>Modern physics also seems to give weight to this position. Despite<br>cyclic cosmological models advanced by some physicists in recent years,<br>since the advent of the big bang theory in the twentieth century, the<br>scientific consensus is that the universe did have a beginning roughly<br>fourteen billion years ago. Alexander Vilenkin, a leading non-Christian<br>cosmologist, was invited to speak at a colloquium for Stephen Hawking's<br>seventieth birthday. There, in front of the greatest scientists in the<br>world, Vilenkin said, "All the evidence we have says that the universe<br>had a beginning." It is rare for scientists to speak with this measure<br>of conclusiveness, but Vilenkin stated his opinion that it is not just<br>that *some* of the evidence points to a beginning of the universe, or<br>even the *majority* of evidence, but that *all* of the evidence points<br>that way today.<br><br>Conclusion: The two premises are widely accepted today: everything<br>that begins to exist has a cause, and the universe began to exist. If<br>that is the case, then the third statement, the conclusion of the<br>argument, logically follows. We cannot avoid the fact that if everything<br>that begins to exist has a cause, and the universe began to exist, then<br>the universe must have had a cause.<br><br>This logical conclusion leads us to wonder: if the universe had a cause,<br>*what* is that cause? The cause certainly could not have been anything<br>*within* the universe or even *the universe itself*, since things can't<br>cause themselves to come into existence. This idea defies logic. Thus,<br>the cause of the universe must be something *beyond* the universe,<br>something beyond all matter, energy, space, and time. In other words, it<br>must be transcendent (beyond the universe), it must be immaterial<br>(beyond matter and space), it must be eternal (beyond time), and if it<br>has created something so massively complex as the universe, it must be<br>tremendously powerful and intelligent. Well, a transcendent, immaterial,<br>eternal, supremely powerful, and intelligent cause of the<br>universe---what does that sound like to you? As Thomas Aquinas pithily<br>puts it, "This is what most people mean by 'God.'"<br><br>Now of course, this doesn't tell us anything about *which* God exists,<br>or anything about that God. It simply is a logical proof which shows<br>that logically-speaking, a creator God must exist.<br><br>\<br><br>Before you go scrambling over yourself to bang out a response, remember<br>that these proofs have been debated for hundreds of years, and the<br>debate continues today. Each side presents its case, and the conclusions<br>you draw usually depend on your worldview and the things you presuppose<br>about the meaning of life.<br><br>*If you have a different opinion, please feel free to answer the<br>question yourself. It brings more worth to the site as a whole (comments<br>are less valuable than answers). But if you have questions about*<br>*this* *opinion, feel free to politely ask.*<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-gUQDb){.citation_index} [[I Don\'t Have Enough Faith to Be<br>an Atheist: Geisler, Norman L., Turek, Frank, Limbaugh, David:<br>9781433580758: Amazon.com:<br>Books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=770f5b&url=https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Have-Enough-Faith-Atheist/dp/1433580756){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
