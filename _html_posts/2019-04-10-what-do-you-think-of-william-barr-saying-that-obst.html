<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What do you think of William Barr saying that obstruction details will<br>not be redacted when he releases the Mueller report?**<br><br>Despite what the nay-sayers are predicting, Barr has shown, at least up<br>to this point, that he is going to follow the law when it comes to what<br>information is being redacted.<br><br>Don\'t forget that he is not doing this redaction in a vacuum. He is<br>working with Mueller\'s team to accomplish it.<br><br>And if something is redacted that has no business being redacted, I<br>fully expect Mueller\'s team to be front and center in calling that out.<br>I will take as highly suspect any media report which says anything like<br>"some members of Mueller\'s team mentioned to some other people at a<br>party that Barr redacted too much" or anything like that. That sort of<br>crap is bona fide 100% fake news.<br><br>But if the redacted report drops and within hours, Mueller is in front<br>of cameras saying that this version is not what they agreed to, *then*<br>it\'s time to question Barr\'s ability to fairly execute the law. Not<br>now.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
