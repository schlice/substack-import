<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it permissible under Federal Law for POTUS to commit crimes and not<br>be indicted for them?**<br><br>Under current interpretation of Federal law, most likely yes.<br><br>The President can commit a crime while in office and (most likely)<br>cannot be indicted for that crime while he is still in office. It's<br>never been tried. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has stated that it's<br>unlikely you can indict a sitting president, at least under Federal law.<br>He potentially could be indicted by a state, but I'm pretty sure the<br>White House doesn't have extradition treaties with US states, and a<br>criminal indictment by a state would probably be deemed to cause too<br>much interference to the job of the president to stand. The statute<br>would be tolled until the president was no longer president (either<br>naturally through election or through the impeachment process).<br><br>Back to committing a crime and not being indicted. This doesn't mean he<br>can't be held accountable for crimes committed in office. It simply<br>means that during the time he is president, he most likely can't be<br>indicted.<br><br>The Constitutional remedy for this is to *impeach* the president, remove<br>him from office, and then indict him for his crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
