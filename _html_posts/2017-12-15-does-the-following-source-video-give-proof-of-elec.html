<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If non-residents of Alabama voted in an Alabama election, according to<br>state law, those votes would be illegal.<br><br>To Democrats, you do whatever you need to do to win, because the only<br>thing that matters to Democrats is power. And it makes sense to smear<br>the other guy in order to win, because that falls in line with "whatever<br>you need to do." Attacking the other guy directly instead of addressing<br>the issues is par for the course for Democrats. Bringing in voters from<br>other states to vote in a state election would similarly be "whatever<br>you need to do."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
