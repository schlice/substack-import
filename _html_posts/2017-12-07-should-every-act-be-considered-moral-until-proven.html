Or<br>should (can) an act be proven to be moral in absolute terms?**<br><br>The problem in modern society is the source of morality.<br><br>For religious people, the source of their morality is God. For<br>non-religious people, the ultimate source of their morality is<br>themselves. They infer their own morality.<br><br>Therefore, we can't make any absolute statements about actions and<br>morality, since we can all have our own morality. Clearly though, there<br>are some acts that we almost universally consider immoral. Beyond that,<br>we simply can't consider any particular act automatically moral or<br>immoral, because there is no moral standard across the whole of society.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
