<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I know things seem "clear" to you from watching cell phone video. But<br>this is the danger of the body worn camera and the cell phone video<br>which you so wholeheartedly believe in.<br><br>Did you see how much the man was resisting arrest? No? Did you see any<br>of the altercation before the video started rolling? No? Do you have the<br>legal authorization to pass judgment on how much force is actually<br>allowed when effecting an arrest of an actively resisting suspect? No?<br>Do you know how many times this man was asked to follow crewmember<br>instructions and then was told to follow police instructions and he<br>actively refused? Actively refused means "resisted arrest."<br><br>Don't forget that this man is not a "victim." He is a "volunteer." He<br>volunteered to be assaulted by police when he actively refused to follow<br>law enforcement officer instructions and Federal law, and **assaulted a<br>cop**. You didn't know he hit the cop? No? Oh, I guess your cell phone<br>video angle must have missed that part.<br><br>I also don't know where you get the line that police officers are<br>required to take all reasonable steps to protect the subject they are<br>arresting. Can you detail the law you are quoting? When a suspect is<br>actively resisting, police are actually authorized to use one level of<br>force greater than the force being presented to them in order to bring<br>the suspect into compliance, lest others around the actively resisting<br>suspect be injured or (God forbid) killed.<br><br>Nice try though, your bias is showing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/In-the-latest-United-Airline-case-arent-the-police-also-culpable/answer/Stephen-Turner-4<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
