<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can the McKamey Manor continue to legally operate even though it<br>openly admits to torturing its guests?**<br><br>There are a few reasons that McKamey Manor is legal to operate.<br><br>1.  The experience does not fall under local zoning ordinances because<br>    it is not legally considered a business. Participants pay nothing to<br>    go through the up to 36 hour ordeal. At times, the owner has<br>    requested donations of dog food for his pets and donations to local<br>    animal shelters in the area. All of the employees are volunteers<br>2.  The owner, Russ McKamey, said he spends four hours with a potential<br>    participant, walking them through a 40-page waiver. He also said he<br>    requires a letter from a physician, a criminal background check,<br>    pre-event interviews and does a portable drug test the day of the<br>    event.<br><br>In his Tennessee location, the fact that he is not a business, and that<br>guests are voluntary participants, makes the entire "simulated torture"<br>thing legal.<br><br>He didn't previously have a safe word option, but because of some legal<br>trouble in San Diego, he now has implemented a safe word option that<br>allows a participant to stop the experience at any time. This only<br>contributes to the fact that the experience is completely voluntary and<br>can be terminated at any time, making the experience even more legally<br>protected.<br><br>McKamey says that it is very safe and that all of the experiences are<br>simulated. He has never been arrested for torturing anyone. He maintains<br>a safety crew that remains within a foot of the participants to ensure<br>their safety.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
