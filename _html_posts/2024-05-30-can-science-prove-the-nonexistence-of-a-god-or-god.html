<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Science cannot prove the nonexistence of God, just as science cannot<br>prove the existence of God. Science deals with the empirical. It deals<br>with things you can test and hypothesize and observe. Trying to find<br>material evidence of an immaterial God is simply impossible, not because<br>we haven't found it yet, but because such evidence *cannot* exist. It's<br>like trying to use an X-Ray machine to find a plastic spoon.<br><br>Secondly, while you can prove an affirmative existential proposition,<br>you cannot prove a negative existential proposition. For example, I<br>could tell you that red eagles exist, and you could tell me that red<br>eagles do not exist. In order to prove my position, I only need to<br>provide some evidence of at least one red eagle existing in order to<br>prove my assertion. But you would have to comb the entire universe and<br>literally be at every place at once to prove that no red eagles exist or<br>ever did exist. This is why intellectually honest atheists admit that<br>you cannot prove that God does not exist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
