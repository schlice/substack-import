<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No. They *could* only be charged with a crime if they were committing a<br>crime when they discovered the evidence of another crime.<br><br>They tell a story in the police academy of a burglar robbing a business<br>when he stumbles on a 55-gallon drum filled with drugs. He reports this<br>to the police, and honestly tells them that he was in the process of<br>robbing the place when he found the drum. He reports that he ceased his<br>robbery and immediately vacated the premises and reported what he found<br>to police.<br><br>*Could* he be charged with a crime? Yes he could, he could be charged<br>with the breaking and entering he admitted to. But would he be charged<br>with a *drug charge*? No, he would not.<br><br>Similarly, if you *accidentally* find evidence of a crime and report it<br>to the police, so long as your accident is verified (you weren't<br>actually committing another crime at the time) and you weren't involved<br>in the crime you are reporting, you won't be charged.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
