If the Democrats retain control of the<br>House, they can choose the Speaker. No one else has authority to select<br>the Speaker but the House.<br><br>If you want Pelosi out, vote Republican in November.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
