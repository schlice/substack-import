Period.<br><br>The issue is someone parking in a handicapped space without a permit.<br>You notify the store that there are cars parked in handicapped spots<br>without a tag. And you let the store handle it.<br><br>Then you go on with your life and you don't worry about things that do<br>not concern you.<br><br>Just repeat to yourself over and over, "Not my monkey, not my circus."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
