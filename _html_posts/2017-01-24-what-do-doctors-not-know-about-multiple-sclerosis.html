<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Your relationship with your care team is vital. You want a neurologist<br>who will listen to your concerns and work with you, as a team. If this<br>does not describe your relationship with your neurologist, it's time to<br>shop around.<br><br>[Fatigue(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4c2dce&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms/Fatigue){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} is one of the<br>most common symptoms of MS. One type of MS fatigue even has its own<br>name: *MS Lassitude*. It's estimated that over 80% of people with MS<br>have experienced this symptom at some point, some more severely than<br>others. I certainly know I have, but not all the time. When I push<br>myself in the heat, it kicks my butt at the end of the day. I've<br>literally fallen asleep in my clothes because I was so drained. I had to<br>have my wife drive us home one night after a particularly exhausting day<br>in the heat. I sat in the seat and instantly realized that there was no<br>way I was going to be able to safely drive home. It's a learning<br>process; you learn how hard you can push yourself, and you learn what<br>the consequences are to doing so.<br><br>Sorry that I don't have SSDI experience, but [[your local MS Society<br>chapter](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=28f09c&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Chapters){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} has people who<br>do.
