The fact<br>that lots of people want to come here does tend to support the truth of<br>that opinion, but it is not a direct 1:1 correlation. It's still just an<br>opinion.<br><br>Granted, I happen to hold that opinion as well, but the simple fact that<br>lots of people want to come here is not proof that America is great.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
