<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It doesn\'t just have to be a sweater. You can wear an entire sheriff\'s<br>uniform, badge and all, and a full duty belt replete with everything you<br>are legally allowed to carry, if you wanted to. That\'s all perfectly<br>legal, it\'s protected first amendment expression.<br><br>What you *cannot* do is attempt to do the job of a sheriff\'s<br>deputy. The moment that you begin to exercise the authority of a<br>sheriff\'s deputy is when you commit the crime of impersonating a police<br>officer.<br><br>You also can\'t use the uniform to try and get a 10% discount at<br>Starbucks. That\'s called theft of service, and it is also highly<br>illegal. Using the uniform to gain any special privilege that you<br>wouldn\'t normally have could be considered theft of service, or<br>impersonating a police officer.<br><br>I might add that a very small number of jurisdictions have laws<br>regarding whether or not non-deputies can wear a deputy\'s uniform, but<br>these laws just exist because they haven\'t been struck down yet. Those<br>laws are largely unenforceable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
