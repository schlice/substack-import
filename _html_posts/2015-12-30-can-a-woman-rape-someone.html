<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Depending on the jurisdiction, as some jurisdictions still have<br>antiquated laws which specify that the aggressor in a rape is male. A<br>woman attacking a man would be considered \"sexual assault\" in such a<br>jurisdiction.<br><br>Most jurisdictions have moved past this, and categorized rape based on<br>the unwanted sexual act, not the gender of the aggressor.<br><br>Additionally, male arousal is a biological function, not a conscious<br>decision. Many men can will against it, but it's not easy.<br><br>Knowing that arousal as a subconscious biological response to stimuli,<br>it is most certainly not considered consent.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
