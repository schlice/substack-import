You can listen to the message (even if you<br>don't accept Christ as your savior, you'll probably get some good<br>information from the message), enjoy the music and some fellowship with<br>some very nice people.<br><br>And perhaps God may soften your heart.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
