<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Now that Trump is attempting to override the 14th Amendment with an<br>executive order, will the 22nd be next?**<br><br>Question begins with a false premise.<br><br>No one is overriding any Amendments.<br><br>If Trump does anything (which is questionable), he will issue an<br>Executive Order which defines how to interpret the 14th Amendment, since<br>the Congress nor the Courts have ever ruled on how that Amendment<br>applies to illegal aliens. The Court has ruled how it applies to<br>citizens, to African Americans, to Native Americans, and to lawful<br>permanent residents (LPRs, or Green Card holders). But the court has<br>never ruled on how the 14th Amendment applies to illegal aliens.<br><br>We have been following an assumption for the last 30--40 years or so.<br><br>The President can issue an Executive Order which clarifies how Executive<br>Branch departments (including the USCIS) interprets the 14th Amendment.<br>He can dictate that all Executive Departments interpret the 14th<br>Amendment to not apply to illegal aliens.<br><br>What will happen after that:<br><br>- Someone will immediately request an injunction (my money is on the 9th<br>  Circus to issue that) halting the execution of that Executive Order,<br>  claiming that it violates the 14th Amendment.<br>- The injunction will be appealed to the SCOTUS to decide how the 14th<br>  Amendment should be interpreted when it comes to illegal aliens.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
