<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do local police have the means to spy on text messages?<br><br>First of all, no one can "spy" on text messages. SMS is highly<br>regulated, far more so than messages within an app. SMS is regulated<br>just like phone calls: you need a warrant to get them.<br><br>In order to "spy" on text messages, the police must go to the wireless<br>carrier, who can provide copies of SMS messages. The police can only do<br>this with a warrant. There is no technology that allows you to "spy" on<br>a text message. SMS does not work that way; it's not like "tapping an<br>analog phone line" and listening in.<br><br>What *can* happen is that someone can install spyware on your phone. One<br>of the most well-known of these apps is called mSpy. It can allow<br>remote access to the GPS location, SMS messages, and communications<br>through nearly any other communications app (i.e. WhatsApp, SnapChat,<br>etc). But this involves physical access to your phone and someone<br>installing an app. It can't be done remotely. Additionally, to track<br>anything beyond phone calls and SMS, the phone itself must be rooted<br>(Android) or jailbroken (iOS).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
