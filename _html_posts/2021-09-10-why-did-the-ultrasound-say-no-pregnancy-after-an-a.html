It may take some time before those pregnancy hormones return<br>to pre-pregnancy levels in the blood after the fetus has been removed.<br>So it is still possible that you can still pop positive on a pregnancy<br>test soon after an abortion.<br><br>In fact, It can take anywhere from 16 days up to 2 months for hCG<br>levels in the body to fall below the levels detected by a pregnancy<br>test.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why did the ultrasound say no pregnancy after an abortion while the<br>pregnancy test shows positive?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
