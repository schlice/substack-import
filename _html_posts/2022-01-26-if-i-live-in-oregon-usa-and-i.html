<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Marijuana is still a Schedule I drug, which still means that at a<br>Federal level, it is completely illegal. There are no exceptions.<br>However, some states have *decriminalized* its use, either for medical<br>or recreational use, which simply means the *state* will not pursue<br>charges against you.<br><br>How your employer treats its use is entirely up to them. Whether or not<br>they recognize your state medical exemption is, again, up to them.<br>You will have to check with USPS to see how they treat state medical<br>exemptions.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If I live in Oregon, USA and I'm a federal employee (mail carrier) can I<br>legally use medical marijuana to treat my MS?<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice. This answer is for GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.<br>Seek the advice of a licensed attorney in the appropriate jurisdiction<br>before taking any action that may affect your rights. If you believe you<br>have a claim against someone, consult an attorney immediately, otherwise<br>there is a risk that the time allotted to bring your claim may expire.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to legal questions are intended<br>third-party beneficiaries with certain rights under Quora's* [[*Terms of<br>Service*](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
