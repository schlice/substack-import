<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [My doctor can take my blood because I know that HIPAA and<br>doctor-patient confidentiality means that he can\'t use it in any other<br>way other than to benefit my health. And he can\'t tell anyone about<br>what he finds; what I disclose is up to me, not my doctor.\<br>\<br>I don\'t trust my insurance company as far as I can throw them. If they<br>find a loophole in HIPAA, they will use it to benefit their bottom line.<br>I have no doubt of that. Obamacare actually makes it harder for<br>insurance companies to make money, so I can only see this getting worse,<br>not better. I can\'t see a release statement being so air-tight that<br>they can only use your blood to determine if you are a smoker and<br>nothing else.\<br>\<br>I\'d be wary of this, for sure.\<br>\<br>You are part of a \"risk pool\" where the risk of you contracting a<br>certain disease and causing an increase in what they pay out is spread<br>across an entire pool of people. Granted, they are doing everything they<br>can to minimize risk, but they can\'t deny you coverage. They can only<br>pass the costs on to you. And especially with the government now<br>increasing taxes on insurance companies instead of you, insurance<br>companies are going to do everything and anything to satisfy that bottom<br>line. They are going to be looking for things that they can use to<br>charge you more. Having your blood gives them a palette, a smorgasbord<br>of things they can use to charge you more.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
