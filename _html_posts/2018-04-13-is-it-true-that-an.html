<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it true that an \"analysis of data from 1988 to 1997 showed that<br>states with \'high\' gun ownership had three times the rate of homicide<br>than states with few guns?\"**<br><br>It may be true, in exactly the same way that the number of people who<br>drowned in a pool in a given year shows a correlation to the number of<br>films in which Nicolas Cage appeared in during that year.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-a8225c8ef515efe9768d6143f54b92f0){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-a8225c8ef515efe9768d6143f54b92f0"<br>master_w="2080" master_h="820"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(Chart courtesy* [[*Tyler<br>Vigen*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=50be2c&url=http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="tylervigen.com"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br>So clearly, we must stop Nicolas Cage from appearing in movies so that<br>people will stop drowning in pools. Right?<br><br>Clearly, that's not right. But why not?<br><br>Because correlation does not equal causation.
