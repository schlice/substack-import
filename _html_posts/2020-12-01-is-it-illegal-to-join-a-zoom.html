It's not even illegal to join a<br>Zoom to which you were not invited.<br><br>It may violate Zoom's rules, and at worst you may be banned from using<br>Zoom, but it's not illegal.<br><br>(EDIT) Forgot the international aspect.<br><br>Zoom is a US company, with servers located in the US. Due to regulatory<br>restrictions, persons in the following countries cannot connect to Zoom<br>sessions:<br><br>Cuba, Iran, Syria, North Korea, and Ukraine (Crimea region).<br><br>For more information about this, you can refer to the [[US government's<br>list of sanctioned<br>countries.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f9faa5&url=https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/programs/pages/programs.aspx){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="treasury.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
