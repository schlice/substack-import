<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My childs schools is part of a housing development and the developers<br>have placed restrictions on the parking. The parking attendants are a<br>private company who sneak up on you at school times and dont ask you to<br>move. Is this against the law?**<br><br>To answer your specific question, yes this is legal.<br><br>But what can you do about it?<br><br>Start by putting pressure on the school. Use parent groups like PTA or<br>school accountability committees (if your school has them). If not, make<br>an appointment with the principal and express your concerns over the<br>parking situation. Make them sit down with the developers to come up<br>with some alternatives for parking around the school. Start a drive<br>among parents at the school. Walk around during peak times and talk to<br>parents in their cars to drum up support.<br><br>If that doesn't work, go over their heads. Go to the school board for<br>the district, go to the state department of education.<br><br>If that doesn't work, go to your local legislators. Go to your mayor's<br>office, your city council, or whichever is the closest form of local<br>government you can reach, and then go up that chain.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
