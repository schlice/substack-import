<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with everything, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>If you are 18 or older, you absolutely can contact the website claiming<br>to be the person in the picture and stating you do not want to be found.<br>The website is under no obligation to remove your picture based on your<br>word alone. They may go back to the poster and tell them that you<br>contacted them and said you don't want to be found, and ask them to<br>take the photo down. But they are under no obligation to do so. As<br>[User-11418373085839729890(https://www.quora.com/profile/User-11418373085839729890)]{.qlink_container}<br>said, if you took the picture, it's your property and can only be used<br>with your permission, and you can cite copyright law (DMCA) requesting<br>the photo be taken down.<br><br>If you are under 18, and you haven't been legally emancipated, your<br>parents or legal guardians are still legally responsible for you. They<br>can make decisions on your behalf. If you have left home without being<br>emancipated and you are simply on your own, your parents/guardians still<br>have legal responsibility for you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
