<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Laws regarding apartment rentals and tenancy vary wildly between states,<br>so you'll have to check your state's laws on who is considered to be a<br>tenant and after how long.<br><br>So you said he is your "ex." It makes a difference whether he is your<br>"ex-husband" or your "ex-boyfriend." Usually, a tenant is someone who is<br>on the lease, or who is related to you. In general, a tenant cannot<br>allow anyone to stay in the apartment *unless they are on the lease, or<br>are immediate family or transient family or friends.*<br><br>If it's an "ex-boyfriend," he's *probably* not considered a tenant. But<br>if he has stayed there for more than two weeks out of any six-month<br>period, most states consider him a tenant.<br><br>The reason why I am asking if he is a tenant is that if he is, he gets<br>tenant's rights, and needs to be formally evicted before he can be<br>removed from the apartment.<br><br>What's more, if you ever accepted rent payments from him, you may have<br>inadvertently created a landlord/tenant agreement with him, making him<br>automatically a tenant and giving him tenant's rights.<br><br>If he is not a tenant but a guest, he can be removed at any time. You<br>can call the sheriff to have them assist with his removal. You are under<br>no obligation to keep his stuff in your apartment; you can throw it<br>outside of your door and it would be up to him to figure out how to get<br>that stuff somewhere.<br><br>But usually, this all works out better if you are reasonable,<br>considering that you are at the complete legal advantage here. Give him<br>a timeframe to get out. Give him 30 days (or 60 days if you're feeling<br>generous) to find a new place to live and get his stuff out. If he isn't<br>out by the date you've given him, and he simply refuses to leave,<br>contact the sheriff's office to assist you with removing him physically,<br>and then get some friends together to move his stuff outside.<br><br>If he is a tenant, you will have to go through a more formal eviction<br>process to get him out, and it will require the court's assistance. In<br>that case, you'd probably be best served by engaging a real estate<br>attorney in your area who specializes in apartments and rental law.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How do I go about evicting my ex? He is not on the lease, but has no<br>car, so he has effectively trapped himself here because all his crap is<br>here. What should I do about his stuff. I cannot afford to pay for a<br>moving truck or rental. HE HAS TO GO.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
