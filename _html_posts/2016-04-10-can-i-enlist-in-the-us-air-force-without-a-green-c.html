<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: Talk to an Air Force recruiter near you.<br><br>Longer answer: Yes, you are correct, the Air Force does make exceptions<br>for persons like yourself who are on a path to citizenship or permanent<br>residence in the United States. Because you are married to an American,<br>you are on a path to citizenship. Depending on the needs of the Air<br>Force, your language skills may make up the difference. Go down to your<br>local recruiting office and talk to the good folks working there. They<br>will be happy to guide you through the process.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
