If<br>you are both interested, you'll probably go deeper in your discussions,<br>but for the time being, you're keepin' it simple.<br><br>It's marketing. You need a simple message to set the hook. Religious<br>people are notoriously bad about marketing, so this is foreign to us.<br>That's why it seems so odd.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
