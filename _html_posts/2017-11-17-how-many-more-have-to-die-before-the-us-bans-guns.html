<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is:<br><br>*There are no solutions. There are only trade-offs.*<br><br>And the undeniable truth, the truth which must be accepted, is that<br>there are always outliers. People will always die from some cause. We<br>need to do the trade-off math and determine if the benefit is worth the<br>deaths.<br><br>In the United States, the top 15 causes of death in 2014 were:<br><br>1\. Diseases of heart (heart disease)\<br>2. Malignant neoplasms (cancer)\<br>3. Chronic lower respiratory diseases\<br>4. Accidents (unintentional injuries)\<br>5. Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke)\<br>6. Alzheimer's disease\<br>7. Diabetes mellitus (diabetes)\<br>8. Influenza and pneumonia\<br>9. Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis (kidney disease)\<br>10. Intentional self-harm (suicide)\<br>11. Septicemia\<br>12. Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis\<br>13. Essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease<br>(hypertension)\<br>14. Parkinson's disease\<br>15. Pneumonitis due to solids and liquids\[1\](#dZMKW){#cite-dZMKW<br>.citation_link}<br><br>The benefit of cars is obviously so great, that we don't mind that<br>accidents rank #4 on this list. It's a trade-off. So far, the math shows<br>us that the benefit of retaining ownership of guns is worth the<br>classroom full of dead kids in Sandy Hook, CT. And if *that* didn't<br>get rid of guns, I don't think any one incident will do it.<br><br>Murder, with or without a gun, doesn't even make the top 15. Some of the<br>#4 accidents and about half of the #10 intentional self-harm involved a<br>gun. So you might be able to scratch the surface of accidents and push<br>suicidal people to other methods, but you won't contribute to stopping<br>any of these in a meaningful way.<br><br>It's probably also telling that none of these causes of death focus on<br>the tool used. We're not even collecting statistics about it without<br>having to look specifically into each one of these causes of death.<br><br>Why, then, are we struggling so hard to control guns when there are ALL<br>OF THESE CAUSES OF DEATH that we could spend our energy focusing on<br>instead of focusing on the ONLY ONE WE CAN'T REGULATE AWAY? Our<br>Constitution ensures that guns are here to stay. So why do we waste the<br>time?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-dZMKW){.citation_index}<br>[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nv\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=722229&url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr65/nvsr65_04.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cdc.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
