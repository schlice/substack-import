<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>To sum up what [[Jack<br>Hallows](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jack-Hallows)]{.qlink_container}<br>said, be a good witness. Learn how to see and remember details so<br>that you can cogently repeat them later. You will have to answer the<br>who/what/when/where/why/how questions when the police ask you.<br><br>You might even consider setting up cameras on your house that look out<br>on to the front of your property and on to your street. The more<br>evidence you can give the police, the better chances they will have at<br>reducing crime.<br><br>But in short, being a good witness is literally the best thing you can<br>do.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
