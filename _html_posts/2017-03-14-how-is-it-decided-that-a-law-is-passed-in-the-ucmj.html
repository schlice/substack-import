<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Beginning in 1775, the then-Continental Congress passed 69 Articles of<br>War to govern the conduct of the Continental Army. Once the Constitution<br>was fully ratified in 1788, Article I, Section 8 gave Congress the<br>authority to "...make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the<br>land and naval forces.\" In April of 1806, Congress authorized 101<br>Articles of War, which remained the rules for the conduct of the US<br>military for more than 100 years.<br><br>The first version of the UCMJ was passed by Congress in 1950, and signed<br>into law by President Harry S. Truman. It went into effect in 1951, and<br>has remained largely unchanged since then. Some changes were made as<br>part of the National Defense Authorization Acts of 2006 and 2007, and<br>some other changes were made by Executive Order of the President.<br><br>So to answer your question, if a new law is proposed to be added to the<br>UCMJ, the military will bring the proposed changes to Congress through<br>the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Congress will likely add it as part of the<br>National Defense Authorization Act, which will then be signed into law<br>by the President. There will be a built-in delay before the new<br>provisions go into effect in order to educate everyone on them before<br>they become law, and military members will take UCMJ refresher and<br>update training to learn the new provisions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
