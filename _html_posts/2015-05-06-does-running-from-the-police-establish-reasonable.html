<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [For the most part, [[Jonathan<br>Books](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jonathan-Books)]{.qlink_container}<br>is correct. Running from the police alone is not probable cause. If you<br>are allowed to walk away from the police, who cares how fast you walk?\<br>\<br>However, in some \"high crime\" jurisdictions, some special waivers have<br>been enacted to help combat that crime which essentially say that<br>running from the police provides \"reasonable suspicion,\" which is a<br>lower level of proof required than probable cause, to stop said runner.<br>If the person was present in a high crime area, exhibiting all the<br>behavior of someone conducting criminal activity, and then they run when<br>the police arrive, that creates reasonable suspicion to stop that<br>person. A \"stop-and-frisk\" revealing evidence of the criminal activity<br>that the person is suspected of doing would then provide the needed<br>probable cause for arrest.\<br>\<br>Jonathan is not correct in saying that the person would then be required<br>to stop when the police yell stop because they were running in the first<br>place. Remember, if it\'s not illegal to run from the police, then if<br>they tell you to stop after you already started running, they have no<br>authority to do so (i.e. tell you to stop). If they didn\'t have the<br>authority to detain you, they certainly don\'t have the authority to<br>tell you to stop and wait for them (which is a form of detainment). In<br>that case, as long as they say the magic words \"Stop, Police!\", then<br>they can stop anyone from running, anytime, anywhere, perfectly legally.<br>Therefore, that is not necessarily true. It would add an aggravating<br>factor if the police already had a reasonable suspicion, but the police<br>saying the magic words isn\'t enough to create reasonable suspicion.\<br>\<br>(EDIT) I want to be clear about something. The fact that an officer may<br>not have the authority to tell you to stop ***is not an invitation to<br>continue to run, citing the officer\'s lack of authority as your<br>excuse!*** If an officer tells you to stop, STOP! The lack of authority<br>I mentioned is ONLY useful to your lawyer, who will use that information<br>to get all your charges thrown out, along with potentially providing<br>grounds for false arrest charges against the department.\<br>\<br>So to reiterate what I just said, if an officer tells you to stop, you<br>MUST stop. Let your lawyer determine if the officer had the authority to<br>do what he did. That\'s what we pay our lawyers for.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
