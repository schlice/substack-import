<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sprinters and distance runners develop notoriously different muscle<br>fibers.<br><br>People have two different types of skeletal muscle fibers: fast twitch<br>and slow twitch. Fast twitch muscle fibers are quicker, more explosive,<br>but tire out faster. Slow twitch muscle fibers are, well, slower, but<br>are better for longer distance workouts.<br><br>During aerobic exercise, slow twitch muscle fibers are the first to<br>engage. When they tire out, fast twitch muscles take over.<br><br>Therefore, the only way to ensure that fast twitch muscle fibers are<br>actively being used during your workouts is to work to temporary<br>fatigue. That will ensure that your slow-twitch muscles have been spent<br>and your fast twitch muscle fibers are fully engaged.<br><br>So to answer your question: No, running cross country won't decrease<br>your explosiveness, nor will it decrease your sprints. But it won't do<br>anything to *help* either. If you're only using your slow twitch<br>muscles, you're doing nothing to engage your fast twitch muscles. Over<br>time, as your fast twitch muscle fibers remain undeveloped, they will<br>become harder and harder to improve, as your slow twitch muscles will<br>fatigue less, meaning even less engagement of fast twitch muscle fibers.<br><br>So it's best to keep your workouts varied, even if you're running cross<br>country. If you're running five days a week, at least two of your days<br>should be track days. You should be doing ladders or intervals or other<br>similar sprint exercises to work to fatigue to engage those slow twitch<br>muscles. You can't do distance every day. That won't help you.<br><br>*Full disclosure: I was a distance runner. I have the low blood pressure<br>and the slow twitch muscles which won't grow mass to prove it. And by<br>the way, you lose fast twitch muscle much faster than slow twitch muscle<br>as you age, so it becomes incrementally harder as you get older to build<br>muscle mass.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
