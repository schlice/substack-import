<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How easy is your polling place to find, obtain parking at, and get in<br>and out of?**<br><br>My polling place is ridiculously easy to find. I don't need parking, and<br>I can vote in my pajamas.<br><br>Yes, I'm being facetious. Colorado has all mail-in ballot voting.<br><br>You can vote in person if you didn't receive your ballot, or if there is<br>something else that prevents you from using your mail-in ballot, but if<br>you received a ballot in the mail, that's how you vote.<br><br>If you distrust the mail system (or your postal carriers), you can<br>hand-carry your ballot down to either one of our local DMV offices<br>(those are County offices as well), or to the County Clerk's office.<br>This is what we do. There is positive hand-off, we ensure that our<br>ballots get dropped off, and we get our stickers. Call me old-fashioned,<br>but I like my sticker.<br><br>The all mail-in system also means that my family (I have four voting-age<br>people living in my house now) can sit down and debate the ballot<br>measures. Interestingly, Colorado had the most ballot measures of any<br>state on the 2016 mid-terms. We literally had a two-page ballot this<br>year (three sides).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
