<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Could be for any number of reasons. They may have received<br>an informational message that you\'re a potential runner (you like to<br>drive off when the officers get out of their car). They may want to<br>separate you from the people in your vehicle if they suspect that you,<br>or one of your passengers, may be dangerous. Or maybe they just want to<br>separate you from your party so they can have a more \"candid\"<br>conversation with you than they would do in front of your passengers.\<br>\<br>Also, location of the stop will influence whether or not you are asked<br>to get out. It\'s generally safer to keep you in your car if you were<br>stopped on the side of a busy road. There\'s less chance of you being<br>injured if you stay in your car than if you get out.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
