<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is an example of a rhetorical question. It contains its own answer.<br>It's like the joke, "what happens when you throw a white rock into the<br>Red Sea?" "It gets wet."<br><br>So if abortions were free, and child support was repealed, would we see<br>a decrease in out of wedlock births?<br><br>YES! Of course we would! Because instead of those children being born,<br>they'd all be *killed!*<br><br>Of course, abortions are never free. Those doctors and hospitals and<br>Planned Parenthood all have to be paid by someone. It's just that the<br>point of payment moves from the patient at the time of service to the<br>patient simply paying taxes and those taxes paying for everyone's<br>services.<br><br>I'm curious though. Do you believe that a decrease in "out of wedlock<br>births" justifies an increase in dead babies? Maybe it does to you. For<br>me, that's not necessarily a moral calculation that I'm comfortable<br>making. How many dead babies is worth a decrease in out of wedlock<br>births? 10,000? 100,000? And why stop at *birth*? I mean, babies still<br>have to be cared for and fed for several years because they can't<br>survive on their own. They're actually *more* of a burden after they're<br>born than before. So why limit the killing to birth? Why not make it the<br>first year or two? Just take your baby to a government-funded<br>extermination center for disposal. I mean, tax dollars are unlimited, so<br>let's make a whole new government-run industry just destroying unwanted<br>babies. Easy peesey, right?<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If abortions were free and child support was repealed, would we see a<br>decrease in out of wedlock births?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
