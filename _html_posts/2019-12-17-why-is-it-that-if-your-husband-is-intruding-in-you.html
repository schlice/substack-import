Unless he's actually doing something illegal, like trying to rape<br>you, then he's allowed to be in your bed. You can ask him to go sleep<br>somewhere else, but it's not illegal for him to sleep in the same bed as<br>you, since you are married and you share a house.<br><br>Federal law says that mail can only be opened by the addressee unless<br>prior permission was granted.<br><br>So why? Because one is illegal and the other isn't.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
