<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In the normal interaction between citizens and police, are citizens<br>smart to be suspicious of law enforcement? To worry that a police<br>officer will (perhaps not intentionally) twist facts to make a case?**<br><br>In the normal interactions between any two people (regardless of their<br>occupation), it is always wise to be aware of their motives.<br><br>So, to that end: what motivates the officer? Is he just trying to make a<br>case against "any warm body he can find" and you just happen to be<br>within reach? Or is he objectively trying to find the truth?<br><br>Regardless, the only way to protect yourself is to ***understand your<br>rights***.<br><br>- In conversations with police, you are only required to give your real<br>  name. You're not required to talk to the police. Understand that this<br>  makes their job that much more difficult, because the police actually<br>  need to talk to people without arresting them in order to do their<br>  jobs and actually find the bad guys. Nevertheless, if you are to<br>  protect your rights, you are under no obligation to talk to the police<br>  at all. If you can help them by telling them what you saw or what you<br>  heard, it's probably best to do that. But beyond that, you should<br>  probably not talk to them. If they want to come in to your home, you<br>  should probably not do that. It's best to step outside rather than<br>  letting them step in. Put on a warm coat if it's cold; don't take them<br>  up on their offer to go someplace warmer. If it's too cold for them,<br>  they should get a desk job.<br>- But let's say that you encounter one of these unscrupulous officers<br>  who simply wants to make a case against any warm body he can find<br>  regardless of the presence of actual facts (these are like unicorns:<br>  if you ever find one, get a selfie with him), and you're arrested.<br>  *SAY NOTHING UNTIL YOU GET A LAWYER.* When they question you, they<br>  will tell you that you have the right to remain silent until you've<br>  had the chance to talk to a lawyer. *Exercise this right!* Do not<br>  speak to the police without an attorney helping you! The police are<br>  not there to be your friend. They're not there to get you terrible<br>  coffee. They're there to send you to jail for the crime they are<br>  accusing you of committing. You should probably not assist them in<br>  that endeavor.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
