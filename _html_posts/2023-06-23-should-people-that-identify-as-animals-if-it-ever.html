How people self-identify is<br>not how we determine who gets fundamental human rights.<br><br>People who self-identify as something which they are physically not are<br>still physically human. You remain a physical human, regardless of how<br>you self-identify.<br><br>Therefore, humans always retain fundamental human rights, because they<br>are always physically human, regardless of how they self-identify.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
