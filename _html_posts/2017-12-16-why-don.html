<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why don\'t people acknowledge that the real constitutional crisis<br>happened when Loretta Lynch did not have Trump arrested for saying,<br>\"Russia if you\'re listening I hope you find the 30,000 emails\"? Why<br>hasn\'t he been arrested for that since?**<br><br>Not only do we have the 1st Amendment in the United States, but<br>"political speech" is especially well-protected.<br><br>Also, Trump wasn't the president at the time he said that. He was a<br>private citizen. It would be like me saying it at a rally. I'm just Joe<br>Nobody, which at the time he was as well. As people have been wont to<br>say lately, private citizens can't negotiate with foreign governments;<br>it's illegal. Plus, you have no power to effect any change.<br><br>Thankfully, such charges would be based on the "reasonable man" test.<br>Would a reasonable man consider Trump's statement as "negotiating with<br>foreign governments," "negotiating a treaty," or "a harmless joke?"<br>Thankfully, the reasonable man would look at the context and see<br>that Trump was simply trying to make a joke. At the time, the Democrats<br>were trying to point the finger at Russia regarding hacking, so Trump<br>was playing on that, basically saying that if Russia was so good at<br>hacking, maybe they could find Hillary's "missing" emails.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
