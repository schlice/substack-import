<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Palisade cell adaptations are the specific adaptations in a palisade<br>cell to allow it to better conduct photosynthesis. From<br>[Wikibooks(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f8a19b&url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A-level_Biology/Central_Concepts/Photosynthesis%23Palisade_Cells){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikibooks.org"}]{.qlink_container}, the specific adaptations<br>are:<br><br>> - Large Vacuole - Restricts chloroplasts to a layer near the outside<br>>   of the cell where they can be reached by light more easily.<br>> - Cylindrical Arrangement - They are arranged at right angles to the<br>>   upper epidermis, reducing the number of light-absorbing cross walls<br>>   preventing light from reaching the chloroplasts. This also allows<br>>   long-narrow air spaces between them, providing a large surface area<br>>   for gaseous exchange.<br>> - Movement of chloroplasts - Proteins can move the chloroplasts within<br>>   cells to absorb maximum light.<br>> - Thin cell walls - to allow gases to more easily diffuse through<br>>   them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
