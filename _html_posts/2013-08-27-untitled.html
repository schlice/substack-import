<br/><br/>Answer Comment<br/><br/><br/>Content: [My original answer covered that. It is not the child that<br/>validates the marriage. And I think that all of us would consider<br/>fertility tests before marriage far too much government intrusion. So<br/>the state does the next best thing: it offers marriage to the<br/>combination of human beings which can mate, and thus procreate; ability<br/>to actually do so is secondary.\<br/>\<br/>Let me turn it around: what if an otherwise healthy married couple chose<br/>not to have kids? Should their license be revoked? I don\'t think<br/>so.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Answer:<br/>https://www.quora.com/Why-are-gay-people-asking-for-the-right-to-marry-If-it-is-legal-stuff-they-are-asking-for-cant-they-go-to-some-separate-setup-for-partners/answer/Bill-Stein<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
