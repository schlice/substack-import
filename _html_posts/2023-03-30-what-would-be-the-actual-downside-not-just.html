<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Literally nothing.*<br><br>Manufacturers will build a new style of semi automatic rifle that<br>doesn't have the prohibited features of the AR pattern rifle (since<br>that's all you'd be banning is prohibited cosmetic design, not<br>functionality). Since the AR platform is so versatile, there are<br>bzillions of attachments and add-ons to extend the functionality of this<br>versatile platform, so other manufacturers will create adapter kits<br>which will allow you to transition your previous accoutrements to the<br>new rifle platform.<br><br>And violent crime still won't care, because crime isn't caused by a<br>rifle. Mass shootings will not decrease. Shooters will pivot to a new<br>platform. Don't forget, the Nashville shooter had a Kel-Tec SUB2000<br>pistol along with a S&W M&P SHIELD 9mm pistol and a rifle manufactured<br>by Lead Star called the Grunt, and it shoots .300 Blackout. It is an<br>AR-pattern rifle, but again, that's just because it is the most popular<br>and most versatile medium-range rifle pattern out there. So one out of<br>three guns would be banned (and replaced by something else anyway) and<br>nothing would change.<br><br>This incessant focus on the AR pattern rifle because it is the most<br>popular is silly.<br><br>> Actual \"assault weapons\" with full auto features are already banned.<br><br>No they're not. You need extra background checks, a bunch of extra<br>steps, and *a whole helluva lot more money* to get them, but they're not<br>banned. You can't possess them in a handful of states, but everywhere<br>else you can have one if you can pass the background checks, jump<br>through the government hoops, and cough up the artificially inflated<br>prices for them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
