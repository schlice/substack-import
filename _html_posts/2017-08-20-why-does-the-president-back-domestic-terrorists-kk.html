<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's be absolutely clear.<br><br>The president backs the rights of *all* Americans to exercise their<br>Constitutional rights. KKK, BLM, white supremacists, Antifa, whoever.<br>They all have a Constitutional right to express their opinions, however<br>flawed they may be. Of course, the media heard this and went completely<br>apoplectic, which is only because they failed history, or slept through<br>it. I think that's a pre-requisite to becoming a journalist these days.<br><br>That said, the president does not support their ideas. He said so<br>vociferously, and repeatedly, in the days following the Charlottesville<br>incident.<br><br>You can actually support a group's right to speak, while simultaneously<br>denouncing the content of their speech.<br><br>The media would do well to learn that lesson. Ah, but alas, that lesson<br>doesn't make money. And since the media is primarily there to make<br>money, doing so will generally tend to skew the news they present.<br><br>I think I've typed Evenlyn Beatrice Hall's quote so many times over the<br>last few weeks that it's going to get burned into my screen, but here it<br>is again. She was actually discussing Voltaire and the kind of person he<br>was, which is why this quote is sometimes incorrectly attributed to<br>Voltaire. Interestingly, this *used* to be the position of the Democrats<br>and liberals (i.e. Kennedy liberals), but nowadays with Progressives<br>taking over the Democrat party, it is increasingly becoming untrue.<br>Nevertheless, Hall's quote, with which I and the President fully concur:<br><br>> I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your<br>> right to say it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
