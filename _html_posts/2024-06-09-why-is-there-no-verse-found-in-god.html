<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Have you ever baked a cake?<br><br>Usually, the timer goes off, and the cake *appears to be done*. But you<br>stick a toothpick in it, or a fork, to see if it is done on the inside<br>(as an aside, that phrase, "stick a fork in it, it's done" came from<br>this practice).<br><br>Or, have you ever grilled a steak?<br><br>It can look done on the outside, but depending on what temperature it<br>was when it started cooking, it is only a meat thermometer (or feeling<br>it for tenderness) which can tell if the steak is done on the inside.<br><br>In other words, something may appear to be done on the outside, when it<br>still needs time to "cook" on the inside.<br><br>\<br><br>The same holds true of believers.<br><br>Some people say they are Christians. They go to church regularly. They<br>read the Bible. They sing the songs. They greet people warmly. *But<br>inside, they have never truly accepted Christ as their Savior.*<br><br>Ultimately, they are "fake Christians."<br><br>Scripture indeed talks about those who appear to be good Christians, but<br>later fall away from their faith. In the parable of the sower and the<br>seed, some of the seed sprung up quickly, only to wither away or be<br>choked out by weeds.<br><br>> As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the<br>> word and immediately receives it with joy, yet he has no root in<br>> himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution<br>> arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away. As for what<br>> was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the<br>> cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and<br>> it proves unfruitful --- Matthew 13:20--22 ESV<br><br>For some "fake Christians," the heart is still a heart of stone, so the<br>Word lands and the people sing and worship, but as soon as their life<br>circumstances change, they fall away from the faith, because that Word<br>had not taken root. The seed which was choked out is the "fake<br>Christian" who hears the Word (the seed is planted), but the "cares of<br>the world and the deceitfulness of riches" cause them to not accept what<br>they hear. But the seed sown on good soil (when the heart is ready)<br>brings forth fruit for harvest.<br><br>\<br><br>Scripture also tells about what happens to a person when they truly<br>accept Christ into their lives.<br><br>> And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within<br>> you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you<br>> a heart of flesh. --- Ezekiel 36:26 ESV<br><br>This new heart is *incapable of* *not* *loving God.*<br><br>In other words, a true believer can ***never not love God. A true<br>believer cannot "lose his faith."***<br><br>And remember, we didn't do this to ourselves. God called the believer<br>out of death and into life:<br><br>> And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked,<br>> following the course of this world, following the prince of the power<br>> of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of<br>> disobedience---among whom we all once lived in the passions of our<br>> flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by<br>> nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. But God, being<br>> rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even<br>> when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with<br>> Christ---by grace you have been saved --- Ephesians 2:1--5 ESV<br><br>One of the top ten great phrases of the Bible is right there: **But<br>God. We were dead** in our sin. Can a dead man save himself? No!<br>Only God can save him. We were dead, but God saved us. Even when we<br>were dead in our sin, God made us alive. And it is God's grace which did<br>that.<br><br>God removes that dead heart of stone through His grace, and replaces it<br>with a heart of flesh. He does this when we truly accept Him; we are<br>regenerated (born again).<br><br>> Jesus answered him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born<br>> again he cannot see the kingdom of God." Nicodemus said to him, "How<br>> can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his<br>> mother\'s womb and be born?" Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to<br>> you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the<br>> kingdom of God." --- John 3:3--5 ESV<br><br>\<br><br>So can someone be a "Christian" and not believe? Yes, happens all the<br>time. This is why we are sometimes confused when someone we thought was<br>a strong Christian falls away from the faith. They may have *appeared*<br>"cooked" on the outside, but they were still "raw" in the middle.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
