<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Your link points out what Everytown believes are Judge Barrett's<br>"extreme and dangerous" beliefs about the 2nd Amendment:<br><br>- **Judge Barrett reiterating her belief that people convicted of<br>  felonies should not be barred from owning guns:** "What I did was<br>  apply Heller's methodology...and I concluded that based on that<br>  history one couldn't take the right away simply because one was a<br>  felon."<br><br>As always, the devil is in the details. Barrett believes (as most do)<br>that the commission of any crime categorized as a felony should not<br>necessarily result in the taking of a Constitutional right. Should you<br>lose a Constitutional right if you commit credit card fraud? That's a<br>felony. Similarly, there are plenty of non-violent white-collar crimes<br>for which removal of a Constitutional right seems improper, and not in<br>keeping with the 8th Amendment. In other words, the punishment should<br>fit the crime. In order to overcome the high bar to relieve someone of a<br>Constitutional right, the crime must be commensurate with that decision.<br>She believes (as most conservative Constitutionalists do) that removal<br>of a Constitutional right to firearms requires the conviction of a<br>violent felony. Respect for the Constitution requires respect for<br>all of its provisions, even the ones you don't like, Everytown.<br><br>- **Judge Barrett refusing to distance herself from her dangerous and<br>  extreme position in Kanter v. Barr:** "What I can say is that my<br>  opinion \in\ Kanter shows my judicial philosophy. I spend a lot of<br>  time looking at the history of the Second Amendment and Supreme Court<br>  cases. The way in which I would approach the review of gun regulations<br>  is in the same way. To look very carefully at the text, to look at<br>  what the original meaning was. I promise I would come to that with an<br>  open mind, applying the law as I can best determine it."<br><br>In this answer, Judge Barrett is doing what she has done throughout<br>these hearings: reiterate that Congress sets policy and crafts<br>legislation, not the court. The court simply checks to see that laws do<br>or do not comport with the Constitution as it was written and understood<br>at the time. It's just sad that Democrats slam her because she won't set<br>policy. But they want the court to set policy because they can't get the<br>votes to pass their policy as they see fit.<br><br>And if Congress ever has a law overruled as unconstitutional, they are,<br>of course, free to re-write the law so that it is Constitutional. But<br>that would involve, you know, Congress *doing their job.*<br><br>These points show that Judge Barrett will apply the Constitution as it<br>was written, after a thorough review of the text, and a determination of<br>the text's original meaning.<br><br>So absolutely, this is exactly what I want in a Supreme Court Justice.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
