<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yet another reason why the 17th Amendment was so terrible.<br><br>The Senate was originally designed to represent the interests of the<br>states, while the House was designed to represent the interests of the<br>people. Those two interests are not always aligned.<br><br>Senators were originally appointed by the various state legislatures to<br>serve; they were not directly elected. Because all states are equally<br>sovereign, all states get two Senators, regardless of the size of the<br>state or its population. House representation is determined by both the<br>size of the state and its population.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why hasn't the Senate membership grown in proportion to the US<br>population?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
