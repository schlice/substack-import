<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Hmm, I don\'t see any particular line of reasoning as<br>offensive; if it\'s reasoned discussion, it should have no offensive<br>content in it.\<br>\<br>I don\'t take offense at your reasoning, it is what it is. I noticed<br>that I said at least once in my answer that guns were designed to kill<br>people; that\'s not accurate. Guns are designed to kill. People,<br>animals, it makes no difference. Guns are not designed to punch holes in<br>paper. That\'s how you practice punching holes in people and animals. I<br>find it illogical reasoning when people say that guns ownership is only<br>valid because people only use them to plink targets. Some guns are<br>specifically modified to be used as competition target guns. That<br>doesn\'t change the fact that it\'s a gun and is primarily designed to<br>punch holes in people and animals.\<br>\<br>We, as a gun enthusiast crowd, have to accept the fact that the primary<br>purpose of the invention of the gun was not to punch holes in paper.<br>There are far more efficient tools we can use to punch holes in paper.<br>Guns were designed to punch holes in people and<br>animals.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-reduce-unlawful-gun-violence-in-the-United-States/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
