<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it legal for a sitting U.S. President to offer a pardon in exchange<br>for illegal activity from a subordinate?**<br><br>It's illegal for anyone, including a sitting US President, to offer<br>anything of value in exchange for doing something illegal. It is an<br>incohate offense, which means \"conduct deemed criminal without<br>actual harm being done, provided that the harm that would have occurred<br>is one the law tries to prevent.\"<br><br>Solicitation is a Federal crime in which a person is offered money or<br>something else of value (a pardon) in exchange for the commission of a<br>crime, with the specific intent that the person solicited commits the<br>crime.<br><br>However, in order to meet the definition of solicitation, the action<br>requested must be an actual crime, and the person instigating the<br>solicitation must be clearly requesting the commission of a crime. For<br>example, our President was visiting the Southern border and joked with<br>Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan that he would<br>pardon him if he blocked illegal immigrants from entering the country.<br>First, whether or not doing so is an actual crime depends on the<br>circumstances, and second, it was unclear whether or not the President<br>was joking. The ICE officials checked, found out that such an action<br>would be a *prima facie* violation of the law, and the White House<br>confirmed that the President was indeed joking and that no such order<br>was given. The Department of Homeland Security stated unequivocally:<br>\"At no time has the President indicated, asked, directed or pressured<br>the Acting Secretary to do anything illegal. Nor would the Acting<br>Secretary take actions that are not in accordance with our<br>responsibility to enforce the law.\" So would this be solicitation? No,<br>there was no actual, real request to commit an actual crime.<br><br>If a President commits a crime, he would have to be impeached and<br>removed from office before he could be prosecuted. If he was impeached<br>but not removed from office, the statute of limitations would only be<br>tolled if the courts found that the President could not be indicted<br>while still President, but this would have to be tested in court (i.e.<br>the Attorney General would have to attempt to indict his own boss, which<br>would be an interesting Constitutional issue in and of itself).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
