<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>To be fair, neither of the candidates we got are the ones I wanted.<br><br>But I like Trump.<br><br>At the end of the day, Trump, better than anyone else out there, is the<br>guy who might be able to actually pull off change in Washington. He is a<br>true outsider. He has never been in politics. He has only been in<br>business (which he is continually derided for). He has, arguably, been<br>successful in business. He uses the law to the benefit of his business.<br>So if you wanted someone who is a "Washington outsider," no one else who<br>was a candidate fit the bill. Fiorina was the only other candidate who<br>was close, but Trump talks tough and pulls no punches. Fiorina never<br>came across as tough enough compared to Trump.<br><br>And he loves this country.<br><br>He was willing to leave his business so that he could be denounced,<br>derided, and ridiculed for his orangeness on a daily basis. And yet he<br>did this willingly. Because at the end of the day, he loves America and<br>what it stands for. He truly believes he can make a difference.<br><br>Apparently, enough voters in enough states agreed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
