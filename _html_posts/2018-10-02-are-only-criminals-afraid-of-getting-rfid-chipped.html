<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Are only criminals afraid of getting RFID chipped? I'm a good guy and<br>try not to knowingly commit crimes, so why should I be against being<br>chipped?**<br><br>No one should be afraid of getting a RFID chip implanted under their<br>skin. The tags that work under the skin have a very short read range,<br>typically up to about 18 inches away from the skin. This is true because<br>the chip is very small. Small chips are only able to collect a small<br>amount of radiation with which to return a signal back to a reader, and<br>therefore only work reliably at short distances. Subdermal chips are<br>easily deactivated by any anti-radiation material being placed directly<br>over them.<br><br>Granted, there are some special-use RFID readers and chips which can be<br>read at greater distances, some up to 1500 feet away, but these are<br>typically "active RFID" chips which are powered, broadcasting units.<br><br>Disney's MagicBands are an example of both types of RFID chips at work.<br>It contains both a passive, short-distance RFID chip, and an active,<br>powered XID chip. The RFID chip is a small, passive, short-distance<br>chip, and is used for personal identification. It is employed in payment<br>systems, hotel room door systems, and "Fastpass" ride access systems,<br>systems that you wouldn't want to be used over longer distances (i.e.<br>you don't want to be paying for the guy's drink in front of you). The<br>XID tag, being a locally powered "active" chip, is readable at a much<br>greater distance, and can essentially identify every person within the<br>park (a boon for the "lost child" business). It also provides<br>"value-added" features, like taking a photo or video clip of a ride<br>vehicle and automatically attaching it to the accounts of every person<br>on that ride vehicle.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
