Will it<br>instantly be removed or will it take time once it is legal for police<br>forces to change their guidelines?**<br><br>*(Please note, I am a US citizen, so this may not apply directly to<br>Canada. I'm going to comment generally; legally-speaking, Canadian law<br>and its application may be different than what I know)*<br><br>Just because something is *legal* doesn't mean an employer has to allow<br>it. For example, it's legal to consume alcohol, but an employer doesn't<br>have to let you be drunk on the job. It's legal to have sex...yeah, you<br>get the picture.<br><br>An employer can still require their employees to be drug-free, even if<br>the drug is a legal one, if job requirements dictate that someone be<br>free from drugs.<br><br>Part of the problem in law enforcement is that there are as-of-yet<br>unknown side effects to marijuana usage, such as how it affects<br>judgement and long-term memory. You can make an argument in court that<br>an officer's judgment may have been impaired due to the fact that there<br>was marijuana in his system from months before, and therefore his arrest<br>should be thrown out. And what if that officer is involved in a deadly<br>force incident? The department could face tremendous liability if the<br>officer was found to have possibly been impaired in ways in which we do<br>not yet know about.<br><br>Since the police simply cannot risk the unknown, it is quite possible<br>that the rule regarding marijuana usage remains intact.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
