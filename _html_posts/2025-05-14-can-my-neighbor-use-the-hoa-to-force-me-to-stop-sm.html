<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, what the HOA has the power to do is in your Governing<br>Documents.<br><br>Second, you may have a provision about "nuisances" somewhere in your<br>Governing Documents, usually in your Rules and Regulations document. If<br>your smoking can be considered a "nuisance odor" to your neighbors,<br>especially if you're smoking something particularly pungent (i.e.<br>cigars, marijuana, etc.), they can tell you to not smoke on your patio,<br>and they can fine you if you continue to do it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
