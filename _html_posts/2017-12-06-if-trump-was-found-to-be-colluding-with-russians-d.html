<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If Trump was found to be colluding with Russians, does that make his<br>presidency illegitimate, and would all his doings be reversed?**<br><br>In short, even if Trump was found to have *illegally paid* the<br>Russians to swing the election in his favor, it would not make his<br>presidency illegitimate, it would not automatically invalidate any<br>Executive Orders he has signed, nor would it invalidate any bills he may<br>have signed into law.<br><br>First, we have already determined that no votes were changed, and no US<br>citizens were prevented from voting. Therefore, ***we have already<br>determined that the election was legal, and the election results are<br>final***. Trump is a legitimate president, and the US presidential<br>election process was not tampered with.<br><br>In fact, there is nothing that *automatically* makes a president<br>illegitimate. **If the people voted for the president, the presidency is<br>legitimate.**<br><br>Therefore, the only thing that the Russians could have "hacked" is the<br>mind of the voter. To that end, we're talking about who is allowed to<br>purchase advertising and who is allowed to talk to US citizens about US<br>elections. And incidentally, we're also assuming that US voters are so<br>dumb that they are easily swayed by advertising.<br><br>The question, therefore, is *did Trump ask Russians to buy advertising<br>to try to sway voters to vote for him, and if he did, did he pay them to<br>do it?*<br><br>If Trump *paid* Russians using campaign money, he may be guilty of<br>violating campaign finance laws. Even this does not automatically make<br>the president illegitimate. The president's presidency is still legal<br>and legitimate.<br><br>If he did not pay Russians, but instead *asked* them to swing the<br>election in his favor (in other words, "collude" with them to try to<br>influence Americans to vote for him instead of Clinton), and they did<br>this without being paid, how is this any different from when [[Americans<br>have interfered in other foreign<br>elections](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=37fe5c&url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/10/13/the-long-history-of-the-u-s-interfering-with-elections-elsewhere/?utm_term%3D.1558ccae67ba){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="washingtonpost.com"}]{.qlink_container}?<br><br>Perhaps you believe this action is not in keeping with the office of the<br>President. Your only recourse is to impeach the President, claiming that<br>such antics constitute "conduct unbecoming of the office of President."<br>2/3 of the House must agree to impeach, and then 2/3 of the Senate must<br>agree that the impeached offense is severe enough that you need to be<br>removed from office.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
