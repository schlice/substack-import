If you are being stopped by a marked vehicle,<br>call 911 while you stop. If you are being stopped by an unmarked<br>vehicle, while you are calling 911, drive slowly along the side of the<br>road with your flashers on.<br><br>Note that in most jurisdictions, there is no lawful reason for you to<br>avoid stopping when an officer attempts to stop you, so if you failed to<br>stop for a real officer, you could potentially face consequences for<br>that failure, but the idea is that you feel unsafe, and so you simply<br>throw yourself at the mercy of the officer, and ultimately, the courts<br>if you do get a ticket for failing to stop. Any time you fail to stop,<br>for whatever reason, you must bear this in mind.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
