<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Once your attack has remitted, and you feel pretty good<br>again, you are left with a few daily niggles. For example, when my Optic<br>Neuritis was in relapse, any exposure to sunlight or fluorescent light<br>was torture. My eye would hurt any time I looked around. I would be<br>blurry in part of my field of view. When it remits, the pain,<br>blurriness, and light sensitivity go away. But when I run, I get double<br>vision. The double vision would be an everyday symptom, since it will<br>never go away. But the pain, sensitivity to light, and blurry vision are<br>only present during a relapse.\<br>\<br>It\'s a learning curve for your own body. You have to go through a<br>relapse and a remission in order to find out what your symptoms will<br>be.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
