<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Remember the old Motorola bag phones and flip phones? Those phones were<br>very simple, audio-only devices (SMS was just coming into fashion at the<br>time). This was, primarily, because of the technology they used. Those<br>original phones were *analog* radio transceiver devices. With an<br>analog signal sniffer, you could essentially eavesdrop on any phone<br>conversation if you could find the right radio frequency. Additionally,<br>the laws surrounding \"wiretapping\" had not caught up to the new<br>\"cellular telephone\" paradigm, so it was less clear whether or not<br>listening in on a cellular call, essentially being \"broadcast\" over<br>the air was illegal. For this reason, many companies insisted you use a<br>landline for sensitive communications.<br><br>Technology has, of course, progressed. All of the old analog systems<br>have been replaced with *digital* transmission systems. This allowed<br>phones to become smaller and consume less power, although tower density<br>had to increase. It also allowed phones to be voice *and* data devices.<br>If you were to try to sniff a call now, you\'d hear nothing more than<br>noise, as all transmissions between the phone and the tower are digital.<br>The digital signal runs through a DAC (digital-to-analog conversion)<br>circuit so that you can hear it. This has increased security on cellular<br>calls, as the technology to decrypt an audio signal is not quite as<br>ubiquitous as the old system. Also, the law caught up with cell phones,<br>essentially expanding existing wiretapping laws to encompass cellular<br>conversations as well.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
