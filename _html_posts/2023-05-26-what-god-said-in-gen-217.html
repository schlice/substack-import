<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, and even so, I think the "who planted the tree" question is a red<br>herring. There was a reason that God said to not eat from the Tree of<br>the Knowledge of Good and Evil:<br><br>***In order for man to truly have free will, there would have to be a<br>compelling alternative to following God's rules.***<br><br>In other words, if you are in an environment in which you can do no<br>wrong, then you have no *choice* but to do good.<br><br>*But*, you're probably asking, *God is omnipotent! Didn't God know that<br>Adam and Eve would disobey?*<br><br>The answer to that is yes, of course He did.<br><br>Now you're probably screaming at your screen, *THEN WHY DID HE LET IT<br>HAPPEN?*<br><br>And the answer is because it was all part of His plan.<br><br>God, through Adam and Eve's disobedience and descent into sin, made<br>the perfect free will environment: enough evidence of His existence<br>to convince anyone willing to believe, but enough ambiguity so as to not<br>coerce the unwilling. And that's exactly what He wants: *only willing<br>believers. And the only ones who will be saved from their*<br>*pre-existing* *life of sin are the ones who truly, freely,<br>willingly choose to love Him.*<br><br>And how do you get only willing believers? Set up a system whereby the<br>only people who will believe are truly willing to believe. You will<br>not see the truth until you are willing to see the truth. And the<br>alternative is equally as compelling (in your own eyes) as God's truth.<br>So if you don't want to see the truth, you can be perfectly content in<br>your disbelief.<br><br>It's the perfect free-choice environment. If you choose not to believe<br>in the truth of Christianity, you can freely reject it. And to make sure<br>your choice is truly free, He places you in this environment filled with<br>evidence of His existence, but without His direct presence, which<br>would be so overwhelming and powerful as to override your free will and<br>coerce you into belief.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
