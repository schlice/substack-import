<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So here's the generalized numbers about people who get shot.<br><br>- You usually hear the 33000 number bandied about, this is the average<br>  number of people per year who die by gunshot. That's a pretty broad<br>  category, because it doesn't address *why* they were shot. The Brady<br>  Center likes to break this one down to make it even scarier: Every<br>  day, 316 people are shot. Technically that's true, but it's really<br>  misleading. And by the way, that includes people who were shot and<br>  survived.<br>- Indeed, that same number includes almost 22,000 people per year who<br>  die by suicide, and the gun was their chosen method. It's not the only<br>  method chosen, but in the United States, it is the most popular. Other<br>  countries see other methods used for suicide instead of guns.<br>- This leaves about 11,000 people who die by gunshot. In about 8000<br>  cases, these are criminal-on-criminal shootings. This is bad guys,<br>  killing bad guys, while in the midst of doing bad things. This<br>  includes drug deals gone bad, gang rivalries, and other illegal<br>  activities.<br>- This leaves about 3100 people who die every year from gunshot who were<br>  not suicides or criminals killing criminals while doing criminal<br>  things. About 1000 of these every year are killed by police, and<br>  the vast majority of these people were either armed or were attacking<br>  the officer in question.<br>- This leaves about 2100 people every year who die of gunshot who were<br>  not suicides or criminals killing criminals while doing criminal<br>  things, or killed by police. About 500 people are accidentally killed<br>  from gunshots. Roughly 325 die but the intent was unknown.<br>- This leave about 1275 people who die every year of gunshot wounds who<br>  are the actual victims of crime. The vast majority of these are caused<br>  by domestic disturbances where the assailant had a relationship with<br>  the victim. The rest are victims of crimes against the person.<br><br>Think about that. In a country of 330 million people, only 1275 die in<br>actual crime where they were not participating in criminal activity<br>themselves. That means in any given year, you have a 0.0003864% chance<br>of being one of those people. So unless you are a gang member or you are<br>a criminal, your chance of encountering gun violence is *vanishingly<br>rare*.<br><br>This doesn't mean we are *unconcerned* with this violence. Far from it.<br>We are very concerned with this. We just know that **the gun is not the<br>cause of the issue**. The *person* is the cause, not the *gun*. And<br>removing the gun does not make people nicer. Just look at any country<br>who claims that their gun violence death is so low. Ask them "Sure, but<br>what is your rate of violence regardless of tool used?" and watch them<br>recoil and backtrack.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What is the real truth on & behind fatal gun crime in the USA, as you<br>often hear & read daily stories on this in the New York Post? Every year<br>out of 330 million Americans nationwide, how many are actually fatally<br>shot & is it mainly gang related?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
