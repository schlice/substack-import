<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Wisconsin Statute 939.48 - Self-defense and defense of others.<br>><br>> (1)â€‚ A person is privileged to threaten or intentionally use force<br>> against another for the purpose of preventing or terminating what the<br>> person reasonably believes to be an unlawful interference with his or<br>> her person by such other person. The actor may intentionally use only<br>> such force or threat thereof as the actor reasonably believes is<br>> necessary to prevent or terminate the interference. The actor may not<br>> intentionally use force which is intended or likely to cause death or<br>> great bodily harm unless the actor reasonably believes that such force<br>> is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself<br>> or herself.<br><br>Rittenhouse had a justifiable case for self defense when he reasonably<br>believed that there was going to be "an unlawful interference with his<br>person" of another person.<br><br>He could only use deadly force if he reasonably believed that such force<br>was necessary to prevent *imminent death or great bodily harm* to<br>himself.<br><br>Under Wisconsin law, his belief had to be *reasonable*. This means that<br>there is a *reasonableness test* which must be applied to his use of<br>force.<br><br>To put it in another way, would a reasonable person, in the same<br>situation, believe that deadly force was necessary to prevent imminent<br>death or great bodily harm?<br><br>In my opinion, someone pointing a gun at me or swinging a skateboard at<br>my skull like a baseball bat definitely constitutes a threat of imminent<br>death or great bodily harm.<br><br>TL;DR: At the moment he believed he was facing a threat of imminent<br>death or great bodily harm, he had a legally justified case of<br>self-defense in Wisconsin.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>At what point did Rittenhouse have, or would he have had (if you believe<br>he didn\'t that night) a justifiable case of self-defense?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
