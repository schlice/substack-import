<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will Barack Obama be arrested and prosecuted for framing Michael<br>Flynn?**<br><br>Of course not.<br><br>But it does belie the statement that Obama was not involved in the<br>process of opening the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump<br>campaign. He was involved. Heavily.<br><br>When Obama makes the statement that his administration was the most<br>transparent, the most scandal-free in history, that is another<br>bald-faced lie. When the meeting in the Oval Office on January 5th took<br>place with Obama, Clapper, Brennan, Comey, Biden, Sally Yates, and a few<br>others, they discussed how to get the Steele dossier covered by the<br>media. It was already public knowledge, and they all knew that it was a<br>steaming pile of turd. The media didn't cover it very thoroughly though<br>because it wasn't really newsworthy. They needed to get some power<br>behind it, so they put the plan together, and implemented it the very<br>next day. They went to Trump Tower and briefed Trump about the dossier,<br>and then leaked to the media that Trump had been briefed about it.<br>*This* made it newsworthy, because the President had been briefed about<br>it.<br><br>We knew intuitivey that the whole Russia collusion thing could not have<br>happened without Obama knowing about it.<br><br>Now we find out that not only did he know about it, but he *spearheaded*<br>it. Now that the full, unredacted documents have been released, we see<br>that not only did Obama know about it, but he coordinated it. He<br>approved it.<br><br>Then, after that meeting, he kept Comey and Yates around discussing<br>Flynn and his call with Kislyak and about how they could trick him into<br>lying so that they could pursue criminal prosecution or get him fired<br>(both of which happened). Yates brought up that maybe they could get him<br>on the Logan Act. And Yates said (paraphrasing), *Oh my goodness. Look<br>at this! What are we trying to do? Are we trying to get the guy fired or<br>are we getting him to lie for a perjury trap?*<br><br>Obama knew about that as well. None of this would have happened without<br>his knowledge, and it did not happen without his approval.<br><br>Will he ever be held to account for this? Probably not. But it's all out<br>in the open now.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for<br>everyone.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
