<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Is a diagnosis of MS a death sentence?*<br><br>*Absolutely positively not.*<br><br>Let's get this out of the way right now: MS is not fatal. You cannot<br>die from MS. You *can* die from complications surrounding MS, but you<br>cannot die from MS. In fact, for someone who has been actively managing<br>the disease with one of the approved MS therapy drugs, lifespans roughly<br>match that of people without MS.<br><br>MS changes the quality of your life. The approved MS therapy drugs can<br>improve your quality of life, almost to the point that MS may be a<br>non-issue.<br><br>For me, it's always in the back of my mind, but not to such a degree<br>that it prevents me from living my life. My plans have to include my MS.<br>Beyond that, I live my life normally.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
