<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Charging ahead full steam. We were notified not too long ago that the<br>\"shop-around\" period had expired. This was the period of time that<br>other competing offers were entertained. This period has come and gone,<br>and no better offers have been received (surprise, surprise). So the<br>merger is moving on to regulatory review.<br><br>The merger is expected to be completed around June of 2016. At that<br>point, all shares of EMC stock will be sold and the capital returned to<br>the investors. They will receive roughly \$30 per share, as well as<br>VMware \"tracking stock\" worth about \$6 per share (approximately 0.111<br>shares of tracking stock for every share of EMC stock).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
