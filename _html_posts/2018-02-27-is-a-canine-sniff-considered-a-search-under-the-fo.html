But depending on the circumstances, it *might*<br>be a search covered by the 4th Amendment, or it might not.<br><br>For example, if a dog smells the *outside* of a car and alerts on drugs,<br>this is covered under what the courts call the "plain smell" test,<br>established in *United States v. Miller* \[812 F.2d 1206 (9th Cir.<br>1987)\]. The "plain smell" doctrine is a corrolary to the "plain sight"<br>exception to the 4th Amendment. The search is not considered<br>"unreasonable" if the illegal item is in plain sight of the officer, or<br>in this case, plain smell.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
