<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [First of all, for a claim of false advertising to have any<br>legs, you would have to find some advertising that says \"real wasabi\"<br>and then find out that they are using horseradish instead.\<br>\<br>Additionally, you have to show some harm for a false advertising claim.<br>Hurting your pride isn\'t really harm. Most people don\'t even know the<br>difference between real wasabi and artificial wasabi.\<br>\<br>In every Japanese restaurant in which I have eaten, I have simply asked<br>the chef for real wasabi and if he has it he will give it to<br>me.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
