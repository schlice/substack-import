<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> If God gave humans free will, then wouldn\'t that mean everything else<br>> has free will (disease, storms, genocide, asteroids, etc.)?<br><br>No. Only sentient creatures even have the capacity for free will, and<br>only humans have received the gift of free will from God. Inanimate<br>objects like asteroids have no will of their own.<br><br>> Why do people blame God for not intervening?<br><br>Because they reason that because God is so powerful, and Christians<br>claim He is infinitely loving, He should be intervening and protecting<br>us from all harm. But that's not only illogical, it's something that no<br>one has ever said of Christianity.<br><br>I've answered the question about why bad things happen to good people<br>before, so let me link to it for you to read over. Here's one question<br>about the pandemic I answered:<br><br>[[Bill Stein\'s answer to How does God feel about our suffering during a<br>pandemic?](https://www.quora.com/How-does-God-feel-about-our-suffering-during-a-pandemic/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
