<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Misconduct means a violation of department policy. It's not a violation<br>of law, because that's handled by the legal system (district attorney<br>and the courts). And it's not a violation of a person's civil rights,<br>because that's handled by the Department of Justice.<br><br>Misconduct means violating rules of conduct at the department level.<br>Therefore, it is the department that handles misconduct complaints.<br><br>It's different at every department, but there are some commonalities. In<br>most cases, police departments have an Internal Affairs Division<br>which is responsible for investigating allegations of officer<br>misconduct.<br><br>In general though, IA will perform an investigation and will turn over<br>their findings to the leadership chain to handle the disciplinary part<br>of the process. Leadership will usually convene a disciplinary board<br>consisting of, at a minimum, the officer's management, the department<br>leadership, and the department's training group. They will determine if<br>the officer did violate rules of conduct and whether or not the officer<br>was appropriately trained on those rules. They may recommend re-training<br>of the officer, or they could recommend other discipline, up to and<br>including termination.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
