<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How intrusive is an HOA allowed to be? Can they tell me how to<br>landscape my backyard?**<br><br>HOAs can be as intrusive as their Covenants and Rules & Regulations<br>allow them to be.<br><br>In general, HOAs deal with the outside of your house. Things like<br>how your yard looks, what products you can use to landscape, what your<br>landscaping looks like, what colors and products you can use on the<br>outside of your house, etc.<br><br>It is very infrequently that an HOA controls the inside of your house.<br>The only time I have seen an HOA be that intrusive is when it deals with<br>garages. I have seen an HOA state that you cannot use garages as storage<br>units and that cars must be stored in garages before they get parked on<br>driveways (it was a pretty restrictive HOA).<br><br>So can they tell you how to landscape your backyard? Absolutely.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
