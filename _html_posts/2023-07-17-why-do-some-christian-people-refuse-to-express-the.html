<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Christians know that God gave humans dominion over all the creatures<br>on the planet.**<br><br>> Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have<br>> dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens<br>> and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping<br>> thing that creeps on the earth. --- Genesis 1:26 ESV<br><br>This means, that as the highest life form on the planet, we have full<br>authority over all the creatures on the planet. This also means that<br>while we do have the right to kill animals for food (cf Genesis 9:2), we<br>are simultaneously entrusted to be *caretakers* or *stewards* of God's<br>creation on earth.<br><br>The Bible is clear that we are to treat animals with dignity and<br>respect.<br><br>> A righteous man cares for the needs of his animal. --- Proverbs 12:10<br>> ESV<br><br>With that in mind, we can develop a biblically-sound practice of<br>euthanasia as well as animal abortion, in order to care for the needs of<br>our animals, to treat them with dignity and respect, and show them mercy<br>as needed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
