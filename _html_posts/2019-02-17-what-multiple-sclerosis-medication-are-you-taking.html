<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What multiple sclerosis medication are you taking, and what have been<br>the pros and cons?**<br><br>I am currently on Gilenya™ (fingolimod). This is my third MS medication.<br>I was originally on Copaxone™ (glatiramer acetate), and then I moved to<br>Tysabri™ (natalizumab).<br><br>Gilenya is a very good medication. It is an oral MS med, so I take a<br>pill every day. Easy peesey.<br><br>Pros:<br><br>- It's a once-daily pill. It's part of my morning routine; I very rarely<br>  forget to take it.<br>- It has a very low incidence of side effects.<br>- It has kept my disease from progressing for the entire time I have<br>  been taking it. No new lesions, no active lesions, no change in any of<br>  my existing lesions.<br><br>Cons:<br><br>- It is an immunosuppressant, so you are more prone to catching viruses.<br>  You must be careful over the winter to keep your hands clean and keep<br>  yourself otherwise healthy. I have a *lower* WBC (white blood cell)<br>  count, but not *dangerously* low, continuously monitored, and<br>  manageable (for now).<br>- It does produce some GI changes. However, if the latest study<br>  highlighted at ECTRIMS is any indication, *this may actually be part<br>  of the reason the medication is effective.*<br>- When you first start taking it, it can lower your pulse and blood<br>  pressure. You must monitor for this. Simply increasing your activity<br>  level is enough to counter this effect. I supplemented that with extra<br>  caffeine for the first few months (make sure you're drinking plenty of<br>  water as well), and I managed the symptoms.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
