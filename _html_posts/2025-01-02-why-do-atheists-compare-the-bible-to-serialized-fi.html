<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's a challenge, but they manage to pull it off.<br><br>In order to characterize the Bible as fiction, you have to ignore all of<br>the fact in it. And there's tons of archaeological and historical fact<br>in the Bible, that even honest atheists must admit to. There are<br>accounts of real historical figures and real geological events and real<br>historical locations which archaeologists have discovered.<br><br>When questioned, they certainly wouldn't take issue with these, because<br>they have been physically discovered. If they can see it, feel it, etc.,<br>then it's proven.<br><br>There's only one problem, then. *God, necessarily, exists outside of the<br>physical realm, and can't be seen or touched.* You're never going to<br>find one of God's hairs or see one of God's footprints, because God is<br>not made of material (if He exists, and if He created the universe, then<br>He necessarily exists outside of the universe). So you're never going to<br>be able to find material evidence of an immaterial God.<br><br>In order to reject the Bible then, you only need to limit your<br>definition of *evidence* to that which can be proven by the Scientific<br>Method, that which can be sensed by the physical senses.<br><br>But of course, we know that things exist outside of the physical. We<br>know that sunsets are beautiful and the Nazis were evil. We are<br>certainly rational to believe these things, but not because we have<br>physical evidence to prove them. So we all believe in some things which<br>can't be physically detected.<br><br>Still, it is a challenge to deny the Bible. It actually takes much more<br>faith to deny the Bible than to believe it.<br><br>Why?<br><br>> Hundreds of years before \[the events in the New Testament were<br>> written to have taken place\], ancient writings foretold the coming of<br>> a man who would actually be God. This man-God, it was foretold, would<br>> be born in a particular city from a particular bloodline, suffer in a<br>> particular way, die at a particular time, and rise from the dead to<br>> atone for the sins of the world. Immediately after the predicted time,<br>> multiple eyewitnesses proclaimed and later recorded that those<br>> predicted events had actually occurred. Those eyewitnesses endured<br>> persecution and death when they could have saved themselves by denying<br>> the events. Thousands of people in Jerusalem were then converted after<br>> seeing or hearing of these events, and this belief swept quickly<br>> across the ancient world. Ancient historians and writers allude to or<br>> confirm these events, and archaeology corroborates them. Having seen<br>> evidence from creation that God exists \...\, Christians believe<br>> these multiple lines of evidence show beyond a reasonable doubt that<br>> God had a hand in these events. Atheists must have a lot more faith to<br>> explain away the predictions, the eyewitness testimony, the<br>> willingness of the eyewitnesses to suffer and die, the origin of the<br>> Christian church, and the corroborating testimony of the other<br>> writers, \and the\ archeological finds.\[1\](#EPWTM){#cite-EPWTM<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>In other words, it takes a lot more faith to believe that these things<br>didn't happen than that they did.<br><br>So you certainly can deny the truth of the Bible, but it's not easy.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-EPWTM){.citation_index} [[I Don\'t Have Enough Faith to Be<br>an Atheist: Geisler, Norman L., Turek, Frank, Limbaugh, David:<br>9781433580758: Amazon.com:<br>Books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=770f5b&url=https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Have-Enough-Faith-Atheist/dp/1433580756){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
