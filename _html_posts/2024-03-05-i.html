<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You're a married Christian. The end.<br><br>If you are a *true* Christian, you already know that marriage is<br>forever.<br><br>> So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined<br>> together, let not man separate. --- Matthew 19:6 ESV<br><br>You may *want* to marry a Hindu, but you are married already, and that's<br>forever.<br><br>So I can help you. Recommit yourself to your current spouse. Do a<br>marriage retreat. Take a vacation with just your spouse. Reconnect with<br>that person.<br><br>And finally, remember that you made a vow. How well people should<br>trust you is rightly dependent on how well you keep your promises. Be<br>the kind of person who people would want to trust.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
