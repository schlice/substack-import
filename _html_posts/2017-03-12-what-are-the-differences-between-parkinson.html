<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are some big differences.<br><br>Parkinson's Disease is characterized by the death of brain cells which<br>produce a neurotransmitter called dopamine. Over time (many years,<br>actually), the loss of the ability to produce dopamine causes the<br>patient to lose the ability to send brain signals which control<br>movements of the body. This may be related to MS as there is some new<br>research that indicates that the death of the dopaminergic neurons<br>(which produce dopamine) may be caused by an [[autoimmune<br>response](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=13b417&url=http://newsroom.cumc.columbia.edu/blog/2014/04/17/parkinsons-autoimmune-disease/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="columbia.edu"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>Multiple Sclerosis is definitely an autoimmune disease, but in this<br>disease the immune system attacks and destroys myelin, the fatty sheath<br>surrounding nerve fibers. In its wake, it leaves plaques, or scars (thus<br>the name "multiple sclerosis" meaning "many scars"). Nerve signals do<br>not traverse the scarred neurons as easily or efficiently as they do<br>through normal nerve cells (think an electrical wire with its insulation<br>stripped off), and this causes the various and unpredictable symptoms of<br>the disease.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
