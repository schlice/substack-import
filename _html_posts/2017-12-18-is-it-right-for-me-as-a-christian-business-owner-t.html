<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In order to successfully use religion as the reason for denying service,<br>the service you are performing for the customer would have to directly<br>contradict a religious belief you hold. For example, if you create<br>shoes, you must create shoes for gay people, even if your religion does<br>not believe in gay marriage. If, however, you were creating<br>one-of-a-kind shoes to celebrate a gay marriage, you might be able to<br>refuse to perform that particular service.<br><br>I struggle to see how you would be using your artistic talents to<br>celebrate sex outside of a marriage.<br><br>Even Scott Phillips, the proprietor of *Masterpiece Cake Shop* in<br>Lakewood, Colorado, had a very specific restriction: as a Christian, he<br>would not use his artistic talents to celebrate a gay wedding because<br>his faith dictated that a wedding is only supposed to be between one man<br>and one woman. When a gay couple asked him to design a custom wedding<br>cake for their commitment ceremony, Phillips told them he would sell<br>them any other cake in the store, but he could not design a custom cake<br>for their ceremony, because using his talents is a form of artistic<br>speech which the First Amendment right to practice religion protects.<br>Note that he was not being homophobic in his business practices; he<br>would sell them any other product with the exception of one which<br>utilized his creative talents to celebrate a gay wedding. He would<br>custom-design a birthday cake, or a Valentine's Day cake, or any other<br>cake, with the exception of a wedding cake. He also has refused to make<br>cakes for other occasions which contradict his religious beliefs: he<br>does not make Halloween cakes (which costs him a ton of money), nor does<br>he make anti-gay cakes. He once refused to make a cake for a Satanist<br>group. He clearly does not unfairly single out homosexuals simply<br>because he discriminates against gays. He clearly has a religious belief<br>which is not in line with celebrating a gay wedding.<br><br>Note that this was an issue because Colorado's anti-discrimination laws<br>list sexual orientation as a protected class. Not all cities or states<br>recognize sexual orientation as protected. As a business owner, you<br>should know what the anti-discrimination laws in your locale are.<br><br>While sexual orientation may be a protected class, it is almost certain<br>that violating ones own religion is not; generally, that is an issue<br>that they would take up with their God.<br><br>In summary, the "thing" you are being asked to do must directly violate<br>your own religious belief before you could consider refusing to do it on<br>religious grounds.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
