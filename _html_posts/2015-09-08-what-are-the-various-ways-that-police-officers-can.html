<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [To add to [[Tim<br>Dees](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tim-Dees)]{.qlink_container}\'<br>answer, there is one other feature of handcuffs that is also required<br>(for us) when they are used:\<br>\<br>Handcuffs ratchet closed in one direction. They only open with a key,<br>but they will continue to ratchet down as pressure is applied. The<br>forward ratcheting action can be locked with the small pin on the back<br>of the handcuff key:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-e50c75d0efc02a257bfd10dbe5c827c9){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-e50c75d0efc02a257bfd10dbe5c827c9" master_w="524"<br>master_h="264"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br>Once the handcuffs are \"double locked,\" they will no longer ratchet<br>closed. This allows you to close them to the point where they are not so<br>tight that they cut off circulation, but they will still retain the<br>suspect\'s wrists. The suspect will also not accidentally close them<br>further when placed in the back of a patrol car. Turning the key in the<br>other direction will release the double lock.\<br>\<br>I like the hinged cuffs because you can apply them with one hand more<br>easily while controlling the arm on which you are applying the cuff, and<br>they provide for less mobility when the suspect is cuffed. It\'s easier<br>to maintain positive control of the suspect while applying the cuffs.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
