<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What should you do assuming you leave your car unlocked overnight and<br>you discover a handgun in your car? It could be a crime weapon. Will<br>police suspect you if you notify them?**<br><br>Same advice that Eddie Eagle (the NRA Mascot) gives to kids about gun<br>safety:<br><br>- Stop<br>- Don't touch<br>- Leave the area<br>- Tell an adult (or in this case, the police)<br><br>Of course they will suspect you, silly! It's your car! They wouldn't be<br>doing their *job* if they didn't suspect you! But if you followed the<br>rules above, and consented to all of their background investigating,<br>they will find that your fingerprints are nowhere near that gun. They<br>will be all over the car, but not on the gun. How is it possible that<br>it's your gun but you never touched it? It's possible, but unlikely.<br>It's also possible but unlikely that you actually committed a crime with<br>the gun and then decided to call the police and tell them that it's not<br>your gun. Or you could have thrown the gun in the river, but hey,<br>calling the police is easier and there's less chance of going to jail,<br>right? /s<br><br>Anyway, get out of the car, lock it so no one can get in, go back in the<br>house, and call the police. Do everything they tell you to do. Let them<br>search everywhere they want. If you are arrested, don't help them any<br>more and get a lawyer, but until then, tell them everything they want to<br>know, including what you had for dinner last night and why you left your<br>car unlocked.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
