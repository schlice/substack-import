<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It depends on what you call a Christian church.<br><br>\<br><br>**TRIGGER WARNING: Before we begin this discussion, we must agree that<br>women are equal to men when we discuss value as human beings. The Bible<br>is also abundantly clear about this point. There is no ambiguity: women<br>and men have equal value.**<br><br>**And we are not discounting the ability of women to succeed in many<br>areas of life, just as men do. Women are exceedingly capable, and have<br>proven that over the decades.**<br><br>**In other words, it's not me denying a woman because I'm a misogynist.<br>It's the Bible which lays out the hierarchy which speaks against it.**<br><br>In other other words, *don't shoot the messenger.*<br><br>\<br><br>*That said, there is a* *hierarchy* *laid out in the Bible.*<br><br>Some Christian denominations denounce the clear teachings of the Bible<br>which indicate that there is clear, Biblical reasoning against females<br>being pastors, or in any rulership position. And yes, in those<br>Bible-denying "Christian" denominations, women can be pastors.<br><br>But the Bible itself speaks clearly against it. **Women are not to<br>exercise headship in the assembly.**<br><br>> *Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness. I do not permit a<br>> woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to<br>> remain quiet. \-- 1 Timothy 2:11--12 ESV*<br><br>This is a difficult one to wrap our modern, woman's equality, inclusive<br>American minds around, so remember that this is a Biblical exegesis,<br>only applicable to those who believe in, and pattern their lives after,<br>the truth of the Bible.<br><br>Here's the exegetical analysis of 1 Timothy 2:11--12:<br><br>> Verse 11 presented what at first appears to be a controversial<br>> statement. Viewed in full context, however, Paul has simply stated<br>> that women should not be flagrant or excessively loud or frenzied<br>> during a church gathering. Just as clothing should reflect a<br>> controlled, reasonable person, so too should behavior in a church<br>> service reflect godly peace.<br>><br>> How, then, is this phrase \in verse 12\ regarding women and teaching<br>> to be understood? In the local church, Paul specified men as elders (1<br>> Timothy 3:1--7) and most likely as deacons (1 Timothy 3:8--13). The<br>> point made in the New Testament is not that adult women can never<br>> teach adult men, as both Priscilla and her husband Aquila did exactly<br>> that with Apollos in Acts 18:26. Phoebe also served in some type of<br>> church leadership role, with some believing her role of \"servant\"<br>> was as a deacon (Romans 16:1). However, men are consistently specified<br>> as the primary local church leaders, in the role of elders.<br>><br>> The key is not the term *didaskein*, referring to teaching, but the<br>> Greek word translated as \"exercise authority:\" *authentein*. This<br>> word means \"to assume a stance of independent authority, give orders<br>> to, or dictate to.\" In simple terms, women are not to serve in the<br>> role of elder, or attempt to lead in the specific ways in which elders<br>> are expected to lead. Though women were not---and are not---excluded<br>> from praying in church gatherings, men were taught to take leadership<br>> in this area.<br>><br>> The repeated reference to \"quietness\" here again has more to do with<br>> self-control than with absolute lack of sound. Women were not to<br>> overtake a worship service, by taking control of public prayers or<br>> teaching, and especially not through hysterics or commotion. Elders<br>> were expected to oversee instruction and prayer in the church. First<br>> Corinthians 14:33--35 notes that this practice was not limited to<br>> Ephesus; it was true in all early churches.\[1\](#UzgHz){#cite-UzgHz<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>So again, we see here that the admonition against women leading church<br>services is not because women cannot lead well, it's because men are<br>*supposed to* lead well.<br><br>People often get hung up on this point about leadership, and for<br>context, they point back to Genesis at the creation of woman and they<br>note how God called her a "helper." But it's not exactly as you think.<br>When God said He was going to create a woman, He said:<br><br>> *Then the LORD God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone;<br>> I will make him a helper fit for him." \-- Genesis 2:18 ESV*<br><br>Now, a lot of people get hung up on the English word "helper," because<br>at least in English, the connotation is *secondary* to the *primary*<br>person. The "helper" in English is more like the "assistant."<br><br>But not so in Hebrew.<br><br>The Hebrew word used to describe Eve is *ezer*, which means a<br>counterpart, someone who completes, someone who strengthens.<br><br>That<br>[word(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=328874&url=https://biblehub.com/hebrew/strongs_5828.htm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="biblehub.com"}]{.qlink_container} is used another **19<br>times in the Bible, and *in every case*** is used to describe how<br>God relates to us. God is our helper, someone who completes us, someone<br>who strengthens us.<br><br>And God used that word to describe Eve. Does that sound like someone who<br>is an "assistant"? Would God describe himself as "second place?"<br><br>That has *radical* implications, no? The same word God uses to describe<br>Eve is the same word God uses to describe ***Himself in relation to<br>us.***<br><br>That's the level of importance God ascribes to the woman.<br><br>\<br><br>So yes, the woman is very important, but is still commanded to not<br>*lead*. At this point, the smart Christian woman would ask the one<br>relevant Biblical question:<br><br>*But what about Deborah?*<br><br>The case of Deborah fits exactly what we were discussing. Deborah's rule<br>shouldn't have been seen as wrong because Deborah didn't lead well.<br>Deborah's rule should have been seen as wrong because *men were supposed<br>to lead, and they did not, to Israel's lasting shame.*<br><br>So is bringing up Deborah a fair counterpoint to what we already<br>addressed as the Biblical patriarchy?<br><br>> \T\his is a fair question, because although Deborah is the only case<br>> of a woman ruling among God's people that feminists can use (cf. 2<br>> Kings 11), it only *takes* one case to disprove the universal negative<br>> that women should not rule. So having noted that she is an<br>> extraordinary case, what should we make of her?<br>><br>> Two ways to read the text<br>><br>> The first thing to note is that exceptional cases in the Bible are not<br>> generally normative; quite the opposite. Isaiah walking around naked<br>> for three years doesn't undermine the scriptural injunctions against<br>> nakedness, but actually reinforces them. It does this by calling<br>> attention to something feminists don't well understand: *shame*.<br>> Isaiah was enacting a graphic living parable of Israel's humiliation.<br>> In the same way, Hosea marrying a prostitute doesn't undermine the<br>> injunctions of Proverbs against marrying harlots, but rather trades on<br>> their truth to explicitly enact Israel's dishonoring of God. Thus,<br>> when we find an exception in Scripture to male rulership, we should<br>> ask whether it draws attention in some way to a principle of order by<br>> intentionally violating it to provoke shame.<br>><br>> In other words, there are two ways to read God's raising up of<br>> Deborah---two competing hermeneutics. The first is to see it as a<br>> commendation of women rulers; the second is to see it as an indictment<br>> of them. Feminists tend to assume that because Deborah sets a good<br>> example, the first hermeneutic must be true. But this demonstrates the<br>> point I keep repeating about acculturation: the frog doesn't know it's<br>> being boiled. Deborah being a good ruler fits just as well with the<br>> *second* hermeneutic if we set it in the context of patriarchy as the<br>> proper order.<br>><br>> The reason for this is that, like Isaiah's nakedness, Deborah's rule<br>> would *emphasize* the very thing God would be drawing attention to in<br>> the first place: the shame of Israel. In this case, Israel's men have<br>> abjectly failed to represent God's father-rule into the world,<br>> dishonoring themselves and their king. Every boy reading Judges 4:8--9<br>> instinctively knows that Barak is being shamed. Every boy reading<br>> Isaiah 3:12 instinctively knows that Israel is being shamed. Every boy<br>> is keenly acquainted with the primal shame of being made subject to<br>> women---even if it is conditioned out of him as "misogyny" by the time<br>> he is able to exegete Scripture for himself.<br>><br>> On this interpretation, the shame of Deborah's leadership would not be<br>> primarily because women shouldn't lead, but because men should. Thus<br>> the good example she sets wouldn't contradict what we read about women<br>> *not* ruling elsewhere in Scripture; it would rather draw attention to<br>> it more acutely by increasing the contrast between the moral state of<br>> the men who should have been ruling Israel, and the woman who was.<br>> Israel is faring poorly throughout Judges, but here in chapters 4--5<br>> there is a particular low point, in that they're so badly off they had<br>> a woman as judge---and she did a good job. The creation order is<br>> completely inverted; Israel is thrown upside down.<br>><br>> **In other words, since the Bible often shows us God turning things<br>> upside down to make a point, it is at least as plausible that God<br>> raised up Deborah to be Israel's shame, rather than its<br>> glory.**\[2\](#BymRy){#cite-BymRy .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-UzgHz){.citation_index} [[What does 1 Timothy 2:12<br>mean?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b15688&url=https://www.bibleref.com/1-Timothy/2/1-Timothy-2-12.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-BymRy){.citation_index} [[But what about Deborah?! ⋆ Bnonn<br>Tennant (the B is<br>silent)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=381e6b&url=https://bnonn.com/but-what-about-deborah/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bnonn.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
