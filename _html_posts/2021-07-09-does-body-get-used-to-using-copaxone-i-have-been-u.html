<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I used Copaxone for seven years. The injection site pain will always be<br>there, but it goes away fairly quickly. There are some things you can do<br>to minimize the pain:<br><br>1.  Take Tylenol 30 minutes prior to your injection<br>2.  Use a cold compress right after you inject<br>3.  Don't "slam" the medicine in there; after you insert the needle, be<br>    slightly more gentle while you push the plunger. This is why I don't<br>    recommend the Autoject for everyone in every circumstance. I only<br>    used the Autoject on my waist (my "love handles" injection site)<br>    because it was hard to reach. The rest of the time I just used the<br>    bare needles.<br><br>If, by "pain after it enters your body" you mean that after you inject<br>the medicine you feel pain throughout your body, that may be something<br>different. You might want to consult with your neurologist on that one.<br><br>(EDIT) After re-reading this question, it's possible that when the OP<br>said "does the body get used to Copaxone" they meant that Copaxone might<br>stop working after a period of time.<br><br>I can tell you that this does happen, as it happened to me. Eventually,<br>Copaxone just stopped working, and I got new lesions and new disability.<br>That's when I moved from Copaxone to Tysabri.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Does body get used to using Copaxone?
