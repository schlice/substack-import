<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [A specific education is not necessary, but is preferred.\<br>\<br>Each department does its own hiring and training in each location,<br>although all training for all peace officers within a state is reviewed<br>and certified by a state-level agency. Most of them call it a POST board<br>(Peace Officer Standardization and Training), to ensure that their<br>officers are trained to an equal minimum standard to enforce the laws<br>within that state.\<br>\<br>The acceptance process, under Federal law, cannot discriminate by age,<br>race, color or sex. In most jurisdictions, you have to be a US citizen,<br>you must have graduated high school or hold a GED, and you generally<br>need to have an excellent driving record.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
