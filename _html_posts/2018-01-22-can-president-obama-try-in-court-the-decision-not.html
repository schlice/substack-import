<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can President Obama try in court the decision not to give his Supreme<br>Court nominee a hearing as a constitutional violation?**<br><br>Only if he can show where (Article and Paragraph) in the Constitution<br>that it says that the Senate is *required* to provide *every*<br>candidate presented by the President with a "hearing."<br><br>I assume you are referring to the nomination of Merrick Garland that the<br>Senate refused to bring to the floor. The Constitution says that the<br>President will make nominations to the various courts with "the advice<br>and consent" of the Senate. There is nothing in the Constitution which<br>requires the Senate to bring every nominee before them for a vote.<br><br>So I ask you: what constitutes "advice?" If the Senate says, "We are not<br>going to act on this nominee," is that "advice?"<br><br>Additionally, the Constitution allows the Senate to run based on its own<br>rules. One of the rules that the Senate has instituted allows the<br>Majority Leader to set the Senate Calendar (i.e. what matters will be<br>heard by the Senate and what matters will be deferred). Since the<br>Majority Leader was following a legally-established Senate rule, in<br>accordance with the Constitution, it appears (without a court weighing<br>in) that the Senate's actions were Constitutional.<br><br>So *could* President Obama bring an action claiming that the Senate<br>acted in an unconstitutional manner? Sure he could, but from first<br>glance, it does not appear that the evidence of such a Constitutional<br>violation is present.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
