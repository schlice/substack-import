<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*This is a tretasie I have had on my computer for a long time; I don\'t<br>remember the source, but I\'ve found various incarnations of it all over<br>the Internet. If you have a source you\'d like to share, by all means<br>let me know so that I can provide the proper attribution.*<br><br>*Also, I don\'t expect to convert any atheists here; indeed, atheism<br>rejects all of this on its face, so you probaby find all of this amusing<br>and slightly boring. That\'s okay. I don\'t want to convert anyone. I<br>just want you to understand. If you at least understand, but still<br>don\'t believe, I have accomplished something today.*<br><br>\<br><br>The question of whether there is a conclusive argument for the existence<br>of God has been debated down through history, with exceedingly<br>intelligent people taking both sides of the dispute. In recent times,<br>arguments against the possibility of God's existence have taken on a<br>militant spirit that accuses anyone daring to believe in God as being<br>delusional and irrational. Karl Marx asserted that anyone believing in<br>God must have a mental disorder that caused invalid thinking. The<br>psychiatrist Sigmund Freud wrote that a person who believed in a Creator<br>God was delusional and only held their beliefs due to a \"wish<br>fulfillment\" factor that produced what Freud considered to be their<br>unjustifiable position. The philosopher Frederick Nietzsche bluntly said<br>that faith equates to not wanting to know what is true. The voices of<br>these three figures from history (along with others) are simply now<br>parroted by a new generation of atheists who claim that a belief in God<br>is intellectually unwarranted.<br><br>Is this truly the case? Is belief in God a rationally unacceptable<br>position to hold? Is there a logical and reasonable argument for the<br>existence of God? Outside of referencing the Bible, can a case for the<br>existence of God be made that refutes the positions of both the old and<br>new atheists and gives sufficient warrant for believing in a Creator?<br>The answer is yes it can. Moreover, in demonstrating the validity of an<br>argument for the existence of God, the case for atheism is shown to be<br>intellectually weak.<br><br>To make an argument for the existence of God, we must start by asking<br>the right questions. And where to begin is with the most basic<br>metaphysical question: "Why do we have something rather than nothing at<br>all?" This is the basic question of existence---why are we here; why is<br>the earth here; why is the universe here rather than nothing? Commenting<br>on this point, one theologian has said, "In one sense man does not ask<br>the question about God, his very existence raises the question about<br>God."<br><br>In considering this question, there are four possible answers to why we<br>have something rather than nothing at all:<br><br>1\. Reality is an illusion.\<br>2. Reality is/was self-created.\<br>3. Reality is self-existent (eternal).\<br>4. Reality was created by something that is self-existent.<br><br>So, which is the most plausible solution? Let's begin with reality being<br>simply an illusion, which is what a number of eastern religions believe.<br>This option was ruled out centuries ago by the philosopher Rene<br>Descartes who is famous for the statement, "I think, therefore I am."<br>Descartes, a mathematician, argued that if he is thinking then he must<br>'be.' In other words, "I think, therefore I am not an illusion."<br>Illusions require something experiencing the illusion, and moreover, you<br>cannot doubt the existence of yourself without proving your existence;<br>it is a self-defeating argument. So the possibility of reality being an<br>illusion is eliminated.<br><br>Next is the option of reality being self-created. When you study<br>philosophy, you learn that there are things called \"analytically<br>false\" statements, which means they are false by definition. The<br>possibility of reality being self-created is one of those types of<br>statements for the simple reason that something cannot be prior to<br>itself. If you created yourself, then you must have existed prior to you<br>creating yourself, but that simply cannot be. In evolution this is<br>sometimes referred to as 'spontaneous generation'---something coming<br>from nothing---a position that few, if any, reasonable people hold to<br>anymore simply because you cannot get something from nothing. Even the<br>atheist David Hume said, "I never asserted so absurd a proposition as<br>that anything might arise without a cause." This being the case, the<br>alternative of reality being self-created is ruled out.<br><br>Now we are left with only two choices---an eternal reality or reality<br>being created by something that is eternal: an eternal universe or an<br>eternal Creator. The 18th century theologian Jonathan Edwards summed up<br>the crossroads we have now come to this way:<br><br>• Something exists.\<br>• Nothing cannot create something.\<br>• Therefore, a necessary and eternal 'something' exists.<br><br>Notice that you must go back to an eternal 'something.' The atheist who<br>derides the believer in God for believing in an eternal Creator must<br>turn around and embrace an eternal universe; it is the only other door<br>they can choose. But the question now is: where does the evidence lead?<br>Does the evidence point to matter before mind or mind before matter?<br><br>To date, all key scientific and philosophical evidence points away from<br>an eternal universe and toward an eternal Creator. From a scientific<br>standpoint, honest scientists admit the universe had a beginning, and<br>whatever has a beginning is not eternal. In other words, whatever has a<br>beginning has a cause, and if the universe had a beginning, it had a<br>cause. The fact that the universe had a beginning is underscored by<br>evidence such as the second law of thermodynamics, the radiation echo of<br>the big bang discovered in the early 1900's, the fact that the universe<br>is expanding and can be traced back to a singular beginning, and<br>Einstein's theory of relativity. All prove the universe is not eternal.<br><br>Further, the laws that surround causation speak against the universe<br>being the ultimate cause of all we know for this simple fact: an effect<br>must resemble its cause. This being true, no atheist can explain how an<br>impersonal, purposeless, meaningless, and amoral universe accidentally<br>created beings (us) who are full of personality and obsessed with<br>purpose, meaning, and morals. Such a thing, from a causation standpoint,<br>completely refutes the idea of a natural universe birthing everything<br>that exists. So in the end, the concept of an eternal universe is<br>eliminated.<br><br>Philosopher J. S. Mill (not a Christian) summed up where we have now<br>come to this way: "It is self-evident that only Mind can create mind."<br>The only rational and reasonable conclusion is that an eternal Creator<br>is the one who is responsible for reality as we know it. Or to put it in<br>a logical set of statements:<br><br>• We exist (we are not an illusion); we are \"something\".\<br>• You do not get something from nothing.\<br>• Therefore a necessary and eternal 'something' exists.\<br>• The only two options are an eternal universe and an eternal Creator.\<br>• Science and philosophy have disproven the concept of an eternal<br>universe.\<br>• Therefore, an eternal Creator exists<br><br>Former atheist Lee Strobel, who arrived at this end result many years<br>ago, said "Essentially, I realized that to stay an atheist, I would have<br>to believe that nothing produces everything; non-life produces life;<br>randomness produces fine-tuning; chaos produces information;<br>unconsciousness produces consciousness; and non-reason produces reason.<br>Those leaps of faith were simply too big for me to take, especially in<br>light of the affirmative case for God\'s existence ... In other words,<br>in my assessment the Christian worldview accounted for the totality of<br>the evidence much better than the atheistic worldview."<br><br>But the next question we must tackle is this: If an eternal Creator<br>exists (and we have shown that He does), what kind of Creator is He? Can<br>we infer things about Him from what He created? In other words, can we<br>understand the cause by its effects? The answer to this is yes, we can,<br>with the following characteristics being surmised:<br><br>• He must be supernatural in nature (as He created time and space).\<br>• He must be powerful (incredibly).\<br>• He must be eternal (self-existent).\<br>• He must be omnipresent (He created space and is not limited by it).\<br>• He must be timeless and changeless (He created time).\<br>• He must be immaterial because He transcends space/physical.\<br>• He must be personal (the impersonal cannot create personality).\<br>• He must be infinite and singular as you cannot have two infinites.\<br>• He must be diverse yet have unity as unity and diversity exist in<br>nature.\<br>• He must be intelligent (supremely). Only cognitive being can produce<br>cognitive being.\<br>• He must be purposeful as He deliberately created everything.\<br>• He must be moral (no moral law can be had without a giver).\<br>• He must be caring (or no moral laws would have been given).<br><br>These things being true, we now ask if any religion in the world<br>describes such a Creator. The answer to this is yes: the God of the<br>Bible fits this profile perfectly. He is supernatural (Genesis 1:1),<br>powerful (Jeremiah 32:17), eternal (Psalm 90:2), omnipresent (Psalm<br>139:7), timeless/changeless (Malachi 3:6), immaterial (John 5:24),<br>personal (Genesis 3:9), necessary (Colossians 1:17), infinite/singular<br>(Jeremiah 23:24, Deuteronomy 6:4), diverse yet with unity (Matthew<br>28:19), intelligent (Psalm 147:4-5), purposeful (Jeremiah 29:11), moral<br>(Daniel 9:14), and caring (1 Peter 5:6-7).<br><br>One last subject to address on the matter of God's existence is the<br>matter of how justifiable the atheist's position actually is. Since the<br>atheist asserts the believer's position is unsound, it is only<br>reasonable to turn the question around and aim it squarely back at him.<br>The first thing to understand is that the claim the atheist makes---'no<br>god' which is that 'atheist' means---is an untenable position to hold<br>from a philosophical standpoint. As legal scholar and philosopher<br>Mortimer Adler says, "An affirmative existential proposition can be<br>proved, but a negative existential proposition---one that denies the<br>existence of something---cannot be proved." For example, someone may<br>claim that a red eagle exists and someone else may assert that red<br>eagles do not exist. The former only needs to find a single red eagle to<br>prove his assertion. But the latter must comb the entire universe and<br>literally be in every place at once to ensure they have not missed a red<br>eagle somewhere and at some time, which is impossible to do. This is why<br>intellectually honest atheists will admit they cannot prove God does not<br>exist.<br><br>Next, it is important to understand the issue that surrounds the<br>seriousness of truth claims that are made and amount of evidence<br>required to warrant certain conclusions. For example, if someone puts<br>two containers of lemonade in front of you and says that one may be more<br>tart than the other, since the consequences of getting the more tart<br>drink would not be serious, you would not require a large amount of<br>evidence in order to make your choice. However, if to one cup the host<br>added sweetener but to the other he introduced rat poison, then you<br>would want to have quite a bit of evidence before you made your choice.<br><br>This is where a person sits when deciding between atheism and belief in<br>God. Since belief in atheism could possibly result in irreparable and<br>eternal consequences, it would seem that the atheist should be mandated<br>to produce weighty and overriding evidence to support their position,<br>but they cannot. Atheism simply cannot meet the test for evidence for<br>the seriousness of the charge it makes. Instead, the atheist and those<br>whom they convince of their position slide into eternity with their<br>fingers crossed and hope they do not find the unpleasant truth that<br>eternity does indeed exist and that such a place is an awfully long time<br>to be wrong. As Mortimer Adler says, "More consequences for life and<br>action follow from the affirmation or denial of God than from any other<br>basic question."<br><br>So does belief in God have intellectual warrant? Is there a rational,<br>logical, and reasonable argument for the existence of God? Absolutely.<br>While atheists such as Freud claim that those believing in God have a<br>wish fulfillment desire, perhaps it is Freud and his followers who<br>actually suffer from wish fulfillment: the hope and wish that there is<br>no God, no accountability, and therefore no judgment. But refuting Freud<br>is the God of the Bible who affirms His existence and the fact that a<br>judgment is indeed coming for those who know within themselves the truth<br>that He exists but suppress that truth (Romans 1:20). But for those who<br>respond to the evidence that a Creator does indeed exist, He offers the<br>way of salvation that has been accomplished through His Son, Jesus<br>Christ: \"Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his<br>name, he gave the right to become children of God---children born not of<br>natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband\'s will, but born of<br>God\" (John 1:12-13).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
