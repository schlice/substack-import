<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In the past month, I have used 77 GB of "service". 74 GB of that was<br>the hotspot on my iPhone. Is that bad?**<br><br>The definition of "bad" is dependent on a lot of things.<br><br>- It may be bad if you were billed for all 77 GB and you can't afford<br>  your bill.<br>- It may be bad if you don't actually have any hotspot service on your<br>  mobile contract (i.e. you converted your phone to hotspot-capable<br>  without hotspot service on your contract) and they terminate your<br>  service for it.<br>- It may be bad if you don't have hotspot service on your phone or your<br>  contract but you're being billed for it anyway.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
