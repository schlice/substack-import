<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Thanks for the A2A.\<br>\<br>There are a few things you need to work out first.\<br>\<br>- Is there a market for your app? Are there police departments that want<br>this capability? Are there police departments that need it? For example,<br>my local department allows reporting of certain types of crimes online.<br>They allow the reporting of the following crimes:]<br><br>- Theft of Personal Belongings (*Where you or another person allowed the<br>  suspect to enter your property/residence.)*<br>- Theft of Car Parts<br>- Theft of License Plates<br>- Damage to Your Property<br>- Vandalism to Your Property<br>- Property You Have Lost<br>- Gas Skips (Businesses only - no suspect information or license plate<br>  information)<br><br>Could your app be integrated with their online system to provide a<br>convenient way for people to report these crimes and include images?<br>This would create a value-added for them and enhance their ability to<br>solve some of these crimes.\<br>\<br>- How can you ensure the video or images are not edited? You have to<br>create recording software that ensures the integrity of the uploaded<br>video (i.e. you have to only allow uploads directly from the app, and<br>you have to capture the camera within the confines of the app). What<br>happens on jailbroken/rooted phones? Can someone commandeer the app and<br>upload edited video?\<br>\<br>- Can reports be made anonymously? This would seriously place in<br>jeopardy the usability of the videos, as their provider could not be<br>authenticated.\<br>\<br>While I like the idea overall, I don\'t think police departments will be<br>interested, because the video won\'t be usable in court (because it<br>can\'t be authenticated and/or verified), so it will be of limited<br>usefulness.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
