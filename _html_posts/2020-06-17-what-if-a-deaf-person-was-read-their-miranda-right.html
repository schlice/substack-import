What would happen<br>if they didn't tell the officer they were deaf?**<br><br>First of all, it's not like TV. You're not read your rights when you are<br>arrested. You are only read your rights when you are questioned.<br>However, it's really rare that arresting officers never speak a single<br>word to a suspect, so it's unlikely that they'd get really far without<br>figuring out they are deaf.<br><br>But anyway, what happens in the interview room:<br><br>- You are handed a Miranda card. The detective will read the information<br>  on the Miranda card out loud while you read along.<br>- You are asked if you understand the rights as they were read to you<br>  and as they appear on the card. You must answer the question yes or<br>  no. You then mark the yes or no box on the card.<br>- You are then asked if you want to answer questions without a lawyer<br>  being present. Again, you must answer yes or no, and mark the<br>  appropriate box on the card. Finally, you sign that you understand<br>  everything and you marked what you intended to mark and no one made<br>  you mark anything you didn't want to mark.<br><br>So even if they didn't hear the words, they would be able to read the<br>card, mark the appropriate boxes, and sign.<br><br>The detective may not even find out that the person is deaf until the<br>actual interview begins, at which point an ASL interpreter would be<br>brought in to the interview.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
