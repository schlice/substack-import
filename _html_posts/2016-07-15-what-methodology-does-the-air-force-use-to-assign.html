<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is a great deal of science behind the structure of AFSCs, but<br>there is a lot of variability in how you get assigned to a particular<br>AFSC. For the most part, three facets have to coincide, and the weight<br>of these factors is different. In order:<br><br>- What the member qualifies for<br>- The needs of the Air Force<br>- The desires of the member<br><br>Every job in the Air Force falls under one of four major aptitude areas:<br>Mechanical, Administrative, General and Electrical. Each AFSC falls into<br>one of the four categories and what you qualify for is dictated by your<br>PULHES and ASVAB scores. PULHES is a numerical score assigned during<br>in-processing, and determines your (P)hysical, (U)pper Body, (L)ower<br>Body, (H)earing, (E)yes, and p(S)ychiatric competency. ASVAB is the<br>Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery test, which is often given to<br>high school students to help them find employment which matches their<br>aptitude in the four major aptitude areas, but is also used exclusively<br>by the military to qualify personnel for AFSCs. Career fields will have<br>minimum ASVAB requirements as well as PULHES scores required for that<br>career field. Some jobs, such as Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)<br>require minimum scores in two aptitude areas, mechanical and electrical.<br>3P0\'s (Security Forces) fall under the General Aptitude area.<br><br>In some cases, recruiters can guarantee the AFSC you will train into at<br>the time you enlist. These entries into military service fall under the<br>Guaranteed Training Enlistment Program, or GTEP. Most career fields are<br>around 40/60. That means 40% of those jobs are GTEP contracts and 60%<br>are AI (Aptitude Area) contracts. For example, let's assume that there<br>are 1000 Fuel Specialist (2F0X1) billets available for Fiscal Year 2016<br>(FY16). 40 percent of them (or 400 billets) are contracted through GTEP<br>at the recruiter level; the other 600 billets are assigned during the<br>second week of basic training. In FY16, Security Forces is 100% GTEP.<br><br>If you are not involved in a GTEP contract, your AFSC will be determined<br>during the second week of basic training. The combination of (in order)<br>your scores, the needs of the Air Force (i.e. which career fields are<br>currently the most understaffed) and your wishes will determine what<br>career field you are assigned to. You may not get the career field you<br>desire; the needs of the Air Force come first, but if you express a<br>desire for a particular career field, the Air Force will try to<br>accommodate you. They want happy people, and if you have a burning<br>desire to be a Special Missions Aviator, they will try to put you in<br>that field. If there is availability, and your scores match the<br>requirements, they can place you there. They will always try to fulfill<br>your wishes when making assignments, assuming you expressed a desire for<br>a particular career field. If you have not, they will use your aptitude<br>and the needs of the Air Force to assign you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
