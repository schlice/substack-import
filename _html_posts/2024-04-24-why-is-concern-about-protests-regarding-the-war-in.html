"Columbia<br>> was confronted with a clear choice either the anti-Semitic barbarians<br>> or the Jews. They expressly chose the anti-Semitic barbarians,"<br>> exclaimed Menken.

"Anti-Semitism is always about finding a facade, a<br>> pretense, and then moving on to their end goal, which has always been<br>> ethnic cleansing and genocide," argued Menken. "They were never<br>> anti-Israel protests.

I'm sure that's only<br>> the tip of the iceberg, since the anti-Semitic protests have reached<br>> even smaller, lesser known schools like [[Cal Poly<br>> Humbolt](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=83ae0a&url=https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-04-23/campus-protests-israel-gaza-palestinian-humboldt-closed){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="latimes.com"}]{.qlink_container} or [[UNC<br>> Charlotte](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d9aa55&url=https://twitter.com/UNC_SJP/status/1782430005311467929){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="twitter.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br>><br>> At this point, it seems like American Jews are safest anywhere that<br>> isn't a college campus. But that's obviously not a workable solution<br>> in the long run. Today's students are tomorrow's lawyers, bankers, and<br>> politicians --- not to mention professors. Are American Jews simply<br>> supposed to accept a second-class status, where they don't get to go<br>> to college and are governed by those who hate them? How well did that<br>> work in 1930s Germany? If Jews aren't safe on American college<br>> campuses, then ultimately they won't be safe anywhere else in America.<br>><br>> Where is the safe space for Jews?<br>><br>> Jews could perhaps find a safe haven on other shores. But a cursory<br>> glance around the world shows the same violent anti-Semitism on<br>> shameful display in American universities. Judging by U.N. voting<br>> records, America sits near the top of the list of pro-Jewish<br>> countries. If Jews can find few countries friendlier than the U.S.,<br>> and they are hated here, where can they go?<br>><br>> Where is the safe space for Jews?<br>><br>> The obvious exception is the world's only Jewish-majority nation-state<br>> (although two million Arabs also live there peacefully), the postage<br>> stamp-sized parcel of seacoast known as Israel. Established in 1948 in<br>> response to the Holocaust, the modern state of Israel has provided a<br>> safe haven for persecuted Jews of every nationality.<br>><br>> Yet Israel's Jews are not safe even within their own paper-snowflake<br>> borders. Hamas proved that on October 7, 2023, when they launched an<br>> unprovoked invasion on a Jewish holy day, slaughtering more than 1,200<br>> Jews, kidnapping more than 200 prisoners, burning, raping, and<br>> pillaging wherever they could. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist<br>> group supported by America's geopolitical adversary Iran, openly<br>> [calls(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=84879f&url=https://washingtonstand.com/news/israel-faces-new-enemies-threats-of-annihilation){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="washingtonstand.com"}]{.qlink_container} for Israel's<br>> "annihilation" and has broadcast its intention to repeat its October 7<br>> attack as often as it is capable.<br>><br>> Hamas is not Israel's only threat. Hezbollah, another Iran-backed<br>> terror group, operates out of Israel's northern neighbor Lebanon, and<br>> it has kept up frequent rocket barrages against Israel to divide its<br>> attention. "There are, I believe, about 80,000 Israelis who can't go<br>> home every night because the rockets being shot in by Hezbollah out of<br>> Lebanon," Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wisc.)<br>> [remarked(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=52fd4c&url=https://rumble.com/v4qyx43-rep.-glenn-grothman-on-the-95-billion-foreign-aid-package.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="rumble.com"}]{.qlink_container} on "Washington Watch."<br>> "Obviously Israel cannot permanently tell 70 or 80,000 of their<br>> citizens, 'you can't go home at night.'"<br>><br>> Behind these groups lies Iran, a global terror sponsor, which is close<br>> to developing a nuclear weapon and is avowedly committed to Israel's<br>> destruction.<br>><br>> Where is the safe space for Jews?<br>><br>> But perhaps the campus mobs openly supporting Hamas are ignorant of<br>> Hamas's goal and merely want American Jews to return to Israel. If<br>> that were true, they would also have to be ignorant of the words<br>> coming out of their own mouth.<br>><br>> "From the river to the sea, Palestine is almost free," they<br>> [chanted(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=209d5b&url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/protests-turn-violent-at-yale-higher-education-college-campus-anti-israel-92c48b3f){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="wsj.com"}]{.qlink_container}. That's a strange twist on<br>> their classic, "From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free." By<br>> "free," they mean free of Jews. By "from the river to the sea," the<br>> chant invokes (and confuses) the boundaries of the land God promised<br>> to give to Israel in Deuteronomy 11:24, "from the River, the River<br>> Euphrates, to the western sea." The technical term for seeking to<br>> drive all people of a given ethnic group out of a given territory is<br>> "ethnic cleansing."<br>><br>> Again, they<br>> [chanted(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=209d5b&url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/protests-turn-violent-at-yale-higher-education-college-campus-anti-israel-92c48b3f){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="wsj.com"}]{.qlink_container}, "There is only one solution:<br>> intifada, revolution." "One solution" echoes the Nazis' "Final<br>> Solution to the Jewish problem": extermination camps. Intifada and<br>> revolution --- both terms for riots or armed uprisings --- are the<br>> means by which this chant proposes to achieve its end: the<br>> annihilation of all Jews everywhere.<br>><br>> No, the protestors know very well what unthinkable barbarity these<br>> chants call for. They share the end of Hamas.<br>><br>> Where is the safe space for Jews?<br>><br>> The utmost irony is that these disgraceful displays of anti-Semitism<br>> were sparked by the attack on Israel. When most sovereign nations<br>> suffer an unprovoked attack by an international terrorist outfit, they<br>> receive universal acknowledgements of sympathy, solidarity, and<br>> solace, even from parties who usually maintain a frosty distance. But<br>> when Israel was attacked, that outrage provoked not only sympathy for<br>> Israel but also expressions of solidarity with those who attacked her<br>> --- even before Israel had mounted any military response.<br>><br>> This has led some Jews, even non-Zionists, to the inevitable<br>> conclusion that Israel's demise would only result in further attacks<br>> on Jews everywhere. "The idea that Jews can be safe anywhere if<br>> they're not secure in Israel has just been shattered," said foreign<br>> policy expert Caroline Glick. "It's very clear that the security of<br>> all Jews everywhere is contingent on Israel defeating our enemies in<br>> Israel."<br>><br>> Under the Biden administration, Israel's closest and most powerful<br>> friend is working overtime to snatch that rightful victory away from<br>> them. If that happens, it will lead right back to the question we've<br>> been asking all along.<br>><br>> Where is the safe space for Jews?\[1\](#YhOTU){#cite-YhOTU<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-YhOTU){.citation_index} [[Where Is the Safe Space for<br>Jews?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4f4061&url=https://washingtonstand.com/commentary/where-is-the-safe-space-for-jews){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="washingtonstand.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
