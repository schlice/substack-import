<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I don't see a problem with *raising* the minimum age to buy a long<br>gun to 21, and doing this nationwide, at the Federal level.<br><br>Note that I didn't say possess a long gun, I just said buy one.<br>If a parent gifts a long gun to you at 18, that's a different story. The<br>responsibility for that young adult getting that rifle is now shared<br>between the parent and the adult child, very much the same way we<br>provide provisional driver's licenses to young adults because they have<br>a very high incidence of auto accidents and so we restrict their driving<br>in the most dangerous, most distracting ways.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
