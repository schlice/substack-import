<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Remember that military rifle rounds are jacketed, meaning under most<br>circumstances, they do not deform when striking human flesh. In many<br>cases, the bullet will go \"through and through,\" make a clean puncture<br>wound, effectively removing that soldier from the fight, but increasing<br>(as much as possible) the chance that the soldier can be patched up and<br>still live. This is a type of weapon that is acceptable in war (insofar<br>as any weapon of war is \"acceptable\").<br><br>Laser weapons cause permanent blindness. Weapons which don\'t simply<br>remove a soldier from the fight, but even in the best case leave a<br>soldier permanently blind, are not considered to be valid weapons of<br>war. An alternative would be a bright enough strobe light that could<br>temporarily blind a troop but leave no permanent damage like a laser. We<br>have such a weapon, it is called the<br>[Dazzler.(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c4bccb&url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dazzler_(weapon)){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
