<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Wouldn\'t it be smarter for Trump to cite the Garland precedent as a<br>reason to not select a nominee to the SC, and make the vacant spot a<br>campaign energizer?**<br><br>You can be sure that someone on Trump's team (not Trump, mind you) has<br>already thought of this. And it is a viable strategy. If the 2016<br>election was partly a referendum on Scalia's seat, couldn't they do that<br>again?<br><br>Certainly, they could employ this strategy. But at least one political<br>strategist has rightly noted that Democrats have been clearly saying for<br>the last few months that they believe the President has been obstructing<br>mail-in balloting because he thinks it will benefit Democrats, or he<br>thinks it will enable election fraud, or whatever, and they have clearly<br>vowed to take this election to the courts. It almost seems like a<br>foregone conclusion that at least one, if not more, state elections will<br>end up being decided by the courts in 2020.<br><br>If you were Trump, would you want to almost assuredly send the election<br>to a 4--4 split in the SCOTUS, when the state courts and appeals courts<br>(who will hear the case first) are largely liberal controlled?<br><br>So which one then is more risky? Leaving the seat vacant until after the<br>election and making filling the seat an election issue and going into<br>the election with a 4--4 split, or going into the election with a<br>textual originalist majority to decide the election and leaving the<br>election up to the people's choice between Trump and Biden? If you're<br>Trump, you know that the election is going to the courts, one way or the<br>other, regardless of who is elected on November 2nd (if we even have a<br>clear winner by then). He'd rather have a full court to decide the<br>election than have another issue to energize his base.<br><br>And what if Trump ends up losing? He loses the opportunity to seat a<br>textualist majority on the SCOTUS which will affect the direction of the<br>courts for *decades* after both Trump and/or Biden or anyone else has<br>vacated that office. That's an opportunity that his base would most<br>definitely excoriate him for passing up.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
