<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Wow, the other answers on here are just...wow.<br><br>Trump will likely do a little blaming of past administrations for<br>failing to secure the borders adequately (which wouldn't be far from the<br>truth), but his use of Twitter has never taken more than a few seconds<br>of his time.<br><br>If another 9/11 magnitude attack happens on US shores, you can expect<br>the full might of the US military to be unleashed on the person, agency,<br>or government (perhaps all of the above) that claims responsibility for<br>the attack, harbors the attacker, or aids their cause.<br><br>If the cowardly organization does not claim responsibility, we will do<br>our best to figure out who did it, and then wipe them from the face of<br>the earth. You can expect a massive response, probably many times larger<br>than the original attack.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
