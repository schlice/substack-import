<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The only way you can make "gun ownership" responsible for the criminal<br>actions of individuals is to first remove the protections afforded by<br>the Constitution for those who keep and bear arms.<br><br>Then you can start making the case that "gun ownership" causes people to<br>commit mass shootings. While nothing stops you from making that case<br>today, gun owners can always rest on the fact that the Constitution<br>protects the right to keep and bear arms.<br><br>You'll have to sell to the average American that owning a gun is a<br>direct cause of other people committing mass shootings. You have to<br>convince them that the gun they have in the safe, which doesn't kill<br>anyone, somehow causes someone else in another state to kill people.<br><br>Once you can do that, you can start to hold gun owners accountable for<br>the mass shootings caused by gun ownership.<br><br>It certainly won't be easy, because it will mean upending the entire<br>system of justice in this country, which has always held that the only<br>person directly responsible for a crime is the criminal. But I bet given<br>the right conditions, you could do it.<br><br>Never give up on your dreams!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
