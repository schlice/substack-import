<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [More social services are great, but there are limits to<br>government benevolence.\<br>\<br>For example, the government could do so much more in the United States<br>to help the mentally ill. We are ignoring a problem which, I think, goes<br>much deeper than most people understand. There are so many different<br>levels of mental health issues; most people are totally functional and<br>have some level of mental health issue. If there wasn\'t such a stigma<br>surrounding mental health, we\'d make far more progress. The government<br>could do so much more to furthering that discussion, and adding more<br>social programs would be something that would benefit many, many<br>people.\<br>\<br>But on the flip side, we throw so much money at education, and we\'re<br>not seeing the ROI from that money. We will approve any tax increase on<br>the ballot as long as the word \"education\" is tied to it. We have<br>steadily increased spending on education over the last 20 years, yet<br>student achievement has been essentially flat. Throwing more money at<br>education doesn\'t help.\<br>\<br>Finally, I\'d mention that our National Parks Service says don\'t feed<br>the animals because doing so \"will make them dependent\" on those<br>handouts and they will never learn to feed themselves. From the<br>[[National Park<br>Service](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d73554&url=http://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/nature/wildlife_alert.htm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nps.gov"}]{.qlink_container} website: \"a fed animal is a<br>dead animal.\"\<br>\<br>There\'s a lot of truth to that statement.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
