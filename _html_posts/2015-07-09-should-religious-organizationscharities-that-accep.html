<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [No one should be receiving charity from the government.\<br>\<br>The government should cease all charitable operations of any kind, and<br>return those monies to individuals.\<br>\<br>Individuals can then decide if they want to provide their money to<br>charitable organizations.\<br>\<br>The government was never designed to be a charity factory, and<br>redistribution of wealth in any form should be strongly discouraged in<br>the government. It creates too many entanglements from which the<br>government should be freed.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
