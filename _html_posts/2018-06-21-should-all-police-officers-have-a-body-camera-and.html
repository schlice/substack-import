<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should all police officers have a body-camera and dash-camera that is<br>turned on and recording everything when they are on patrol? If no then<br>please state why you feel that way?**<br><br>Should they? In an ideal world, yes, they should.<br><br>Is it the *smartest* and most *fiscally responsible* thing to do? By<br>far, it is not.<br><br>In order to have such a policy, you have to ask yourself:<br><br>- How long must you store the evidentiary video (i.e. the video that<br>  actually must be used as evidence)?<br>- How long must you store the non-evidentiary video (i.e. the video that<br>  is not actively part of a legal proceeding)?<br>- How do you handle FOIA requests for either set of materials?<br><br>The first two bullets go directly to cost. Server space and drive<br>space is not cheap. It's also not cheap to hire video techs to work full<br>time cataloging, backing up, and maintaining all that video. Therefore,<br>the answers to the first two bullets effectively determine exactly how<br>much money you spend as a department. For departments with unlimited<br>budgets, they can indeed do this. But when a department has a fixed<br>budget, priorities must be made. Do we record and store *everything,* or<br>just the *important stuff*? It is indeed a trade off. If you really want<br>the police to record and store everything, be prepared for your taxes to<br>go up. Not interested in a tax hike? Be prepared for trade-offs.<br><br>The third bullet is really important. If I can make a FOIA request for<br>non-evidentiary video, I can request the police release that recording<br>where a woman detailed her sexual assault and I can put it on YouTube.<br>She may feel like her privacy was violated, but ah, too bad, you talked<br>to the police, and their camera is always rolling. Or worse, replace<br>woman with child above. Or worse, replace that with an informant who is<br>rolling over on a gang banger. You really think he'll be willing to talk<br>to police?<br><br>Now ask yourself: *how many women or children or informants will<br>willingly tell police the truth when they know that anyone could request<br>that video?*<br><br>You've just created a chilling effect on things that people wouldn't<br>want revealed to the world. You'd basically have to consider every<br>police officer as a video feed to the Internet, and act accordingly,<br>even when they interview you. And you won't be able to tell the police<br>the whole truth if you know that their video feed could someday end up<br>on YouTube.<br><br>If it's not clear from the description, this doesn't help anyone.<br><br>It's not smart to have cameras on all the time, or at least to not have<br>officers have discretion over when they can turn them on and off. Both<br>from an overall cost and a privacy perspective, constantly rolling<br>cameras are unwise.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
