<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The most realistic shows I have watched followed<br>detectives, not so much squad officers.\<br>\<br>If you want to know what really happens in a police investigation, watch<br>*The First 48* on A&E. It follows detectives in a major metro area as<br>they walk through the first 48 hours of an investigation, the most<br>critical time of any investigation. There is an almost 50% drop in<br>probability of successfully closing a case if there is not a significant<br>break in the case within the first 48 hours of the police investigation.<br>Probably the most realistic view of what police investigators do.\<br>\<br>A more dramatized view into what squad detectives do can be found on<br>*NYPD Blue* reruns. But that show was indeed a drama, and was dramatized<br>away from real life. But I can tell you that the cases were real, as my<br>dad (a retired New York detective) called me in a flurry after one<br>episode and said, \"Did you watch NYPD Blue? That was my case!\" While<br>the names were changed to protect the identities of the real persons<br>involved, the subject matter of the case and many of the details were<br>directly out of the real case.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
