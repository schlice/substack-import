<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are the limits for joining the armed forces as a felon? I will be<br>honest and have a felony for 3rd degree felony. I cleaned up my act and<br>finished probation. I want to serve my country, educate myself for free<br>and serve with my brothers in arms.**<br><br>Thanks for your question.<br><br>The military has "character standards" for their enlistees. The reason<br>for these standards is not prudishness or elitism. It's because people<br>who do not have prior criminal records are less of a risk for becoming<br>trouble (i.e. disruptive) while serving, or becoming security risks.<br><br>To that end, people with prior felonies will need a waiver. The waiver<br>process will show that the enlistee has successfully risen above his<br>prior circumstance and has been trouble-free for a certain period of<br>time.<br><br>This is what the military has to say about character standards for<br>enlistment:<br><br>> Persons entering the Armed Forces should be of good moral character.<br>> The underlying purpose of moral character enlistment standards is to<br>> minimize entrance of persons who are likely to become disciplinary<br>> cases or security risks or who disrupt good order, morale, and<br>> discipline. Moral standards of acceptability for service are designed<br>> to disqualify the following kinds of persons:<br>><br>> - Individuals under any form of judicial restraint (bond, probation,<br>>   imprisonment, or parole).<br>> - Those with significant criminal records.<br>> - Persons convicted of felonies<br>>   - Persons with felonies may request a waiver to permit their<br>>     enlistment. The waiver procedure is not automatic, and approval is<br>>     based on each individual case. One of the considerations in<br>>     determining whether a waiver will be granted is the individual\'s<br>>     ability to adjust successfully to civilian life for a period of<br>>     time following his or her release from judicial control.<br>>   - In processing waiver requests, the Military Services shall require<br>>     information about the \"who, what, when, where, and why\" of the<br>>     offense in question, and a number of letters of recommendation<br>>     attesting to the applicant\'s character or suitability for<br>>     enlistment. Such letters must be from responsible community<br>>     leaders such as school officials, ministers, and law enforcement<br>>     officials.<br>> - Those who have been previously separated from the Military Services<br>>   under conditions other than honorable or for the good of the<br>>   Service.<br>> - Those who have exhibited antisocial behavior or other traits of<br>>   character that would render them unfit to associate with military<br>>   personnel.\[1\](#XPsyD){#cite-XPsyD .citation_link}<br><br>So you mentioned that your probation is over; the military will want to<br>see that you have successfully adjusted to civilian life *after* your<br>probation, so if you've been 6 months off of probation and are holding<br>down a job and handling yourself well, you're more likely to get a<br>waiver approved than if you just came off of probation last week.<br><br>Work with your recruiter to see if you can get a felony waiver. There is<br>no penalty for talking about your past with your recruiter, and the more<br>honest you are about your past, the more likely a recruiter will process<br>a waiver for you. And even if your recruiter puts in a waiver, MEPS will<br>want to review the case before they take you, so be prepared for lots of<br>scrutiny into your past and what you did.<br><br>Also remember that waivers are purely subjective. For example, if you<br>were convicted on a burglary charge, and the Colonel at MEPS reviewing<br>your case just had his house broken into last month, do you think he<br>will approve your waiver?<br><br>Finally, each service is different; if one service will not waiver you,<br>try another. So have a top preference for service, and then a second and<br>third preference. You may want Air Force first, and then Navy, and then<br>Army. If Air Force won't give you a waiver, go talk to the Navy<br>recruiter.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-XPsyD){.citation_index} [[An Arrest Record Could Keep You<br>From<br>Enlisting](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0fc7ee&url=https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/disqualifiers-law.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="military.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
