<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The way it is normally written in HOA Governing Documents is that the<br>group which does Architectural Review (either known as the Architectural<br>Review Board or the Architectural Approval Board) has **complete<br>control over what the neighborhood looks like, and it is their sole<br>discretion** which determines what stays and what goes.<br><br>The guidelines in the neighborhood would be just that: guidelines. The<br>ultimate authority is the ARB.<br><br>So if you were to do what others suggest (such as, where in the CC&Rs<br>does it say you can't grow ivy, etc), you'll likely be referred to the<br>section in the CC&Rs which gives the ARB the sole authority to determine<br>what changes can stay and what changes must go.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How is an HOA allowed to make broad rules such as, \" unsightly<br>growth\"? I asked if I could grow creeping fig around my front door. The<br>response I received was ,\" you cannot grow ivy it is considered<br>unsightly growth.\"<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
