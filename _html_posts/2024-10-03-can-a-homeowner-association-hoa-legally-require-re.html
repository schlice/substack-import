<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends," and in this<br>case it depends on the rules in the HOA's Governing Documents.<br><br>If the HOA needs to regulate who parks in the community's garage, the<br>HOA can issue parking permits to cars which are permitted to use the<br>garage. To issue parking permits, the car to which the permit is being<br>issued can be recorded, including the "ID numbers" (in the US, we call<br>them "license plates") assigned to the car.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
