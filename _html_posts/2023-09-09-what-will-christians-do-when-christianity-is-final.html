<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So let's make your hypothetical at least plausible. Let's assume the<br>Chinese take over the United States and they abolish the Constitution.<br>Then they make all religion (including Christianity) illegal.<br><br>What will Christians do?<br><br>Go underground.<br><br>How do we know? It's happened before.<br><br>At the outset of the French Revolution in 1789, people were forced to<br>swear allegiance to the Civil Constitution, which rejected papal<br>authority and aimed to establish a national church. Christians did not,<br>and people like Father (now Blessed) William Joseph Chaminade ministered<br>to the underground church in Bordeaux while disguised as a peddler. His<br>life story reads like a made-for-TV drama, with close calls and near<br>misses, with the thickness of a board separating him from the<br>guillotine.<br><br>TL;DR: So long as at least one person believes, Christianity will never<br>truly be abolished. And despite making it illegal, it will still be<br>practiced, in secret. Like Jesus told His disciples:<br><br>> But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your<br>> Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in<br>> secret, will reward you. --- Matthew 6:6 NIV<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
