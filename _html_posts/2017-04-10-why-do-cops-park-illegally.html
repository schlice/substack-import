<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The short answer is that cops can't park "illegally."<br><br>Police vehicles are considered "emergency vehicles" in most states'<br>vehicle and traffic laws. This means that the traffic law doesn't apply<br>to them. A police car can't pull over another police car and charge him<br>with speeding. A police car technically can't be in excess of the speed<br>limit, because the speed limit technically does not apply to police<br>officers. Granted, there are always department policies that limit what<br>an officer can and cannot do with a police cruiser , but a police<br>vehicle cannot operate illegally as far as the law is concerned.<br><br>But like [[Christopher<br>Finch](https://www.quora.com/profile/Christopher-Finch-5)]{.qlink_container}<br>said, police officers often have to curtail their stops quickly and head<br>out to other emergency calls, so having their vehicle close by (which<br>sometimes means parking against a red curb, or on a sidewalk, or<br>someplace that you think might be otherwise illegal) is imperative.<br><br>Also, that cruiser is their office. It has all of their emergency<br>supplies, their police computer, and it is the temporary holding "cell"<br>for people being placed under arrest. It needs to be as close as<br>possible.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
