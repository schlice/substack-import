<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Two questions here, I'll take them one at a time:<br><br>> Why does God not give the sort of evidence for his existence that<br>> atheists are looking for?<br><br>First of all, *what is the evidence atheists are looking for?* Should<br>God float down from heaven on a massive cloud and zap all the bad people<br>and instantly end all war and suffering? Would that be the evidence they<br>would need to believe in God?<br><br>Probably. But there is one primary reason why God will not do this:<br><br>Free will.<br><br>God has given us free will, and he wants us to choose him freely,<br>without coercion. If he were to float down on a cloud as I stated, *his<br>presence would be so overpowering that it would override our free will*.<br>We would have no choice but to believe in him. And he doesn't want<br>to do that to us.\<br>\<br>The simple fact is that God has given us enough evidence in this world<br>to convince anyone who is willing to believe, but has left just enough<br>ambiguity so as to not compel the unwilling. For love must be given<br>freely, it cannot be coerced.<br><br>> Wouldn't that just shut them up or would they just ignore that<br>> evidence and continue not believing?<br><br>Ask an atheist who is willing to have an honest conversation the<br>following question: *If I could present evidence which would reasonably<br>answer all of your questions and doubts about Christianity ---<br>reasonable to such a degree that it seems likely that Christianity is<br>true* *beyond a reasonable doubt* *--- would you become a<br>Christian?*<br><br>If the answer is still no, then the problem is not one of evidence.<br>There is a difference between *proving* a proposition and *accepting*<br>the truth of that proposition. I can provide all of the evidence you<br>need to prove the truth, but it is up to you to accept that truth. In<br>the case of the atheist who still will not become Christian, the problem<br>is not one of evidence. The problem is volitional or emotional, not<br>merely intellectual. In other words, no amount of evidence would<br>convince such an atheist, because evidence is not what's in their way<br>--- they are.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why does God not give the sort of evidence for his existence that<br>atheists are looking for? Wouldn't that just shut them up or would they<br>just ignore that evidence and continue not believing?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
