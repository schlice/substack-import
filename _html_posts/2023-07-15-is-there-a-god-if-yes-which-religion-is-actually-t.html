<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So first of all, with the sheer number of different religions and sects<br>around the world, it makes it very difficult to know which one is right.<br>But religion is not unique in this. It's just so strange that so many<br>people just say, "All religions are right, they're just different ways<br>of looking at the same thing." At this point, these relativists often<br>pull out the example of the elephant and the six blind men. They say<br>that if you point the blind men at an elephant and you ask them to<br>identify what they "see" (feel), you'll get six different answers. One<br>man feeling the leg will identify that it is a tree, another feeling the<br>body would say it's a wall, the one holding the tail would say it's a<br>rope, while the one feeling the trunk would say it's a snake. The man<br>feeling the ear might say it's a fan, and the one feeling the tusk would<br>say it is a spear. The relativist will then explain that the elephant is<br>like God and the blind men are like world religions: they are all<br>experiencing God differently, but they come to different conclusions<br>about what they experience. Religious truth, we are told, is relative to<br>the individual. It's subjective, not objective.<br><br>At first, the fact that there are so many contradictory religions in the<br>world might reinforce the elephant parable, and lead to the notion that<br>truth in religion can't be known.<br><br>But this is far from accurate.<br><br>The rebuttal to the elephant parable is this: *what is the perspective<br>of the one telling the story: the narrator?* That person has an<br>*objective* view of the scene and can tell that the blind men are all<br>wrong. The narrator would not know that the blind men were wrong unless<br>he had an objective perspective of what is right.<br><br>So if the person telling the story can see that it's an elephant, can't<br>the blind men see it too? Of course! If they suddenly could see, they<br>would realize that they too were wrong, and it's actually an elephant in<br>front of them, and not a rope, a snake, or a spear.<br><br>So that leads us to a number of questions:<br><br>- Is there absolute truth?<br>- Can truth be known?<br>- Is it true that God exists? Can the truth about God be known?<br><br>We know that absolute truth exists. And we can prove that it does.<br>The relativist says, "All truth is relative," but isn't that an absolute<br>statement? If the relativist declares that all truth is relative, he's<br>making an absolute truth statement, is he not? Therefore, his very<br>belief is self-defeating. The postmodernist says that there is no truth<br>at all, but he actually holds that one truth exists: postmodernism is<br>correct. Therefore, postmodernism too is self-defeating by its own<br>nature. The skeptic says, "We can't know anything for sure." But *are<br>you sure* that you can't know anything for sure? That sounds like a<br>pretty certain truth statement. You literally can't be skeptical about<br>*everything*, because that position is self-defeating: the more you are<br>skeptical about skepticism, the more certain you become. Therefore,<br>skepticism is also self-defeating.<br><br>**So if absolute truth exists, we know right off the bat that<br>agnosticism, postmodernism, relativism, and skepticism are all false<br>positions.**<br><br>Next, the Law of Noncontradiction says that a thing can not be "X" and<br>"not-X" at the same time. So while Islam and Judaism teach that Jesus is<br>not God, Christianity teaches that He is. One of these has to be right,<br>and the other has to be wrong. So there is truth, and it can be known.<br>This means that pluralists are clearly not right when they say that all<br>religions are true, or they say "I'm speaking my truth" as if it is<br>"true for me but not for you." Contrary *beliefs* may exists, but<br>contrary *truths* do not.<br><br>Finally, can we know that God exists, and can the truth about God be<br>known?<br><br>The answer is yes, we can, and we can use logic to do it. In order to<br>answer the question, you have to ask the correct question first. And<br>that question is: *why am I here?* *Why is there something, rather than<br>nothing at all?* The search for the truth about why something exists<br>rather than nothing at all leads us to understand the truth about God.<br>The argument for God can be expressed very simply:<br><br>1.  Something exists.<br>2.  You can't get Something from nothing.<br>3.  Therefore, a necessary and eternal entity created Something.<br><br>Even atheists do not deny this logic. They simply claim that the<br>universe is that eternal entity. However, to date, all scientific and<br>philosophical inquiry has proven and re-proven that the universe had a<br>beginning, and the body of evidence proving this fact is continually<br>growing. If something had a beginning, it is not eternal. Therefore,<br>being that the only two sources of eternality are an eternal universe or<br>an eternal Creator, and we have proven that the universe is not eternal,<br>an eternal Creator must exist.<br><br>*Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that a creator God exists.*<br><br>Now, this conclusion says nothing about what kind of God exists, but it<br>does rule out all pantheistic religions. All pantheistic worldviews say<br>that the universe is God and is eternal. And this assertion is false.<br>So, **Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and all other pantheistic religions<br>are ruled out as valid belief systems.**<br><br>\<br><br>So in just a few paragraphs, we have discovered that atheism,<br>agnosticism, postmodernism, relativism, pluralism and skepticism are all<br>false. We have also discovered that all pantheistic religions such as<br>Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, etc, which believe that the universe is God<br>and is eternal, are also false.<br><br>So we're left with just the monotheistic (Abrahamic) religions:<br>Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. But can we tell which one of the<br>monotheistic religions is right?<br><br>Well, we can use another scientific principle: the Law of Causality.<br>This law says, in part, that *an effect must resemble its cause*.<br>Therefore, can we use forensic analysis to work backwards from the<br>effect (us) and learn anything about the cause (God)? The answer,<br>unsurprisingly, is yes. From creation, we can tell the following about<br>God. He is:<br><br>- Supernatural in nature (as He exists outside of His creation)<br>- Incredibly powerful (to have created all that is known)<br>- Eternal (self-existent, as He exists outside of time and space)<br>- Omnipresent (He created space and is not limited by it)<br>- Timeless and changeless (He created time)<br>- Immaterial (because He transcends space)<br>- Personal (the impersonal can't create personality)<br>- Necessary (as everything else depends on Him)<br>- Infinite and singular (as you cannot have two infinites)<br>- Diverse yet has unity (as all multiplicity implies a prior<br>  singularity)<br>- Intelligent (supremely, to create everything)<br>- Purposeful (as He deliberately created everything)<br>- Moral (no moral law can exist without a lawgiver)<br>- Caring (or no moral laws would have been given)<br><br>Now that we have determined the characteristics of the God who created<br>the universe and everything in it, *is there any remaining monotheistic<br>world religion which describes this God?*<br><br>In fact there is: Christianity describes this God perfectly.<br>Christianity says that God is:<br><br>- supernatural (Genesis 1:1),<br>- powerful (Jeremiah 32:17),<br>- eternal (Psalm 90:2),<br>- necessary (Exodus 3:14, Colossians 1:17)<br>- omnipresent (Psalm 139:7),<br>- timeless/changeless (Malachi 3:6),<br>- immaterial (John 5:24),<br>- personal (Genesis 3:9),<br>- infinite/singular (Jeremiah 23:24, Deuteronomy 6:4),<br>- diverse yet with unity (Matthew 28:19),<br>- intelligent (Psalm 147:4-5),<br>- purposeful (Jeremiah 29:11, Psalm 19:1-4),<br>- moral (Daniel 9:14),<br>- caring (1 Peter 5:6-7).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
