<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What does Article 2 Section 2 Clause 2 of the Constitution mean?<br><br>> He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate,<br>> to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur;<br>> and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the<br>> Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls,<br>> Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United<br>> States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and<br>> which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest<br>> the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in<br>> the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of<br>> Departments.<br>><br>> ---Article II, Section 2, Clause 2, US Constitution<br><br>Article II Section 2 Clause 2 does a few things.<br><br>- It defines the Office of the President as the office responsible for<br>  foreign relations, as it gives the President the power to make<br>  treaties.<br>- It defines the President's appointment authority. He can appoint<br>  "officers" of the United States, including the Supreme Court.<br>- It lays out the fact that the Senate is responsible to give "advice<br>  and consent" to such appointments and treaties. It's important to note<br>  that it does not dictate *how* the Senate gives that advice and<br>  consent, or whether or not they must give that advice and consent at<br>  all (thus disallowing the appointment by not providing "consent"). The<br>  Senate is free to work according to their rules. This became a major<br>  point of contention when Merrick Garland was being considered for a<br>  Supreme Court seat to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice<br>  Antonin Scalia. The Senate chose not to hear arguments or testimony<br>  from Judge Garland, and chose to not vote on his appointment. Many<br>  thought that the Senate "abdicated its duties" by refusing to vote,<br>  and thought that the judge was due an "up or down vote," not a tacit<br>  denial of appointment. Garland's appointment situation, and the<br>  subsequently vacant seat, became an election issue, as the incoming<br>  president would decide who should fill that seat. This became a<br>  driving factor for many to consider Trump over Clinton, as the public<br>  voted to shape the courts with the Presidential election.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
