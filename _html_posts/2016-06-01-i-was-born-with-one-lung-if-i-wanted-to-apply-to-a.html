<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [That's a tough one. Navy standards say that<br>pneumonectomy, or removal of one lung, is disqualifying. Lobectomy<br>is also disqualifying, as is a history of surgery in the chest. However,<br>lung agenesis (or congenital absence of a lung) is not explicitly called<br>out as a disqualifying condition.\<br>\<br>However, there are still a number of other things that could potentially<br>cause you to fail the medical entrance exam, not the least of which is<br>the fact that your total lung volume is half of what everyone else has.<br>You may not be able to pass the pulmonary function tests with the<br>appropriate pulmonary function to be deemed medically qualified.\<br>\<br>For most service academy appointments, if you are otherwise qualified to<br>attend a service academy, the admissions department will process a<br>medical waiver request for you. They will want to see that you can pass<br>a pulmonary function test and that you have a history of successful<br>participation in normal cardiovascular activity. They may schedule you<br>for additional tests, but in the end, it's up to the people at DODMERB<br>(DoD Medical Examination and Review Board) to determine if the condition<br>is waiverable.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
