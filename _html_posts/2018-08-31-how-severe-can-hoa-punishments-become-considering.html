<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How severe can HOA punishments become, considering you OWN the<br>property?**<br><br>The answer is "it depends." Don't forget, the HOA has an ownership<br>interest in the entire neighborhood, even though you are the deeded<br>owner on your house. Your Governing Documents determine just how bad it<br>can get. In some cases, if there is something on the outside of your<br>home that needs to be fixed, the HOA will hire contractors to fix it and<br>then bill you for the work. In others, they will simply demand you fix<br>it and will continually fine you until you do.<br><br>In most HOAs, the remedy for the HOA is fines. However, if you don't pay<br>your fines (or any work they may have done and billed to you), they can<br>put a lien on your house. If you continue to not pay your fines, the HOA<br>can foreclose on your lien to get their money (which means you no longer<br>own your house).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
