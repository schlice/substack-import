<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Is it philosophically problematic to have arguments for or against the<br>> existence of God?<br><br>Not at all. In fact, I believe that belief in a creator god is<br>philosophically sound. The reason why I say this is because there is<br>positive, empirically detectable evidence for a creator god, regardless<br>of whether or not atheists want to acknowledge it. It would be<br>philosophically problematic if it were an argument from ignorance, or an<br>argument inserting an intelligent cause into a gap in our knowledge.<br><br>> How does faith factor into these arguments?<br><br>What we know about God is knowledge gained by *induction*. Induction is<br>the process of gaining information by drawing general conclusions from<br>specific observations. This process is distinct from the process of<br>*deduction*, in which we line up premises in a valid argument to arrive<br>at a conclusion.<br><br>Much of what you know, you know through induction. In fact, you've<br>probably already used induction to investigate the truth in the<br>arguments I provided in the previous section. Namely, you have<br>determined that since it would be philosophically problematic to base<br>your belief of the existence of God on an argument from ignorance or a<br>"god of the gaps" fallacy, it would not be problematic to base your<br>belief on positive, empirically detectable evidence for a creator. This<br>information was gained through induction.<br><br>It is also true that the vast majority of information gained through<br>induction can never be 100% certain. It can only be *highly probable.*<br>For example, are you absolutely, 100% certain that gravity makes all<br>objects drop? No, because you haven't observed all objects being<br>dropped. Likewise, are you absolutely certain that all men are mortal?<br>No, because you haven't observed all men die. Perhaps there's someone<br>somewhere who hasn't died or will not die in the future. In fact, we<br>arrive at most decisions in life---from what we eat to whom we choose<br>for friends---through observation and induction. We don't have perfect<br>information about the liquid in a Campbell's Soup can---we think it's<br>edible and won't poison us---but we're not 100% certain. We are relying<br>on our prior experience that Campbell's Soup is trustworthy, and we are<br>concluding that there's actually Campbell's Soup and not poison in the<br>can. Likewise, we don't have perfect information about the character of<br>people we may meet. But after spending some time with them, we may<br>conclude that they are trustworthy people. Are we 100% certain? No,<br>because we are generalizing from our limited number of experiences. Our<br>conclusion may be highly probable, but it is not certain. This is the<br>case with many decisions we make in life.<br><br>So if inductive conclusions are not certain, can they be trusted? Yes,<br>but to varying degrees of certainty. Since no human being possesses<br>infinite knowledge, most of our inductive conclusions can be wrong. But<br>even when we don't have complete or perfect information, we often have<br>enough information to make reasonably certain conclusions on most<br>questions in life. Back to our "are all men mortal" question, since<br>virtually everyone has been observed to die, your conclusion that all<br>men are mortal is considered true beyond a reasonable doubt; it's<br>99-plus percent sure, but it's not beyond any doubt. It takes some<br>faith---albeit a very small amount---to believe it. The same can be said<br>for concluding that gravity affects all objects, not just some. The<br>conclusion is practically certain but not absolutely certain. In other<br>words, we can be sure beyond a reasonable doubt, but not sure beyond all<br>doubt.<br><br>Faith, therefore, bridges the gap between our knowledge and our belief.<br>When we possess some knowledge by induction, we need some faith to<br>overcome any remaining doubt. Since our conclusion about the fact that<br>all men are mortal is almost certain, we don't need a lot of faith to<br>believe it. But if we lack inductive knowledge of a premise, it would<br>take *more* faith to believe it.<br><br>This is where we stand when we discuss having faith in a creator god.<br>Since we have positive, empirically-detectable evidence for a creator<br>god, it doesn't take as much faith to believe. Conversely, the atheist<br>can produce no positive, empirically-detectable evidence that a<br>creator god does not exist. Therefore, the atheist requires **much more<br>faith** to believe his position than the theist requires to believe his.<br><br>Think about that. What that means is that it requires more faith to be<br>an atheist than it does to be a theist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
