<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How "most people" answer that question is dependent on the dictates of<br>their religion. But on this one account, *Christianity stands alone<br>among world religions.*<br><br>And on that account, let's be abundantly clear here. Christianity<br>believes that NO ONE IS QUALIFIED FOR HEAVEN.<br><br>> *as it is written: "None is righteous, no, not one; \-- Romans 3:10<br>> ESV*<br><br>No one is worthy. We are all sinners. We sin in our thoughts, and in our<br>words, in what we have done, and what we have failed to do. We sin<br>(acts) because we are sinners (by birth). We are born into sinful<br>bodies, and born into a broken, sinful world.<br><br>And without God's grace, it is there we would stay.<br><br>> *And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once<br>> walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of<br>> the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of<br>> disobedience---among whom we all once lived in the passions of our<br>> flesh, carrying out the desires of the flesh and the mind, and were by<br>> nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.* *But God**,<br>> being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us,<br>> even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with<br>> Christ---by grace you have been saved--- \-- Ephesians 2:1--5 ESV*<br><br>I highlighted "But God." One of the best thoughts in the Bible.<br><br>We were dead in our trespasses and sins. Can dead men save<br>themselves? NO!<br><br>BUT GOD<br><br>But God intervened. He saved us, through His grace alone. We can do<br>nothing to earn salvation. We can do nothing to qualify us for<br>salvation. It is only through God's grace that we are saved.<br><br>> *For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your<br>> own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no<br>> one may boast. \-- Ephesians 2:8--9 ESV*<br><br>You are saved by the grace of God, through faith in Christ. That is a<br>gift which we did nothing to earn.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
