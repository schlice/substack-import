<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **How do you respond to someone that persistently tells you that the<br>> world is ending & that the Bible accurately predicted the natural<br>> disasters & wars happening?**<br><br>First of all, the Bible is not a fortune teller. It's not a Farmer's<br>Almanac. It isn't designed to "tell you the future" any more than the<br>Farmer's Almanac is designed to tell you who's going to win the 2030<br>World Series.<br><br>***The Bible is designed to point YOU in the right direction for YOUR<br>future!***<br><br>And for those who persist and say that the Bible is accurately<br>predicting natural disasters and wars, I say that even a stopped clock<br>is right twice a day. Yeah, maybe the Bible gets some of these right,<br>but as I mentioned, the whole point of the Bible is not to predict<br>future events with startling accuracy. It's to help YOU reach YOUR<br>future.<br><br>> **She's saying that God is doing this to show us that he\'s boss & no<br>> one is stronger.**<br><br>Really? You really think that GOD has to PROVE himself to *US*? Who does<br>she think God is? Who does she think *WE* are that we are somehow<br>ENTITLED to God's EXPLANATIONS and DEMONSTRATIONS of His power?<br><br>If that were the case and God was doing this to prove something to us,<br>why wouldn't he answer some even more basic questions, like *why does he<br>allow evil to persist in the world? What is the purpose of our<br>suffering? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the cross before He died?*<br><br>God is not obligated to answer ANY of our questions, and even claiming<br>that he need to "showcase" His power to us for some reason is almost<br>blasphemous to utter!<br><br>> *"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my<br>> ways," declares the Lord. "As the heavens are higher than the earth,<br>> so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your<br>> thoughts."*<br>><br>> - Isaiah 55:8--9 (NIV)<br><br>Even if He *wanted* to answer our questions and showcase His power and<br>reveal His plans, it's very likely, according to this, that ***we<br>probably wouldn't even understand, because we're simply incapable of<br>understanding.***<br><br>As Christians, we must rely on God's Word, and rely on the fact that He<br>always keeps His promises. He has promised to return; you must believe<br>that He will keep that promise and return. He has promised that ***all<br>who believe in Him*** will have eternal life (John 3:16). You must<br>believe that.<br><br>This is the basis of *faith*. But faith is not ungrounded. Faith is<br>founded in truth and logic. There is evidence to show that He has kept<br>His promises, so we have faith that He will continue to do so.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
