<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Oh, it's much more logical to disbelieve in God if you have no evidence.<br><br>Thankfully, believers have plenty of evidence to believe that God<br>exists. It's just that some people have so narrowly defined what they<br>will accept as "proof" that it conveniently excludes the evidence we<br>already have.<br><br>That's not a hallmark of the scientific method. That's allowing your<br>conclusions to color your scientific inquiry. This means that you are<br>not unbiased while analyzing your data. That's bad science, and it<br>almost never leads to the correct answer.<br><br>The "proof" that some people are looking for is *physical, testable<br>evidence* of the existence of God. But logically, this makes no sense.<br>Material evidence of an immaterial God is illogical. You're never going<br>to find material evidence of God. You're never going to find one of<br>God's hairs, or see one of God's footprints. It's like using a metal<br>detector to find a plastic cup.<br><br>But demanding physical evidence of God's existence is just one of the<br>dishonest things that religion deniers will demand so that they can<br>*seem* reasonable. News flash: that's not reasonable.<br><br>We do have proof, it's just not physical proof. *Philosophy* is the<br>scientific discipline which allows us to probe realities beyond the<br>physical. It is philosophical proofs which lead us to believe that a<br>creator god exists. And we have enough of that proof to believe beyond a<br>reasonable doubt that God exists.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
