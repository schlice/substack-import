<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It\'s a function of numbers. There aren\'t nearly enough<br>cops out there to be able to effectively catch criminals immediately<br>after a crime has been done. We\'d need far more cops to be able to have<br>that sort of saturation in the general population, and that sort of<br>society turns more into a police state than I\'d like to see.\<br>\<br>Whether they catch the criminal 5 minutes after, or 24 hours after, the<br>crime is not really relevant. So long as they catch the criminal, they<br>have accomplished their stated duties. Why would the speed of<br>apprehension affect a criminal? If a criminal knew he\'d be caught<br>within 24 hours, would he still commit the crime?\<br>\<br>Sadly, this is the actual reason that crime persists: most criminals do<br>not get caught. The very large majority of crimes go unsolved. It\'s<br>true that if there is not a significant lead within the first 48 hours<br>of a crime, the possibility of catching the criminal reduces by nearly<br>50%. So speed is definitely of the essence.\<br>\<br>Let me just add one more thing. Police are there to catch the criminal<br>after the crime. That fact puts your well-being in *your* hands, not<br>in the hands of the police. There will always be crime, there will<br>always be criminals, because there will always be people, and people are<br>people. But your well-being is up to you. You can choose to be a victim<br>of crime, or you can fight back. The choice, and the consequences, are<br>up to you. Don\'t be a bystander in your own life.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
