You might think that you could just go to your carrier and demand an<br>output of all of the SMS messages that went to that line, as you own the<br>account. However, your cell phone provider has an obligation to protect<br>the privacy of the other participant in the conversation, and you were<br>not a party to that conversation. Therefore, in order to retrieve text<br>messages from your cell phone carrier, you must obtain a court order.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
