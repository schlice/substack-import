<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is no purpose.<br><br>In order to ask for forgiveness, you must ask *someone* for their<br>forgiveness. If you wrong someone, you ask that person for forgiveness.<br><br>If you do not believe that God exists, you have no one to whom you are<br>accountable, so you have nothing for which you need to be forgiven. All<br>is permissible (or at least all you can get away with).<br><br>Of course, if God does exist, then living like He doesn't is probably<br>not going to be a fruitful way to live, but that's not what you asked.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
