<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>An Entry-Level Separation (ELS) is a discharge which occurs during the<br>first 180 days of enlistment. It is a recognition that not everyone is a<br>"good fit" for military duty.<br><br>However, you don't seek an ELS. ELS is not a program that allows you<br>to quit within the first 180 days. ELS is a program which allows<br>commanders to separate you without a characteristic of service<br>instead of discharging you if you can't be rehabilitated to fit the<br>military lifestyle, or if you refuse to do so. Be aware, they will try.<br>They will send you for remedial training, or they will discipline you if<br>needed.<br><br>Commanders can discharge you instead of doing an ELS, and the<br>characterization of your discharge can affect all sorts of things like<br>future benefits or ability to be drafted, or your ability to re-enlist<br>if you choose.<br><br>But to answer your question, if they try to work with you and it simply<br>isn't working, a commander can ELS or discharge you, and you will<br>immediately begin the process of out-processing. You have a form to<br>fill out which closes out all of your interests at all of the offices on<br>the base which track you. You have to visit all of those places, they do<br>their thing to remove you, and they sign off on your form. The amount of<br>time it takes you to out-process is dependent on how long it takes each<br>one of these agencies to complete their portions and sign off on your<br>form.<br><br>Once it's complete, you take your form to Transportation, who will<br>arrange for transport back to the city of your home of residence. Your<br>personal effects can be packaged and sent ahead to your home of<br>residence, and that's it. You walk out the door and you go on with your<br>life.\[1\](#OsoID){#cite-OsoID .citation_link}<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What is the process of getting discharged with an ELS or general<br>discharge?
