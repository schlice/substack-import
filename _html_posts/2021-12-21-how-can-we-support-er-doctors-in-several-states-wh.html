<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Tell them to either:<br><br>1.  Quit lying to you to try to scare you into supporting them<br>2.  Go back to school and learn what triage is.<br><br>I can guarantee you that no one is being refused life-saving care<br>because they are "too busy" with COVID-19 patients.<br><br>Patients are seen based on their *criticality*, not whether or not a<br>patient has COVID-19. A process known as *triage* takes place when you<br>arrive at a hospital. They determine just how critical your case is, and<br>you are seen in the order of your criticality.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-31af4200a4154f1d08e90c1ee7804b9c){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-31af4200a4154f1d08e90c1ee7804b9c"<br>master_w="1000" master_h="547"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(From* [[*The<br>Conversation*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=37d016&url=https://theconversation.com/from-triage-to-discharge-a-users-guide-to-navigating-hospitals-54658){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="theconversation.com"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br>This is what determines when patients get seen. So it doesn't matter who<br>has what, what matters is where they fall on the criticality chart. The<br>highest category cases are seen first.<br><br>Now, what you may be actually hearing is the fact that *hospitals are<br>very busy*, and 30--40% of their cases may be COVID-19 cases. It is also<br>true that in some smaller regional hospitals (which were already running<br>at 80% of capacity under normal operating conditions), the surge of<br>COVID-19 cases may be causing them to run out of regular beds.<br><br>It is at that time that the hospital should be implementing its<br>emergency plans. Just as we did at the beginning of the COVID-19<br>pandemic, we should be converting sections of the hospital into ICU<br>space or COVID-19 space or triage space, depending on what is needed.<br><br>And if the hospital implements their emergency plans and they *still*<br>run out of space? They should be calling on the state for assistance.<br><br>For a hospital to overrun its total beds and allow any patients to be<br>turned away is a travesty of hospital administration, and a failure to<br>implement emergency plans in a timely manner. A hospital administrator<br>should lose his or her job over such a failure.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How can we support ER doctors in several states who say they\'re being<br>forced to refuse life-saving care to patients, as 30 to 40% beds are<br>tied up with COVID-19 cases?<br><br>\<br><br>*Feel free to comment, but if you think you're going to come into my<br>comments on my answers, pop off, and then block me, don't expect me to<br>keep your conversation around very long.*<br><br>*If you don't like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I'm wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is<br>a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you are simply<br>commenting to tell me "ackshually, you're wrong," don't be surprised if<br>I quietly delete your comment. Put anything vaguely harassing in there,<br>and your deletion will be followed by a block/mute, and a BNBR report. I<br>will do this immediately and with no compunction.*<br><br>*You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
