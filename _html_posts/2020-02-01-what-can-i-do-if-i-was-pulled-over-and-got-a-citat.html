<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What can I do if I was pulled over and got a citation for something I<br>didn\'t do? I was driving normally when suddenly a cop pulled me over<br>and told me I didn\'t stop at a stop sign. However, there was no stop<br>sign at all.**<br><br>Don't pay the ticket. Instead, go to court and argue that there was no<br>stop sign. Your ticket should have a court date, so go argue your case<br>to the judge.<br><br>Show photos of the road proving there was no sign. Make the state prove<br>you ran a sign and make them show you where it was and that it wasn't<br>obscured.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
