<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's take your questions one at a time:<br><br>> **Will I, a person born in China (but with U.S. citizenship) have<br>> trouble getting into USAFA, AFROTC, or OTS?**<br><br>As long as you are a US citizen, you are eligible to be appointed to<br>USAFA. You can also attend AFROTC, or OTS after your college graduation.<br><br>> Will I have a problem getting a senator\'s recommendation letter?<br><br>For USAFA admission, you need a *nomination*. Nominations come from<br>either a US Congressional representative, a US Senator, the Vice<br>President, or the President. You will need to work with the office of<br>your local representatives to the US Congress, but your country of birth<br>should not prevent you from securing a nomination.<br><br>> **Further, will I have trouble getting into certain career fields or<br>> ranks?**<br><br>You will have no trouble getting into any career field or achieving<br>rank. Ranks are granted based on demonstrated performance which occurs<br>once you start working.<br><br>As others have noted, security clearance will take a little longer to<br>process for you, as your country of birth is, understandably, a concern<br>for the military. They are going to want to ensure that your ties to<br>your country of birth do not constitute a risk to national security.<br>Your investigation may take a little longer, but it will not *prevent*<br>you from participating in any career fields.<br><br>For USAFA, make sure you check out the [[Academy<br>Admissions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60e33c&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} website to find<br>out what you need to do and when.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
