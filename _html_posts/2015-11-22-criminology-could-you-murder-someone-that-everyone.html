<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I think what you\'re talking about is the concept of<br>double jeopardy.\<br>\<br>Double jeopardy says that you cannot be tried twice for the same crime.<br>This was actually the subject of a movie, coincidentally called *Double<br>Jeopardy*.\<br>\<br>So to illustrate the concept, I\'ll give you the plot from the movie.<br>The wife (played by Ashley Judd) was falsely accused in the death of her<br>husband, who faked his death. She was tried and convicted for the<br>murder, even though no body was ever found. There was enough evidence to<br>send her to jail for the crime. While in prison, she learns the location<br>of her husband, who has taken up with a new family. Following her<br>release from prison, after serving her full sentence, she finds him and<br>murders him in the middle of a crowded street. She is arrested, but<br>cannot be tried for his murder since she was already tried, convicted,<br>and sentenced for the same murder.\<br>\<br>However, double jeopardy only attaches if it\'s the same person. If<br>*someone else* were to murder the husband, that person would then be<br>tried and convicted for the murder, even though the wife was already<br>tried and convicted for the murder. The new murder stands on its own<br>merit, despite a conviction for the same murder.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
