<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Trading in ivory is currently illegal, as is the<br>international sale of any new ivory products. However, there is a<br>thriving black market for ivory, and it is only getting worse.\<br>\<br>There have been calls to legalize ivory and to control the market, but<br>that has been met with skepticism.\<br>\<br>Simon Jenkins, the BBC journalist and author, [[wrote a<br>piece](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e9e011&url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/13/save-elephants-farm-them-ivory-tusks){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="theguardian.com"}]{.qlink_container} about how if we want to<br>save the elephants, we will have to control the market that poachers are<br>currently running rampant in. He claims the way to do this is to farm<br>elephants, much like cattle.\<br>\<br>However, Will Travers, President of the Born Free Foundation, [[wrote a<br>rebuttal](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ed5d1e&url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/02/farming-wont-save-elephants-simon-jenkins-ivory-trade){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="theguardian.com"}]{.qlink_container} that explains that the<br>economists that Mr. Bandow quoted are simply wrong, and that the trade<br>embargos have actually caused the elephant population to stabilize.\<br>\<br>Doug Bandow [[wrote a<br>piece](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=13f30d&url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/dougbandow/2013/01/21/when-you-ban-the-sale-of-ivory-you-ban-elephants/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="forbes.com"}]{.qlink_container} in Forbes magazine that<br>talks about the economics of legalizing the ivory trade. He points out<br>that economists still see a flourishing (and growing) poaching trade<br>which will eventually decimate the existing elephant population if<br>something is not done to control it:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> Many other wild animals face varying threats to their existence.<br>> However, the news is not always bad. In some cases markets have been<br>> the key to conservation. For instance, vicunas once were considered<br>> endangered but now, reported \[the Convention on the International<br>> Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)\], "are<br>> managed through captive breeding and non-lethal harvests from wild<br>> populations." Wild animals "are taken, shorn and released." The<br>> population increased 40-fold between 1965 and 2010. Similarly, "The<br>> legal trade in crocodiles is one of the success stories in CITES<br>> history which shows species recovery as a result of trade." In China<br>> "tigers are being farmed with the intention of supplying tiger parts<br>> in the future."\<br>> \<br>> \<br>> But today elephants are dying, many because of ivory prohibition.<br>> Economist Rasmus Heltberg observed: "One may find such black markets<br>> and the poaching that supplies them immoral, but ignoring their role<br>> by assuming them away may lead to misguided conservation policies."\<br>> \<br>> \<br>> CITES acknowledged the failure: "given the present rise in illegal<br>> killing of elephants in West, Central, and East Africa it is clear<br>> that current measures are not containing the present surge in the<br>> illegal trade in ivory." Western governments should stop insisting on<br>> doing more of the same, which guarantees failure. The only realistic<br>> alternative is to create a legal market for ivory and other elephant<br>> products.\<br>> \<br>> \<br>> In March CITES must decide whether it is better for elephants to be<br>> sacred and dead or commercial and alive. If elephants could talk, they<br>> almost certainly would prefer the second. So should the rest of us.\<br><br>\<br>I have to look at this objectively and say that there should be a legal<br>market, to save the elephants. African governments are ineffectual in<br>their ability to control poaching, and it is literally running rampant.<br>If the indigenous people who are proximate to the elephants already<br>could help to control the poachers by having a legal market themselves,<br>we could save the elephants. At this rate of poaching, however, they are<br>facing an extinction-level event within the next 20 years.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
