<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Police officers are indeed allowed to lie to suspects during<br>interrogations. About the only line that exists in police interrogation<br>is making threats. The police cannot threaten you with bodily harm, but<br>the line between an unlawful threat and a permitted police interrogation<br>tactic are far from clear.<br><br>Police often use the "[[Reid<br>technique](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=58766d&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_technique){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}" which is sometimes<br>colloquially referred to as "Good Cop/Bad Cop." While it is mostly<br>embellished by Hollywood, the Reid interrogation technique is<br>surprisingly effective at eliciting actual, lawful confessions, and has<br>been used for over 70 years.<br><br>> The Reid technique\'s nine steps of interrogation are:<br>><br>> 1.  Positive confrontation. Advise the suspect that the evidence has<br>>     led the police to the individual as a suspect. Offer the person an<br>>     early opportunity to explain why the offense took place.<br>> 2.  Try to shift the blame away from the suspect to some other person<br>>     or set of circumstances that prompted the suspect to commit the<br>>     crime. That is, develop themes containing reasons that will<br>>     psychologically justify or excuse the crime. Themes may be<br>>     developed or changed to find one to which the accused is most<br>>     responsive.<br>> 3.  Try to minimize the frequency of suspect denials.<br>> 4.  At this point, the accused will often give a reason why he or she<br>>     did not or could not commit the crime. Try to use this to move<br>>     towards the acknowledgement of what they did.<br>> 5.  Reinforce sincerity to ensure that the suspect is receptive.<br>> 6.  The suspect will become quieter and listen. Move the theme of the<br>>     discussion toward offering alternatives. If the suspect cries at<br>>     this point, infer guilt.<br>> 7.  Pose the \"alternative question\", giving two choices for what<br>>     happened; one more socially acceptable than the other. The suspect<br>>     is expected to choose the easier option but whichever alternative<br>>     the suspect chooses, guilt is admitted. There is always a third<br>>     option which is to maintain that they did not commit the crime.<br>> 8.  Lead the suspect to repeat the admission of guilt in front of<br>>     witnesses and develop corroborating information to establish the<br>>     validity of the confession.<br>> 9.  Document the suspect\'s admission or confession and have him or<br>>     her prepare a recorded statement (audio, video or<br>>     written).\[1\](#CZNlm){#cite-CZNlm .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-CZNlm){.citation_index} [[Reid technique -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=58766d&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_technique){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
