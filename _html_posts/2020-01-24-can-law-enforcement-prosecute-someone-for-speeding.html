<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can law enforcement prosecute someone for speeding with only a verbal<br>confession?**<br><br>First of all, law enforcement doesn't prosecute anyone. District<br>attorneys prosecute criminals.<br><br>Law enforcement collects evidence of a crime, and if the District<br>Attorney believes there is a case to be made, they prosecute the crime.<br><br>Finally, speeding, in most cases, isn't a "crime" but a traffic<br>infraction. You don't go to jail for speeding, in most cases. The<br>exceptions (where you would go to jail) are when your speed and your<br>driving rise to the level of "reckless endangerment," where you<br>recklessly put other peoples' lives in danger.<br><br>If there were other witnesses to your recklessness, and you confessed to<br>the speed, you could be prosecuted for reckless endangerment.<br><br>But just a confession? If I was a DA, I wouldn't prosecute that. I'd<br>need more evidence before moving forward, especially to support a charge<br>of reckless endangerment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
