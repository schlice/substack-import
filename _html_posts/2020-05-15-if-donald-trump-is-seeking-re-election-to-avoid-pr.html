<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If Donald Trump is seeking re-election to avoid prosecution, then 4<br>more years would do nothing but delay the SDNY proceedings, wouldn't<br>it?**<br><br>Correct. In fact, if they did file charges against the President and he<br>was ineligible to be prosecuted because he is literally in charge of<br>prosecutions, the statute of limitations would be *tolled* (or paused)<br>until he was no longer President, either through the natural expiration<br>of his term, or impeachment *and removal from office*.\*<br><br>So you're absolutely right, a second term would only delay the<br>prosecution; he would not escape it.<br><br>Makes you think he's probably not pursuing a second term to avoid<br>prosecution.<br><br>\* Most likely. No President has ever been indicted successfully while<br>still in office, so there is no precedent for such an action. However,<br>Constitutionally-speaking, it's most likely that a President cannot be<br>prosecuted while holding the office of President.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
