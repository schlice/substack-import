<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'd love to hear about a criminal case against Trump. I'd be curious<br>which state's attorney was ballsy enough to bring such a case. I suspect<br>that maybe New York might do it (they're pretty out-there), but I'd want<br>to know so I could prep the popcorn...<br><br>::: {.ui_qtext_gif_noclick_wrapper background-url="images/qimg-b615a8ee9c15e7fc58847478b6dc1f07" gif-embedded="images/qimg-b615a8ee9c15e7fc58847478b6dc1f07" is-playing="true" interactive="true"}<br>!(images/qimg-b615a8ee9c15e7fc58847478b6dc1f07){.qtext_image<br>style="max-width: 100%;"}<br>:::<br><br>::: {.ui_qtext_gif_noclick_wrapper background-url="images/qimg-c9ff3a37c0e5bc3a589c89909d4b429c" gif-embedded="images/qimg-c9ff3a37c0e5bc3a589c89909d4b429c" is-playing="true" interactive="true"}<br>!(images/qimg-c9ff3a37c0e5bc3a589c89909d4b429c){.qtext_image<br>style="max-width: 100%;"}<br>:::<br><br>But ultimately, you need to do something illegal first, and then you can<br>have charges brought against you.<br><br>And it can't just be some Democrat's *opinion* of what you did, it has<br>to be an actual law that you apparently broke. And there has to be<br>actual proof that points to you as the law-breaker.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>My husband doesn\'t want to hear about any criminal or civil cases<br>involving Donald Trump or any of his family, because he says there will<br>ultimately be no consequences. Do you agree w/ this assessment? Why or<br>why not?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
