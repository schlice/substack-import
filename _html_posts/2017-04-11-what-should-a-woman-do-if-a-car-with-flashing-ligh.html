<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I've already answered a question similar to this, but unfortunately I<br>don't think they are similar enough to merge:<br><br>[[Bill Stein\'s answer to Can I legally refuse to be pulled over if I<br>suspect (on reasonable grounds) he was a \'fake\' police<br>officer?](https://www.quora.com/Can-I-legally-refuse-to-be-pulled-over-if-I-suspect-on-reasonable-grounds-he-was-a-fake-police-officer/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Let me re-iterate the salient points:<br><br>1.  There is no legal provision in any state I know of that allows you<br>    to refuse to pull over, regardless of your reasoning. That means if<br>    you refuse to pull over, you can be charged with failing to stop.<br>    Any reason you may have for not stopping would be considered a<br>    defense to that charge.<br>2.  When you are illuminated by a car which you believe is not a real<br>    police officer, your first course of action would be to immediately<br>    get out your cell phone and call 911. Inform the dispatcher that<br>    there is a car behind you with red and blue lights but it doesn't<br>    look like a police officer. They will be able to tell you if it is a<br>    real police officer behind you. If the dispatcher tells you it is a<br>    real police officer, you must stop immediately. It's not up to<br>    you to determine whether or not the location is "safe" to stop. It's<br>    up to the officer to keep you safe during your traffic stop. There's<br>    no provision in the law to "second-guess" the officer's judgement on<br>    the location for the traffic stop. If you stop somewhere and<br>    something bad happens, it's on the officer, not on you.<br>3.  If you cannot call 911 because you don't have a cell phone or is not<br>    working, your only other viable option is to drive (safely, do not<br>    speed) to the nearest police station, and go inside. Tell the desk<br>    officer that there is a car following you and you are unsure whether<br>    or not it is a police officer. If it is, the officer will come<br>    inside and you will sort it all out together. If not, the car will<br>    likely drive away and you will be safe.<br><br>Failing to stop for any length of time beyond making a phone call to 911<br>is ill-advised.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
