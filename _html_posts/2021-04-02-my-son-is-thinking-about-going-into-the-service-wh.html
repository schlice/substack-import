What would be the<br>safest job for him where he could avoid combat?**<br><br>First, you need to understand the difference between *deployment* and<br>*combat*.<br><br>Not all military personnel are *front-line combat troops*, but<br>*any career field, legitimately, can deploy.*<br><br>Clearly, there are certain career fields who are seemingly deployed all<br>the time. Security Forces, Combat Controllers, and any career field<br>associated with work directly on the flight line (aircraft maintenance,<br>etc) deploy regularly.<br><br>But if you are in a worldwide-deployable unit, and you are deployable,<br>you deploy with your unit. There are only a scant few career fields<br>which are non-deployable, and they are usually in very niche fields or<br>short-term billets. But even those fields are slowly changing and are<br>deploying more regularly. The only field which is not compelled to<br>deploy is government civilians who work at military bases. They can<br>voluntarily deploy, but unless you signed up for a position which can be<br>deployed, they will provide the consistency at the base while the<br>military teams deploy.<br><br>But *deploying* is worlds different from seeing *actual combat.*<br><br>There are many career fields which will never use the firearms training<br>they got in Basic Training outside of Basic Training. Support staff at<br>bases and posts outnumber the actual front-line fighters, and those<br>folks will not see combat unless combat comes to them at their base.<br><br>There are even some career fields which have combat specialty units<br>within them. For example, I was a Communications officer, and we have a<br>specialty unit called *Combat Comm* which was a highly deployable front<br>line unit.<br><br>So unless you choose a career field which is actually a front-line<br>combat field, you will still deploy, but you'll do the same job you did<br>stateside, just overseas.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
