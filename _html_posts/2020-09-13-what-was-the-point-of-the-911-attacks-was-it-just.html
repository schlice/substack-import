<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What was the point of the 9/11 attacks? Was it just a murder suicide?<br>I honestly don't really know because I wasn't alive during that time.<br>RIP to all the victims of the attacks and the family's that have<br>suffered.**<br><br>I remember precisely where I was standing when I watched the second<br>plane hit the south tower. We all watched it live.<br><br>While the north tower was on fire, we were all collectively thinking,<br>"this could have been an accident. This could have been a really tragic<br>accident. I know airline traffic over Manhattan is tightly controlled,<br>but this could have been a tragic accident...right?"<br><br>Then, the second plane hit.<br><br>As we watched, our minds made that collective leap from "this could have<br>been an accident" to "this was clearly deliberate." And as the news<br>continued to pour in, we became increasingly certain that it was,<br>indeed, a deliberate attack against the United States.<br><br>For those of us who watched it, we know precisely why.<br><br>But there is now an entire generation of adults who were not alive when<br>the attack happened.<br><br>Take literally five minutes out of your day and watch this video. You<br>will be glad you did. It speaks to people exactly like you, who were not<br>even alive when the attack happened.<br><br>[https://youtu.be/QGXrZsX_1fU(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7a5787&url=https://youtu.be/QGXrZsX_1fU){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
