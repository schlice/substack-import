<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: *[In General:{.underline}*\<br>\<br>People are tried and convicted following the law in place at the time.<br>If the law changes, the conviction still stands.\<br>\<br>For example, let\'s say that you\'re tried and convicted under a certain<br>law, and then while you\'re incarcerated, they change the law and make<br>that act legal. Should your conviction be thrown out? Since you were<br>convicted under the law that was in place at the time, your conviction<br>stands. You might fight with your lawyer to be re-tried, but double<br>jeopardy applies, and you can\'t be tried again for a crime for which<br>you\'ve already been convicted, even if the law changes.\<br>\<br>The relevant law is the *ex post facto* rule, and it is in the<br>Constitution (Article 1, Section 9, Clause 3). It basically states that<br>the Federal (or State) governemnt cannot retroactively change the legal<br>consequences of actions that were committed before the enactment of the<br>law.\<br>\<br>However, this is the opposite of an *ex post facto* law because it<br>decriminalizes certain behavior. This is more a form of an amnesty<br>law, and is an exception to the *ex post facto* law, and is generally<br>called *in mitius* (literally: to make mild). This is technically<br>legal, but it frowned upon in general. Under the principle of the<br>amnesty law, the new punishment would now apply, and the convict should<br>now be convicted to life in prison with no parole.\<br>\<br>*The NE Case In Specific:{.underline}*\<br>\<br>In the Nebraska case, there are a few things going on.\<br>\<br>]<br><br>- The law was passed with a 90-day implementation period to allow for<br>  legal challenges to it, which are pending. Executions can proceed<br>  during that 90-days. Nebraska\'s referendum process allows for<br>  citizens to suspend the implementation of a law if they can gather<br>  enough signatures (10% of the voting population) within 90 days of the<br>  law\'s passage.\<br>- The supplies for the 10 executions have already been purchased and are<br>  being shipped, and the governor said he wasn\'t going to cancel that<br>  order.\<br>- Opponents of the change note that the Nebraska constitution requires<br>  that the Board of Pardons has the sole authority to change final<br>  sentences, therefore the law is unconstitutional. The AG\'s office<br>  cites a portion of the law which reads, \"It is the intent of the<br>  Legislature that in any criminal proceeding in which the death penalty<br>  has been imposed but not carried out prior to the effective date of<br>  this act, such penalty shall be changed to life imprisonment.\" The<br>  AG\'s office says that this wording is unconstitutional.\<br>- Supporters say that the law isn\'t changing the sentences. It\'s<br>  simply removing the death penalty as a punishment, so the state will<br>  have no way to carry out the sentences of the 10 people on death row.<br>  Legislators note that \"intent language\" is not law, and doesn\'t<br>  carry the force of law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
