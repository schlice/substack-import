<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I re-read this which I also read (and commented) when you posted it<br>previously. I also read the conversation you had with<br>[BP(https://www.quora.com/profile/BP-397)]{.qlink_container} regarding<br>hiring practices at jails, and my first thought was, "Sheesh, I'm glad<br>that our CJC (Criminal Justice Center) uses real deputies, not 'cop<br>wannabes that couldn't make the cut with the PD\...\.'"<br><br>But then I thought, *but wait just a sec, your first assignment out of<br>the Sheriff's Academy, even before patrol, is CJC. Granted, it's not the<br>blind leading the blind, as there are many very good, well-qualified<br>deputies who run the show over there, but are we making the same<br>mistakes as some others do, but in a different form, by putting rookie<br>deputies in the jail?* I like to think that we're not because they are<br>supervised by some very good senior deputies, and my experience has been<br>nothing but stellar in there (as I previously detailed in my other<br>comment), but I can't help but wonder if we are setting ourselves up for<br>failure with this practice.<br><br>Re-reading this made me re-think my previous position. I'm going to do a<br>little research on this. Thanks for planting that seed again. Hopefully<br>this helps someone else who might be able to influence practices at a<br>jail do something a little bit better in the future.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/At-what-moment-in-your-life-did-you-witness-true-evil/answer/Christin-Taggart<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
