<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think the form you are looking for is the DD-214, which is your<br>discharge letter from the military. It shows the dates of service, how<br>long you served on active duty, what station you separated from, what<br>was your characterization of separation (usually honorable), under what<br>rule you separated (usually completion of active duty service), and then<br>lists all of your "Awards and Decs" or all of your medals and<br>decorations. It does not show a chronological history of every duty<br>station you ever served at. You can retrieve all of those records<br>(including the DD-214) from the National Personnel Records Center<br>(NPRC), part of the National Archives.<br><br>If he separated or retired before October 1, 2004, his records will be<br>at the NPRC. If he separated after that, his records will still be at<br>the Air Force Personnel Center, and you can submit a records request as<br>next-of-kin to them.<br><br>But for NPRC records, you can use the<br>[eVetRecs(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=11bb67&url=https://vetrecs.archives.gov/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="archives.gov"}]{.qlink_container} system from the National<br>Archives to generate the records request. You will still need to mail or<br>fax the form to the NPRC. The eVetRecs site will help you with what to<br>do with the form.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How can I get a copy of things like my dad\'s WW2 DD14? He was a B-17<br>pilot in the 8th Air Force, and I remember seeing records of his bombing<br>missions and medals, but I don\'t remember what it was that he showed me<br>before he died in 1991.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
