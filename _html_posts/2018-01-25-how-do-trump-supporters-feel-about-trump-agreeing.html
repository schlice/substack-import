<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So long as this "path to citizenship" is only for DREAMers, I'm okay<br>with it. DREAMers are the DREAM Act children, children of undocumented<br>immigrants who were brought to this country illegally by their parents.<br><br>DREAMers didn't violate the law on their own. Their parents did. So<br>offering them an opportunity to become citizens is something I would<br>find acceptable.<br><br>I would oppose a path to citizenship for their parents. I would oppose a<br>path to citizenship for any other category of illegal alien.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
