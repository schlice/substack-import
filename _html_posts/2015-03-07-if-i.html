<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It depends a lot on jurisdiction, but most states have<br>some form of [[castle<br>doctrine](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=577621&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_doctrine){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. The \"castle doctrine\"<br>is termed from the old saying, \"a man\'s home is his castle,\" meaning<br>that a resident should feel ultimately safe and secure within the<br>confines of his home. And he should feel utterly justified in defending<br>his home with force against those who wish to do him harm, up to and<br>including deadly force.\<br>\<br>You will need to research the laws in your particular jurisdiction<br>concerning whether or not your home is in an area where a castle<br>doctrine is enforced.\<br>\<br>There have been occasions where the police have entered the wrong house.<br>The intersection of \"no-knock warrants\" and the \"castle doctrine\" is<br>a very violent intersection, to be sure. Assuming it\'s not a \"no-knock<br>warrant,\" the police will be very vocal in announcing who they are and<br>the fact that they have a search warrant, as they bash through your<br>front door.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
