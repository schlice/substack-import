Why aren't<br>conservatives outraged by this?**<br><br>What exactly do you think the Russians did during the last election that<br>was so dangerous?<br><br>- Did it affect vote totals?<br>- Did it prevent people from voting?<br><br>So understanding that Russians did nothing more than what they normally<br>do every day, just like we do, what exactly do you think we should be<br>"preventing?"<br><br>If you can come up with something that we can actually prevent, then<br>perhaps we can work to prevent it. But saying that the Russians "did<br>cyberattacks" and will do it again is like saying, "I breathed air<br>yesterday and will probably do it again tomorrow."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
