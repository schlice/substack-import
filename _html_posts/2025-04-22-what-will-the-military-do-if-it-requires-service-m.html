<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Under current DOD regulations (which match the Commander in Chief's<br>orders), servicemembers will serve as the sex listed on their original<br>birth certificate, and if the certificate does not exist or if the<br>servicemember disagrees with what is listed on their birth certificate,<br>the sex indicated by scientific analysis will be used.<br><br>To conduct a scientific analysis, doctors will use chromosomal analysis<br>to determine if the presence or absence of the Y chromosome matches the<br>expression of the external genitalia. If the genitalia matches the<br>presence/absence of the Y chromosome, the military will use that<br>determination to establish a biological sex.<br><br>Whether that matches the servicemember's *understanding* of their own<br>sex is irrelevant. If their external sex organs show them as male, and<br>they have a Y chromosome in enough abundance to conclusively classify<br>them as male, then they are considered male and if they serve, will<br>serve as male, even if they believe they are female.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
