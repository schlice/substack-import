<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [As always, the true answer is \"it depends.\" The patient<br/>and his/her doctor will need to evaluate the specific circumstances in<br/>order to determine the best course of treatment. It depends on the age<br/>and general overall and neurological health of the patient, the degree<br/>of advancement of the MS, as well as the type of MS the patient has. If<br/>the person is older and the MS is not exceedingly advanced, assuming the<br/>patient has RRMS, the patient and his/her doctor may choose to do<br/>nothing and simply allow the disease to progress, and deal with the<br/>relapses as they occur. Medication is certainly an option; however, in<br/>most cases, there isn\'t a surgery that is helpful.]<br/><br/>*Disclaimer:*<br/><br/>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br/>substitute for professional medical advice.
