<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Congress gets to set the rules of conduct for their own members. And<br>they do have both conduct rules and an ethics committee.<br><br>But what did this particular congressman do that you believe "breaks<br>their oath" to "protect and uphold the Constitution?"<br><br>And anyone can "give a congressman a dishonorable discharge." We have<br>the power to do that. It's called the voting booth. If you don't<br>like how a congressman is acting, or what he is doing, you have the<br>power to remove him from office. The trick, of course, is convincing<br>enough of your fellow constituents that he also needs to not be<br>re-elected.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
