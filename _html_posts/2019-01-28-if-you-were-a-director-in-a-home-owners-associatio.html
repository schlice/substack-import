<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you were a director in a Home owners Association (HOA) and there<br>was a complaint that a member\'s flag pole exceeded the rules how could<br>you with just a tape measure determine the height without climbing the<br>flag pole?**<br><br>Note, you will need to do this on a sunny day.<br><br>1.  Measure the length of the pole's shadow on the ground, record in<br>    inches. Then measure the length of your own shadow on the ground,<br>    also recorded in inches. You can also measure the height of<br>    something nearby along with the length of its shadow, if it's more<br>    convenient to do so (like a fencepost).<br>2.  Divide the nearby object's (or your) actual height (in inches) by<br>    the length of the shadow.<br>3.  Multiply the answer from step 2 by the length of the pole's shadow.<br>    This will be the height of the pole, in inches.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
