<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(US answer)*<br><br>Individuals can only remain incarcerated for no more than 72 hours<br>without being charged. That means that the district attorney must charge<br>the person within 72 hours or they must be released.<br><br>If it has been more than 72 hours and the person is still in jail and<br>formal charges have not been filed, that person's lawyer can go before a<br>judge and get a *writ of habeas corpus*, which instructs the police to<br>bring the person in front of a judge so the judge can decide if the<br>person is being lawfully held in jail.<br><br>If the person *has* been charged, it's because the district attorney<br>believes there is enough evidence that a crime has been committed. Save<br>your video for trial. Give it to the person's attorney.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
