<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Are MS and GERD related? Can gerd be a side effect of MS?<br><br>MS is an autoimmune disorder which affects nerve fibers in the central<br>nervous system. Symptoms typically include balance, bowel/bladder<br>issues, gait, and sometimes swallowing.<br><br>GERD (Gastroesophegeal reflux disease) is an issue where the lower<br>esophageal sphincter does not properly close or leaks, allowing frequent<br>stomach acid back into the esophagus.<br><br>MS does not affect autonomic musculature like the heart, or the<br>esophageal sphincters. For that reason, MS cannot be a direct cause of<br>GERD.<br><br>However, MS medications, especially some of our early oral medications,<br>may indeed cause GI side effects. Acid reflux could be a side effect of<br>MS medication.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
