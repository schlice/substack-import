<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I am a big fan of reducing the cost to government for any<br>service. In this case, however, providing a police force is one of the<br>actual jobs that government (in the US, under the Constitution) is<br>actually supposed to provide. So based on that alone, I don\'t think<br>governments ought to outsource police services.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
