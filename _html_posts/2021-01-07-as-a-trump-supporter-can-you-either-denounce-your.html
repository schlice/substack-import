<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**As a Trump supporter, can you either denounce your support for Trump<br>or admit that his supporters are actually domestic terrorists and<br>unpatriotic Americans after the insurgent attack on our US Capitol?**<br><br>No, I will do none of those things.<br><br>What I will do is state that *whoever those individuals were* *who<br>violently stormed the Capitol were criminals.* Whether or not they were<br>actually Trump supporters is still undecided, and I'll reserve my<br>judgement until I see the police reports myself.<br><br>I will also say that Trump's speech yesterday morning, at the very<br>least, was poorly executed. At the very worst, it amounted to conduct<br>unbecoming a president. Whether or not it was impeachable is a<br>discussion best left to Congress to decide. But it was best described as<br>the whiny, petulant ramblings of a spoiled child who didn't get his way.<br>Trump definitely deserves to be censured for that speech, and if<br>Congress feels so inclined, impeached.<br><br>None of this is indicative of Trump supporters *in general*. The only<br>judgement we can cast is on the small number of violent rioters who were<br>present at the Capitol building.<br><br>Casting that judgement across all Trump supporters is lazy thinking. No<br>one in their right minds would condone the actions of those violent<br>rioters.<br><br>But don't you find it *just the least bit ironic* that if this incident<br>had taken place just a few months ago, we would have been calling them<br>"mostly peaceful protesters?"<br><br>[[Only Some Kinds of Protest Are Always 'Mostly Peaceful' \| National<br>Review](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b5b627&url=https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/only-some-kinds-of-protest-are-always-mostly-peaceful/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalreview.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>But because they happened to be wrapped in Trump flags and wearing MAGA<br>hats, they are suddenly "domestic terrorists" and "unpatriotic<br>Americans?"<br><br>Please don't bother trying to explain away the differences between what<br>happened yesterday and the violence that the media spent months<br>proclaiming was "mostly peaceful protesting." I don't look at the<br>"mostly peaceful protesters" and paint all Democrats like that. Don't do<br>the same with me.<br><br>I'm not going to condone the actions of a few (including the president),<br>nor will I paint the entire group with that broad brush.<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance<br>for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough<br>shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion<br>masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your<br>own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.<br>If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"<br>don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything<br>vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a<br>block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
