<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**You don't drive a car with the intention of being in a accident so why<br>do people say you shouldn't have sex if you don't want to get pregnant.?<br>Accidents happen.**<br><br>TL;DR: because sex is designed to cause pregnancy.<br><br>Longer answer: you do drive a car with the intention of going from one<br>place to another (or perhaps going somewhere and coming back to the same<br>place). But always, you drive a car with the intention of going<br>someplace.<br><br>Have you ever known anyone to get out of a car and say, "Hey! I never<br>consented to traveling in a car! I never consented to going from one<br>place to another!" Of course not, because getting in a car implies going<br>from one place to another, ***because that's what cars were designed<br>for.*** Sure, cars are fun, and sure, the risk of accidents is there,<br>but you got into a car because you wanted/needed to go somewhere.<br><br>Now that we've framed your example correctly, let's apply it to sex.<br>Physiologically, the purpose of sex is procreation. There are only two<br>animal species who engage in sex for pleasure: humans and dolphins<br>(based on scientific observations of dolphins copulating year-round even<br>though females are only fertile for a few months of the<br>year).\[1\](#uiHgx){#cite-uiHgx .citation_link} This suggests that sex<br>for pleasure, as far as physiology goes, is a *side-effect* of sex, or<br>something intended to trigger a *desire* for sex, but ultimately it<br>serves the same purpose: to encourage the participants to procreate.<br><br>Just as you can't voluntarily enter a car and not consent to traveling<br>from one place to another, you can't voluntarily consent to sex and not<br>consent to the primary purpose of sex: *procreation*. Actively avoiding<br>procreation may be one thing, but as we know, no birth control is 100%<br>effective. Nature is very good at accomplishing its goals, and despite<br>our best efforts at working around nature's goals, nature always seems<br>to manage to find a way.<br><br>Calling it an "accident" is like saying you drove a car and<br>"accidentally" ended up in a different place than when you first got in<br>the car. It's not an accident. It's intentional. So when you call<br>pregnancy an "accident," you're missing the point because you're not<br>framing the discussion correctly. It's only an accident because it<br>wasn't *your* intention. It's always *sex's* intention though: to make<br>babies. That means that every time you have sex, you consent to making<br>babies. You may try to not have a baby, but like I said, nature always<br>manages to find a way. But that's what you signed up for when you<br>engaged in a behavior designed to make babies. While you can try to not<br>make a baby, you cannot absolve yourself of the responsibility of your<br>actions when you engaged in that activity in the first place.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-uiHgx){.citation_index} [[Dolphins' complex clitorises are<br>the key to understanding their sex<br>lives](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ba90bb&url=https://qz.com/1589590/dolphin-clitorises-suggest-the-animals-have-sex-for-pleasure/%23:~:text%3DThere's%2520an%2520oft%252Dcited%2520factoid,few%2520months%2520of%2520the%2520year.){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="qz.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
