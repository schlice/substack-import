<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why do gun control advocates insist on forcing private sellers to go<br>through a licensed firearm dealer to conduct a background check? Why not<br>allow private sellers the ability to run background checks on potential<br>buyers themselves?**<br><br>The answer, as always, is money.<br><br>An instantaneous system like NICS which allows any citizen to run<br>background checks would not only be massive, but it would be expensive.<br>When NICS was implemented, this was the compromise made, because forcing<br>everyone to use NICS would mean that it would have been prohibitively<br>costly at the time it was implemented.<br><br>Therefore, the idea that background checks were only needed from gun<br>dealers, and private transactions did not need them was introduced, and<br>the NICS system was scaled to allow for only licensed dealers to use it.<br><br>The second problem is the "default allow" problem. If a NICS answer does<br>not return in three days, the sale defaults to allow. This is to prevent<br>another potential problem: the government inducing a *de facto* gun ban<br>simply by crashing the system. Using the default allow process, if the<br>government does not do its due diligence and prohibit a sale within<br>three days, the sale defaults to allow. If we simply open up NICS to<br>everyone, and it can't handle the volume of requests, some transactions<br>which should be prevented could default to allow simply because the<br>system can't handle the volume.<br><br>Finally, while I mostly trust FFLs to not abuse NICS, it's entirely<br>possible that people could use NICS for purposes other than selling<br>guns. Want to check up on your daughter's new boyfriend? Run a NICS<br>search! If he can't buy a gun, he's either a felon, a mental defective,<br>or something else that's serious enough to prevent a gun sale, so he's<br>also not good enough for dear old daughter. Abuse of the system would be<br>rife.<br><br>We need a new system. Opening NICS up to the world is a bad idea all<br>around.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
