<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why is it illegal to drive a vehicle without insurance?<br><br>Because the state owns the roads, and the state gets to determine who<br>gets to use those roads and under what conditions.<br><br>- The state mandates that you have a driver's license.<br>- The state mandates that your car be registered.<br>- The state mandates that you carry, at a minimum, bodily injury and<br>  property damage insurance if you cause damage to other people and/or<br>  other things (though some states require more).<br>  - The exception to this: some states may not require you to carry<br>    insurance. Those states could require you to put up a cash bond in<br>    lieu of insurance, or show that you have enough money to cover any<br>    injuries you may cause. However, this is most definitely the<br>    exception rather than the rule (something like three states allow<br>    this). The vast majority of states require you to carry commercial<br>    insurance.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
