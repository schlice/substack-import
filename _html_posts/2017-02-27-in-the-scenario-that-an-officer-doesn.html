<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Your question is convoluted, but it is like many other questions on<br>Quora looking for that *magic bullet* that you can show that the officer<br>didn't do that will get you off scot-free.<br><br>Unlike the movies and TV, the police do not read you your Miranda rights<br>statement when you are arrested. You are only read your rights and asked<br>to sign a Miranda statement *when you are being questioned*. The officer<br>at the scene is under no obligation to read you your Miranda rights<br>unless he has to ask you questions besides basic identity questions,<br>which you are generally required to give (truthfully) under law.<br><br>If your rights were not read to you, it's probably because you were not<br>being interrogated.<br><br>Work this out with your lawyer. Make sure your lawyer knows everything<br>that happened, when it happened, and what was said. If there was an<br>error, your lawyer will help you sort it out.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
