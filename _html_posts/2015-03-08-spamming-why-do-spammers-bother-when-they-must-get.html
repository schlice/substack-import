<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Spammers are all about volume. Clickthrough from their ad<br>campaigns is very very low. Clickthrough is the term which describes<br>when a user clicks on a link in a spam message.\<br>\<br>Since clickthrough is so low, they rely on volume. Even that one spam<br>message that makes it on to social media might generate a clickthrough,<br>even though they get kicked off of that site quickly. For that one spam<br>account, they have 50 more doing the same thing, and not all of them are<br>identified quite as quickly.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
