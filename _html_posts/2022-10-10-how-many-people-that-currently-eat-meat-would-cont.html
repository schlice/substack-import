<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Have you ever been hungry?<br><br>And I don't mean "I skipped breakfast" hungry. I mean "go a week without<br>really eating anything" hungry. You're not just hungry, you're<br>*huuuuuungry.*<br><br>If not, you can't realistically answer this question, especially if the<br>thought of cleaning an animal squicks you out.<br><br>Because even if you're squicky about cleaning an animal, that<br>squickiness goes away *really, really fast* when you're huuuuuungry.<br><br>We got to experience this in the military. It's part of survival<br>training. Part of the training is, literally, becoming huuuuuungry.<br><br>I had always wondered whether or not I'd be squicky about cleaning an<br>animal. But when I was *huuuuuungry,* I killed, skinned, gutted, and<br>cooked a whole rabbit, and I ate the eyeball (apparently it's a cool<br>thing in the military).<br><br>Did you ever eat a worm as a kid? Did you ever think to eat a worm as an<br>adult? When you're *huuuuuungry,* you slurp them down like spaghetti<br>(hint: don't bother chewing them).<br><br>Did you ever eat a grasshopper? if you happen to have a fire, they come<br>out crispy and actually tasty (but I was *huuuuuungry*, so everything<br>was tasty).<br><br>TL;DR: **A lot of your food aversions go away really quickly when you<br>are hungry.**<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How many people that currently eat meat would continue to do so if they<br>had to personally raise, kill, disembowel, skin, and cut up the animal<br>every time they ate meat?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
