<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there any reason (besides a criminal act perpetrated while sitting<br>on the bench) that a Supreme Court Justice would be removed? Has anyone<br>ever been removed for cause from the Supreme Court?**<br><br>Let's start with the second question first. Only one US Supreme Court<br>justice has ever been impeached: Samuel Chase in 1804. Justice Chase was<br>acquitted by the Senate. Therefore, the answer is no, no Justice has<br>ever been removed from the Supreme Court through the impeachment<br>process.<br><br>The Constitution says that Supreme Court justices "shall hold their<br>offices during good behavior." This language, along with the "high<br>crimes and misdemeanors" language used for impeachment of Presidents, is<br>intentionally vague. It allows for interpretation by Congress, even<br>though the "accepted" definition of an impeachable offense is something<br>that you could be convicted of in court.<br><br>However, President (then Representative) Gerald R. Ford said in the<br>House on 15 Apr 1970, in comments surrounding possible impeachment of<br>Justice William O. Douglas: "\A<br> impeachable offense is whatever a<br>majority of the House of Representatives considers \it\ to be at a<br>given moment in history; conviction results from whatever offense or<br>offenses two-thirds of the other body considers to be sufficiently<br>serious to require removal of the accused from office."<br><br>So to answer the first question: A Supreme Court Justice may be<br>impeached if the House deems that the Justice has committed an<br>impeachable offense. That Justice can then be removed from office if 2/3<br>of the Senate believes that the offense was sufficiently serious as to<br>require his or her removal from office.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
