In this sense, police officers have far more<br>authority to prosecute crimes against the state than CBP agents.<br><br>However, if we're talking *Constitutionally*, at border crossings,<br>CBP can conduct searches which would otherwise violate the 4th Amendment<br>(i.e. they can search vehicles and contents of vehicles without a<br>warrant, or even probable cause). Federal law also allows them to<br>operate in the "Border Zone," anywhere up to 100 miles inland from any<br>US "external boundary." Away from the border, CBP is technically<br>required to have a warrant or probable cause that an immigration<br>violation has taken place before they can conduct a border search, but<br>this is both not well understood and frequently broken.
