<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you agree with the Republicans talking about leaving the Republican<br>party (and possibly starting a new one) because Mitch McConnell called<br>Biden president elect?**<br><br>I am a conservative and I *fully support* any member of Congress who<br>wishes to leave the Republican party to go and do so and to go start<br>their own party, simply because someone used a term of description they<br>don't like. That tends to say more about *them* than it does about *us.*<br><br>If that's the hill they want to die on (and subsequently destroy the<br>remainder of the original GOP), by all means, go ahead.<br><br>The New Republican Party will be dedicated to originalist, conservative<br>values only. Anyone else can stay away. Let's no longer dilute the New<br>Republican party with RINOs. That's right, the likes of Olympia Snowe,<br>Mitt Romney, and Susan Collins will not be welcome.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
