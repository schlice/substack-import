<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What happens to your body when you have multiple sclerosis?<br><br>The answer is, a lot.<br><br>MS is an autoimmune disease which causes the immune system to attack the<br>CNS. White blood cells cross the blood-brain barrier and attack the<br>myelin sheath surrounding nerve fibers, leaving scars (or scleroses).<br>This is where the name comes from: multiple sclerosis, or "many scars."<br>Signals from the brain to the peripheral nervous system (the autonomic<br>nervous system remains unaffected) are degraded as they pass through the<br>areas of *demyelination* and arrive altered at their destination. This<br>is what causes the various symptoms of the disease.<br><br>As far as the symptoms, there are many and they are varied. No two<br>people experience MS in the same way. Even people who experience the<br>same symptom experience it in different ways. Also, the timing of<br>relapses (for Relapsing-Remitting MS), the duration of relapses, and the<br>amount of time between relapses varies between patients. So saying<br>exactly what will happen to any one person diagnosed with MS is<br>impossible. What we can do is say what the most common symptoms of the<br>disease are, and what are less common symptoms.<br><br>> More common symptoms<br>><br>> - Fatigue<br>><br>> Occurs in about 80% of people, can significantly interfere with the<br>> ability to function at home and work, and may be the most prominent<br>> symptom in a person who otherwise has minimal activity limitations.<br>><br>> - Walking (Gait) Difficulties<br>><br>> Related to several factors including weakness, spasticity, loss of<br>> balance, sensory deficit and fatigue, and can be helped by physical<br>> therapy, assistive therapy and medications.<br>><br>> - Numbness or Tingling<br>><br>> Numbness of the face, body, or extremities (arms and legs) is often<br>> the first symptom experienced by those eventually diagnosed as having<br>> MS.<br>><br>> - Spasticity<br>><br>> Refers to feelings of stiffness and a wide range of involuntary muscle<br>> spasms; can occur in any limb, but it is much more common in the legs.<br>><br>> - Weakness<br>><br>> Weakness in MS, which results from deconditioning of unused muscles or<br>> damage to nerves that stimulate muscles, can be managed with<br>> rehabilitation strategies and the use of mobility aids and other<br>> assistive devices.<br>><br>> - Vision Problems<br>><br>> The first symptom of MS for many people. Onset of blurred vision, poor<br>> contrast or color vision, and pain on eye movement can be frightening<br>> --- and should be evaluated promptly.<br>><br>> - Dizziness and Vertigo<br>><br>> People with MS may feel off balance or lightheaded, or --- much less<br>> often --- have the sensation that they or their surroundings are<br>> spinning (vertigo).<br>><br>> - Bladder Problems<br>><br>> Bladder dysfunction, which occurs in at least 80% of people with MS,<br>> can usually be managed quite successfully with medications, fluid<br>> management, and intermittent self-catheterization.<br>><br>> - Sexual Problems<br>><br>> Very common in the general population including people with MS. Sexual<br>> responses can be affected by damage in the central nervous system, as<br>> well by symptoms such as fatigue and spasticity, and by psychological<br>> factors.<br>><br>> - Bowel Problems<br>><br>> Constipation is a particular concern among people with MS, as is loss<br>> of control of the bowels. Bowel issues can typically be managed<br>> through diet, adequate fluid intake, physical activity and medication.<br>><br>> - Pain & Itching<br>><br>> Pain syndromes are common in MS. In one study, 55% of people with MS<br>> had \"clinically significant pain\" at some time, and almost half had<br>> chronic pain.<br>><br>> - Cognitive Changes<br>><br>> Refers to a range of high-level brain functions affected in more than<br>> 50% of people with MS, including the ability to process incoming<br>> information, learn and remember new information, organize and<br>> problem-solve, focus attention and accurately perceive the<br>> environment.<br>><br>> - Emotional Changes<br>><br>> Can be a reaction to the stresses of living with MS as well as the<br>> result of neurologic and immune changes. Significant depression, mood<br>> swings, irritability, and episodes of uncontrollable laughing and<br>> crying pose significant challenges for people with MS and their<br>> families.<br>><br>> - Depression<br>><br>> Studies have suggested that clinical depression --- the severest form<br>> of depression --- is among the most common symptoms of MS. It is more<br>> common among people with MS than it is in the general population or in<br>> persons with many other chronic, disabling conditions.<br>><br>> Less common symptoms<br>><br>> - Speech Problems<br>><br>> Speech problems, including slurring (dysarthria) and loss of volume<br>> (dysphonia) occur in approximately 25-40% of people with MS,<br>> particularly later in the disease course and during periods of extreme<br>> fatigue. Stuttering is occasionally reported as well.<br>><br>> - Swallowing Problems<br>><br>> Swallowing problems --- referred to as dysphagia --- result from<br>> damage to the nerves controlling the many small muscles in the mouth<br>> and throat.<br>><br>> - Tremor<br>><br>> Tremor, or uncontrollable shaking, can occur in various parts of the<br>> body because of damaged areas along the complex nerve pathways that<br>> are responsible for coordination of movements.<br>><br>> - Seizures<br>><br>> Seizures --- which are the result of abnormal electrical discharges in<br>> an injured or scarred area of the brain --- have been estimated to<br>> occur in 2-5% people with MS, compared to the estimated 3% of the<br>> general population.<br>><br>> - Breathing Problems<br>><br>> Respiration problems occur in people whose chest muscles have been<br>> severely weakened by damage to the nerves that control those muscles.<br>><br>> - Hearing Loss<br>><br>> About 6% of people who have MS complain of impaired hearing. In very<br>> rare cases, hearing loss has been reported as the first symptom of the<br>> disease.<br>><br>> Secondary and tertiary symptoms<br>><br>> While the primary symptoms described above (more and less common) are<br>> the direct result of damage to the myelin and nerve fibers in the<br>> central nervous system (CNS), the *secondary symptoms* are the<br>> complications that can arise as a result of these primary symptoms.<br>> For example:<br>><br>> - Bladder dysfunction can cause repeated urinary tract infections.<br>> - Inactivity can cause loss of muscle tone, weakness (not related to<br>>   demyelination), poor posture, decreased bone density (increased risk<br>>   of fracture) and shallow, inefficient breathing.<br>> - Immobility can cause pressure sores.<br>><br>> While secondary symptoms can be treated, the optimal goal is to avoid<br>> them by treating the primary symptoms.<br>><br>> *Tertiary symptoms* result from the impact of the disease on your<br>> life. These symptoms include social, vocational and psychological<br>> complications. For example, if you are no longer able to drive or<br>> walk, you may not be able to hold down your usual job. The stress and<br>> strain of dealing with MS often alters social networks and sometimes<br>> fractures relationships. Problems with bladder control, tremor or<br>> swallowing may cause people to withdraw from social interactions and<br>> become isolated.<br>><br>> *Depression* is very common in people with MS. Depression may be both<br>> a primary and a tertiary symptom as it can be caused by the disease<br>> process itself and/or triggered by the challenges discussed<br>> above.\[1\](#EDKyr){#cite-EDKyr .citation_link}<br><br>As you can see, what happens to your body in MS is quite extensive.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-EDKyr){.citation_index} [[MS<br>Symptoms](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=59aaf4&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
