<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If the HOA was formed after you purchased your house, you cannot be<br>compelled to join it. The only way to make the HOA mandatory is to get<br>100% of the homeowners to agree. Normally, this is accomplished by the<br>developer, before the houses are sold, since the developer controls all<br>the lots at that time.<br><br>If you are not subject to the HOA because you never joined it, you can<br>tell them to go kick rocks. You don't pay dues to them so they can't<br>fine you. They have no control over your property. They cannot place a<br>lien on your property for failing to pay their fines.<br><br>They could try to sue you, but they'd lose badly.<br><br>Just ignore them. Let them make the first move. But make sure you know<br>which lawyer you're going to call if they do try any legal shenanigans.<br><br>(EDIT) In actuality, there is a process by which a mandatory HOA can be<br>formed after you buy your house, but it is a long process, it is not<br>cheap, and where it has happened, the homeowners who did not vote for it<br>(and actually campaigned against it) have won temporary injunctions from<br>enforcement activities by the newly-formed mandatory HOA.<br><br>For example, in Texas, you need a minimum of three homeowners to form a<br>property owner's association which encompasses all of the properties in<br>a given subdivision. Once the POA is formed, they can petition the court<br>to add *covenant restrictions* to the extents of the property<br>covered by the POA. 100% homeowner approval is not required. I forget<br>what the percentage is, but it's not 100%.<br><br>The upshot is that a mandatory HOA can indeed be formed after you buy<br>your property, but it takes years to accomplish. In at least one court<br>case, a homeowner successfully fought off a HOA which was formed after<br>he bought his house, but even that process took years and was similarly<br>not cheap.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If I lived in an area before an HOA was formed, can they do anything<br>legally if I don\'t follow their petty rules?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
