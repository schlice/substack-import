<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If it costs the US taxpayers \$40,000 per year per inmate, then why<br>don\'t we force the inmates to pay that themselves by forcing them to<br>work?**<br><br>Because last time I checked, Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery. The 13th<br>Amendment says that \"<br>\either slavery nor involuntary servitude,<br>except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly<br>convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to<br>their jurisdiction.\"<br><br>We can thus make them work as punishment. We cannot force them, however,<br>to *pay for their own incarceration*. The former is *involuntary<br>servitude as punishment*. The latter is *slavery*.<br><br>The taxpayers pay to incarcerate criminals. The criminals do not pay for<br>their own incarceration.<br><br>And what happens when someone is injured and can't work? Who pays for<br>their incarceration then? Do we just let them go because they can't<br>work?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
