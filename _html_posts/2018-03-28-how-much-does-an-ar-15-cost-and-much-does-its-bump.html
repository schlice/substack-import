<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How much does an AR-15 cost, and much does its bump stock cost? How<br>much does an M-16 cost, and wouldn\'t it be a good idea to raise the<br>price of the cheaper ones to make it harder to get a full auto weapon,<br>and possibly lower mass shootings?**<br><br>I'm not going to address the costs, since they do change and you need<br>only to search for them in The Googles in order to find out how much one<br>costs today.<br><br>Additionally, bump stocks are in the process of being made illegal, so<br>even if you do buy one now, it's likely going to be made unlawful to own<br>in the future. Bump stocks are toys. Don't bother with them.<br><br>**\W\ouldn\'t it be a good idea to raise the price of the cheaper ones<br>to make it harder to get a full auto weapon, and possibly lower mass<br>shootings?**<br><br>Getting a semi-auto weapon and fitting a bump stock to it is not the<br>only way to make a semi-automatic firearm fire like a full automatic.<br><br>It's actually very simple to convert a semi-automatic into a full<br>automatic. It's highly illegal, but simple. And you don't need a bump<br>stock to do it.<br><br>But let's get to the root of your question.<br><br>If the problem of mass shootings in America was *caused by* fully<br>automatic weapons, I'd be all for it. Ban them all. Simple solution.<br><br>But the problem of mass shootings in America is far more complex than<br>"it's the full auto, stupid." So raising the cost of something simply to<br>prevent mass shootings just means that only rich crazy people will be<br>the ones doing mass shootings. It doesn't address the problem.<br><br>Oh, and news flash: rifles can be bump fired without a bump stock. Uh,<br>oh...<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
