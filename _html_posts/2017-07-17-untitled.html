<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I would call for help while I took my dog to the vet. Again, I have no<br>duty to assist the rider, and regardless of who was at fault, the bike<br>damaged my dog. I am responsible for my dog; I am not responsible for a<br>motorcycle rider. Accidents do not absolve the rider of responsibility,<br>it simply lessens the amount for which he is responsible.<br><br>Besides, at the scene, it would be irresponsible to withhold treatment<br>to either the dog or the rider until responsibility could be determined.<br>Treat or call first, then determine responsibility later.<br><br>So I would transport my dog and call 911 while I'm driving.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Your-dog-is-run-over-by-a-motorbike-and-as-a-result-the-rider-falls-badly-Who-do-you-go-to-the-rescue-of-first-Your-dog-or-the-rider/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
