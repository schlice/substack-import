<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A hole isn't something you can "make." There is no "substance" to a<br>hole. A hole is actually an *absence* of something.<br><br>For example, you can dig a hole in the ground, and unquestionably a hole<br>exists, but you didn't *make* the hole. You removed dirt. Therefore,<br>the hole is what we call an *absence* of something.<br><br>Similarly, when you hit the drywall with your hammer, you removed some<br>drywall. The condition of an absence of something can oftentimes be<br>referred to as a "hole." You didn't make the hole with ingredients.<br>You caused the hole to exist by removing something else.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
