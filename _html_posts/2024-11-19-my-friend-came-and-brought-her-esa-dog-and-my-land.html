<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No.<br><br>Emotional Support Animals are not the same as Service Animals.<br><br>Service animals are usually dogs which are specially trained to do work<br>or perform tasks which assist a person with an ADA-recognized<br>disability. Some examples may be seeing eye dogs, or seizure dogs.<br><br>Emotional Support animals are not specially trained, but that doesn't<br>mean they don't provide a benefit. They provide comfort to people with<br>certain medical conditions, such as anxiety, depression, learning<br>disabilities, attention deficit disorder, chronic stress, and<br>postâ€‘traumatic stress disorder. To have any recognized ESA at all, you<br>must have a doctor's prescription for one.<br><br>That said, ESAs are not treated the same as service animals. Service<br>animals are allowed anywhere that people are allowed, and businesses<br>cannot deny entrance to a person with a service animal. ESAs are not<br>afforded the same treatment, and businesses can choose whether or not<br>they will allow ESAs into their establishments.<br><br>Housing also presents differences between the two. Landlords cannot<br>discriminate against a person with a service animal, since they are<br>legally allowed to be anywhere a person can be. ESAs, however, can only<br>live with their owners in "no pet" housing when there is a valid<br>doctor's prescription. ESAs can be restricted from any other housing<br>arrangement, including visiting a "no pet" building.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
