<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, there are plenty of legal reasons to impeach Biden. For<br>more, see my previous answer:<br><br>[[Bill Stein\'s answer to If Republicans win the House, and perhaps the<br>Senate, should they impeach Joe Biden? On what charges would be of<br>greatest<br>effect?](/If-Republicans-win-the-House-and-perhaps-the-Senate-should-they-impeach-Joe-Biden-On-what-charges-would-be-of-greatest-effect/answer/Bill-Stein?__filter__=5&__nsrc__=notif_page&__sncid__=33043962029&__snid3__=44419617520)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Secondly, I guess it's time for another edition of Constitution 101.<br><br>**You don't need a legal reason to impeach a president, because<br>impeachment is not a legal process.**<br><br>Impeachment is a *political* process.<br><br>The Framers used the words "high crimes and misdemeanors" because that's<br>the "level" of crime for which impeachment was to be reserved. It should<br>be things *akin* to what we would charge *anyone else* with as a crime.<br>But for a president, we would instead impeach.<br><br>Remember what then-Representative Gerald Ford said about impeachment in<br>1970: \"An impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of<br>Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.\"<br><br>In other words, the House can literally impeach the President for any<br>reason they see fit, or no reason at all. But as I said in my previous<br>answer, Clinton, W, Obama and Trump all committed impeachable offenses,<br>and only Clinton and Trump were impeached, and Trump not even for the<br>thing he did that was truly impeachable. Biden too has committed<br>impeachable offenses.<br><br>And if we don't start holding presidents to some standard, then the<br>office of the President will gain *de facto* power and we will have no<br>mechanism to stop it.<br><br>If you do what you've always done, you'll get what you've always gotten.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
