<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm going to assume you are both underage.<br><br>If you have your nudes, you have committed the crime of possession of<br>child pornography. But the girl who is threatening you is also in<br>possession of child pornography and is threatening to commit more crimes<br>(distribution of child pornography is also a crime). Depending on what<br>she wants from you, she may also be committing blackmail or extortion.<br><br>Tell her that you and she can go down to the police station to discuss<br>whose crimes are worse. If she doesn't agree to go with you, tell her<br>that you'll go by yourself and the police will probably come by to have<br>a chat with her.<br><br>If the nudes leak, you have evidence to show exactly who did it, so<br>those nudes better not get posted anywhere or the police will come find<br>her first.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**A girl is threatening to leak my nudes. She has proven that she got<br>them, and said that I committed a crime. What are your advice?**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
