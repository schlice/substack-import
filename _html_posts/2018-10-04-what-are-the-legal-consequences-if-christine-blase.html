<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are the legal consequences if Christine Blasey Ford made up her<br>story about Kavanaugh in order to affect the Supreme Court?**<br><br>*If* it can be proved that she lied (and lying means she knew the truth<br>and she intentionally said something different with the intent to<br>mislead the Congress), she could be convicted of perjury, which is lying<br>under oath. A similar charge is "knowingly and willfully making<br>materially false statements to Congress," but that doesn't require being<br>under oath. A conviction on a Federal perjury charge can send you to<br>Federal prison.<br><br>For reference, John Poindexter was convicted of perjury for his<br>Congressional testimony as part of the Iran-Contra affair. He was later<br>pardoned.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
