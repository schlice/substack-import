<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, let's talk about the gun itself.<br><br>You stated that guns are a tool that is only use is to kill, and this is<br>incorrect. There is a vast difference between what a tool was *designed*<br>to do, and what its primary or secondary uses are.<br><br>It might surprise you that knives were designed to kill. But they found<br>much more utility as tools than as killing implements. They are indeed<br>still used to kill, but they have found more use as cutting implements<br>than as killing implements.<br><br>Hammers were designed to apply directed force at nails. They are still<br>used for that purpose. But hammers can also kill, and they are used to<br>kill today.<br><br>Guns were designed to kill, just like knives were. But the utility of<br>the gun in killing is the fact that it can kill at *standoff distances*<br>(distances where the gun operator cannot be hurt by whatever they are<br>killing). But guns can do more than kill. Guns can stop crime, *in many<br>cases just by their mere presence.* Guns equalize the force disparity<br>between the strong and the weak, the few and the many, and the old and<br>the young.<br><br>\<br><br>Now, let's talk about your false equivalence.<br><br>You are attempting to say that "gun nuts" (whatever that means) value<br>their guns over the lives of innocent children in schools. So since this<br>"gun nut" is someone who values inanimate objects over human life, I<br>would say that this person is clearly mentally deficient. Whoever that<br>person is should get help.<br><br>You are next attempting to make the claim that *because* guns are<br>designed to kill, *therefore* we shouldn't have them because sometimes<br>innocent people are killed. Sure, sometimes innocent people are killed<br>by bad people with guns. But sometimes innocent people are killed by bad<br>people with cars, and sometimes innocent people are killed by bad people<br>with fire, and sometimes innocent people are killed by bad people with<br>hammers. Is the answer to ban all of those tools? Or is the answer to<br>find the common denominator and work on that? I see the common<br>denominator in all of those as the bad person. Focus on stopping the<br>bad person, don't think that the bad person will be *less bad* because<br>you have removed his tool. The bad person will still be bad; he'll just<br>use a different tool.<br><br>Plus, you've ignored the good that guns do. I pointed out the fact that<br>guns can stop crime. In fact, they do this *many, many more times* than<br>they facilitate crime. Millions of times a year, a gun stops a crime<br>from taking place, often without a single shot being fired.<br><br>\<br><br>Yes, school shootings are tragic. But we've had guns long before we've<br>had a massive increase in school shootings. Understanding why we have<br>had a massive increase in school shootings would go a long way to<br>stopping them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
