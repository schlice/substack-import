<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If the Senate trial were to proceed with witnesses and evidence, do<br>you believe Donald Trump would resign to prevent whatever he is hiding<br>from becoming public knowledge?**<br><br>If the Senate trial were to allow witnesses, Trump will laugh all the<br>way to victory in 2020.<br><br>Because if Democrats call John Bolton, Republicans will call Joe Biden.<br>If Democrats call Mick Mulvaney, Republicans will call Hunter Biden. And<br>so on.<br><br>If we're going to re-litigate and re-investigate what the House already<br>investigated and voted on, then Republicans will use the opportunity to<br>investigate what the House failed to investigate: whether or not Trump's<br>motives were indeed truly corrupt, by investigating Hunter Biden and his<br>ties to Burisma. Republicans will also want to know whether or not Trump<br>had a legitimate reason to call for Ukraine to investigate whether Joe<br>Biden used his influence in the Obama administration to block the<br>investigation into Burisma, by withholding US aid.<br><br>It is House managers who opened this door, referencing Hunter Biden in<br>their *opening statement*. If Hunter Biden is in scope in this trial, we<br>want to hear from him.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
