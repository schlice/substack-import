<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is that it depends on what the "rules about rules" are in<br>your Governing Documents. We really cannot provide you the answer you<br>are looking for, as the answer is going to be specific to your HOA and<br>your Governing Documents.<br><br>In general, HOA Boards are allowed to create *Rules and Regulations*<br>(R&Rs). No community voting is necessary; the HOA Board can create and<br>modify RR&s as they see fit. Now, *they* have to vote on the rule<br>change, and it has to be done at an open Board meeting, but you do not<br>need a vote of the members for the Board to create or modify a rule.<br><br>This is different for modifying the rest of the Governing Documents (the<br>Declaration of Covenants, the Articles of Incorporation, or the Bylaws),<br>as each of those document has different requirements for amendment,<br>usually involving assent by some percentage of the homeowners.<br><br>As long as those newly-added rules do not violate any other provisions<br>in the Governing Documents, they are legal and enforceable.<br><br>So details matter.<br><br>- What rule was created? How was it created? Does that rule require a<br>  vote of the membership, or just of the Board?<br>- What rule does it contradict? How was *it* created? Did *that* rule<br>  require a vote of the membership, or just the Board?<br><br>We cannot answer these questions here. You should probably seek the<br>advice of a real estate attorney in your local area who specializes in<br>HOA law.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer**:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.* ***This<br>answer is for GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.*** *Should you ignore<br>this warning and send specific or confidential information in a private<br>message or post it as a comment, there is no duty to keep that<br>information confidential or to discontinue or forego any representation<br>adverse to your interests.
