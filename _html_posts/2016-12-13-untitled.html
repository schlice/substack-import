<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, we're not talking about "using stop and frisk." I never<br>even mentioned it. We're talking about "broken windows theory" which has<br>nothing to do with stop-and-frisk. I don't really care what policies<br>Minneapolis chooses to use in their enforcement. It's the *types* of<br>crimes that matter, not the nature of determining when to intervene. You<br>can still use broken windows theory without stop-and-frisk. Two totally<br>different things.<br><br>Secondly, *I* didn't use Minneapolis, that's a quote from someone<br>else. Don't like her figures? Feel free to tell her. Here, I'll even do<br>all the "hard work" to find the place where you can do so:<br><br>[[Heather Mac<br>Donald](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c3803d&url=http://www.manhattan-institute.org/expert/heather-mac-donald){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="manhattan-institute.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Just click the "Comment" button in the upper right side of the page,<br>where you can feel free to tell her whatever you like about her figures.<br><br>Until then, I'll feel free to quote the figures that I believe are<br>sourced from experts who have done the legwork.<br><br>If you don't like my response and you still feel your answer is right,<br>feel free to answer the question yourself, but don't blather on to me<br>with your comments and nothing to back them up. I have at least provided<br>credible academic sources to show where I came up with my figures. You<br>cite nothing. I suspect you made those numbers up, but no one will know<br>until you cite your sources.<br><br>And your silly trope about Republicans causing this is entirely<br>unfounded. The cities in the United States with the largest increases in<br>crime have been led by Democrat mayors and Democrat governors, under the<br>leadership of a Democrat president.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-broken-windows-theory-apply-to-urban-crime-And-how-does-the-land-use-theory-apply-to-rural-suburban-crime/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
