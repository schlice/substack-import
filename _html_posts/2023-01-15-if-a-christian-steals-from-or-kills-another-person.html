<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's make sure we are speaking as Christians, since you asked this<br>question in the Christians and Christianity Space, and you asked if a<br>Christian steals or kills and repents (and is thus forgiven) how is that<br>justice for the person sinned against?<br><br>First, let's just say that the Christian *sinned*, which includes any<br>and all sins, including stealing and killing.<br><br>Next, let's clarify that *the person sinned against is God.* It is God's<br>commands which are broken. The sin is against God, not against the<br>victim.<br><br>The sinner repents of his sin to God, and God, who is rich in mercy,<br>covers the transgression with the blood of Christ. Christ's death and<br>resurrection take the penalty for sin. The sin still happened, but<br>Christ's shed blood covers the sin.<br><br>So does the *victim* get justice? That depends on what the victim is<br>looking for when it comes to justice. The victim may get legal<br>justice, and that is entirely appropriate, as we all live in this<br>fallen, secular world. But should the victim expect *justice* for the<br>*sin*? Since the sin itself was committed against God, justice is not<br>due to the victim. The victim may therefore seek *retribution* or<br>*vengeance*, but those should not be confused for *justice*, as is<br>common in today's world. And those are also not due to the victim<br>either.<br><br>> Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God's wrath,<br>> for it is written: "It is mine to avenge; I will repay," says the<br>> Lord. --- Romans 12:19 NIV<br><br>So how does God demand the victim respond? Mercy! The same mercy<br>that He shows to the sinner!<br><br>> "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, a tooth for a<br>> tooth.' But I say to you, do not resist an evil person; but whoever<br>> slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.<br>><br>> "If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your<br>> coat also. Whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him two. Give to<br>> him who asks of you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow<br>> from you." --- Matthew 5:38--42 NIV<br><br>God demands justice for sin against Him. Rest assured, because God is<br>just, someone will pay for the sin. For the Christian who repents,<br>however, that someone is Jesus. And that blessing is available to<br>everyone who repents and believes.<br><br>Look at it this way. What the sinner does to me is a reflection of him,<br>not of me. What I do in response to him is a reflection of me, not of<br>him. As a Christian who has been sinned against, how you respond is just<br>as important as the justice God demands of the sinner.<br><br>\<br><br>*Original question:*<br><br>*If a Christian steals from or kills another person and repents (and is<br>forgiven); how is that justice for the person sinned against?*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
