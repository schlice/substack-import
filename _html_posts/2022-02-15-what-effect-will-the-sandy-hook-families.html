<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If gun violence were caused by marketing, then *maybe* this case might<br>cause gun manufacturers to think differently about how they market<br>firearms.<br><br>But no reputable study has been able to link gun violence to marketing<br>by gun manufacturers. Sure, there are studies. But they all show how gun<br>manufacturers' marketing practices *may play a role* in gun violence,<br>not that marketing guns in a specific way or to a specific target<br>demographic *causes* gun violence.<br><br>So at best, the mentally unhinged might not choose a Remington for their<br>next killing spree because of updated marketing. But until we stop<br>focusing on the tool and start focusing on the violence, this is nothing<br>more than a Pyrrhic victory.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What effect will the Sandy Hook families\' settlement for \$73 million<br>with gun maker Remington have on gun violence in the future?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
