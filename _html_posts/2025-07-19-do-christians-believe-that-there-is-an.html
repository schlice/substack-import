<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I understand what you are asking. You're asking if there is an "age"<br>beyond which you are responsible for your sins.<br><br>So it's important to note that the majority of commenters here are<br>correct; there is no "age of accountability" listed in the Bible, but at<br>the same time, ask yourself this: when a baby dies, do they go to<br>heaven? What about the mentally handicapped? They often don't know the<br>spiritual ramifications of their actions. Do they go to heaven?<br><br>So there's two parts to this answer, and the first part pertains to what<br>causes us to need salvation. We know that we are sinful by nature. We<br>call that "original sin." But does original sin alone condemn us? No, it<br>does not, because original sin is the stain of Adam, which is passed on<br>to us. More specifically, while God created Adam and Eve in His own<br>likeness (Genesis 5:1), the Bible says that, once Adam and Eve fell and<br>became sinful, Adam fathered children "in *his* own likeness" (Genesis<br>5:3, emphasis added; cf. Romans 5:12). All of us inherited a sinful<br>nature through Adam's original sin. Adam sinned and thus created for<br>himself a sinful nature, and he passed that sinful nature along to all<br>his descendants.<br><br>However, while we have inherited Adam's original sin, are we *convicted*<br>simply because of it? The answer is no, we are not. Original sin<br>means we have inherited a sinful nature which makes sin the inclination<br>of every human heart (Genesis 6:5). Therefore, we sin because original<br>sin made our natural response sinful. In short, we sin because we are<br>sinners. It is that sin which convicts us, not the stain of our original<br>sin. We are only responsible for our own sin (which we all freely do).<br><br>So now that we've discussed original sin vs our own sin, we come to the<br>second part of the answer. Everything we just discussed leads us to<br>another question: couldn't it be possible that someone *isn't*<br>responsible for their own sin? Would you say that a baby has enough<br>inclination to sin without being cognizant of his or her actions? What<br>about the mentally handicapped? In other words, *is there any level of*<br>*mens rea* *required along with the* *actus reus* *of sin?*<br>***Must you have the ability to know that what you are doing is sinful,<br>along with actually doing the sinful thing?***<br><br>The answer is yes, you must. My friends at<br>[GotQuestions.org(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e4ff7d&url=http://GotQuestions.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container} explain this with the<br>following Biblical explanation:<br><br>> In John 9, Jesus heals a man born blind. After the physical healing,<br>> the man goes through a process of receiving his spiritual sight. At<br>> first, the man is ignorant; he knows Jesus' name but not where to find<br>> Him (John 9:11--12). Later, he arrives at the truth that Jesus is a<br>> prophet (verse 17) and that He is from God (verse 33). Then, in<br>> speaking to Jesus, the man admits his ignorance and his need for the<br>> Savior. Jesus asks him, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?" and the<br>> man replies, "Who is he, sir? . . . Tell me so that I may believe in<br>> him" (verses 35--36). Finally, having seen the light spiritually, he<br>> says, "Lord, I believe," and worships Jesus (verse 38).<br>><br>> Following the expression of faith from the man born blind, Jesus<br>> encounters some spiritually blind Pharisees: "Jesus said, 'For<br>> judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and<br>> those who see will become blind.' Some Pharisees who were with him<br>> heard him say this and asked, 'What? Are we blind too?' Jesus said,<br>> 'If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you<br>> claim you can see, your guilt remains'" (John 9:39--41). In other<br>> words, Jesus says, "If you were *truly* ignorant \blind\, you would<br>> have no guilt. It's because you are *not* ignorant---you are willfully<br>> unbelieving---that you stand guilty before<br>> God."\[1\](#ZAsnR){#cite-ZAsnR .citation_link}<br><br>The principle that Jesus is outlining here is very clear: **God does not<br>judge people for things they are unable to do.**<br><br>> *Sin is measured by the capacities or ability of people, and by their<br>> opportunities of knowing the truth. If people had no ability to do the<br>> will of God, they could incur no blame. If they have all proper<br>> ability, and no disposition, God holds them to be<br>> guilty.*\[2\](#pzstd){#cite-pzstd .citation_link}<br><br>Therefore, if we follow this principle to its natural end, babies, the<br>mentally handicapped, and those who are unable to actually accept Jesus<br>are not accountable for their unbelief.<br><br>So while there may not be an "age" of accountability, there is a<br>"disposition" of accountability: the ability to accept Jesus. If a<br>person is physically or, by age, unable to accept Jesus, they cannot be<br>held accountable for the fact that they have not accepted Jesus, and<br>thus cannot be held accountable for their sin.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ZAsnR){.citation_index} [[Do babies and children go to<br>heaven when they<br>die?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b59691&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/do-babies-go-to-heaven.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-pzstd){.citation_index} [[Notes on the New Testament<br>explanatory and practical: Matthew and Mark (Barnes on the New<br>Testament): Barnes, Albert: 9780801005664: Amazon.com:<br>Books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1609de&url=https://www.amazon.com/Notes-New-Testament-explanatory-practical/dp/0801005663){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
