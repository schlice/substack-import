<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You have started your question with an unvalidated assertion.<br><br>You said, "The Bible describes hell as a place burning with fire and<br>brimstone." Well, that's *partially* true. The Bible uses *lots* of<br>descriptors to describe hell.<br><br>Let's start with where we get the whole "fire and brimstone"<br>description. "Fire and brimstone" describes some of what hell is<br>*like*---but not all of what hell *is*.<br><br>In actuality, the word the Bible uses which is related to "fire and<br>brimstone" is *Gehenna*, and you might be surprised to learn that<br>*Gehenna is an actual place:* the valley of Gehenna adjacent to<br>Jerusalem on the south. The things that went on in Gehenna<br>were...unorthodox. Babies were sacrificed to the pagan god Molech in<br>that valley (see 2 Kings 16:3; 2 Chronicles 33:6; Jeremiah 32:35). How<br>were they sacrificed, you might ask? Immolation. In other words,<br>*they were burned alive.* If you were to ask someone of Jesus' day about<br>Gehenna, they'd instantly know that unholy things were taking place<br>there, and it was quite adjacent to "fire" and "brimstone." Basically,<br>"Gehenna" was related to uncleanliness, demonic activity, and evil<br>rituals---a fitting metaphor for hell.<br><br>Jesus also talks directly about burning fire during His Sermon on the<br>Mount:<br><br>> And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you<br>> to enter life crippled than with two hands to go to hell, to the<br>> unquenchable fire. \-- Mark 9:43 ESV<br><br>Was Jesus advocating for self-mutilation? Hardly. But in comparing<br>self-mutilation to going to the unquenchable fire, Jesus is saying that<br>we should literally be doing whatever we can (including self-mutilation)<br>to avoid going to hell, because hell is worse than losing a hand. So how<br>do we know that Jesus isn't referring to hell as a fiery place? Because<br>like we said, Jesus isn't advocating for self-mutilation. If the first<br>part of that sentence is admittedly hyperbolic, we can assume that the<br>second part (unquenchable fire) is also hyperbolic.<br><br>In addition, "unquenchable fire" is not the only description the Bible<br>uses for hell. The Bible also describes hell as a bottomless pit or<br>abyss (Revelation 20:3), a lake (Revelation 20:14), darkness (Matthew<br>25:30), death (Revelation 2:11), destruction (2 Thessalonians 1:9),<br>everlasting torment (Revelation 20:10), a place of wailing and gnashing<br>of teeth (Matthew 25:30), and a place of graduated punishment (Matthew<br>11:20-24; Luke 12:47-48; Revelation 20:12-13). The wide variety of<br>hell's descriptions seems to indicate that there is no one description<br>that the Bible uses as the one description of hell.<br><br>But just because we don't have a singular description of hell doesn't<br>diminish how bad hell is. In fact, the wide variety of descriptions<br>should *amplify* the fear of hell, not *lessen* it. Hell is *worse than<br>we can even describe*. Hell is a place of more tears and more anguish<br>than any one description could ever portray.<br><br>Basically, the multiple descriptions of hell describe a place which is<br>beyond our language to even explain, and a place far worse than we even<br>have the capacity to imagine.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
