<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We\'ll take this a step at a time.<br><br>*I failed out of college. -* This has no bearing on whether or not the<br>military will pay for any schooling you may choose to attend.<br><br>*If I join the Air Force, will they pay my student loans?* - The<br>military will not pay any *previous* student loans you may have incurred<br>before you entered Active Duty. However, if you go to school *after* you<br>join the military, there are educational benefits available.<br><br>The military will pick up much of the tab for your schooling, but as<br>with everything, there is a catch. If you attend school while you are<br>active duty, you will incur a service commitment following your<br>graduation. This service commitment (for school) usually runs<br>*concurrently* with any other service commitments you may already have.<br>So if you already have a three year commitment, and you graduate from<br>college and thus incur a two year service commitment which starts the<br>day of your graduation, you would have zero additional commitment, as<br>you already have a three year commitment and your educational benefit<br>commitment would run concurrently with your existing commitment.<br><br>Let me give you a practical example. I graduated from USAFA in June,<br>1994, with a five year active duty service commitment, so that would<br>expire June, 1999. I started my Masters program January 1995, after<br>arriving at my first duty station in October, 1994. I graduated from my<br>Masters program in March, 1996, and incurred a two year service<br>commitment following graduation, which ran concurrently with any other<br>existing commitments. My education commitment expired in March, 1998,<br>but I still had commitment from USAFA. So my education commitment had no<br>effect on my total required service.<br><br>TL;DR - If you have existing loans, the Air Force will not pay<br>those. If you go to school while on Active Duty, education benefits are<br>available to help pay for the bulk of that cost.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
