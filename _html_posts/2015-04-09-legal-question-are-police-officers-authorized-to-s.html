<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>To answer your specific question, if a suspect is simply fleeing the<br>police but does not threaten anyone\'s safety (either the public or the<br>officer), then deadly force cannot be used. The recent case in South<br>Carolina shows the line which officers cannot cross. If an unarmed man<br>is not a threat to anyone, he cannot be shot.<br><br>If the suspect is a threat to the public or to the officer, deadly force<br>may be authorized. Any UOF will be reviewed in every case anyway.<br><br>The landmark Supreme Court case *Tennessee v. Garner* solidified use of<br>force: a police officer may not use deadly force against a fleeing<br>suspect unless \"the officer has probable cause to believe that the<br>suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury<br>to the officer or others.\" That's a pretty high bar to overcome, so in<br>practice, fleeing suspects can generally not be shot. The Court found<br>that use of deadly force to stop a fleeing suspect is an unreasonable<br>seizure under the Fourth Amendment, without probable cause that the<br>suspect posed a significant threat.<br><br>The only place in where this is different is on a US military<br>installation on which the installation commander has authorized the use<br>of deadly force. Those officers are indeed authorized to shoot you even<br>if you are not a threat to anyone. Simply fleeing from custody is<br>grounds to be shot if you are on a military installation. Military<br>police are allowed to shoot you if you are fleeing with classified<br>documents, fleeing with HE (high explosive) ordnance (or anything else<br>considered dangerous to the public), or simply fleeing from custody. If<br>you pose a threat to the installation or to anyone on it, you can also<br>be shot.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
