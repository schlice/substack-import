<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can my parents sign for me if I'm too young? I entered an art<br>competition that requires someone over 18 to submit artwork, so my<br>parents agreed to sign any contracts if I win. Is this a problem and<br>could I get into legal trouble if they sign for me**<br><br>No one here can answer this question for you, because no one here has<br>seen the actual agreement your parents may sign.<br><br>If that agreement says that "you must be 18 in order to enter the<br>contest," your parents could claim that they produced the artwork,<br>receive the prize, and no one would be the wiser. You would be violating<br>the rules of the contest, and if you were found out, you would have to<br>return any prizes you were awarded, and you could indeed face legal<br>liability. You could get sued for the monetary value of the extra effort<br>the contest organizers had to put in to track you down, get the prizes<br>back, contact the first runner up, and get the prizes to them.<br><br>Now, if the agreement says that "Someone over the age of 18 must sign,<br>but anyone can produce the art" then you're fine.<br><br>It is up to you to proceed how you see fit. I am not going to advise you<br>how to proceed, other than you should follow the rules of the contest as<br>they are written. If you have questions regarding any specific contest<br>rules and how they may apply to you, you should direct those questions<br>to the people who are running the contest.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is legal information, not legal advice.
