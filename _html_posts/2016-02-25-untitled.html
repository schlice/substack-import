<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I\'m certain we will have some input from Congress sometime soon.<br><br>But this isn\'t a matter for Congress yet. It\'s a matter for the<br>courts. The courts provided a lawful order, ***the same kind of lawful<br>order Apple has complied with in the past, and the same kind of lawful<br>order the court will issue tomorrow.***<br><br>Manufacturers have written all kinds of new code to aid law enforcement.<br>They\'ve even built completely new devices to support law enforcement.<br>The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) was<br>written specifically to ensure that telecommunications systems remained<br>open to wiretapping for law enforcement. CALEA-capable listening<br>equipment exists at all of the cell phone carriers\' switching centers<br>for law enforcement use. These devices had to be specially designed to<br>decrypt digital cell calls so that they could be wiretapped, and these<br>devices are only used by law enforcement.<br><br>Apple is attempting to appeal to a slippery slope argument, when they<br>have already helped law enforcement unlock locked iPhones in the past,<br>and they will continue to do so as long as they are able. It\'s part of<br>being an American company and being good corporate citizens assisting<br>law enforcement in the discharge of their duties. It\'s certainly<br>not without precedent.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-the-FBI-break-into-the-San-Bernardino-shooters-phone-Is-it-actually-that-secure-or-is-this-just-a-ploy-to-make-Apple-submit/answer/Craig-Weiland<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
