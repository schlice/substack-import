<br><br><h2>Space Submission</h2><br><div><br><br>Space name: New Testament Christians<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is an excellent question. We can rephrase it to a more basic<br>question:<br><br>*Is salvation a license to sin?*<br><br>The short answer is no. I think intuitively we probably knew that.<br><br>To understand the longer answer, we need to understand what happens when<br>a person is "saved."<br><br>When a person is truly saved, two things must happen: they must<br>repent of their sin, and they must accept Christ as their lord<br>and savior.<br><br>- Repentance means a "turning away" from your past life and your<br>  past sinful acts. Think of "turning your back on" your past life. The<br>  language about repentance is very figurative and descriptive,<br>  especially when it talks about "dying to your sins." Your old life is<br>  *over*. The old you dies.<br>- Acceptance means recognizing you are a sinner, you will always be<br>  a sinner (human nature being what it is), and you have **zero hope of<br>  salvation** without Christ.<br><br>Romans 6 (the whole chapter) discusses this concept. It is a *really<br>great read*, and I would recommend you read the New International<br>Version, as it is easy for the average English-speaking person today to<br>understand:<br><br>[https://www.biblegateway.com/pas\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a029b5&url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search%3DRomans%25206%26version%3DNIV){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="biblegateway.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Just look at verse 1: "What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning<br>so that grace may increase?" What a fascinating thought! I mean, if some<br>grace in forgiving my sins is good, should I keep sinning so that I get<br>*more grace*? Verse 2 gives you the answer: "By no means! We are those<br>who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?" **By no<br>means! Because we *died to sin*. Our old life is dead**. We are<br>reborn as new people in Christ.<br><br>And now, the big question: ***Does this mean that once we are saved, we<br>automatically never sin again?***<br><br>No.<br><br>We are still human. Salvation doesn't change our human nature. We are<br>still sinful by nature. Salvation instead assures that Christ *paid for<br>my sin with his death and resurrection, past, present, and future.* I<br>certainly don't live in my old ways any more, but I still sin. I sin in<br>thought and I sin in action. I still get angry with that stupid driver<br>doing 15 miles an hour below the speed limit on the Interstate, or the<br>oblivious self-obsessed shopper blocking the entire aisle with her cart.<br>It happens.<br><br>But I try to stop it. Instead of snapping to judgement, I try instead to<br>pray for that person, that whatever is going on in their lives can be<br>handed over to God, as I did, so that they can experience the fullness<br>of God's grace, as I have.<br><br>Instead of thinking "What a Karen," I try to actively think, "Does she<br>even know how much God loves her?" It takes work, but you can improve on<br>your sinful nature.<br><br>Even so, I still go to God and ask forgiveness for the sins I committed<br>in thought and deed. I am still human, and I recognize that I still,<br>daily, need Christ's healing and power to transform lives. I'm being<br>transformed a little bit at a time, in a process called<br>*sanctification*. Salvation was a one-time, instantaneous action, while<br>*sanctification* is the process by which we, through faithful study and<br>prayer, are transformed into the person God wants us to be. It is<br>normally a lifelong process, but the results get more and more beautiful<br>every day.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-80f3adcec5721a2596f9ddc675a9190f){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-80f3adcec5721a2596f9ddc675a9190f" master_w="321"<br>master_h="306"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>I'm still a work in progress.
