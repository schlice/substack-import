Now, they're not violating a specific law,<br>so they aren't doing anything criminal, but because they do not have a<br>right to strike in state law, they could face disciplinary action, up to<br>and including termination.<br><br>If there are provisions that allow work stoppages in other states, that<br>could be grounds to allow for a strike. if such provisions exists, the<br>striking workers must follow those provisions and end the strike in<br>accordance with those laws.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
