<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>By "source," I assume you mean some non-Biblical record of the<br>Resurrection. Flavius Josephus, the greatest Jewish historian of his<br>time, reported that Jesus appeared to His followers three days after He<br>was crucified and buried. Tacitus, the Roman historian, wrote in his<br>final work, *Annals*, that the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate executed<br>Jesus. In all, there are ten non-Christian sources which had details<br>about the fact that Jesus' disciples believed that He was resurrected<br>from the dead.<br><br>As for modern research, Gary Habermas has completed the most<br>comprehensive investigation to date on what scholars believe about the<br>Resurrection. Habermas collected more than 1,400 of the most critical<br>scholarly works on the Resurrection written from 1975 to 2003. In [[*The<br>Risen Jesus and Future<br>Hope*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7c70a7&url=https://www.amazon.com/Risen-Jesus-Future-Hope/dp/0742532879/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}*,* Habermas reports that<br>virtually all scholars from across the ideological spectrum---from<br>ultra-liberals to Bible-thumping conservatives---agree that the<br>following points concerning Jesus and Christianity are actual historical<br>facts:<br><br>1.  Jesus died by Roman crucifixion.<br>2.  He was buried, most likely in a private tomb.<br>3.  Soon afterwards the disciples were discouraged, bereaved, and<br>    despondent, having lost hope.<br>4.  Jesus' tomb was found empty very soon after his interment. ยน<br>5.  The disciples had experiences that they believed were actual<br>    appearances of the risen Jesus.<br>6.  Due to these experiences, the disciples' lives were thoroughly<br>    transformed. They were even willing to die for their belief.<br>7.  The proclamation of the Resurrection took place very early, from the<br>    beginning of church history.<br>8.  The disciples' public testimony and preaching of the Resurrection<br>    took place in the city of Jerusalem, where Jesus had been crucified<br>    and buried shortly before.<br>9.  The gospel message centered on the preaching of the death and<br>    resurrection of Jesus.<br>10. Sunday was the primary day for gathering and worshiping.<br>11. James, the brother of Jesus and a skeptic before this time, was<br>    converted when he believed he also saw the risen Jesus.<br>12. Just a few years later, Saul of Tarsus (Paul) became a Christian<br>    believer, due to an experience that he also believed was an<br>    appearance of the risen Jesus.<br><br>The acceptance of these facts makes sense in light of the existing<br>evidence, which shows:<br><br>- The New Testament Story Is Not a Legend---The New Testament<br>  documents were written well within two generations of the events by<br>  eyewitnesses or their contemporaries, and the New Testament storyline<br>  is corroborated by non-Christian writers. In addition, the New<br>  Testament mentions at least 30 historical figures who have been<br>  confirmed by sources outside the New Testament. Therefore, the New<br>  Testament story cannot be a legend.<br>- The New Testament Story Is Not a Lie---The New Testament writers<br>  included divergent and embarrassing details, difficult and demanding<br>  sayings, and they carefully distinguished Jesus' words from their own.<br>  They also referenced facts and eyewitnesses that their readers either<br>  already knew or could verify. In fact, the New Testament writers<br>  provoked their readers and prominent first-century enemies to check<br>  out what they said. If that's not enough to confirm their<br>  truthfulness, then their martyrdom should remove any doubt. These<br>  eyewitnesses endured persecution and death for the empirical claim<br>  that they had seen, heard, and touched the risen Jesus, yet they could<br>  have saved themselves by simply denying their testimony.<br>- The New Testament Story Is Not an Embellishment---The New<br>  Testament writers were meticulously accurate, as evidenced by well<br>  over 140 historically confirmed details. They recorded miracles in<br>  those same historically confirmed narratives, and they did so without<br>  apparent embellishment or significant theological comment.<br><br>So is the New Testament true? If most scholars agree with the twelve<br>facts stated above because the evidence shows that the New Testament<br>story is not a legend, a lie, or an embellishment, then we know beyond a<br>reasonable doubt that the New Testament writers accurately recorded what<br>they saw.<br><br>They recorded the fact that Jesus appeared to His disciples at least<br>eight different times to different people over the 40-day period since<br>His crucifixion.<br><br>\<br><br>ยน While scholars are not unanimous on the empty tomb, a *majority* of<br>them (about 75 percent) believe the tomb was empty. The other eleven<br>facts stated here enjoy nearly unanimous scholarly support.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
