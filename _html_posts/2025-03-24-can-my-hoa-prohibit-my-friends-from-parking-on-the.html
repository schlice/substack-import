<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sure they can! They can do it by having a rule which states "no street<br>parking." The question becomes *what can they do about it?*<br><br>If your HOA has this "no street parking" rule in your Governing<br>Documents, and you agreed to be bound by those Governing Documents when<br>you bought your house, along with the rule that says that your guests<br>are also your responsibility, then the HOA can fine *you* when they<br>catch your friends parking on the street in front of your house.<br><br>At least, that's what the rule says. But *actually enforcing such a<br>rule* is where the wicket gets sticky.<br><br>For instance, *how do they know whose guest owns the car?* Do they stare<br>at your house until someone gets out and into the car? Generally no. In<br>most cases, the HOA can't determine, during the day, if the car in front<br>of your house is a guest, or even if it is someone coming over your<br>house to do legitimate business (i.e. an insurance agent, a house<br>cleaner, a tradesperson, etc). This makes the rule exceedingly difficult<br>to enforce during the day. But if the car is there *overnight*, there's<br>a better-than-average chance that the person is a guest staying at your<br>house.<br><br>To that end, when there is a "no street parking" rule, *it is generally<br>enforced* *overnight*. Parking patrols usually head out late in the<br>evening or very early in the morning and catalog license plates.<br>Sometimes, they stick notices on the driver's window reminding the<br>vehicle owners that the HOA has a strict "no street parking" rule. But<br>if the vehicle owner is not present, even if the HOA paid to go through<br>their management company to run the license plates, what happens if the<br>person is not a resident? You just wasted that money, because the person<br>can't be fined.<br><br>\<br><br>The previous was all true for HOAs with public streets, as most are. But<br>the calculus changes *considerably* if the HOA is gated.ยน<br><br>If you live in a gated community, *the HOA owns the roads*. *The HOA<br>pays to maintain the roads.* That ownership of the roads means the HOA<br>can enforce its parking rules at any time. The HOA can hire a towing<br>company and tow/impound illegally parked cars. They can boot cars until<br>owners are identified, tickets are given, or in some cases, until<br>parking fines are paid, if they choose. They can issue speeding tickets<br>on their roads. They are, in effect, a quasi-governmental agency inside<br>of the gates.<br><br>You'll usually notice a big sign when you enter a gated community<br>indicating who the towing company for the HOA is, along with a notice<br>that entering the community means abiding by the rules, and if you break<br>the rules, your car can be towed at your expense (meaning you'll need to<br>pay the impound lot to get your car out).<br><br>\<br><br>(EDIT) I know you may believe that the HOA cannot issue you a fine for<br>parking on a public street. If you're going to bounce into the comments<br>and yell at me and tell me that there is no way the HOA can issue you a<br>fine for parking on a public street, read this first.<br><br>First, *all states and all HOAs are different.* Some states do not<br>permit HOAs to fine homeowners for parking on pubic streets. ***BUT MOST<br>DO***. And I can assure you, from personal experience as a Board member<br>in two states: courts routinely rule these fines are valid.<br><br>Second, *the HOA is not giving you a state parking ticket*. The HOA<br>is giving you *a fine for violating HOA rules.* You can violate HOA<br>rules anywhere within the purview of the HOA: on a private driveway, in<br>a parking space, on private property, and even on a public street inside<br>the HOA. The HOA has broad statutory authority to enforce its rules<br>within its *entire area of purview.*<br><br>You are welcome to believe that the HOA does not have this authority.<br>You are, of course, welcome to test this theory at any time. Here's how<br>you must do it:<br><br>1.  Live in a community with an HOA whose Governing Documents contain a<br>    "no street parking" rule.<br>2.  Violate this rule. The only way you can challenge the legality of<br>    the rule is to become a victim of it. It's called *standing.*<br>3.  When you are fined, sue the HOA and make your claim that the rule in<br>    question violates state law because the HOA cannot fine you for<br>    parking on a public street.<br>4.  *Be prepared to lose.* I'm not saying you will lose, but you must be<br>    prepared to lose. That means you will owe not only your fine (and<br>    any late fees), but you'll also owe attorney's fees and court costs.<br><br>I'm certain that some of you still want to go to the comments and tell<br>me that the HOA simply doesn't have that authority. Unless you are in a<br>position to test this theory yourself, please save it. None of us can<br>tell whether or not any particular Governing Documents in any particular<br>state has unlawful rules in them. The only way to determine if any<br>particular rule is lawful is to violate it and then challenge its<br>legality. I will delete any further comments regarding legality of<br>parking.<br><br>\<br><br>ยน This is also true of the less common situation where an ungated<br>community owns the roads, but in all cases where the HOA is gated, the<br>HOA owns the roads.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
