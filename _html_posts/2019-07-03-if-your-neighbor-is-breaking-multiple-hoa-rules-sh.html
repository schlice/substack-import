<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If your neighbor is breaking multiple HOA rules, should you report<br>them to the HOA?**<br><br>That's really up to you. It depends on how egregious the violations are,<br>and how much they personally impact you.<br><br>We all understand that following the rules is the right thing to do, and<br>we should all do it. But whether or not you personally make the report<br>to the HOA of someone violating the rules is a personal decision that<br>only you can make. Remember, they're still your neighbor; you have to<br>live with them. If they discover who reported them, it could make for a<br>tense living situation if they get fined because of your report.<br><br>Perhaps you can make your report anonymously; that may help.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
