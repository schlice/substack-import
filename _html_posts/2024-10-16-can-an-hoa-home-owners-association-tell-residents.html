<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>They could, but it would be a really bad idea.<br><br>If a tree encroaches onto a neighboring property, and the homeowner is<br>prohibited from maintaining his property by HOA rules, the homeowner<br>could sue the HOA for facilitating a tort trespass. After all, it is<br>only the HOA's rule which prevents the homeowner from addressing the<br>tort trespass, because without the rule, the homeowner can directly<br>address the issue themselves.<br><br>And Heaven forbid your property is damaged because of a tree encroaching<br>into your yard. The HOA would be *financially liable* for the damages,<br>because it was their rules which prevented you from addressing the<br>encroachment. Make sure you save any and all correspondence with the HOA<br>where you attempt to get them to either allow you to address the issue<br>or to get them to address it themselves.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
