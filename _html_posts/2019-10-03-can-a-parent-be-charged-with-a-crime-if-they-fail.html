<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can a parent be charged with a crime if they fail to adequately<br>supervise their child and their child accidentally pushes a pregnant<br>Person down a flight of stairs or into a body of water, killing them?**<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>Only three states (Illinois, Maryland, and Oregon) have a set minimum<br>age that a child must reach before they can be left unsupervised, and<br>it's a different age in each state: Illinois says the child must be 14,<br>Maryland says the child must be 8, and Oregon says the child must be 10.<br>Other states have set "guidelines" instead of rules, and many do not<br>define an exact age, leaving it open to interpretation.<br><br>However, that's not what you asked.<br><br>You asked if a parent can be charged with a crime when their child<br>accidentally does something which results in a death. **In this specific<br>scenario, we generally do not charge anyone with a crime** when<br>someone has an accident. Unless there is criminal negligence at<br>play (which in this case, there would not be), it's unlikely that either<br>the child or the parent would be criminally liable for the death.<br><br>That said, it's certainly possible that the parent could be sued in<br>civil court for negligence resulting in death, and the estate of the<br>deceased could be monetarily reimbursed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
