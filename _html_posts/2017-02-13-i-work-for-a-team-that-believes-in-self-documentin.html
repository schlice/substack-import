<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can always write a separate text document which describes each<br>variable, what it is used for, what calls it, and what it calls. That<br>means that every time you create a variable, you need to simultaneously<br>add the variable to the document. This avoids the overhead in the code,<br>but is more time-consuming for the programmer. I would suggest either a<br>spreadsheet or a table in a word processor document.<br><br>If you're programming using the gdb editor, you can type **info<br>variables** to get a list of all variables in the code. You can use that<br>as your starting point. You can also type info locals to list local<br>variables of the current stack frame, including static variables in that<br>function. Finally, you can type info args to list arguments of the<br>current stack frame. So depending on your editor, you may be able to<br>list out all of the variables in your code, and you can use that to<br>start your variable document, and perhaps to keep it updated.<br><br>For code that may have to be maintained at some point in the future, we<br>like to add comments directly into the code because it allows for ease<br>of future maintenance. The problem with a standalone code instruction<br>document is that it could be lost or misplaced, and then the code<br>becomes orders-of-magnitude harder to maintain in the future.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
