If she gives me power of attorney can I stand in court<br>for her during the process?**<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>Depending on the state and depending on the case at hand, in most cases<br>an "attorney in fact" cannot represent you in court. Only an "attorney<br>at law" can represent you, if in your special circumstance you are not<br>physically required to appear in court. This is generally only<br>applicable in special circumstances and for administrative proceedings.<br><br>Under most circumstances, if you are required to be present in court,<br>you must be physically present. An attorney in fact (which is a power of<br>attorney holder) cannot represent you in court. Only a licensed attorney<br>can represent a client.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
