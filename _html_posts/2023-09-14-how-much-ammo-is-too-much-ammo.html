<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When I was training to become a Reserve Deputy, the story was told of a<br>Deputy who used to be British Special Forces. He had a rig on the back<br>of his duty belt which held *four* fully loaded magazines for his<br>sidearm, in addition to the two-mag pouch he wore on the front of his<br>belt.<br><br>The other guys used to tease him. "Hey Rambo, think you have enough ammo<br>there?" they'd say.<br><br>He would simply respond, "Have you ever been in a firefight and run out<br>of ammo? Once you feel what that feels like, you'll never ever want to<br>feel that again."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
