<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How possible is it to hack into your smartphone if someone stole your<br>\'Ring\' doorbell?**<br><br>**TL;DR: Unless you've jailbroken or rooted your phone, it's exceedingly<br>unlikely that your phone will be hacked.**<br><br>Your network, however, is another story altogether.<br><br>Once someone has stolen your Ring doorbell, they now have the key to<br>your wireless network. The doorbell has your wireless network's<br>information, and the hacker can spoof the doorbell's identity to enter<br>your network. They can do all sorts of nefarious things around your<br>network, but most importantly, they can *monitor* your network.<br><br>They don't have to hack into your smartphone to watch you log in to your<br>email.<br><br>And once you do that, *they have the keys to the kingdom.*<br><br>With your email account, they can reset your password on **any other<br>account you have:** banking, home mortgage, social media, everything.<br><br>They can blast out your email and do the whole "forgot password" thing<br>and when your providers dutifully send you password reset links to your<br>email, they can activate those and they now have control of<br>*everything*.<br><br>So here's a few things you can do *right now* to secure your digital<br>life:<br><br>1.  **Turn on two-factor authentication on your email account. If your<br>    email provider does not use two-factor authentication, dump them.**<br>    Note that Apple and Google both use two-factor authentication.<br>    Apple's is on by default; you have to turn Google's on.<br>2.  If you use the same password at more than one service, **change<br>    them.** Never use the same password at more than one service. A good<br>    scheme which helps you remember your password is to use a password<br>    scheme that incorporates the name of the service into the password.<br>    So for example, you could have passwords like,<br>    "Th1s1smyTw1tt3rP@ssw0rd!" for Twitter and<br>    "Th1s1smyFaceb00kP@ssw0rd!" for Facebook. I actually don't recommend<br>    using those two passwords because they're really easy to guess, but<br>    you get the idea. These are different passwords, but you only need<br>    to remember the pattern.<br><br>Then, if your Ring doorbell is stolen, **immediately delete your<br>wireless network and create a new one**. You will need access to your<br>wireless router to do this. You should learn how to do this now in case<br>this happens to you. You will then need to re-connect every wireless<br>device you own to the new wireless network. Yes, it's time-consuming,<br>but it is eminently necessary to protect yourself and your smart home<br>(to the extent that you have built one out).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
