<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I was going to agree, but these two things are completely different.<br><br>It's like saying "If Republicans are for forcing a woman to carry a<br>child under any circumstances, then why would they be against putting<br>pineapple on a pizza?"<br><br>They are two totally separate things. This is a logical fallacy called a<br>"false equivalence." The reason why logical fallacies are bad is that<br>they nearly always produce *incorrect outcomes* (except in cases<br>where they accidentally stumble upon the truth).<br><br>So let's review the two points you've tried to make in this question:<br><br>1.  Republicans are for forcing a woman to carry a child under any<br>    circumstances<br>2.  Republicans are against programs to help the poor.<br><br>\<br><br>I don't know why you are looking at Republicans. There are plenty of<br>pro-choice Republicans out there. But I suppose the Republican Party<br>platform does say this:<br><br>> *We proudly stand for families and Life. We believe that the 14th<br>> Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no<br>> person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the<br>> States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights.<br>> After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the States<br>> and to a vote of the People. We will oppose Late Term Abortion, while<br>> supporting mothers and policies that advance Prenatal Care, access to<br>> Birth Control, and IVF (fertility treatments).*<br><br>So Republicans, clearly, support the idea that states (and the will<br>of the people in those states) get to decide for themselves whether<br>they will use state funding to support abortions. At the same time,<br>Republicans support policies that advance prenatal care, access to birth<br>control, and IVF.<br><br>So your contention that Republicans are for forcing women to carry a<br>child under any circumstance is clearly incorrect. The Republican party<br>platform says clearly that Republicans are for allowing states to decide<br>whether they will use state funds to pay for abortions. The rest is up<br>to you. No one is forcing anyone to do anything they don't willingly<br>choose to do, least of which is Republicans.<br><br>\<br><br>I don't think Republicans are against programs to help the poor. Many<br>Republican lawmakers argue that their policies aim to **empower the<br>poor through job creation and economic growth, reduced<br>government dependency, and work requirements** for benefits like<br>Medicaid and SNAP.<br><br>So it's not necessarily that Republicans are against all programs to<br>help the poor. Republicans are against wasteful programs which do some<br>good but also have a great deal of slop and waste which is what got us<br>in this mess in the first place.<br><br>\<br><br>It's not always a matter of "care" vs. "neglect." It's often a clash of<br>ideologies. Republicans tend to favor limited government and<br>personal responsibility and Democrats emphasize redistribution<br>and social safety nets, but both approaches aim to help the poor.<br>They just go about them in different ways.<br><br>So while Republicans may believe their approach helps the poor by<br>promoting independence, you may see it as **undermining essential<br>support systems**.<br><br>Both want to help, but both have different ideas about what constitutes<br>help. Republicans want to offer a "hand up" while Democrats want to<br>offer a "hand out." Both help, but in different ways.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
