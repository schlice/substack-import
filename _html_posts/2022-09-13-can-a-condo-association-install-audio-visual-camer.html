<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The short answer is yes, the Condo Association can indeed install<br>VIDEO cameras in a clubhouse that is used for residents to hold private<br>parties and other celebrations. Cameras can be installed in all common<br>areas, for the protection of those areas. Cameras cannot be installed in<br>any areas in which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy (i.e.<br>locker rooms, bathrooms, etc).<br><br>Yes, the Board of Directors can view those recordings. The Board is<br>the responsible party for protecting the facility.<br><br>Whether or not the recordings can include audio depends on how the<br>cameras are being used, and in what state the camera is installed. The<br>differences we're talking about are the differences between **two-party<br>consent states and one-party consent states**. Rather than go into<br>that legal distinction, in this case, the way the cameras are being used<br>means that **no parties to the conversation have consented to audio<br>recording, so audio cannot be recorded in a clubhouse.** For nearly all<br>cameras available on the market today which include microphones, they<br>have the ability to disable that microphone on their recordings. If your<br>Condo Association is recording audio, this needs to be addressed ASAP,<br>and that practice must be stopped.<br><br>While you don't have to install signage in most cases, it is definitely<br>advisable for the Board to do so. Not only does it deter unacceptable or<br>illegal activity, it advises homeowners that they are entering an area<br>protected by video surveillance, and gains tacit consent to monitoring<br>by entering the space. Basically, it means that once you agree to enter<br>the space, you consent to being recorded.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can a condo association install audio /visual cameras in a clubhouse<br>that is for residents to hold private parties and other celebrations.<br>And can any of the board members view these recording or are these only<br>available to Police?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
