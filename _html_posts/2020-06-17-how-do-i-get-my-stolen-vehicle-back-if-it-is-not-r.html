The car was stolen with the bill of sale and pink slip. Everything<br>was in the car.**<br><br>Hire an attorney.<br><br>But<br>[Dennis(https://www.quora.com/profile/Dennis-945)]{.qlink_container}<br>is correct, you have a tough row to hoe here. But you can make it work<br>if you can contact the previous owner and convince them to testify that<br>they sold the car to you. Receipts or bank statements showing the<br>transaction taking place and the money changing hands between you and<br>the previous owner would probably be enough to establish that you<br>actually did purchase the car when you said you did, and that the<br>current bill of sale and title were obtained fraudulently.<br><br>This is not impossible, but it is not easy. Good luck.<br><br>And for anyone else reading this, fair warning: **never store the title<br>to the car in the car itself.** Anyone with that title "owns" the car,<br>as they can pretty quickly generate a fake bill of sale showing you<br>"sold" the vehicle to them. They can then register the vehicle and all<br>is well.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
