<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, it's a fear, not a possibility. Secondly, it's borne of a<br>misunderstanding of what martial law is in the United States, which in<br>short means that martial law and overriding the 22nd Amendment to the<br>Constitution are completely unrelated.<br><br>Martial law involves the suspension of *habeas corpus*, which is<br>basically being arrested and held without a hearing. More broadly, it is<br>the oversight of law enforcement by the judicial branch. Article 1,<br>Section 9 states, \"The Privilege of the Writ of *Habeas Corpus* shall<br>not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the<br>public Safety may require it.\"<br><br>In these cases, the military takes over specific duties as appointed by<br>the president, to keep order or to preserve or maintain peace (the Posse<br>Comitatus Act covers this as well). Since the military would be in<br>charge, and is required to follow the Constitution (*sans* habeas<br>corpus), the military would *strongly encourage* the President to uphold<br>the 22nd Amendment.<br><br>However, just because habeas corpus is suspended doesn't mean the rest<br>of the Constitution is. There is still the First and Second Amendments<br>to deal with...<br><br>So in short, no president is going to extend his or her term until the<br>22nd Amendment is repealed. This means you would need widespread<br>national support to do so, and no president will engender such support.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
