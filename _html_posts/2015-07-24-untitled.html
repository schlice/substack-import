<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [I think you meant that most gun owners are opposed to<br>background checks that maintain a list of the weapons purchased and<br>serial numbers.\<br>\<br>Colorado shows that a person is authorized to purchase a gun or<br>authorized to sell a particular type of gun (handgun/rifle, etc). It<br>does not create a record of gun sales. The FFL provides a certificate<br>showing that the NICS checks were done and passed. That\'s all. It\'s up<br>to the seller to maintain that information.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-are-Republicans-against-gun-control/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
