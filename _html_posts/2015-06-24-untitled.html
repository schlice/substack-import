<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Police training includes an entire course of study (40<br>hours minimum in our department before an officer is sworn) called<br>Arrest Control. They are trained on techniques used to physically<br>restrain suspects and place them under arrest. The goal is to use the<br>minimum amount of force against a suspect and subdue them safely and in<br>a way which produces the least amount of injury to the suspect and to<br>the officer.\<br>\<br>Officers are trained on the use of every device or tool on their belts.<br>In most cases (except the baton and the firearm) they have to have the<br>device used on them. Every officer who carries a Taser has been hit by a<br>Taser (the full 15-second ride in my department). Now, they don\'t shoot<br>the barbs at us; they use a training Taser with electric leads and<br>alligator clips, but everyone gets to feel what it feels like and the<br>effect on the body, and the pain. They get to fire the Taser at practice<br>targets, so they can practice proper barb placement so as to avoid<br>injury and deliver the maximum effect to the suspect. Everyone who<br>carries pepper spray has been hit with pepper spray. We do have<br>paramedics available to help remove the oil from the skin, but we still<br>get hit with it and get to feel what it feels like on the<br>skin.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Are-American-police-officers-trained-to-kill-and-if-so-how/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
