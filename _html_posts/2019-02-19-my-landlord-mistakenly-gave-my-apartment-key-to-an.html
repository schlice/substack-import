What kind of attorney should I talk to?**<br><br>First, you should start with the theft. If you haven't filed a police<br>report, you should.<br><br>Once the thief is captured, the stolen property will be returned<br>(whatever property they still have possession of). The District<br>Attorney's office will represent the state in that action. They will<br>prosecute the thief, but that won't get you any money back for the items<br>which he/she stole.<br><br>You will have to then personally file suit against the thief for the<br>monetary value of the stolen items which you didn't get back, and the<br>landlord for granting access to your apartment to an unauthorized person<br>in violation of your lease agreement. You will need to hire a real<br>estate attorney in your area who specializes in landlord/tenant law to<br>help you with that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
