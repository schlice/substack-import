<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**As gun owners, why do you believe \"An armed society is a polite<br>society\"?**<br><br>This answer comes from a post called "[[Why the gun is<br>civilization](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b4201b&url=https://munchkinwrangler.wordpress.com/2007/03/23/why-the-gun-is-civilization/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wordpress.com"}]{.qlink_container}."<br><br>> Human beings only have two ways to deal with one another: reason and<br>> force. If you want me to do something for you, you have a choice of<br>> either convincing me via argument, or force me to do your bidding<br>> under threat of force. Every human interaction falls into one of those<br>> two categories, without exception. Reason or force, that's it.<br>><br>> In a truly moral and civilized society, people exclusively interact<br>> through persuasion. Force has no place as a valid method of social<br>> interaction, and the only thing that removes force from the menu is<br>> the personal firearm, as paradoxical as it may sound to some.<br>><br>> When I carry a gun, you cannot deal with me by force. You have to use<br>> reason and try to persuade me, because I have a way to negate your<br>> threat or employment of force. The gun is the only personal weapon<br>> that puts a 100-pound woman on equal footing with a 220-pound mugger,<br>> a 75-year old retiree on equal footing with a 19-year old gangbanger,<br>> and a single gay guy on equal footing with a carload of drunk guys<br>> with baseball bats. The gun removes the disparity in physical<br>> strength, size, or numbers between a potential attacker and a<br>> defender.<br>><br>> There are plenty of people who consider the gun as the source of bad<br>> force equations. These are the people who think that we'd be more<br>> civilized if all guns were removed from society, because a firearm<br>> makes it easier for a mugger to do his job. That, of course, is only<br>> true if the mugger's potential victims are mostly disarmed either by<br>> choice or by legislative fiat--it has no validity when most of a<br>> mugger's potential marks are armed. People who argue for the banning<br>> of arms ask for automatic rule by the young, the strong, and the many,<br>> and that's the exact opposite of a civilized society. A mugger, even<br>> an armed one, can only make a successful living in a society where the<br>> state has granted him a force monopoly.<br>><br>> Then there's the argument that the gun makes confrontations lethal<br>> that otherwise would only result in injury. This argument is<br>> fallacious in several ways. Without guns involved, confrontations are<br>> won by the physically superior party inflicting overwhelming injury on<br>> the loser. People who think that fists, bats, sticks, or stones don't<br>> constitute lethal force watch too much TV, where people take beatings<br>> and come out of it with a bloody lip at worst. The fact that the gun<br>> makes lethal force easier works solely in favor of the weaker<br>> defender, not the stronger attacker. If both are armed, the field is<br>> level. The gun is the only weapon that's as lethal in the hands of an<br>> octogenarian as it is in the hands of a weightlifter. It simply<br>> wouldn't work as well as a force equalizer if it wasn't both lethal<br>> and easily employable.<br>><br>> When I carry a gun, I don't do so because I am looking for a fight,<br>> but because I'm looking to be left alone. The gun at my side means<br>> that I cannot be forced, only persuaded. I don't carry it because I'm<br>> afraid, but because it enables me to be unafraid. It doesn't limit the<br>> actions of those who would interact with me through reason, only the<br>> actions of those who would do so by force. It removes force from the<br>> equation...and that's why carrying a gun is a civilized act.<br><br>Let me pull out a few quotes from that piece:<br><br>**People who argue for the banning of arms ask for automatic rule by the<br>young, the strong, and the many, and that's the exact opposite of a<br>civilized society.**<br><br>**A mugger, even an armed one, can only make a successful living in a<br>society where the state has granted him a force monopoly.**<br><br>**The gun at my side means that I cannot be forced, only persuaded.<br>\...\ It doesn't limit the actions of those who would interact with me<br>through reason, only the actions of those who would do so by force.
