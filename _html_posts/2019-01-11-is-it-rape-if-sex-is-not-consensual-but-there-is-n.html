<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it rape if sex is not consensual, but there is no refusal<br>signaled?**<br><br>Depends on where you are. The definition of consent varies.<br><br>In the United States, it depends on the state. There are roughly five<br>states in the US where you must get affirmative consent. California<br>requires affirmative consent not just for adults, but for anyone of any<br>age (personally, I find it problematic to have a high school affirmative<br>consent law when non-adults cannot legally consent to sex anyway, but we<br>are talking about California here). In these states, you can only have<br>consensual sex when both parties actively agree. We call these "yes<br>means yes" states.<br><br>[[Affirmative Consent Laws (Yes Means Yes) State by<br>State](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ba3431&url=http://affirmativeconsent.com/affirmative-consent-laws-state-by-state/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="affirmativeconsent.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>For every other state in the country, it's not "yes means yes," it's "no<br>means no." In order to be sexual assault, someone must say no. In those<br>states, you only have "non-consensual" sex when someone says no. When<br>one party says no, both parties must disengage immediately.<br><br>Additionally, both parties must be able to say yes or no in order to<br>actually consent in any state. So if someone is drunk, they can't<br>actually say yes or no with a clear mind, so that *implies* no.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
