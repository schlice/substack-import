<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Certainly sounds logical. If God knows all (omnipotent), why do we have<br>to pray? He already knows what we need! Why doesn't he just give us<br>everything that he knows we need?<br><br>There are a few reasons why.<br><br>1.  God doesn't give us what *we* need. God gives us what *he wants us<br>    to have.*<br>2.  God knows exactly what you desire, but he wants to hear from you<br>    anyway.<br><br>There is a very big misunderstanding about prayer. Prayer is thought to<br>be this sort of "vending machine" relationship: we say the prayer and<br>the gift pops out of the little door at the bottom. And if we *don't*<br>get what we prayed for, then God must not exist, or if he does, he's<br>unloving.<br><br>But this is a fundamental misunderstanding about why God is gracious to<br>us, and what effect prayer has.<br><br>God doesn't give us things *because we asked for them*. God gives us<br>things *because it's part of his plan.* If we get something which we<br>asked for in prayer, it's because God already wanted you to have that<br>something, because having that something is part of his plan. God<br>doesn't abandon his plan for you because you asked for something in<br>prayer. If that prayer comports with his plan, then he will give you<br>what you asked for. So just know that if you prayed for something and<br>you didn't get it, it's because that thing is not part of God's plan for<br>you.<br><br>I'm learning that winning the Powerball is not part of God's plan for<br>me. I'll still ask, and God knows my heart and knows that I'd certainly<br>be a good steward of that money, but that's just not part of his plan<br>for me. I'm also learning that he won't remove this thorn from my side<br>(MS) just because I asked, because having MS is part of his plan for me.<br>As he said, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made<br>perfect in weakness." (2 Cor 12)<br><br>And while God already knows what he wants you to have, he doesn't always<br>just give it to you, *because God created you for* *relationship**.*<br>This is one of the reasons that the pandemic was so mentally trying on<br>people. We were created for togetherness. We were created for<br>relationship. And God desires nothing more than for you to love him and<br>be in relationship with him. *That's* what he wants. He wants to express<br>his love to you through his relationship. He wants to know you *in the<br>way you see your life!* He wants you to talk to him! He wants you to<br>tell him about your day. He wants you to tell him what was good, what<br>was bad, how you're feeling, what you're thinking; again, even though he<br>already knows.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why doesn\'t God just give us what we need if he knows we need them?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
