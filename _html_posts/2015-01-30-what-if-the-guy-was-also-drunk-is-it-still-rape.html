<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Ultimately, the law says that she has to be able to<br>consent. If she is not able to consent, it\'s rape.\<br>\<br>His state of mind is not at issue. Since in most jurisdictions, rape is<br>a crime that a man commits against a woman, the committing of the crime<br>turns on whether or not the woman has consented, and continues to<br>consent, during sex. She must be lucid enough to consent to sex. If she<br>cannot consent, it is rape.\<br>\<br>Whether or not she pursues rape charges is a different story.\<br>\<br>And yes, in some jurisdictions, the man can say that he did not consent<br>and that he was raped against his will.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
