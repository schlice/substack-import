<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Hamas is going for *shock value*, which is exactly what they got. But<br>they expected *more of the same* reaction from Israel, which is not<br>what they are going to get.<br><br>The IDF is going to go into Gaza, and they are going to go<br>house-by-house, building-by-building, picking slowly and painstakingly<br>through each and every one, separating out the unwitting civilian human<br>shields, and killing the Hamas terrorists. They will have to flood all<br>of the underground tunnels that Hamas built to move around freely<br>without attracting unwanted IDF attention. They will have to manually<br>excise Hamas from the picture completely, without simply glassing the<br>entirety of the Gaza Strip, which they will not do.<br><br>When they are done, they will likely offer the remaining people in Gaza<br>the same choice they did after the Six Day War: *if you accept Israel's<br>sovereignty and right to exist, and accept Israeli control over this<br>land, you can live here, freely, in peace, as full citizens of Israel.*<br>It's a great deal. For the Arabs in Gaza, they'd be among the only Arabs<br>living as full citizens in a European democracy. And just as after the<br>Six Day War, some will take that deal.<br><br>Others will not, and this time, they will be asked to leave. Which is a<br>problem for Israel, because *none of the "enlightened" Arab nations<br>around Israel wants to take them*. Those Arab nations want to continue<br>using them as pawns to either expand Arab rule in the region, or use<br>them as an excuse to invade Israel. They desperately want those Arabs to<br>stay in Israel, but in defiance of Israel. They want those Arabs to be<br>the foothold they keep within Israel, or be the canaries in the cages<br>who die at Israel's hand, and become the justification for a full-scale<br>invasion of Israel. Accordingly, Israel cannot afford to keep them there<br>in that condition any longer. They must either swear allegiance to<br>Israel, or leave. The bloodshed must stop.<br><br>The bottom line is this: *Israelis are tired of war.* They are tired of<br>rockets. They are tired of suicide bombers. They just want it all to<br>stop and everyone to live in peace. Hamas was tired of living in *what<br>they see* as an open-air prison, even though it is a prison of their own<br>making.<br><br>The truth about the situation in Israel is this:<br><br>*If Hamas lays down their guns today, there will be no more war.\<br>If the Jews lay down their guns today, there will be no more Jews.*<br><br>Think about that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
