<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'll ignore the logical fallacy of "most civilized countries" and<br>pretend that you're just ignorant of logical fallacies and not<br>attempting to be intentionally inflammatory. We'll just address the rest<br>of the question.<br><br>So if I understand what you're asking, you want to know that if someone<br>wants a "suicide by cop," why would the police shoot them?<br><br>First of all, isn't it possible that the suspect is *lying?* Perhaps<br> he doesn't really want a suicide by cop, and perhaps he just wants<br>to *kill a cop!* There are people out there who simply want to kill<br>cops.<br><br>Nevertheless, if the person has a gun or a sword, and he wants to kill a<br>cop, or if he wants a suicide by cop, *does that make his bullets any<br>less lethal? Or make his sword any less lethal?*<br><br>The goal in policing is to enforce the law to the best of your ability<br>**and go home in your own car, not in an ambulance or (God forbid) the<br>coroner's van.**<br><br>If someone presents lethal force to you, the time to talk about his<br>motives has long since passed. You are being presented with lethal force<br>and you have a fraction of a second to decide what to do. At this point,<br>training takes over, and you respond with lethal force. Remember that in<br>all cases, the goal is not to kill. Similarly, the goal is also not to<br>*not kill*. The goal is to *stop the act.* The firearm is the most<br>effective way to stop someone using lethal force in an expeditious,<br>accurate manner while reducing the risk of collateral damage.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
