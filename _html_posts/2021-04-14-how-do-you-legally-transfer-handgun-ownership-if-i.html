Sign and date, keep for a few years.<br><br>But private transfers in Indiana do not require background checks.<br>Neither do private sales, but in that case, I'd do a firearms bill of<br>sale and keep that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
