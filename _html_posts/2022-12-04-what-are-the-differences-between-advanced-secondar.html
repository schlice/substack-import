<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The difference is in the name, not the symptoms.<br><br>Primary Progressive MS (PPMS) is MS that begins its journey with<br>worsening symptoms with no signs of remission.<br><br>Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS) usually begins as Relapsing-Remitting MS<br>(RRMS), but then eventually a relapse will occur and never remit, thus<br>signaling the transition to *secondary* progressive MS.<br><br>Without treatment, RRMS will transition to SPMS within about 10 years.<br>With treatment, that transition can be extended for quite some time.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional medical advice.
