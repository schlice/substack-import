<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I took a World Religions class in college. Granted, it was an elective,<br>but it gave me the insight to understand how to answer this question.<br><br>And the answer is: **in no way should such a class ever become a<br>requirement.**<br><br>Why is that?<br><br>Simple. My final exam was *one single essay question* and it was simply<br>an exercise in finding the "common thread" throughout all world<br>religions. The question was a pluralistic-style question which basically<br>said, as its subtone, "What you've learned throughout your time in this<br>class is that all major religions teach the same thing. They all see the<br>same God in different ways."<br><br>This is, quite simply put, untrue.<br><br>While most major world religions share some moral foundations (as they<br>should, since morals are inborn gifts of our Creator), the major world<br>religions differ on just about everything else. The nature of God, the<br>nature of man, sin, salvation, heaven, hell, and creation. They differ<br>on all of it.<br><br>And while most religions have some beliefs that are true, not all<br>religious beliefs are true, because they are *mutually exclusive*. That<br>means that some beliefs must be wrong. But in America (as this class<br>taught), you're not supposed to say that. You're supposed to be<br>"tolerant" of all other religions, and "tolerance" today doesn't mean<br>simply accepting that other people believe differently than you, even if<br>it is false. "Tolerance" today means *you must accept that every one of<br>their beliefs is as true as yours.*<br><br>Not only is this idea wrong, it's dangerously wrong. For example, if<br>Christianity is true, then there would be eternal consequences to not<br>being Christian. Similarly, if Islam is true, there would be eternal<br>consequences to not being Muslim.<br><br>Additionally, the pluralistic view that all religions must be right is,<br>in itself, an absolute moral position. Why can't we question the truth<br>of other's beliefs? Is it immoral to do so? And by whose standards? Do<br>the pluralists have any evidence to support the moral imperative to<br>*not* question anyone else's beliefs? Or is it just their own opinion<br>that they are using the educational system to impose on everyone else?<br><br>As you can see, there are some pretty significant dangers which would<br>have to be ironed out of any World Religions class before it should ever<br>be offered, and definitely before it ever becomes a mandatory offering.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Would you support a requirement of students to take a world religions<br>class to graduate from high school or college? Why or why not?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
