<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In most cases, state law surrounding CCW will dictate<br>proper conduct at a traffic stop.\<br>\<br>For example, in Colorado, you are required by law to immediately notify<br>an officer conducting a traffic stop that you are carrying concealed and<br>you have a permit. You are advised to keep your hands firmly attached to<br>your steering wheel until the officer tells you how he wants to handle<br>the stop. You are also required to fully know and understand the law<br>regarding where and when you can carry.\<br>\<br>If you live in a CCW state that does not require immediate notification,<br>I would only advise the officer that I\'m carrying if I\'m about to put<br>my hand anywhere near my weapon, or if I\'m asked to get out of the car.<br>For example, if the officer asked for my license, I might say, \"Before<br>I get my license, I need to inform you that I have a concealed weapons<br>permit and I am carrying on my right hip, near my wallet. Is it okay for<br>me to get my wallet, or should I do something else?\" If I\'m asked to<br>get out of the car, I\'d say, \"Before I get out of the car, I need to<br>inform you that I have a concealed weapons permit and I am carrying on<br>my right hip. How would you like me to proceed?\"\<br>This sort of slow attention to detail seems annoying, but is crucially<br>important, because if my concealed weapon inadvertently becomes<br>\"unconcealed\" during the stop and I didn\'t notify the officer that I<br>have a permit, he will likely perceive the fact that I am armed to be a<br>threat, and I\'ll likely end up at gunpoint, something which could have<br>easily been avoided with *using my words.*\<br>\<br>*It\'s not hard. It doesn\'t cost you anything to use your<br>words.*]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
