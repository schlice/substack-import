<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It sounds like you might be asking, "What are some other things that we<br>are rational to believe that science can't prove?"<br><br>There are plenty of things that we are all rational to believe exist<br>even though science can't prove them. For example:<br><br>- Math and logic. Science can't prove them, because science *presupposes<br>  them.*<br>- Aesthetic judgements. Science can't prove that a sunset is beautiful.<br>- Ethical judgements. Science can't prove that the Nazis were evil. The<br>  beautiful, like the good, cannot be proven with a scientific test.<br>- Metaphysical truths such as the fact that there are minds which exist<br>  outside of my own.<br><br>And surprisingly,<br><br>- Science itself. The belief that the scientific method discovers truth<br>  can't be proven by the scientific method. You cannot prove the tools<br>  of science (the laws of logic, the Law of Causality, the Principle of<br>  Uniformity, or the reliability of observation) by running some kind of<br>  experiment. You have to assume those things are true in order to do<br>  the experiment!<br><br>So while it's true that science can't prove the "concept of God," there<br>are plenty of other things that we are all rational to believe even<br>though science can't prove them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
