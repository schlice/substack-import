<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think you may be missing the forest for the trees.<br><br>It may be true that the majority of violent crime is perpetrated by men.<br>This may also be because, biologically, men tend to be more aggressive<br>than women. On balance, men have more testosterone than estrogen, and we<br>know that testosterone can increase aggressive behavior.<br><br>So what you've noted is a well-known feature of human physiology, not a<br>way by which we can address the problem of violence in society.<br><br>We still need to focus on the drivers of violence in general in society,<br>rather than looking at gender roles in who perpetuates that violence.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
