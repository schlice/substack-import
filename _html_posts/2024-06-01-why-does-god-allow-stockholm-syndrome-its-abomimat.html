<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Cool, a two-fer! Two questions in one! Let's jump right in:<br><br>> Why does God allow stockholm syndrome?<br><br>Why does God allow *any* evil to exist in the world?<br><br>First of all, **if you believe that somehow God is obligated to explain<br>Himself to us, you ought to do a better job reading the Bible**.<br>Proverbs 25:2 says, "It is the glory of God to conceal a matter." Isaiah<br>45:15 says, "Truly You are a God who hides Himself." First Corinthians<br>2:11 says, "No one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God."<br>Deuteronomy 29:29 says, "The secret things belong to the Lord our God"<br>(NKJV). Ecclesiastes 11:5 says, "As you do not know the path of the<br>wind, or how the body is formed in a mother's womb, so you cannot<br>understand the work of God, the Maker of all things." Isaiah 55:8--9<br>says, "'For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My<br>ways,' declares the Lord. 'As the heavens are higher than the earth, so<br>are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts higher than your<br>thoughts.'"<br><br>It appears as if the Bible is telling us we don't have the capacity to<br>understand God's infinite mind or the plans He has for us. It's<br>arrogance for us to believe we have the ability to understand the mind<br>of God. It's like you standing over a pregnant mother's womb and trying<br>to explain what life is like on the other side, in such a way that the<br>baby in the womb would understand. That baby simply doesn't yet possess<br>the capacity to understand. Paul told the believers in Corinth, "Now we<br>see but a poor reflection; then we shall see face to face. Now, I know<br>in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known" (1 Cor.<br>13:12). Paul was basically saying that we may not ever gain full<br>understanding while we are alive on earth, and we probably need to learn<br>to accept that.<br><br>Secondly, **no one ever said that being a Christian would mean a<br>problem-free life**. If you've ever looked into any of the lives of the<br>great men and women of the Bible, their lives were not the most<br>glamorous. Look at Joseph. His brothers and sisters hated him so much,<br>they sold him into slavery. When in Egypt, he was thrown in prison,<br>falsely accused of rape, and threatened with execution. During the<br>entire ordeal, there is no indication in the Bible that God explained<br>his plan to Joseph. He was simply expected to live out his life in<br>less-than-complete understanding, as you and I are. *What pleased God<br>was Joseph's faithfulness when nothing else made sense*. Stephen was<br>stoned because he proclaimed God's name. James was put to death with a<br>sword for his faithfulness. Paul was persecuted, stoned, flogged, and<br>beheaded in a Roman prison. During their lifetimes, they never knew<br>God's great plan for them. Jesus even said that life wouldn't be easy.<br>He said, "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have<br>peace. In this world, you will have trouble. But take heart! I have<br>overcome the world" (John 16:33).<br><br>Throughout the Bible, it tells us not only that bad times can happen,<br>but that we should *expect* bad times to come because we live in a<br>*fallen world. Bad times will come.* Yet somehow, we still expect God to<br>take away all of our problems, spearheading our walk through life with<br>his massive cosmic leaf-blower, clearing our path of any trials,<br>hardships, or pain. This causes a great deal of anxiety, even among<br>long-time faithful, because life is hard.<br><br>The Bible tells us to not bother trying to understand, not to bother<br>trying to make all the pieces fit together. "Trust in the Lord, lean not<br>on your own understanding" (Prov. 3:5). We are not told to not try to<br>understand, just don't "lean on" your understanding, which means don't<br>make it an ultimatum. "God, you'd better explain yourself, or I'm outta<br>here!" That would be "leaning" on your own understanding, and we are<br>admonished against that.<br><br>So what does this all mean? Basically, expect trouble in life, and<br>expect that there will be situations we do not understand. Faith is the<br>point at which logic stops making sense. We must have faith that God<br>will keep His promises, and that everything we go through in this life<br>has a purpose, even though our minds do not have the capacity to<br>understand it.<br><br>> **why does he allow and grant heaven for severely mentaly noncapable<br>> people who can't understand complex thing like God or religion**<br><br>So rather than focusing on mental handicaps, let's zoom out a little.<br>Because while the Bible doesn't address it specifically, it does talk<br>about babies and children, and the same principles can be applied to the<br>mentally handicapped.<br><br>The bottom line is that God doesn't condemn people for things they have<br>no ability to do (cf John 9:38-41). According to this principle, babies<br>and young children who are unable to accept or reject Christ are not<br>held accountable for that unbelief. Similarly, those with mental<br>handicaps who are unable to accept or reject Christ are not held<br>responsible for that either. The Bible says that those who face<br>judgement are those who refuse to acknowledge what is "clearly seen" and<br>"understood" concerning God (Romans 1:20). People who, upon seeing and<br>evaluating the evidence of nature, make the choice to reject God are<br>"without excuse." *Those* are the people for whom hell will be their<br>final destination.<br><br>> its just unfair<br><br>*UNFAIR????* *Are you certain you want what's fair?*<br><br>Because that's justice: *everyone gets exactly what they deserve*.<br>And we, each and every one of us, have sinned. We have all fallen short<br>of God's glory. Every one, without fail. If God were to *fairly*<br>judge every one of us today, we would all absolutely deserve hell. That<br>would be JUST: we would each get exactly what we deserve.<br><br>We should rejoice that God tempers His justice with MERCY and GRACE.<br>Mercy means we don't get what we deserve (and that's to go straight to<br>hell), and grace means we get what we don't deserve (a Savior who took<br>the penalty we deserve on our behalf). He gave us this gift of grace<br>WHILE WE WERE STILL SINNERS! Christ died for us while we were still<br>sinners. What an amazing gift!<br><br>God never promises that everything will always be "fair." But He<br>promises that He will temper His justice with His grace, and for that,<br>He deserves our praise.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
