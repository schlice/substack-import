<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is "it depends."<br><br>Most modern smartphones have batteries which should last around 2 years<br>under normal use, which happens to coincide with the average amount of<br>time smartphone users hang on to any particular handset. So most people<br>will just trade in or sell their old handsets and get new ones.<br><br>You could consider replacing your battery. For Android devices, many<br>repair shops will sell you a new battery and install it for you, and it<br>will probably run you about \$100. Apple [[also has a<br>service](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=934eaf&url=https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/service/battery-power){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="apple.com"}]{.qlink_container} which will allow you to get<br>your battery replaced. If your phone is covered by AppleCare+, battery<br>replacements are free. If it is not under warranty, a battery<br>replacement will cost you anywhere from \$49 to \$69.<br><br>If you have an Android smartphone, you can potentially flash a new<br>operating system on to your device when your battery starts to hold less<br>charge. LineageOS is a good one, and they support many different Android<br>devices. You can breathe new life into your phone, while getting better<br>battery life out of a battery which may be headed downhill. Just<br>remember that doing so would void any warranty you had (if you still<br>had hardware warranty), so don't even consider doing this until after<br>your hardware warranty expires.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Should you replace your smartphone after the battery life decreases?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
