<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No.<br><br>But I *can* agree that a person who chose a pet over **a<br>spouse wasn't meant to get married to that spouse**.<br><br>People with pets get married all the time. You do know that you don't<br>*have* to choose your pet over your spouse, right?<br><br>It's just that sometimes, a person will give an *ultimatum* to their<br>spouse, and will force them to "choose the pet or me."<br><br>In marriage, that's unfair. It is unfair to try to force your spouse to<br>do things your way. You are both equals in marriage; no one has<br>exclusive authority over the other. You work out your differences; you<br>don't force your spouse into a decision which they do not want to make.<br><br>So if you're going to *force* your spouse to make an inherently<br>unfair choice, don't be surprised if that spouse decides that you're not<br>the person they want to be married to. And it's not because they chose<br>the pet over you, it's because they chose the pet over a person who is<br>too unreasonable to consider continuing to be married to a pet owner.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Do you agree that people who choose their pets over their spouse aren\'t<br>meant to get married?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
