<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Anyone can go back on their word. A judge\'s \"word\" is<br/>as good as anyone else\'s. But if your judge\'s \"word\" wasn\'t in<br/>writing somewhere, as in a ruling dropping your charges contingent on a<br/>clean record for the next 60 days, then you\'re SOL.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
