<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you tried to shoot someone without knowing the gun just had blanks,<br>would you be charged with attempted murder?**<br><br>Yes. You fit all the elements of the crime, except for the unlawful<br>termination of a life. You even took an action in furtherance of the<br>crime (you discharged a gun in someone's direction, even though it was<br>only loaded with blanks, which you did not know).<br><br>So for example, if I gave you a gun and told you it was loaded, and you<br>fired it at someone, you could be charged with attempted murder.<br><br>As far as your *mens rea*, you were in the appropriate state of mind to<br>be a murderer, even though you failed to complete the *actus reus*.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
