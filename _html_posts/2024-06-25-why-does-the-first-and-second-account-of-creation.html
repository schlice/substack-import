<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because some believers are not really good at Biblical exegesis.<br><br>The first account of creation looks at the entire week, and the second<br>account of creation looks only at the sixth day.<br><br>As for the rest of the supposed contradictions:<br><br>> There are two primary claims of contradictions between Genesis<br>> chapters 1---2. The first is in regard to plant life. Genesis 1:11<br>> records God creating vegetation on the third day. Genesis 2:5 states<br>> that prior to the creation of man "no shrub of the field had yet<br>> appeared on the earth and no plant of the field had yet sprung up, for<br>> the LORD God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no man to<br>> work the ground." There is no contradiction, though, because Genesis<br>> 2:5 does not say how long before man's creation there was no plant<br>> life. In fact, the previous verse mentions the first and second days<br>> of creation (at which point there were no plants), so it makes sense<br>> that Genesis 2:5 would mention there were no plants. Several days of<br>> creation occur between Genesis 2:6 and Genesis 2:7. Verse 7 details<br>> the creation of man on the sixth day. Verse 8 mentions the garden that<br>> God had created for him---the fourth day is spoken of in the past<br>> tense. The trees that God makes to grow in verse 9 are those in the<br>> garden. So the passages do not contradict. Genesis 1:11 speaks of God<br>> creating vegetation on the third day; Genesis 2:5 speaks of the first<br>> and second days when there was no vegetation; and Genesis 2:9 speaks<br>> of the specific growth of trees in Eden.<br>><br>> The second claimed contradiction is in regard to animal life. Genesis<br>> 1:24-25 records God creating animal life on the sixth day, before He<br>> created man. Genesis 2:19, in some translations, seems to record God<br>> creating the animals after He had created man. However, a good and<br>> plausible translation of Genesis 2:19-20 reads, "Now the LORD God had<br>> formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds<br>> of the air. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them,<br>> and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.<br>> So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the air and<br>> all the beasts of the field." The text does not say that God created<br>> man, then created the animals, and then brought the animals to the<br>> man. Rather, the text says, "Now the LORD God had \already\ created<br>> all the animals." There is no contradiction. On the sixth day, God<br>> created the animals, then created man, and then brought the animals to<br>> the man, allowing the man to name the<br>> animals.\[1\](#oWLyg){#cite-oWLyg .citation_link}<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-oWLyg){.citation_index} [[Why are there two different<br>Creation accounts in Genesis chapters<br>1-2?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4f37e0&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/two-Creation-accounts.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
