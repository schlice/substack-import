<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Certainly, some people believe that humans have rights because they are<br>an extension of "mammals rights." While the idea that humans have rights<br>that are an extension of \"mammal rights\" raises important ethical<br>considerations about the shared capacity for sentience and the need to<br>avoid suffering, it\'s also crucial to acknowledge the **unique<br>capacities and interests** that underpin the full scope of human rights.<br>The debate continues about the most appropriate ways to address the<br>moral status and protection of animals within a framework that *also*<br>recognizes the distinct qualities of human beings.<br><br>Human rights are unique to humans and exist *because* humans exist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
