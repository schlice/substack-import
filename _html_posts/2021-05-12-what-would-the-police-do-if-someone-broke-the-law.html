How?<br>Ultimately, a small group can't overpower the state.<br><br>The person's security guards may be able to call for backup, but the<br>backup will never be able to reach the suspect, as the police will<br>cordon off the area. Same with helicopter support; the FAA can restrict<br>helicopter traffic in that area if the police declare a local emergency.<br><br>Finally, if the police escalate the issue high enough, the governor (for<br>whom the state's police ultimately work) can activate the National<br>Guard. The governor can also appeal to nearby states or the federal<br>government if the force overwhelms the fully-constituted force of the<br>state's National Guard. And the federal government can send the US Armed<br>Forces to assist the state in quelling the insurrection. And before you<br>tell me that the US Armed Forces can't intervene, read some of the<br>oldest legislation in the country: the *Posse Comitatus Act* and the<br>*Insurrection Act.*<br><br>In other words, a small group simply can't overpower the state.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What would the police do if someone broke the law but had the best<br>trained security guards to stand in the way of arrest and also have the<br>ability to call for backup or even call for helicopter support?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
