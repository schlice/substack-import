A landlord can only grant police entry<br>without your permission if the police have a valid search warrant or if<br>there is a bona fide police emergency. Otherwise, the landlord is bound<br>by the normal landlord-tenant rules which state that a landlord must<br>give written notice before he enters a rented property to perform<br>maintenance without the tenant being present.<br><br>If the landlord unlawfully granted entry to the police into your<br>apartment without a warrant and evidence was collected, the evidence<br>would be inadmissible and anything resulting from the evidence would be<br>similarly inadmissible.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
