<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If we decide that women are nothing more than "baby factories" and they<br>can produce babies, give them up for adoption, and receive compensation,<br>then sure, why not.<br><br>But women are not "baby factories." There are no industries which exist<br>for creating and delivering babies to anyone. Babies are not a<br>"commodity" which are traded for compensation. No one is "compensated"<br>when they give a baby up for adoption. Giving a baby up for adoption is<br>an acknowledgement that a woman is not ready to, or is not in a<br>financial position to, become a mother, but she had a baby anyway.<br><br>I should think that the freedom to actually give up your baby for<br>adoption without cost to you is compensation enough, wouldn't you? The<br>ability to have a baby and then just "walk away" is probably a pretty<br>valuable thing, if we're considering value. But I suppose if you have<br>the moral capability to devalue baby life, you can consider the baby a<br>tradable commodity instead of a human being.<br><br>And let's not forget, when the woman gives up the baby, the state<br>becomes the *de facto* parent, and the taxpayers foot the cost of<br>raising that baby. Increased babies means increased taxes. Why would we<br>incentivize women to do this? Why would we compensate women and then pay<br>to raise their babies? Did you really want your state taxes to go up<br>that much? If *Roe* is overturned, taxes will have to go up as the state<br>works harder to match more babies with adoptive parents. There are still<br>plenty of adoptive parents out there, so that's not the issue. But the<br>state will have to process more adoptions, so their costs will<br>necessarily increase. Adding compensation for the mother incentivizes<br>women to get pregnant and give up their babies for adoption, and that's<br>still not the ideal solution. The state generally does not incentivize<br>solutions which are not ideal for the child, as they have a compelling<br>interest to promote the best outcome for the child.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Shall women be compensated for their contribution to the domestic supply<br>of infants after Roe v.
