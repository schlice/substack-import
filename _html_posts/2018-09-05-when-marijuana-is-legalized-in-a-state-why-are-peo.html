<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**When marijuana is legalized in a state, why do people who are in jail<br>for marijuana related crimes not released from prison?**<br><br>First of all, a point of clarification. Since marijuana is illegal at<br>the Federal level, states don't actually "make it legal," since this is<br>unconstitutional. What states do is *change the state-level punishment*<br>by essentially removing the state-level punishment for violating that<br>Federal law altogether. So long as it is the state processing that<br>crime, then there is no punishment.<br><br>Anyway, there are several reasons why people who are currently in prison<br>aren't automatically released:<br><br>1.  The Constitution has a restriction (Article I, Section 10, Clause 1)<br>    on *ex post facto* laws. These are laws that *retroactively* changes<br>    the status, or consequences, of a law before it was enacted. It<br>    could either make the punishment more severe, or less severe, for<br>    crimes which were previously committed. Therefore, the legalization<br>    of marijuana doesn't change what happened to people who were already<br>    convicted.<br>2.  Punishments for any crime are given at the time that the case is<br>    prosecuted, and generally it means that if a law exists at the time<br>    you committed the crime, that's the law you are prosecuted under.<br>    Even if *the next day* the law were to change, you are still subject<br>    to the law on the day you committed the crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
