<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it a landlord's responsibility to fix everything a tenant breaks?<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>Usually, your lease agreement will spell out how you go about getting<br>repairs, and what they will do if they find a repair to be your fault<br>and not covered under your standard lease agreement.<br><br>Generally, in that situation, the landlord will fix the issue and will<br>bill you for the repair. Sometimes, landlords will tell tenants to<br>contract out the repair (and pay for it). Sometimes, they will simply<br>deduct the cost of the repair from your security deposit. But in nearly<br>all circumstances, the decision about how to proceed is solely up to the<br>landlord to decide.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
