<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>To be fair, you've already done your due diligence. Your MRI doesn't<br>show the signs of someone with MS, so it is highly unlikely you have MS.<br><br>Note that I didn't say "impossible." I only said "highly unlikely." Is<br>it *possible* to have MS and have no visible lesions on an MRI? Yes, it<br>is possible.<br><br>There are other tests that can add to the body of evidence, such as a<br>lumbar puncture (i.e. a spinal tap), and VEP (visual evoked potential)<br>which can also add to the body of evidence. You can talk to your<br>neurologist about these if you are still concerned.<br><br>Remember, MS is a diagnosis of exclusion, so before you can diagnose MS,<br>you must exclude *everything* that can possibly cause your symptoms,<br>because MS doesn't have any symptoms unique to it.<br><br>I would not worry about a particular disease. I would focus on trying to<br>find the cause for the symptoms you are experiencing. There are many<br>forms of peripheral neuropathy which can cause leg pain and optic<br>neuritis.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
