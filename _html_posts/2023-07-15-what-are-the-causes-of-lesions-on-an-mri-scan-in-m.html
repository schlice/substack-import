<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The lesions (or scars), called *scleroses,* on an MRI scan occur because<br>of the disease action. By the way, that's where the name "multiple<br>sclerosis" comes from ("many scars").<br><br>In MS, the immune system mistakes the myelin sheath surrounding nerve<br>fibers as a foreign invader, and sends lymphocytes to attack the myelin<br>in a process called *demyelination*. In its place are left *plaques* or<br>*scars* made primarily of cholesterol. These areas of demyelination<br>prevent nerve signals from traversing at their original speed, causing<br>the corresponding response at the muscle to be less than the brain<br>intended. This is what produces the variety of physical symptoms of the<br>disease.<br><br>This is also an *inflammatory* process, which contributes to the poor<br>nerve response across the areas of demyelination.<br><br>In most cases, the scars never disappear, and what results is *gliosis*<br>where the nerve cells die and are replaced with glial cells. The white<br>spots on MRI (indicating lesions) are replaced with completely black<br>spots (indicating gliosis).<br><br>In some cases, if the body is given enough breathing room through the<br>use of certain medications, the brain can heal itself and some of these<br>lesions can shrink. I experienced this myself while I was on Tysabri.<br>The disease process was so well controlled that my body had at least a<br>little bit of a chance to heal itself, and some of my lesions shrank.<br>And myelin isn't easily rebuilt; the body doesn't naturally remyelinate<br>nerve cells. Studies are underway to attempt to force the body to<br>remyelinate damaged nerve cells, but it does not do so naturally.<br><br>Unfortunately though, in the vast majority of cases, the damage caused<br>by MS is permanent. This is why the recommendation of most neurologists<br>is to take the "conservative" approach: conserve as much brain matter as<br>possible. Get ahead of the disease process. Treat it before it becomes<br>critical, because (to shamelessly steal the pull quote from stroke<br>awareness) time lost is brain lost.<br><br>Keep s'myelin!<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional medical advice.
