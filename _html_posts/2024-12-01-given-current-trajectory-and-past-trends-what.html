<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So let's look at "current trajectory."<br><br>Since this question was posted in the "Christians and Christianity"<br>Space, it's fair to look at Christianity. Therefore, "current<br>trajectory" is *increasing* worldwide. In 2023, the Christian population<br>was estimated to be around 2.604 billion, a 44.5 million increase from<br>mid-2022. By 2024, the Christian population is expected to grow to 2.63<br>billion. And by 2050, the Christian population is projected to reach 3<br>billion or more.<br><br>So given current trajectory, the concept of organized religion will<br>never disappear.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
