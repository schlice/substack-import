<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you sue the city for damage to your vehicle caused by a pothole in<br>the road?**<br><br>Indeed, you can sue the city, but there are some relatively steep legal<br>challenges you must overcome before you will get any money.<br><br>First, you'll have to prove that the city was negligent. Just because a<br>pothole exists doesn't mean that the city was negligent in its duty to<br>fill it. Was the pothole reported to the city? How long have they known<br>about the hole? What are their standard timeframes for filling holes<br>after someone notifies them of its presence? If a pothole has been<br>reported to the city and was known about for months, and then it damages<br>a car, I think it's fairly clear that the city might be negligent. But<br>if a pothole is reported at noon and a car hits that pothole at 1 pm, it<br>would be much tougher to claim that the city was negligent.<br><br>Second is the set of rules that each city has for filing lawsuits.<br>Generally, you have a very short period of time to notify the state<br>agency, and another short period of time to file a lawsuit. If you<br>exceed those timeframes (sometimes in some states and cities as short as<br>30 days), you cannot bring an action against the city.<br><br>Finally, you have to think about comparative negligence. In a negligence<br>lawsuit, under comparative negligence laws in most states, the defendant<br>will also try to show that the plaintiff was negligent. Could you have<br>avoided the pothole? If you knew of its existence, did you report it to<br>the city yourself, or did you assume that "someone else" would take care<br>of it? Could you have taken another route? Was the pothole large enough<br>that you should have been able to see it and should have been able to<br>easily avoid it? If you as the plaintiff are also found to be negligent,<br>any amount you receive will be reduced by the percentage of your own<br>negligence. For example, if you were found to be 30% at fault in the<br>accident, your award would be reduced by the 30% which was your fault.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
