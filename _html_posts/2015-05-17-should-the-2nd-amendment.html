<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Since I was A2A, I\'ll answer.\<br>\<br>First of all, the situations were completely and totally different. Not<br>only were they recorded in different states with different officers, but<br>we know nothing about what happened before, what happened during, and<br>what calls the officer was responding to. It\'s a very biased video.<br>Seems like a bit of an apples-to-oranges comparison. Without context,<br>we\'ll never know.\<br>\<br>But to address the actual concern, if you\'re asking if bigotry still<br>exists, it certainly does. If you\'re asking if there are bigoted police<br>officers, yes there are. Should the 2nd Amendment only apply to<br>Caucasian males? Absolutely not.\<br>\<br>But I\'ll ask you these questions:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>- Blacks make up 14% of the population. But they commit more than half<br>  the violent crimes in this country.<br>- The population of state prisons made up of by black men is 37.5%,<br>  which is far greater than their representation in the population.<br>- The number one cause of death for young black men is homicide. And in<br>  90% of cases, the shooter is another young black man.<br><br>\<br>So should the police ignore these statistics? And should they also<br>ignore the statistic that says that a cop is *six times more likely* to<br>be shot by a black man than the other way around? If you were that cop<br>rolling up onto a black man with a gun, and you knew these statistics,<br>would you think twice?\<br>\<br>Through all of that, the police still have to do their jobs fairly and<br>equitably, and they have to treat each situation as it comes, which<br>means they will treat every \"man-with-a-gun\" call differently. And who<br>else has to deal with the pressure the police do? Who else has 10 cell<br>phone cameras trained on him while he does his job? Do we do this to<br>electricians? Or garbage collectors? Or firefighters? No, only police<br>get recorded every time they step out of their cars.\<br>\<br>Bigotry and hatred should not exist. In a perfect world, they would not.<br>But our world is far from perfect, and we can only deal with it as it<br>comes.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
