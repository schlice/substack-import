<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>He should have, but I can understand why he didn't.<br><br>You might think that your husband just instantly "cuts the apron<br>strings" and instantly joins you at your side and you two are "one<br>flesh" for ever and ever.<br><br>But that's not exactly how it happens.<br><br>Instead, the "cutting of the apron strings" is a much slower process.<br>Your husband has to "grow" into that relationship with you. Remember,<br>his mother was the only significant woman in his life for many years.<br>He's not going to just up and turn on her just because you're married<br>now. And mom is going to have to learn to start letting go, even though<br>it's evident that she may have some separation issues herself.<br><br>Her comments may have been very wrong, but he's going to have to take<br>some time to let it sink in.<br><br>Here's the important part though: **I know you want to ream him up one<br>side and down the other for not "standing up for you."**<br><br>DON'T DO IT.<br><br>If you yell at him because he didn't stand up for you, he will only<br>resent you for coming between him and his mother when it is he who must<br>come to that conclusion on his own. Instead, talk to him about how her<br>comments made you feel. Tell him that his mother should respect you for<br>who you are, and should respect you as his wife, and her comments do not<br>do that. Tell him that you deserve more respect as a wife, and it's up<br>to him to ensure that his family respects you.<br><br>Please understand that this will take time. You, obviously, want it to<br>take *less* time than it already does, but it will take time. You'll<br>have to be patient with him while he learns.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>MIL called me a B\*tch and Wh\*re and other horrible things during one<br>of her rants and my husband just sat there and didn't say anything.<br>Shouldn't he of told her that he won't let her disrespect me like that<br>ever?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
