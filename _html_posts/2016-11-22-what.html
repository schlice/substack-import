<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I actually got this one from Dr. Phil.<br><br>Put a sticky note on your bathroom mirror (something you'll see every<br>day, first thing in the morning). It should say:<br><br>***What can I do TODAY that will make my family's life just a little bit<br>better?***<br><br>It doesn't matter the size of your family (which will likely grow), you<br>will always be able to do this. When you see your sticky note in the<br>morning, think of one thing that you can do to make your wife (or your<br>family) a little happier, or make their life a little better, that day.<br>It doesn't have to be a big thing. Little things, every day, will add up<br>immensely.<br><br>For your wife, you know the little things she likes. Maybe it's a<br>certain flavor coffee from Starbucks. Maybe it's a text to her at<br>lunchtime to let her know you're thinking of her. One little thing,<br>every day. It's more important than just making her happy every day. It<br>has lasting benefits.<br><br>One of those lasting benefits is preparing for the bad times. It's great<br>to talk about the good times, but bad times will come your way (as they<br>do in every marriage). I know it's hard to think that bad things will<br>ever happen (as is true of the beginning of every marriage), but bad<br>things will happen, and you should be prepared for them. Sometimes, when<br>the bad things pile up, it's hard to remember that there is still good<br>there. Bad things in your marriage are like clouds that cover the sun.<br>It's important that you still remember that the sun is still there, it's<br>just covered up. The more good things you do with and for each other,<br>the easier it will be to remember those things when bad things happen.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
