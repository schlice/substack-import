<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If the goal of the Christian's life were to be more like Christ, then<br>there would be no difference between someone who is not Christian simply<br>being a better person, and a Christian.<br><br>But the "goal" of the Christian's life is not just to be more like<br>Christ.<br><br>The "goal" (if you want to call it that) is to be *saved.*<br><br>Once the Christian is saved, they spend the rest of their lives learning<br>more about Christ, and becoming more Christ-like. In other words, the<br>works (being a good person) are the *result* of the salvation. The works<br>are not the end goal.<br><br>The works do not save you. Only Christ saves you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
