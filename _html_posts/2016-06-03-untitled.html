<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [I know you based on our previous discussions, and I know<br>you do get it.\<br>\<br>If you just feel for the kid, say so. That makes more sense. Your<br>comments make it sound like you disagree with UCMJ\'s restrictions on<br>drug use because it is becoming \"normalized\" in society. UCMJ can\'t<br>be any less strict than the most strict prevailing law, which is<br>currently Federal law. So until Federal law changes, UCMJ can\'t change<br>either.\<br>\<br>I understand you feel for him. I do not. He was arrested once and at<br>that time, he was told that regardless of state law, drug use in the<br>military is illegal. Do it again and you will be headed home. What did<br>he do? He did it again. That\'s either a sign of stupidity, or willful<br>ignorance, both of which run counter to good order and discipline, which<br>we definitely don\'t need in the military.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/If-a-policeman-arrest-a-soldier-does-he-have-to-deliver-the-soldier-to-the-MPs/answer/Tim-Dees<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
