<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, this article is two years old. There's nothing "recent"<br>about it.<br><br>Secondly, the only thing this poll shows is that Americans don't know<br>what they want.<br><br>The first question in the poll shows that "more Americans want stricter<br>gun laws." But when you break it down, the increase came from only one<br>political party. Any idea which one?<br><br>> The rise in the proportion of Americans who want stricter laws on<br>> firearm sales can be attributed partly to an increase among certain<br>> demographic groups. Support rose among Democrats and especially<br>> independents from 2014, and among those who do not personally own a<br>> gun. \[1\](#Tbgrz){#cite-Tbgrz .citation_link}<br><br>Then, and even more telling, is the second question, which asks whether<br>or not there should be a law that limits gun possession to only the<br>police.<br><br>> The percentage of Americans who favor a law providing that only<br>> authorized persons (including the police) would be allowed to possess<br>> handguns has remained low since the 1990s. This year, 27% \-- near the<br>> record low \-- say there should be this type of ban. This trend has<br>> been generally declining since Gallup began asking this question in<br>> 1959, when 60% said such a law should exist.<br><br>So while some people think that laws should be tougher (even while not<br>saying which laws, or *how* they should be tougher --- "well, I dunno,<br>they just *should be*"), they also continue to say, in greater numbers<br>every year, that there should not be restrictions on who should be<br>allowed to own a handgun.<br><br>If anything, such a poll could lead to little more than increased<br>quantities of lazy data analysis and confusion.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-Tbgrz){.citation_index} [[Americans\' Desire for Stricter<br>Gun Laws Up<br>Sharply](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cfabac&url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/186236/americans-desire-stricter-gun-laws-sharply.aspx?g_source%3DSocial%2520Issues%26amp%3Bamp%3Bg_medium%3Dnewsfeed%26amp%3Bamp%3Bg_campaign%3Dtiles){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gallup.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
