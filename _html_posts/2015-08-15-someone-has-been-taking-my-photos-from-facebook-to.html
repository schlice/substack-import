<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If you can find the person, you can file a copyright<br>infringement lawsuit against him/her. You won\'t likely be sending<br>anyone to jail, but you\'ll be compensated for the use of your images<br>(since you say that the thief is using your photos for commercial gain),<br>as well as receiving damages.\<br>\<br>I suggest you retain the services of an IP attorney.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
