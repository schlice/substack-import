<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The level of crime indicates what the majority of the public believes<br>should be a serious crime, and what they believe should be a less<br>serious crime.<br><br>I think the problem you may be running into today is that the vast<br>majority of things that come in your mailbox are relatively unimportant.<br>Most of your bills are now delivered electronically. You file your taxes<br>electronically. You communicate with your bank electronically. What do<br>you get in your physical mailbox? Junk mail, mostly. Circulars,<br>advertisements, credit card offers, etc.<br><br>But I bet that if you changed "mail" in your description (*I\'m pretty<br>sure reading other people\'s mail isn\'t that serious a crime)* to<br>e-mail, you'd change your tune slightly. I bet you'd be pretty<br>miffed if someone hacked your e-mail account and read your e-mail. They<br>could go to *any account you own* and reset your password, which<br>gets delivered to your e-mail. They could then shut off your electric<br>service, or transfer all the money out of your bank account, or buy<br>themselves a car and have it delivered somewhere, using your accounts<br>which they reset using your e-mail.<br><br>I bet you'd have no problem making *that* a felony. Phew, good thing<br>it is, eh?<br><br>But some people, especially the elderly, don't use technology nearly as<br>frequently as you do. Their bills and account statements are all still<br>delivered through the mail.<br><br>So because sensitive information can still be delivered using paper<br>mail, paper mail is still protected. Only the addressee listed on the<br>envelope can open it. And it's still a felony to read someone else's<br>mail, because it's still important to protect mail.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
