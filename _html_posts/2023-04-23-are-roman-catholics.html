<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is absolutely a valid question, and of course turns on what the<br>definition of "Christianity" is.<br><br>Christianity is a term describing a number of religious groups which<br>believe in Jesus Christ as one member of the Trinity, both fully human<br>and fully divine, who died as a penal substitution for us, sacrificing<br>himself as payment for our sin, and who rose from the dead three days<br>later, to overcome death and pave the way for humanity to be reunited<br>with God.<br><br>Based on that really loose definition, Catholics are indeed Christian.<br><br>From there, though, our two beliefs begin to diverge. Among other<br>differences:<br><br>- Christians believe in one source for the word of God: the Bible.<br>  Catholics believe in three: the Bible, the Magisterium (the collection<br>  of priests, bishops, cardinals, and the Pope), and sacred church<br>  traditions.<br>- Catholics believe that at the Last Supper, when Jesus passed around<br>  the bread and said "this is my body" and then passed around the cup<br>  and said "this is my blood," He was turning those objects into his<br>  *literal* body and blood. Christians believe that Jesus was, once<br>  again, teaching in parables, as He did throughout His entire life.<br>  There is exegesis that supports either view, so both beliefs carry on<br>  to today.<br>- Catholics believe you can lose your salvation. Christians believe in<br>  "once saved, always saved."<br>- Christians believe that it is only faith in Christ which saves you<br>  (*sola fide*). Catholics believe in *faith plus*, as in faith plus<br>  following the traditions of the church, or faith plus regularly eating<br>  the bread and drinking the cup.<br><br>There are plenty of other differences, this is just a brief highlight.<br>There are other things (i.e. the transcendence of Mary, intercessory<br>prayer, etc) which differ between our belief sets.<br><br>TL;DR: When it comes to the big things, Christianity and Catholicism<br>believe the same. But once we get down to the details, there are<br>significant differences.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
