<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In September we will see the 200,000th person to die from COVID-19 in<br>the USA. What could Mike Pence have done differently to make that number<br>smaller?**<br><br>Nothing, and it is fallacy to think that any person could have "done<br>something different" that would have caused fewer people to die.<br>Absolute lunacy.<br><br>It's hard enough getting 50 states to work together to stop the virus,<br>and then you have to work against people who believe that Trump somehow<br>has the ability to *order them to do things*. It's called the<br>Constitution. Read it.<br><br>**Was Pence deliberately set up for failure by Trump when given this job<br>to lead the task force?**<br><br>Pence was put in charge of Federal efforts to assist the states with<br>their relief efforts. No one could have done it any better. I suppose<br>you could have gotten someone in there who would have declared martial<br>law and sent the National Guard to literally patrol the streets and<br>arrest anyone not wearing a mask or venturing outside their front door,<br>but beyond that, what exactly do you think that we could have done<br>differently? State governors know their states better than the Federal<br>government, and county commissioners know their counties better than the<br>state governors.<br><br>It seems you may have forgotten that the goal was never to completely<br>eradicate the virus. The goal was to flatten the curve. And we did that.<br>But it's not going away. Not any time soon.<br><br>Sure, numbers are going up. Even worse, it's likely that COVID-19 will<br>become a seasonal virus, just like the cold and the flu. But we'll<br>develop annual vaccines for it just like we do for the flu, and you'll<br>get your flu/COVID shot every year, and you'll mostly stop it just like<br>the flu.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for<br>everyone.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
