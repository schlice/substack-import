<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I've never heard of MS lesions referred to as "brain damage." I think<br>generally we associate "damage" with injury rather than illness. But in<br>a purely technical sense, the brain is "damaged" when myelin is<br>destroyed by white blood cells and replaced by plaques (or scars, thus<br>the term "multiple sclerosis," meaning "many scars").<br><br>And while [Robert Pfaff(https://www.quora.com/profile/Robert-Pfaff-5)<br>]{.qlink_container}offers some valuable insight about Vitamin D, I must<br>caution you against too much self-diagnosis or self-medicating, even<br>with vitamins. Because while we do know that Vitamin D can have a<br>prophylactic effect against development of the disease (while you are<br>young), we don't know exactly what its action is, when it is effective,<br>or how much you should take. We also know that taking D3 can be damaging<br>in larger quantities, so you must take care before simply starting or<br>changing any of your medications or supplements.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
