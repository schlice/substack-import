<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Generally, the cost is not relevant to whether or not you<br>are liable for damages.\<br>\<br>If you give away free calculators and they cause damage, you could be<br>responsible for the damages they cause. You should include a warranty<br>with your calculators that releases you from liability, something like<br>this. This is a modified excerpt from a warranty I used to provide for<br>items I sold on eBay in the early days before eBay guaranteed items its<br>sellers sold. Note that IANAL, and I cannot guarantee you that this<br>warranty will cover you in any partictular situation, but it worked for<br>me:\<br>\<br>\"THIS PRODUCT IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" WITH NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND,<br>EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY. SELLER SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY<br>IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>PURPOSE AND INFRINGEMENT. THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AGAINST SELLER FOR ANY<br>CAUSE OF ACTION RELATING TO THE HANDLING OR USE OF THE PRODUCTS SOLD BY<br>SELLER IS A CLAIM FOR DAMAGES AND IN NO EVENT SHALL DAMAGES OR ANY OTHER<br>RECOVERY OF ANY KIND AGAINST SELLER EXCEED THE PRICE OF THE SPECIFIC<br>PRODUCTS WHICH CAUSED THE ALLEGED LOSS, DAMAGE, INJURY, OR OTHER CLAIM.<br>SELLER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR, AND ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AGAINST SELLER<br>ARE WAIVED FOR, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES<br>OR EXPENSES OF ANY NATURE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: LOSS OF PROFITS<br>OR INCOME, AND PROPERTY LOSS OR DAMAGE, WHETHER OR NOT BASED ON SELLER'S<br>NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF WARRANTY, STRICT LIABILITY IN TORT OR ANY OTHER<br>CAUSE OF ACTION. THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU<br>MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.\"\<br>\<br>In general, sites like instructables have clauses that say that you (the<br>contributor) are not responsible for anything that happens to the<br>builder if they follow your instructions and build something that<br>malfunctions. If they don\'t, you should consider including a warranty<br>statement similar to the one above in the fine print.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
