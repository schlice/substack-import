<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is illegally obtained evidence (i.e. video of a murder) usable against<br>a serial killer? Will he/she be free if there\'s no other evidence?**<br><br>So, two questions here. Let's break them down:<br><br>**Is illegally obtained evidence (i.e. video of a murder) usable against<br>a serial killer?**<br><br>It depends on who obtains it, and whether or not they will testify as to<br>how they obtained it.<br><br>Clearly, if an agent of the government (i.e. a police officer) illegally<br>obtains evidence, that evidence is inadmissible. If a civilian illegally<br>obtains evidence at the behest of a government agent, it is still<br>inadmissible. But if a civilian illegally obtains evidence all on his<br>own, and without government direction, the evidence is (in most cases)<br>legal and admissible. Of course, this will usually require the person<br>obtaining the evidence getting up on the stand and testifying as to how<br>they came into possession of said evidence, which would clearly<br>implicate them in criminal behavior, opening up a Pandora's Box of<br>issues. But prosecutors have done this in the past, especially in<br>high-profile cases; a serial killer would definitely count.<br><br>Will he/she be free if there\'s no other evidence?<br><br>Not necessarily.<br><br>Circumstantial evidence can be so strong that even without illegally<br>obtained evidence, a person can be guilty *beyond a reasonable doubt.*<br>Remember that the standard to which the jury is held is the "reasonable<br>doubt" standard. If the prosecutor can make the case using the<br>circumstantial evidence, the defendant can still be found guilty.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
