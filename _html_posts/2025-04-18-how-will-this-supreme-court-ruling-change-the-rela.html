<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You'll probably have to be more specific as to which Supreme Court<br>ruling you are referring.<br><br>I can *assume* you're talking about the recent (17 Apr 25) Supreme Court<br>of India ruling regarding homebuyers, since that's roughly around the<br>same time as this question.<br><br>In that ruling, the SC of India ruled that peaceful protesting (in this<br>case, with signs) against home builders is permitted free speech.<br><br>The homebuyers were respectful in their protest. "We find that the<br>manner of the protest resorted to by the appellants was peaceful and<br>orderly and without in any manner using offensive or abusive language.<br>It could not be said that the appellants crossed the lakshman rekha and<br>transgressed into the offending zone," the court said. There was "no<br>foul" or rough language used. "There is no reference to any expression<br>like 'fraud, cheating, misappropriation,' etc. In mild and temperate<br>language, certain issues, which the appellants perceived as their<br>grievances have been aired," the court noted.<br><br>So how will this change the relationship between homebuyers and<br>builders? Builders should do well to listen to the concerns of their<br>homebuyers. Dissatisfaction should be addressed with the utmost care and<br>timely attention, or dissatisfied homebuyers could peacefully protest<br>and air those grievances in public.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
