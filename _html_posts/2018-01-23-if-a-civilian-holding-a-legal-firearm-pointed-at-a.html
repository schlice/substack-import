<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a civilian holding a legal firearm pointed at a criminal and is<br>waiting for the police to arrive, and the criminal starts to run or<br>tries to attack you, are you within your rights to shoot if they are not<br>holding a weapon?**<br><br>First of all, you are already in tricky legal waters, as you are<br>pointing a firearm at an individual who is not presenting you a threat<br>of death or grave bodily harm.<br><br>As painful as it is to hear, that person can sue you for assault as well<br>as unlawful imprisonment. You as a civilian do not have a right to hold<br>another civilian at gunpoint until the police arrive.<br><br>If the suspect just completed stabbing someone 27 times, I think you<br>might be able to make the case that they are a continued threat until<br>the police arrive. But you must be careful. If the person is not an<br>active threat, you cannot point a gun at them.<br><br>I would suggest, if you are a concealed carry holder, researching what<br>the low ready position is, and using that instead. You still face<br>the same threat of lawsuit for unlawful detention, but you stand a much<br>better chance of having that charge dismissed if you are not actively<br>assaulting the person at the same time (i.e. tort assault).<br><br>If they start to run away, not even the police have the right to shoot<br>them.\* If they are posing no threat to you, you cannot shoot them.<br>Period.<br><br>If they start to run towards you or try to attack you, you can usually<br>make the case that you were, in fact, in fear for your life, and deadly<br>force is warranted.<br><br>\* There are, of course, exceptions to every rule, and there are legally<br>codified conditions under which police can shoot a fleeing suspect.<br>Primarily, those conditions revolve around a *continuing threat* to the<br>community in allowing that person to escape. It is allowed under common<br>law, but in the United States, the case *Tennessee v. Garner* in 1985<br>limited police use of deadly force against a fleeing suspect. The<br>justices held that deadly force \"may not be used unless necessary to<br>prevent the escape and the officer has probable cause to believe that<br>the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily harm<br>to the officer or others.\"<br><br>Military police have *far broader* jurisdiction to use deadly force<br>against a fleeing suspect, especially if that person has in his<br>possession classified materials or explosive devices. We actually have<br>eight different conditions under which we can use deadly force, and two<br>of them involve the release of classified information, one involves<br>anything which can cause substantial harm to the general public, and one<br>is for the apprehension of a fleeing prisoner. The last one is following<br>the issuance of a lawful order.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
