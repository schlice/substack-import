<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The whole purpose of laws is to ensure that your freedom to live your<br>life as you choose does not impact anyone else's freedom to live their<br>lives as they choose. When those two items intersect, we need laws to<br>determine how to best handle the situation.<br><br>The phrase itself is a little misleading. It somehow seems to imply that<br>rights are naturally limited when what you do is experienced by someone<br>else. This is mostly untrue. For example, I have the right to speak<br>freely in the public square. The fact that someone can hear that speech<br>does not infringe on the hearer's rights. They have the right to listen<br>to something else. They have the right to leave the area in which I am<br>speaking (assuming it is a public place). They even have the right to<br>express a differing opinion. But they do not have the right to<br>*silence* my speech simply because they don't like it, or they don't<br>want to hear it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
