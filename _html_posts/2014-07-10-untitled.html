<br/><br/>Answer Comment<br/><br/><br/>Content: [I have seen firsthand what marijuana can do to a person<br/>who has an addictive personality (i.e. someone who can become an<br/>addict). I\'ve seen people who have used all manner of illicit drugs and<br/>then drop them on a dime without any ill effects, and I\'ve seen others<br/>get hooked on drugs that some might think are almost \"benign.\"<br/>Marijuana, for all of its benefits, is not harmless.\<br/>\<br/>Marijuana is a gateway drug. Because when marijuana quits doing it for<br/>you, you start looking for the next big thing. Generally it\'s black tar<br/>because it\'s (relatively) cheap and easy to get.\<br/>\<br/>Medical marijuana just sends the message to teens that it\'s okay to use<br/>because it\'s \"medical.\" It\'s a medicine; it can\'t be bad for you,<br/>right? And since you can\'t legally write a prescription for it, you<br/>only need a doctor\'s \"note\" to get it. Plenty of doctors are more<br/>than willing to write a note for you. Actually, here in Colorado, they<br/>work in the pot store.\<br/>\<br/>I was in a small town here (which shall remain unnamed) and the sign<br/>outside the pot store had two arrows to their two storefront locations.<br/>The arrow to the left said \"18+\" and the arrow to the right said<br/>\"21+\". The sign next to it clarified: the arrow to the left said<br/>\"Medical\" and the arrow to the right said \"Recreational.\" The only<br/>difference between the two stores: the \"recreational\" store charges<br/>tax. No tax is charged for \"medical\" marijuana.\<br/>\<br/>Stats from two years ago showed that there were 110,000 people in the<br/>state with their medical marijuana cards, and that current estimates put<br/>it at approximately 10,000 that actually needed them.\<br/>\<br/>One of the other things that legalization here has done is given us the<br/>ability to test it more. We\'ve found how detrimental it is to the<br/>maturing brain. It is actually far more harmful to the maturing brain<br/>than was first thought. Really, no one under age 25 should touch the<br/>stuff because brains in humans reach their maximum maturity at age 25;<br/>they are still maturing before then.\<br/>\<br/>Oh, and that awesome tax revenue? The governor was asked what he was<br/>going to do with that amazing windfall he received from marijuana sales,<br/>and in his brilliance, he said he was going to invest it in drug rehab<br/>and drug prevention programs. Welcome to Colorado; see what incredible<br/>things you can do when the state turns blue?\<br/>\<br/>So the LE professional in me says that it\'s a complete waste of time,<br/>money and effort to continue to fight the war on drugs, and the parent<br/>in me says we\'re only hurting ourselves by letting our kids think that<br/>it\'s okay to use because it\'s \"medical.\" So far, I\'m finding that<br/>we\'re not doing ourselves any favors.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Answer:<br/>https://www.quora.com/What-do-police-officers-think-about-legalizing-drugs-Would-it-make-their-jobs-harder-or-easier/answer/R-Justin-Freeman<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
