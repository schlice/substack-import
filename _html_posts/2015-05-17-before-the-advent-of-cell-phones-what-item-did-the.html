<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Toy guns.\<br>\<br>The rules surrounding the manufacture of toy guns has only recently been<br>expanded to include the hunter-safety-orange tips and the \"strong<br>suggestions\" that toy guns not be made to look like real guns.\<br>\<br>I had a Lone Ranger cap gun as a kid. It took rolls of caps on paper.<br>From 10 yards, it looked as real as any handgun.\<br>\<br>But I knew that I\'d never carry that thing in a threatening way, or it<br>could be mistaken for a real gun, and that would be the last mistake<br>I\'d make.\<br>\<br>Somehow, I survived without ever being shot by a police officer.\<br>\<br>Sometimes, it\'s not good to live and learn, as the cost of enrollment<br>at Consequences University is a little too high in that case. We should<br>do a better job of ensuring that our kids don\'t learn that lesson the<br>hard way.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
