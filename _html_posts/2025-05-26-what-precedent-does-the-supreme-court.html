<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Since none of the answers thus far are technically correct, let me help<br>clarify something very important. The SCOTUS delivered an ***unsigned<br>opinion*. This fact is *VERY IMPORTANT***.<br><br>***UNSIGNED OPINIONS DO NOT SET PRECEDENT. This 4--4 vote SETS NO<br>PRECEDENT AT ALL.***<br><br>There was no reasoning. There was no research. There was no history.<br>There was no basis provided. The only information given: the Justices<br>voted, and they split 4--4 as Justice Barrett had recused herself.<br>That's all we know.<br><br>No precent was set. Precedent cannot be set on unsigned opinions. This<br>means that religious groups can bring these cases again if they choose,<br>and this decision *CANNOT* be used as nationwide case law.<br><br>The only place religious charter schools cannot be established, based on<br>this case, is Oklahoma, as the only ruling which carries precedent is<br>the one from the Oklahoma Supreme Court. Religious groups in 49 other<br>states still have standing to bring suit if they wish.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
