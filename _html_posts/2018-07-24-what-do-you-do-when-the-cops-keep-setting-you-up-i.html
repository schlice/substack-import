<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What do you do when the cops keep setting you up intentionally to be<br>arrested using illegal surveillance to strategically set up elaborate<br>false arrests?**<br><br>Wow, where do you live? The police in your town literally have *nothing<br>better to do* then to set up elaborate false arrest scenarios using<br>"illegal surveillance" to specifically target *you*? Either your local<br>cops are really really bored (which is a good thing) or you did<br>something to really really piss them off such that they'd waste lots of<br>time and risk cases getting thrown out of court by using "illegal<br>surveillance" just to give you a hard time.<br><br>Regardless of why the police are doing this, what you do is **get a<br>lawyer.** If the police really are targeting you, using "illegal<br>surveillance" to harass you, your lawyer will help you file suit against<br>the department alleging harassment.<br><br>If, on the other hand, their surveillance is actually legal (or if it's<br>wiretaps, supported by a court order), you're going to need that lawyer<br>to defend yourself, because some pretty hefty charges are soon to come<br>your way.<br><br>So in either case, the remedy is the same.<br><br>Get a lawyer.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not legal advice*, *nor is it intended to be used as<br>a substitute for legal advice. This answer is for GENERAL INFORMATIONAL<br>USE ONLY. If you have a legal problem which would require legal advice,<br>consult with a licensed attorney in your area.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to legal questions are intended<br>third-party beneficiaries with certain rights under Quora\'s* [[*Terms<br>of Service*](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
