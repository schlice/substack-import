<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do I reach general or flag officer rank in the United States Armed<br>Forces?**<br><br>I've heard lots of generals speak to us about careers. Basically, there<br>are a few things you have to do:<br><br>1.  Fill all the squares<br>2.  Do your job, and then do it better<br>3.  Be flexible with where the service wants to send you.<br><br>The first one is fill all the squares. This is a military saying<br>which means that for all of the "must do" items you have to do in your<br>career, do them. Do your PME (professional military education) when you<br>are supposed to do it. Do all of the things you are supposed to do as<br>part of your career field, when you are supposed to do them. Don't put<br>them off.<br><br>Secondly, do your job, and then do it better. Strive to accomplish<br>all of the things you need to do in your job, and then excel. Shoot for<br>the stars and you'll probably hit the moon, and that ain't bad.<br><br>Finally, when assignments calls and says they need to send you on a 1<br>year unaccompanied remote but there will be a good deal in your<br>follow-on, take it. Don't complain about it. The service will treat you<br>right, if you let them. Don't try to micromanage your career.<br><br>After all that's done, it's just a lotta luck. Maybe knowing the right<br>people to put in a good word for you, but there's not a lot of room at<br>the top of the pyramid, and you just have to know that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
