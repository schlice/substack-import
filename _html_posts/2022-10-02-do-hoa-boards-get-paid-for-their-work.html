<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>HOAs are 501(c)(4) non-profit corporations. As such, their Directors are<br>unpaid volunteers.<br><br>No, HOA Board members get nothing (but ridicule) for doing the work they<br>do.<br><br>Board members can deduct any personal expenses they incur from their<br>taxes, but most HOA bylaws stipulate that Directors can receive no<br>compensation for their work. They wouldn't want to be compensated,<br>because drawing a salary would make a Director ineligible for the D&O<br>(Director and Officer) insurance carried by most Boards, meaning that<br>they'd be personally liable in a lawsuit against them related to their<br>Board duties.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
