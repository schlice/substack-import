<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it more advantageous or disadvantageous to live in a house with an<br>HOA?**<br><br>The answer, of course, it "it depends."<br><br>On the downside, you may not be the type of person who is interested in<br>having some group of homeowners tell you what you can and can't do with<br>the outside of your house, or anything that can be seen from the outside<br>of your house. I've read these other answers, and I've heard comments<br>from other homeowners, and I get it. Some homeowners don't like anyone<br>to be able to tell them what they can and can't do with the house *they<br>own*. They think that their dues are *unreasonable,* or they're not<br>getting their money's worth.<br><br>However, if you own a condo, a HOA can be very valuable, and if you live<br>in a small(ish) neighborhood of single-family homes, it can actually<br>help. By keeping home exteriors neat and uniform(ish), HOAs help keep<br>neighborhoods looking good, and home values high. As an example, we have<br>130 homes and we live across a main street from another very similar<br>neighborhood built around the same time. We have a HOA, they do not. Our<br>home prices, on average, run about \$30,000 more than theirs do, for a<br>comparable house ("comps," in real estate jargon), and we're just across<br>the street.<br><br>You can tell why. Drive around their neighborhood, and you see the car<br>on blocks in the driveway. You see the house next door, painted electric<br>blue. You see the house across the way where the owner doesn't bother<br>cutting or watering the lawn, ever. You see cars all over the streets.<br>It simply looks crowded and uninviting. Now drive around our<br>neighborhood. Lawns are maintained. There are no electric blue houses<br>(although there's a forest green house which looked better on paper than<br>it did on the walls). The roads are mostly car-free. It looks neat. It<br>looks well-kept. It looks like people care about the neighborhood (even<br>though some of them couldn't care less). It looks like a place you'd<br>*want* to live.<br><br>Additionally, we negotiated a trash and recycling service for the<br>neighborhood. What usually would cost you about \$20 a month we could<br>negotiate at \$8 per house, and we pay for that out of your HOA dues.<br>Plus we have the added benefit that with only one trash company, we have<br>only one day per week that trash cans are out, only one day a week that<br>trash trucks are around, and the service pulls the cans back up as close<br>to the garage as they can get them when they dump your trash, so the<br>neighborhood still looks neat.<br><br>Finally, here in Colorado, we have marijuana. Not such a big deal,<br>right? Wrong. Many different things can go wrong with this law, and many<br>have. The cartels have moved into neighborhoods and made grow houses,<br>converting the entire house into a grow house, because they know that<br>law enforcement is mostly powerless to stop them. By the way, Feds are<br>not, and that's the only way we've been able to bust the drug houses is<br>with the DEA's help. But without the local police to help, the HOA's<br>"nuisance odor" rule was the only other way we could legally take care<br>of the drug house. We fined the owner, and when he didn't pay, we put a<br>lien on the home, and then when we didn't get paid for another *year,*<br>we foreclosed on the lien. We got the drug dealers out when the police<br>could not.<br><br>HOAs have their place. When the HOA lives by its charter (keeping home<br>values high), then it's a good thing. When the HOA gets lost in the<br>weeds, in the minutiae of managing, it may not be beneficial.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
