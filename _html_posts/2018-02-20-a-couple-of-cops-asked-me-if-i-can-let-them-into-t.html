<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>***BE AWARE, we are talking about letting police into the COMMON AREA,<br>not into any one INDIVIDUAL APARTMENT. This is an immensely important<br>legal distinction.***<br><br>\<br><br>Legally, the gates of a gated complex define the area managed by the<br>Homeowner's Association, or the boundaries of area controlled by the<br>owners of an apartment complex.<br><br>**Your legal rights begin at your apartment door, not the complex<br>gates.**<br><br>There are virtually zero legal ramifications of letting an *on-duty<br>police officer* into the gated area of your complex.<br><br>Now, letting them into an *actual apartment* has a whole other set of<br>issues that could present themselves, especially if it's not your<br>apartment.<br><br>But if you're legally allowed to be in that gated area (and you are<br>because you rent an apartment), you have the legal authority to let a<br>police officer into that same common area. If you may admit a guest into<br>that area. you may admit a police officer.<br><br>The only time I could see any sort of issue is if there is a paid<br>security guard who is supposed to control access and he or she is not<br>there, but even then, if you can let friends and family into the gated<br>area, there should be no problem letting police in either.<br><br>If you're really worried, call 911. Ask them if any officers have been<br>dispatched to your apartment complex, because there's some "shady<br>looking cops asking to gain entrance" into the gated area of your<br>complex. If they tell you yes, you *must* let them in, or you could be<br>charged with obstruction of justice.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**A couple of cops asked me if I can let them into the gated community<br>of my apartment complex where I\'m renting an apartment because an<br>\"alarm went off\". Should I let them in? What\'s the best thing to do<br>in this situation?**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
