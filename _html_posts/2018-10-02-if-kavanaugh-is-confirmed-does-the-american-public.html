<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If Kavanaugh is confirmed, does the American public have any legal<br>course of action to have Kavanaugh removed?**<br><br>1.  Federal judges as well as Supreme Court judges are subject to<br>    impeachment. The Constitution grants the House the power to impeach<br>    \"The President, the Vice President, and all civil Officers of the<br>    United States.\" Federal court judges and Supreme Court justices are<br>    agreed to be civil Officers of the United States, and are subject to<br>    impeachment. The process for impeachment is the same for a Supreme<br>    Court justice as it is for the President: the House of<br>    Representatives must pass Articles of Impeachment, and the Senate<br>    must have a trial to vote to remove that person from office.<br>2.  A Supreme Court justice is not the President and so is subject to<br>    criminal indictment. If evidence exists of a crime which a Supreme<br>    Court justice is alleged to have committed, that justice can be<br>    indicted, which would probably lead back to #1 (impeachment). Dr.<br>    Ford can go to Maryland and file charges of sexual assault against<br>    Kavanaugh if she chooses; there is no statute of limitations on<br>    sexual assault in Maryland.<br><br>However, you asked the question about the "public" having any recourse<br>to having him removed, and the answer to that is no. The President<br>appointed him, and if he is confirmed, he will have been appointed with<br>the "advice and consent" of the Senate, in accordance with the<br>Constitution. The Constitution provides no injunctive relief for a<br>SCOTUS justice you don't like.<br><br>In order for "the public" to have some recourse to remove a SCOTUS<br>justice from the bench, you'd have to amend the Constitution.<br><br>The whole point of lifetime appointments is to avoid politics and the<br>political cycle influencing the court and its opinions. Allowing people<br>to remove SCOTUS justices undoes that idea.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
