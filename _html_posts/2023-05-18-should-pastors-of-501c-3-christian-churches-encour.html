<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So I'm trying to understand the AMAZING LEAPS OF LOGIC you make.<br><br>It seems that you're trying to say that *because* a church has been<br>granted the GIFT of not having to pay taxes, the church is somehow<br>OBLIGATED to act as a servant of the government.<br><br>AND THEN, you make the leap that the current government wishes to disarm<br>the law-abiding. This is the only one where there may be a nugget of<br>truth. The current government DOES wish to disarm the law-abiding. Only<br>the Second Amendment stands in their way. Pesky Second Amendment...<br><br>AND FOR YOUR FINAL DEATH-DEFYING LEAP OF LOGIC, you presume that all<br>government automaton-servants must shill for said government and<br>encourage those who listen to them to voluntarily give up their<br>Constitutional rights and disarm themselves, at great personal expense.<br><br>Presuming these FANTASIC logical contortions, I could see how you might<br>think this.<br><br>\<br><br>But I can tell you from personal experience that churches know ALL TOO<br>WELL that the government is not their friend. Churches, above all, know<br>that the government should be kept at arm's length, and anything they<br>want should be critically analyzed before it is acted upon.<br><br>And finally in the category of "what church pastors know" is the fact<br>that the FIRST AMENDMENT, which gives those churches the very right to<br>exist is only still in place because the SECOND AMENDMENT exists.<br><br>In other words, you only have the rights you can keep. And you can only<br>keep the rights you have when you can effectively defend them.<br><br>Don't hurt yourself twisting into a pretzel trying to make the one part<br>agree with the other.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
