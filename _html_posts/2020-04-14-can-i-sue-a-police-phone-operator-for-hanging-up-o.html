<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can I sue a police phone operator for hanging up on me?<br><br>Can you? Sure you can. In the United States, you can sue anyone for<br>anything.<br><br>The question, as always, is whether or not you have a chance of<br>prevailing. And in this case, it would be *really challenging* to<br>prevail.<br><br>First off, you would have to show that you were harmed by the hang up.<br>Then you would have to show that the operator knew you would be harmed<br>by the hang up (or at least knew that there was a reasonable chance you<br>could be harmed) and proceeded to do it anyway. That's going to be a<br>tough one to prove.<br><br>But if you can prove those things, go for it. You could make a case for<br>negligence.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
