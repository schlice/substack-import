<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Who will help me overturn Terry v Ohio?<br><br>Not many.<br><br>The Court found that \"a reasonably prudent man would have been<br>warranted in believing \Terry\ was armed and thus presented a threat<br>to the officer\'s safety while he was investigating his suspicious<br>behavior.\" The search was limited in scope, to protect the officers'<br>safety incident to their investigation only.<br><br>There was only one dissent filed in the original *Terry* case. Justice<br>William O. Douglas believed that there was no circumstance that overrode<br>the 4th Amendment's prohibition on search without probable cause:<br><br>> it is a mystery how that \'search\' and that \'seizure\' can be<br>> constitutional by Fourth Amendment standards, unless there was<br>> \'probable cause\' to believe that (1) a crime had been committed or<br>> (2) a crime was in the process of being committed or (3) a crime was<br>> about to be committed. The opinion of the Court disclaims the<br>> existence of \'probable cause\' \... There have been powerful<br>> hydraulic pressures throughout our history that bear heavily on the<br>> Court to water down constitutional guarantees and give the police the<br>> upper hand. That hydraulic pressure has probably never been greater<br>> than it is today. Yet if the individual is no longer to be sovereign,<br>> if the police can pick him up whenever they do not like the cut of his<br>> jib, if they can \'seize\' and \'search\' him in their discretion, we<br>> enter a new regime --- *Douglas dissent, Terry v. Ohio (392 US 1,<br>> 1967)*<br><br>Despite the dissent, the precedent stands. Officers can perform *Terry*<br>stops and frisk for weapons to ensure their safety.<br><br>So before you can overturn *Terry*, you need to have standing. You need<br>to be directly impacted by a *Terry* stop. You could also find someone<br>else who was directly impacted by a *Terry* stop who you believe had<br>their 4th Amendment rights violated, and you could ask to assist them in<br>a class action lawsuit.<br><br>Then, you need to find a compelling reason why the long-standing<br>precedent should be overturned. The case has shaped police behavior<br>throughout the US for decades, and it is unlikely to change any time<br>soon.<br><br>Maybe someone like the ACLU can help you.
