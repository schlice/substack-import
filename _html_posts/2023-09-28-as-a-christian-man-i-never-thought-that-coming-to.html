<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Leave.<br><br>There is a difference between "church shopping" and "finding a church<br>which matches your values," or at the very least, "finding a church<br>which espouses Biblical values."<br><br>Some people do indeed confuse "God doesn't care what you wear" with "God<br>still expects you to have a modicum of propriety." If your manner of<br>dress causes you to sin, then it is clearly, unequivocally wrong. But it<br>is *just as wrong* if your manner of dress causes *someone else* to sin.<br><br>Paul talked about this to the new believers in Corinth. And while he<br>didn't address clothing (it wasn't a terribly big problem at that time),<br>he addressed food.<br><br>Food was a major issue of Christian liberty in the Corinthian church;<br>specifically, "food offered to idols" (1 Corinthians 8:1). All the<br>Corinthian Christians (except perhaps the Jewish ones) would have had<br>backgrounds in pagan idol worship. When they became Christians, they<br>renounced these idols and all the expressions of worship associated with<br>them.<br><br>The problem was that idol worship was woven into the very fabric of<br>Corinthian civic, trade, and social life---it was culturally pervasive.<br>Idol temples were social centers, and could function similarly to public<br>restaurants (1 Corinthians 8:10). And much of the meat sold in the<br>markets and served in homes had been ritually offered to idols (1<br>Corinthians 10:25, 27). That meant eating meat could be interpreted as<br>an act of idolatry, a betrayal of Christian beliefs (1 Corinthians<br>8:10).<br><br>Wonderfully, however, some Corinthian Christians were discovering that<br>"an idol has no real existence, and that there is no God but one" (1<br>Corinthians 8:4). Since idols were no real things, they realized that<br>meat sacrificed to idols was meat sacrificed to nothing (1 Corinthians<br>10:19--20). Therefore, eating meat sacrificed to idols could not be<br>idolatry if the people eating knew that idols weren't real. They were<br>free to eat this meat with a clear conscience! Paul agreed with them (1<br>Corinthians 10:26, 29).<br><br>Paul did not agree, however, with how some of them were exercising this<br>newfound Christian freedom. In effect, some of the Corinthians had<br>placed a higher value on enjoying this freedom than on the spiritual<br>good of other souls. First, not all the Corinthian Christians "possessed<br>this knowledge" (1 Corinthians 8:7). Some of them, perhaps newer<br>converts or those who, for whatever reason, had tender consciences,<br>still felt like eating meat sacrificed to an idol was a form of<br>idolatrous worship. For them, to eat sacrificial meat was to deny<br>Christ.<br><br>Second, others, who may have even believed idols were nonentities, would<br>face temptation to a different kind of idolatry by eating such meat.<br>Many Corinthian converts likely paid a high price to become Christians.<br>Renouncing the false pagan religion(s) meant renouncing social customs,<br>family traditions, and friendship networks. Some, no doubt, lost their<br>jobs. You can imagine the temptation some experienced to give at least<br>an appearance of homage to the prevailing religion in order to avoid<br>losing employment, social status, and family disapproval.<br><br>Third, there was the issue of gospel witness among non-Christians who<br>were watching the Christians. What would pagans think of Christians who<br>knowingly ate meat sacrificed to idols? They would likely assume that<br>the Christians venerated the idols just like they did, and therefore<br>there was no real reason to give heed to Christians' odd claims. And<br>what would Jews think of this behavior? That Christians were pagans and<br>that Christianity was demonic.<br><br>So, Paul strongly reminded the Corinthians that far more was at stake<br>than enjoying sacrificial steaks. **If Christians whose consciences were<br>free to eat meat sacrificed to idols weren't very careful, the exercise<br>of their freedom could destroy the faith of another Christian (1<br>Corinthians 8:9--11) or ruin Jesus's reputation among non-Christians (1<br>Corinthians 10:27--29).** This is why Paul said, "If food makes my<br>brother stumble, I will never eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble"<br>(1 Corinthians 8:13). And then he went on to describe throughout chapter<br>9 many ways he voluntarily abstained from things he was free to enjoy as<br>a Christian (not to mention an apostle) like various kinds of food and<br>drink, marriage, and a full-time ministry salary (1 Corinthians 9:4--7).<br><br>The same is true for clothing. If Christians whose consciences were free<br>to wear whatever clothes they chose weren't careful, the exercise of<br>their freedom could harm the faith of another Christian, or damage<br>Jesus' reputation among non-Christians. You can see just how easily that<br>would be true for someone who lacks propriety and wears revealing<br>clothing. They may be free to do it, but Paul says that if him doing it<br>"causes his brother to stumble," then he won't do it.<br><br>\<br><br>Sorry for the long-winded answer, but I'm just telling you that it's<br>okay to find another church which more closely respects the Bible, with<br>people who more carefully consider the feelings of others, not just<br>themselves.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
