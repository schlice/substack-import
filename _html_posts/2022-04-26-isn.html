<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>At best, it could be considered a *retaliation* against a company who<br>exercised its free speech rights. But an *infringement* of free speech,<br>it is not. The law change does not prevent the corporation from<br>expressing its opinion freely. However, retaliation could be considered<br>because the corporation exercised a protected free-speech right, and the<br>state retaliated against the corporation for doing so.<br><br>Disney would have a good case against Florida. But Disney has a few<br>things to consider before they file a lawsuit.<br><br>- Florida would have the right to discovery. While no one is saying that<br>  Disney has violated any other state laws, they probably don't want<br>  Florida mucking about in business that they'd rather keep<br>  confidential. Most companies would prefer to keep their inner<br>  machinations private, so this makes the idea of a lawsuit<br>  unattractive.<br>- Disney would do well to remember that it was Florida who allowed them<br>  to re-open just months after they were forced to close for COVID, but<br>  the great and lauded state of California, wherein resides their<br>  corporate headquarters, forced their *other* property to remain closed<br>  for over a year. From the outside looking in, Florida is a bigger<br>  supporter of Disney's continued business than California.<br>- While Disney could sue and win, at best, all they would get would be<br>  an injunction against making any modifications to RCID today, but they<br>  would also sour future relations with Florida, and you can't un-ring<br>  that bell. Republicans are not going away any time soon from the<br>  Sunshine State, and Disney should probably stay on their good side, at<br>  least for now. They could re-tool the law, bring it in to<br>  Constitutional compliance, address all the concerns that the lawsuit<br>  brought up, and pass it later. Disney can win this battle in the short<br>  term, but if they go down this road, they will likely lose the long<br>  game.<br><br>That said, Disney doesn't need Florida. Florida needs Disney.<br><br>- While Disney likely couldn't *relocate* Disney World, it could<br>  absolutely *close* the Florida business permanently, sell off all of<br>  the assets, and only lose a small chunk of operating revenue. They<br>  would make far more in real estate sales than they make from the park<br>  itself, enough to pay off all of their bond debt and still make a tidy<br>  profit. They simply don't make a large portion of their profits from<br>  their theme park business. Disney would lose a handful of employees,<br>  but Florida would lose its largest business and its largest employer.<br>  Disney would continue to hum along, but Florida would lose its biggest<br>  tourism draw, probably the one thing that keeps the state from having<br>  to implement a state income tax.<br><br>So what's probably going to happen here is that Disney and Florida are<br>going to quietly renegotiate the terms of the Reedy Creek Improvement<br>District, and everything will go back to the way it was before.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Isn\'t Florida\'s law specifically targeting Disney a massive<br>infringement of free speech?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
