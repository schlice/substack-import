<br><br><div><br><br># Answers<br><br>## Answer<br><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The simple answer to this question is no, you cannot avoid paying dues<br>to an HOA if the HOA is not following their own rules.<br><br>The details: There is nowhere in your Governing Documents in which there<br>is a provision to allow you to forego your dues payments if you believe<br>that the HOA is not following the rules. Paying dues and holding the HOA<br>accountable are two separate operations.<br><br>If you believe the HOA is not following the rules, you should (in this<br>order):<br><br>1.  Notify the HOA that they are violating the rules, and await their<br>    response.<br>2.  If they respond and they admit their fault, they will fix it.<br>    Problem solved.<br>3.  If they do not respond, or if they respond and deny their fault, you<br>    will have to hire an attorney and sue the HOA, which will most<br>    likely send you into arbitration. You will meet with an arbitrator,<br>    you will discuss your concerns, the HOA will present their<br>    arguments, and the arbitrator will make a decision, and you will<br>    both sign the agreement, and you will both be bound by the<br>    agreement.<br><br>None of that has anything to do with the provisions which you agreed to<br>when you bought your property requiring you to pay dues. And nowhere in<br>the process of holding the HOA accountable is a provision which allows<br>you to withhold your dues payments.<br><br>If you have a complaint about dues, you need to address that separately.<br>But your perception that the Board is violating its own regulations does<br>not grant you authority to stop paying your dues.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
