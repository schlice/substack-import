<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you are in contempt of court, a bench warrant will be issued for your<br>arrest. If the bench warrant is entered into NICS, any agency which<br>performs NICS checks (gun stores, law enforcement, security clearances,<br>etc) will see the warrant. The actions they take will depend on the<br>agency conducting the check.<br><br>If you are stopped by law enforcement and the warrant shows up, the law<br>enforcement agency will contact the court which issued the warrant and<br>ask if they want you to be held on the warrant. Extradition is not cheap<br>or easy, so not every agency will do it. They look at several factors,<br>such as the nature of the offense which caused you to be held in<br>contempt, as well as the distance away you are. They have to pay for two<br>officers' travel and expenses to go to where you are to get you, so they<br>get to decide whether or not they will extradite. If they do decide to<br>extradite, you will be held in your jurisdiction until the issuing<br>locality can retrieve you. If they do not decide to extradite, law<br>enforcement will proceed as they were going to before the warrant check.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
