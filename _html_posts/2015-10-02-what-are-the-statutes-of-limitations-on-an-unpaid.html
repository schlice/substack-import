<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You have asked a specific legal question, and you need to<br>once again consult an attorney to get actual, actionable advice.\<br>\<br>In general, in New York, the statute of limitation on debts is 6 years<br>(or so Google tells me). This is for oral, written, promissory, or<br>open-ended debts (like credit cards). So yes, it\'s still appropriate to<br>consult with an attorney to seek repayment of the<br>debt.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
