<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Hello, first of all as someone who also has MS-induced bladder and bowel<br>issues, I personally know your struggle.<br><br>Since you asked about your job, I'll start my answer with the<br>job-related information, and then I'll move on to the bowel/bladder<br>information.<br><br>**You are not required to disclose your disability to your employer if<br>you do not want to.** However, *if you need an accommodation to help you<br>accomplish the specifics of your job, you do have to ask for it.* The<br>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) makes it something for which you<br>cannot be fired, unless the accommodation request is unreasonable,<br>or is something that the business would have to invest significant money<br>into, or that it would significantly change the way they do business.<br><br>Now, I don't know what you do for work, but here are some potential<br>accommodations you can ask for which may help:<br><br>- Easy access to a restroom: Requesting to be located near a restroom or<br>  in a position that allows for quick and discreet bathroom breaks is a<br>  common and reasonable accommodation.<br>- Flexible bathroom breaks: Employers should be flexible about allowing<br>  you to take breaks as needed without fear of repercussions or stigma.<br>- Access to a private restroom: A private restroom can offer the space<br>  and privacy needed to manage your condition comfortably.<br>- Hands-free disposal units: Providing discreet, hands-free disposal<br>  bins in restrooms ensures a private and hygienic way to dispose of<br>  incontinence products.<br><br>You could also ask for an accommodation like these, but again, I don't<br>know what you do, and some of these suggestions may not necessarily<br>apply to you:<br><br>- Flexible work schedules or telework: Working from home or having a<br>  modified work schedule can help you manage your symptoms more<br>  effectively, especially on days when symptoms are severe.<br>- Part-time hours or modified work schedule: Depending on your needs,<br>  adjusting your work hours or schedule may be a viable option.<br><br>There may be some workstation changes you can make to help you manage<br>your incontinence:<br><br>- Adjustable (sit/stand) desk: An adjustable desk that allows you to<br>  stand instead of sitting may be helpful, as sitting can sometimes<br>  worsen incontinence symptoms.<br>- Ergonomic chair or exercise ball: Using an ergonomic chair or exercise<br>  ball can support posture and core strength, potentially improving<br>  symptoms.<br>- Accessible toilets and toilet seats: This addresses potential physical<br>  barriers in the workplace restroom.<br>- Toileting aids: If necessary, specific aids may be requested to<br>  facilitate toileting.<br><br>Finally, here's some other changes you can request from your employer,<br>regardless of what you do:<br><br>- Additional rests or breaks: More frequent breaks can help manage<br>  fatigue or other symptoms associated with your condition.<br>- Unpaid or paid leave: In cases of severe symptoms, hospitalization, or<br>  procedures, you may be able to request leave as an accommodation.<br>- Modified duties: Depending on your job, some duties may be modified to<br>  accommodate your needs.<br><br>Remember that under the ADA, employers are required to provide<br>*reasonable* accommodations that enable you to perform the essential<br>functions of your job, as long as these accommodations do not cause<br>undue hardship to the business. Your employer is permitted to ask for<br>medical documentation to support your request for accommodation. If they<br>do, you'll have to get a letter from your neurologist explaining that<br>your bowel/bladder incontinence is incident to your MS.<br><br>And while I know it's challenging, having open communication with your<br>employer or HR department can help facilitate the process and ensure<br>your needs are met.<br><br>\<br><br>On the MS side, bowel and bladder incontinence is an issue which is not<br>only caused by MS. There are many medication products available to<br>control spasticity in both the bowel and the bladder. My personal<br>regimen would be different from yours; MS is like that. Even if we have<br>the same category of symptoms (i.e. bowel and bladder issues), we<br>experience them differently. So I can't tell you what medicines and<br>interventions will work best for you, but I can tell you that there is a<br>wealth of capability to manage these symptoms.<br><br>I strongly suggest you talk to your neurologist (and perhaps a urologist<br>or a gastroenterologist as recommended by your neurologist) and ask<br>about remediation you can take to control these symptoms.<br><br>\<br><br>I also invite you to visit us over at the [[Multiple Sclerosis<br>Forum](https://multiplesclerosisforum.quora.com/)]{.qlink_container}<br>right here on Quora.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional medical advice.
