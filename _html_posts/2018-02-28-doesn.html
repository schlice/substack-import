<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Doesn\'t it make the public lose trust and respect for law enforcement<br>when police as blatantly violate traffic laws and park illegally when<br>clearly not on call, including speeding and parking in handicap spots?**<br><br>First, police vehicles are not classified as "motor vehicles" in the<br>vehicle and traffic laws of almost every city and state in the country.<br>They are classified as "emergency vehicles" and are therefore not<br>subject to those regulations. Have you ever seen a parking ticket on a<br>police car? You can't, because they are not classified in the same way<br>as motor vehicles which are subject to traffic laws.<br><br>That said, there are always department rules regarding where vehicles<br>should park and where they shouldn't. Usually, departments avoid parking<br>cruisers in marked handicapped spots and instead will park in a fire<br>lane or in a similar "No Parking" location, for reasons which we'll get<br>to.<br><br>Secondly, police officers need quick access to their vehicles if they<br>get an emergency call. If you were trapped in a building and needed<br>police to respond quickly, would you want the police officer to have<br>quick access to his vehicle to respond as fast as possible, or would you<br>rather have him make his way out to a parking spot and contend with all<br>of the headaches of negotiating a parking lot rather than responding to<br>your call? Because they need rapid access to their vehicles, they often<br>park in areas which would be illegal for you to park your own personal<br>car.<br><br>If this practice makes you lose respect for the police, it's only<br>because you don't have a clear understanding of why it happens.<br>Therefore, the loss of respect is your problem, not the police officer's<br>problem.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
