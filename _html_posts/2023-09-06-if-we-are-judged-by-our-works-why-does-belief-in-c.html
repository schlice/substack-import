<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a really valid question.<br><br>If we are judged by our works alone, *then why did Christ have to die?*<br>If we are the sole reason we go to Heaven, then there was no reason for<br>Christ's sacrifice. Our efforts would be what gets us to Heaven, nothing<br>else.<br><br>So there must be something else besides our works.<br><br>The answer is we do not gain salvation by our works. We are indeed<br>judged by our actions, but our *salvation* is a gift from God. It is not<br>conditioned on the presence or absence of our good works.<br><br>Salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone.<br><br>Once we are saved, our good works flow from that salvation. Our<br>works *demonstrate God's love* to the world. In other words, *salvation<br>begets works; works do not beget salvation.*<br><br>Now, that's not to say that someone who is not saved cannot perform good<br>works. You can perform good works both before and after you are saved.<br>The point is it's not the works that get you the salvation.<br><br>> For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith---and this is<br>> not from yourselves, it is the gift of God---not by works, so that no<br>> one can boast. --- Ephesians 2:8--9 NIV<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
