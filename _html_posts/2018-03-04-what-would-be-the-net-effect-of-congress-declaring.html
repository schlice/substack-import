That actually makes them<br>part of the "organized" militia, also known as the National Guard.<br><br>If you're suggesting that we change the law and remove the unorganized<br>militia and make all citizens part of the organized militia, I'd see<br>that there would be as much backlash to that as you'd get if you<br>reinstated the draft.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
