<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Have you actually spoken to them? They probably already know that you<br>have enough real capital to pay the bill. In their eyes, you're simply<br>choosing to not pay the bill. But I have a hard time believing that they<br>are simply refusing to put a payment plan together for you. Unless you<br>have so much real capital that they know you are not financially<br>hurting and can easily pay, I do believe they would help you.<br><br>You should call their billing department and try to work out a plan. If<br>they refuse, you could allow the bill to go to collections who will be<br>more likely to work out that plan for you (at a cost to your credit<br>score). You can also enlist the services of a debt restructuring or debt<br>consolidation company who can sell you a product which will cover all of<br>your bills and you then make monthly payments towards. You may find this<br>to be more palatable than convincing the hospital that you need a<br>payment plan.<br><br>As a last resort, you can declare bankruptcy and have the courts force<br>the hospital to work out a payment plan, if you literally do not have<br>enough real capital to cover the bill. But that's only if you don't have<br>enough real capital to cover the bill. You own a car? Sell it. You own a<br>house? Sell it. You own any other real property? Sell it. At that point,<br>if you simply don't have enough real property to cover the bill, you<br>declare bankruptcy which triggers all sorts of debt restructuring. Some<br>debtors may simply choose to excuse the debt. Most will opt to establish<br>a court-overseen payment plan where you and any other debtors you have<br>work together to come up with a payment plan you can afford. Believe me,<br>you'll be eating popcorn and Mac 'n' Cheese for the whole time you're<br>paying, because every last nickel will go towards paying those debts.<br>But it can work if you can tough it out.<br><br>There is a difference between "can't pay" and "don't want to pay."<br>Debtors of all flavors know those differences, and most consumers do<br>not.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-happens-if-a-tourist-woman-cant-pay-the-medical-bill-for-giving-birth-in-the-USA-and-Canada/answer/Alex-Wong-66<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
