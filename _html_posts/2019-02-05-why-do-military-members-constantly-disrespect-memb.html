<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why do military members constantly disrespect members of other<br>branches?**<br><br>Let's talk about *respect.*<br><br>Respect is earned. Respect is not deserved. I may respect you<br>because of your position (i.e. I respect a superior officer because he<br>or she is a superior officer), but I may not respect you as a person<br>(i.e. I may not want to go have a beer with you). You are not<br>automatically deserving of respect because of who you are or where you<br>work. You become worthy of respect when you do things which are worthy<br>of respect, and comport yourself in a manner worthy of respect.<br><br>Phew.<br><br>As far as the relationship between the branches, we have good-natured<br>*inter-service rivalry*. We do not *disrespect* each other, whatever<br>that means. At the end of the day, we all have the same job: support and<br>defend the Constitution. That's why we love our inter-service football<br>games. The Army-Navy game has been a tradition for over 100 years (the<br>first game was in 1890). I *love* to see that Army has a great team this<br>season. I love that they kept the Commander-in-Chief's trophy. I'd be<br>lying if I said I wasn't sad that Air Force didn't bring it home this<br>year. But Army deserves some wins, and the way they've been playing is<br>just awesome to watch.<br><br>General Douglas S. MacArthur said it best:<br><br>> *On the fields of friendly strife are sown the seeds that on other<br>> days and other fields will bear the fruits of victory.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
