Pray to whatever higher<br>power you believe in (if you have one) that your reasons are wrong.<br><br>If the officer arrives in a local police car, wearing a local police<br>uniform, there is almost no chance that the person is not a police<br>officer.<br><br>If you're still paranoid, or if the person is in plain clothes rolling<br>up in a car with nothing more than a Kojak light on it<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-4e8262a00d9f51d6ed70e3837d24703f){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-4e8262a00d9f51d6ed70e3837d24703f" master_w="300"<br>master_h="225"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>then you can do the following:<br><br>- Ask the officer for his identification card. Someone playing at being<br>  an officer will have a very official-looking badge and usually a gun,<br>  but very rarely will have an ID card. If you see an ID card, even if<br>  you're not an expert in the ID card layouts of your local law<br>  enforcement agencies, and it doesn't look like it was printed on a<br>  dot-matrix printer and laminated at Kinko's, you can be reasonably<br>  assured that the person is a police officer. Real ID cards are<br>  directly printed onto plastic cards because they are usually proximity<br>  cards which function both as ID cards and as keys to the station<br>  doors. They're not usually laminated.<br>- Request to call 911 and ask the dispatcher if the person is a real<br>  officer. If it is a real officer, he or she should indulge you that<br>  much leeway, but just that much. They will probably dial 911 on their<br>  phone and then hand it to you to talk to the dispatcher.<br><br>If none of these things assuages your fears (or if the person does not<br>show you an ID card and does not let you call 911), you have a choice to<br>make. If you're still in your car, you can attempt to flee, and drive<br>immediately to the nearest police station and run inside. Once the<br>officer is identified, however, be prepared to face additional charges,<br>such as resisting arrest. If you're not in your car, you could try to<br>run, but this could also be very dangerous for you.<br><br>Regardless, if you do run, don't run away, run to a police station. In<br>the unlikely event that the person was not a real police officer, you'll<br>be safe and exonerated. If they were actually an officer, they will<br>likely arrest you at the police station, but at least you know it's real<br>cops, so there's that. Just be prepared for additional charges.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
