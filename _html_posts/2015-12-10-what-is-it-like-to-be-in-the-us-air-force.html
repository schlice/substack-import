<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You are headed to a very exciting opportunity! And might I be the first<br>to thank you in advance for your service to our nation.<br><br>To add to [[Tom<br>Farrier](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tom-Farrier)]{.qlink_container}\'s<br>excellent advice, let me offer you the following bits of advice:<br><br>1.  Keep an open mind. If you go into it with pre-conceived notions<br>    about what you think your military experience *should* be like, you<br>    will only be disappointed when it does not live up to your<br>    expectations, or it is different than you thought. It\'s an<br>    adventure! Live it like one! Deal with the challenges as they come<br>    (and they will, but challenging yourself is not a bad thing), and<br>    look for the positives when it seems like everything around you is<br>    negative.<br>2.  Basic Training is designed to tear you down as an individual and<br>    build you up as a team. Your individuality will be removed: you\'ll<br>    all dress the same, they will shave off all your hair (thus removing<br>    your hairstyle, another avenue of individuality), etc. Remember that<br>    everyone there is going through exactly the same thing, and everyone<br>    there feels the same way, even if they don\'t express it. Also<br>    remember that they can\'t legally kill you, so they\'re just trying<br>    to test you. It\'s not personal. It\'s training. And the logic of<br>    what they do will only make sense well after you leave. Just go with<br>    it.<br>3.  Tech school is much more chill, but remember that these are the<br>    foundational skills you will need in your job. The skills you learn<br>    in tech school probably won\'t be what you do day-to-day, but they<br>    provide the foundation of knowledge you will need to excel at your<br>    job. You\'ll learn more about your specific skills when you arrive<br>    at your first duty station.<br>4.  Tom said to be an expert in your field. He\'s absolutely right. Do<br>    everything you can to become the best you can be in your career<br>    field. Take extra training if it is offered, complete your PME as<br>    soon as you are able to apply, etc. These things only help come<br>    promotion time. Rather than just \"filling the squares,\" do your<br>    best, and the squares will fill themselves.<br><br>\"Duty, then, is the sublimest word in the English language. You should<br>do your duty in all things. You can never do more; you should never wish<br>to do less.\" \-- Gen. Robert E. Lee<br><br>\"If I do my full duty, the rest will take care of itself.\" \-- Gen.<br>George S. Patton, Jr.<br><br>\"The courage of a soldier is heightened by his knowledge of his<br>profession.\" \-- Vegetius; De Re Militari, i, 389<br><br>\"The true measure of a professional lies in his ability to adapt to new<br>situations.\" \-- Hon. Harold Brown, SecAF 1966<br><br>and the last training quote that springs to mind:<br><br>\"On the fields of friendly strife are sown the seeds that on other days<br>and other fields will bear the fruits of victory.\" - Gen. Douglas<br>MacArthur<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
