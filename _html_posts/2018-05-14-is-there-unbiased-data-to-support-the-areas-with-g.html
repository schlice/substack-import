Therefore, it<br>makes no *logical sense* to try to compare gun ownership to crimes<br>against the person.<br><br>At best, the statistics you should be looking at are rates of issuance<br>of CCW permits vs rates of crimes against the person. However, I don't<br>know of anywhere that those statistics exist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
