<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As you can see in this infographic, "vanishingly small" means 1%:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-cd15c7640fb9b18e33e7a226aa553458){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-cd15c7640fb9b18e33e7a226aa553458"<br>master_w="1175" master_h="551"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(Source:* [[*Abortions Later in Pregnancy \|<br>KFF*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a74beb&url=https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/abortions-later-in-pregnancy/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="kff.org"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br>So "never" is not accurate. Less than 1 in 100 abortions occurs post 20<br>weeks. That's not "never," but it is pretty rare. So when lawmakers even<br>propose "Draconian" 15-week abortion limits, this still allows \~95% of<br>abortions to continue to legally take place.<br><br>The other problem is that "viability" is a moving target. First, less<br>than 30% of babies born earlier than 22 weeks survive. So viability<br>means "a minimum starting point before which survival outside of the<br>mother's womb is, using current technology, virtually impossible."<br>Second, as technology improves, so too will the date of viability.<br>Already, experiments with an artificial womb are proving fruitful,<br>meaning that babies will soon be able to survive after being removed<br>from the mother even earlier than 20 weeks:<br><br>[https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/19/h\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e10fac&url=https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/19/health/artificial-womb-human-trial-fda/index.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cnn.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Technology will soon obviate the need to kill babies, as we will be able<br>to transfer them into an artificial womb. Then, there will be no need to<br>kill them, and the mother can be free of them if she wishes.<br><br>So ultimately, I believe that this debate will end with technology.<br>Abortion will become outdated and unnecessary, as pregnant women who no<br>longer want to be pregnant will simply have their baby transferred to an<br>artificial womb.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
