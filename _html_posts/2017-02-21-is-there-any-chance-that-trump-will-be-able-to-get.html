<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Trump can *lobby* to change the 14th amendment, but he cannot do it<br>himself. He still needs Congress and the states to change an amendment,<br>just like the constitution demands. If enough people believe as he does,<br>the amendment will be changed by passing a new amendment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
