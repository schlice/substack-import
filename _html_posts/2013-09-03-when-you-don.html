<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Let me give you the military equivalent and let you draw<br/>your own conclusions. In the Air Force, we are all collectively called<br/>\"Airmen\" in the same way you would refer to the Army as \"Soldiers\"<br/>and the Navy as \"Sailors.\" We of course had a rank structure which is<br/>far more in depth than that of the police department, but that\'s simply<br/>because of the diversity of positions that require various ranks to show<br/>proficiency and experience.\<br/>\<br/>Anyway, we have a rank called \"Airman\" and it is a low-level enlisted<br/>rank (E-2). I was a Captain (O-3), but I never took offense when someone<br/>called us \"Airmen.\"]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
