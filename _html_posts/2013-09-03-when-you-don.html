<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Let me give you the military equivalent and let you draw<br>your own conclusions. In the Air Force, we are all collectively called<br>\"Airmen\" in the same way you would refer to the Army as \"Soldiers\"<br>and the Navy as \"Sailors.\" We of course had a rank structure which is<br>far more in depth than that of the police department, but that\'s simply<br>because of the diversity of positions that require various ranks to show<br>proficiency and experience.\<br>\<br>Anyway, we have a rank called \"Airman\" and it is a low-level enlisted<br>rank (E-2). I was a Captain (O-3), but I never took offense when someone<br>called us \"Airmen.\"]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
