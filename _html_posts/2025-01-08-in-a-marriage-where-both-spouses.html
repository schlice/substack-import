<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When a home is sold, the proceeds are distributed to the people listed<br>on the deed according to their ownership percentage in the property,<br>meaning each person receives a share of the sale price based on their<br>portion of ownership as defined on the deed, unless there is a specific<br>agreement stating otherwise between the owners.<br><br>If multiple people are listed on the deed with \"joint tenancy,\" they<br>typically receive equal shares of the proceeds. If the deed specifies<br>\"tenancy in common,\" the owners can have different percentages of<br>ownership, and the proceeds are distributed accordingly.<br><br>The deed is the legal document that determines how ownership is divided,<br>so it\'s crucial to review it carefully to understand how proceeds will<br>be distributed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
