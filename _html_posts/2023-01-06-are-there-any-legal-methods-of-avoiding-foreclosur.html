<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In some states, you have a "statutory right of redemption" which you can<br>exercise by paying the full foreclosure sale price (plus interest and<br>fees) within a set period of time after the foreclosure to the<br>foreclosure buyer. Not all states have a statutory right of redemption;<br>if you are interested in pursuing this right of redemption, check with a<br>real estate attorney in your area to see if you can do this. Homeowners<br>who live in states that have statutory redemption statutes must be able<br>to pay the exact amount of what the property was sold for at the final<br>foreclosure sale within the time period specified in your state<br>(anywhere between thirty days and one year), or else the lender can<br>re-seize it and sell it to another party.<br><br>Beyond statutory redemption, the only other method of avoiding<br>foreclosure is to pay off the amount you owe on any outstanding liens<br>against your home (especially the one foreclosing on its lien), or the<br>mortgage itself (if you stopped paying that).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
