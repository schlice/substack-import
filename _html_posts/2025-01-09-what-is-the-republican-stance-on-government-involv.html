<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Republicans truly believe that government should be as far removed as<br>possible from women's reproductive rights.<br><br>HOWEVER, Republicans believe that government should be<br>*preeminently* involved in what activities we classify as "women's<br>reproductive rights."<br><br>Specifically, whether we should call the destruction of a living human<br>being, for reasons other than to save the life of the woman, "women's<br>reproductive rights."<br><br>Once we create bright-line boundaries around the term "women's<br>reproductive rights," then how those rights are managed fall squarely<br>between a woman and her doctor.<br><br>But redefining the term "women's reproductive rights" to include the<br>destruction of living human beings for reasons other than to save the<br>life of the woman is not acceptable, and Republicans believe that<br>government should be specifically involved in that conversation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
