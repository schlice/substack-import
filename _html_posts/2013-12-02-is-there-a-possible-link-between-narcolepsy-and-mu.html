<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Narcolepsy is one of the major sleep disorders in which<br>the brain cannot adequately regulate sleep cycles. Narcolepsy is a<br>neurologic disorder, not an illness, and the course of the disease is<br>similar to the course of multiple sclerosis, except that the issues<br>within the brain causing narcolepsy originate from a different source<br>than MS. Narcolepsy is generally caused by gene mutations or other brain<br>abnormalities, where MS brain issues are caused by autoimmune damage to<br>nerve cells.\<br>\<br>However, it is not a stretch to see how damage to the brain caused by MS<br>could potentially cause sleep apnea or other associated sleep disorders,<br>should MS lesions occur on the brain stem. Sleep is a major issue for MS<br>patients, as fatigue (or MS lassitude) is one of the most prevalent<br>symptoms of the disease. MS patients also face restless leg syndrome<br>(RLS), which is a major disruptor to normal sleep cycles.\<br>\<br>There is a weak causation between multiple sclerosis and obstructive<br>sleep apnea. [[A 2014<br>study](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fd7740&url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24532998){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nih.gov"}]{.qlink_container} headed by Dr. Tiffany Jo Braley<br>of the University of Michigan Health System Department of Neurology<br>found the following:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> Results:\<br>> Mean AHI was higher among patients with MS than among control groups A<br>> or B (2-way analysis of variance and multiple linear regression, *p* =<br>> 0.0011 and 0.0118, respectively). Median and mean CAI were also<br>> increased among patients with MS in comparison to control groups<br>> (Wilcoxon signed rank and multiple linear regression, *p* = 0.0064 and<br>> 0.0027, respectively). Among MS patients with available data, those<br>> with evidence of brainstem involvement, compared with groups A and B,<br>> showed particularly robust differences in AHI (*p* = 0.0060 and<br>> 0.0016) and CAI (*p* = 0.0215 and \<0.0001). In contrast, MS patients<br>> without brainstem involvement, compared with groups A and B, showed<br>> diminished differences in AHI, and CAI did not significantly differ<br>> among groups.\<br>> Conclusions:\<br>> These data suggest a predisposition for obstructive sleep apnea and<br>> accompanying central apneas among patients with MS, particularly among<br>> those with brainstem involvement. (summary from [[PubMed<br>> Canada](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=535c90&url=http://pubmedcentralcanada.ca/pmcc/articles/PMC3425840/){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="pubmedcentralcanada.ca"}]{.qlink_container})\<br><br>\<br>While there is no direct causational link between multiple sclerosis and<br>narcolepsy, it is not difficult to see how a MS patient could easily<br>develop major sleep disorders and have a predisposition to obstructive<br>sleep apneas and other central apneas if their MS includes lesions on<br>the brain stem.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
