<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with most states, the left lane is called the "passing" lane. This<br>means the left lane is designated for traffic that is desiring to<br>"pass." If you are not passing the car ahead of you in the right lane,<br>you should move back to the right lane, which is known as the "travel"<br>lane. On three-lane roads, the right and center lanes are travel lanes,<br>and the left lane is a passing lane.<br><br>So when they say "driving" in the left lane, what they are actually<br>referring to is "traveling" in the left lane without passing someone.<br><br>Generally, this provision of the traffic code goes unenforced unless the<br>person in the left lane is causing a traffic hazard by impeding traffic<br>so badly that it is forced to pass on the right, which is more<br>dangerous.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
