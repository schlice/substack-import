<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The person who is truly "saved" *dies to their sin* and is *born again*.<br>They become a new person in Christ.<br><br>This isn't merely just "word imagery." This is a truth of salvation.<br>Your old life *dies*. You become a new person. The old person is<br>"crucified" (Romans 6) and a new man lives in his place (2 Cor 5:15, Gal<br>2:20).<br><br>Christ paid for our past sin with his death and resurrection. Yes it<br>happened, and yes you will face those sins on the day of judgement, *but<br>those who are saved have already had the cost of those sins covered*.<br><br>You don't have to "change your mind about your sins." God has given you<br>the gift of Jesus, and he has paid for your sin. It is done. You cannot<br>change what has happened. You committed the sin, but Christ sacrificed<br>himself, and took the punishment you deserved, clearing your way to go<br>to heaven.<br><br>Whoa. That's a pretty amazing gift he gave us, isn't it?<br><br>However, if you were "saved" *and yet you still live in sin,* the same<br>sins you lived in before you were "saved," I might question whether or<br>not you were actually "saved" in the first place.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If I commit sins on Earth and live a bad life but I am saved, are the<br>consequences of those sins eternal? If so, how do I have a change of<br>mind about my sins?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
