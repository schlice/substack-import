<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the law saying that immigrants must be detained while waiting<br>for their hearing instead of some alternative?**<br><br>There are a few things at play here. One is the treatment of illegal<br>immigrants, and the other is the treatment of children who accompany<br>illegal immigrants across the border.<br><br>In this case, we're talking about Federal law which says that if you<br>enter the country illegally, it is a crime for which you are arrested.<br>When you are caught violating Federal law, you go to jail. It's kind of<br>a given; I'm not sure why this is a difficult concept to understand.<br><br>I'm not certain that there are many scenarios in which you can violate<br>Federal law, get caught, and have some alternative to jail. There could<br>be bond, I guess. But what bond agent is going to put up the bond for an<br>illegal immigrant? Maybe some would, I don't know. But perhaps you could<br>bond out of custody.<br><br>Minors can be released into the custody of an adult. Some minors cannot<br>be released, and they go into approved housing facilities.<br><br>More to the current controversy is the treatment of those minor children<br>who are not released. As to their treatment, there is no written law.<br>What you have is a series of INS procedures which were challenged in<br>court, and thus became "case law."<br><br>The specific case law pertains to a case colloquially called the<br>[[*Flores Consent Decree of<br>1997*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eac750&url=https://www.conservativedailynews.com/2018/06/flores-consent-decree-of-1997-full-text/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="conservativedailynews.com"}]{.qlink_container}. This case<br>says that for minors who are not released, they must be "expeditiously"<br>moved to new facilities.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
