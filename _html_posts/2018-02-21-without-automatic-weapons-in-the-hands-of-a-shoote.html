<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Without automatic weapons in the hands of a shooter, how could the Las<br>Vegas deaths have happened and 17 children get murdered in mass<br>killings?**<br><br>Maybe I'm not understanding the question, but it seems like you're<br>asking how people can kill if they don't have guns.<br><br>You do realize that guns make killing *easier*. Guns don't make<br>killing *possible.*<br><br>Here's a few examples of other items which are not guns which have been<br>used to kill:<br><br>- Trucks. [[Man kills 8 in New York City truck<br>  attack](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ba6819&url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/31/us/new-york-shots-fired/index.html){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="cnn.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br>- Bombs. [[2002 Bali<br>  bombings](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=425bbd&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Bali_bombings){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br>- Fire. [[Cases of arson-homicide in Australia almost double in 20<br>  years:<br>  study](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d3aca3&url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-03/arson-homicides-on-the-rise-in-australia-institute-criminology/6592448){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="abc.net.au"}]{.qlink_container}<br>  - Arson is the tool *du jour* in Australia. Incidentally, you'll<br>    notice that arson homicides have doubled since the Australians<br>    instituted a gun ban, which just lends credence to my stance that if<br>    you take guns away, killers will simply change their killing tools<br>- Knives. [[A knife attack every 4 minutes; 130,000 per year - but<br>  ministers still insist crime rates are<br>  falling](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5598da&url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1036154/A-knife-attack-4-minutes-130-000-year--ministers-insist-crime-rates-falling.html){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="dailymail.co.uk"}]{.qlink_container}<br>  - Knives are the preferred killing tool in the UK. There, where guns<br>    are also banned, roughly 350 people per day are victims of knife<br>    attacks.<br>- Airplanes. [[September 11<br>  attacks](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1c9366&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Any one of these methods could have been used with varying degrees of<br>success in Las Vegas and in Parkland, FL. Some methods may have caused<br>fewer deaths, others may have caused far more deaths.<br><br>This is the reason that focusing on the tool is the wrong idea. I mean,<br>let's make sure we're not sloppy with the tool. I think we should raise<br>the minimum age to buy a long gun to 21 (not possess, just buy, and then<br>keep a record of transfer to someone under 21). But beyond things like<br>that, let's make sure we focus on the killer, not the tool they use. You<br>do remember that murder is illegal too, right? Yet these killers,<br>regardless of the tool, continue to murder, despite the presence or<br>absence of the tool.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
