<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How accurate is an MRI to diagnose multiple sclerosis?<br><br>The MRI is one of the most important tools used in diagnosing MS, *but<br>it alone cannot diagnose MS.*<br><br>MS is a diagnosis of *exclusion*, because there is no one symptom unique<br>to it. Even the small, ovoid patches (in other words, little white<br>spots) on an MRI can be caused by other diseases. Therefore, you have to<br>*exclude* all other diseases and conditions which might cause little<br>white spots on an MRI.<br><br>Along with the MRI, the neurologist will begin to exclude all other<br>known diseases and conditions which can cause an MRI to show white<br>lesions on the brain. A panel of blood tests are performed (colloquially<br>called, no surprise, the "little white spot series") which rule out<br>other diseases which can cause both the symptom experienced and the<br>white spots on the MRI.<br><br>The MRI has become so important in the diagnosis of MS that the<br>diagnostic criteria used to diagnose the disease were changed to include<br>a positive MRI. This criteria is called the [[**McDonald<br>criteria**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=891dab&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald_criteria){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. Previously, the patient<br>had to have two separate symptoms of MS "disseminated by space and<br>time." Dissemination in space means in two separate areas of the CNS<br>(i.e. the brain, the spinal cord, the optic nerve, etc). Dissemination<br>in time meant no closer together than six months. Therefore, in order to<br>get a full diagnosis of MS, you would have to have two relapses.<br><br>In 2017, the McDonald criteria were updated to include evidence of one<br>of those two symptoms appearing only on an MRI. Therefore, you can show<br>symptoms in only one functional system of the body, and show evidence on<br>an MRI of the inclusion of a second functional system, and of course,<br>run the "little white spot series" to rule out any other possible causes<br>of the symptoms or the little white spots. So for a person who has had<br>only one attack, the MRI can provide the evidence that a second system<br>is involved, and that the second event is older, disseminated by time<br>(the MRI can show active lesions, and lesions which were active but are<br>now inactive, using [[**gadolinium<br>enhancement**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b22a95&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRI_contrast_agent){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}).<br><br>Therefore, it's fair to say that the MRI is so important in the<br>diagnosis of MS, that as of 2017, you can now be diagnosed after only<br>one relapse, if you have an MRI which shows evidence of previous disease<br>activity in another functional area of the<br>CNS.\[1\](#vHswA){#cite-vHswA .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-vHswA){.citation_index} [[Diagnosing<br>MS](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3985d2&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/Diagnosing-MS){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
