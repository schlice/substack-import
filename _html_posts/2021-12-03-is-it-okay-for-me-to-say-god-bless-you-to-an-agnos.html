In the United States, you have freedom of speech. You can say<br>whatever you like, even if the person you are speaking to happens to<br>practice a different religion than you (or no religion at all).<br><br>Are you worried that the atheist or agnostic person will be *offended*?<br>Because you offered a sincere blessing? I mean, it's a silly habit we<br>held over from the time when we thought that sneezes were evil spirits<br>being violently expelled from our bodies; nonetheless, it's still a<br>polite thing to do.<br><br>You're literally being polite. We do remember what politeness is these<br>days, don't we? If an atheist or agnostic takes offense at you offering<br>a blessing after a sneeze, we're in a far worse place in this world than<br>even I thought. Since you cannot control them, their offense is not a<br>reflection on *you*. It is a reflection on *them* and how they respond<br>to stimuli in their environment.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it okay for me to say God bless you to an agnostic/atheist?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
