<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a cop knocks on my door and says he has a warrant how can I confirm<br>he\'s not lying this happened last march he said police I have a warrent<br>for (my name) I opened the door he then didn\'t have a warrant and<br>walked in which is trespassing?**<br><br>If you can't see out of your front door, you should fix that. Have a<br>peephole installed, or use a Ring doorbell (or similar video doorbell).<br><br>Really, the police can tell you they have a warrant, even if they don't,<br>and there really isn't a way at the door for you to know. If they called<br>one in, they may not have the paper warrant in hand, but they may still<br>have a warrant. In other words, they may not have a piece of paper to<br>show you in all cases. Some jurisdictions may require it, and if you do<br>the research, maybe you can find out if a paper warrant is required in<br>your jurisdiction. If it is, you can demand to see it before you open<br>your door.<br><br>If they do not have a warrant but they said they did, this is an issue<br>for your lawyer to argue. In essence, assuming you were arrested, it may<br>have been an unlawful arrest if you were arrested without a warrant and<br>without probable cause. The police don't need a warrant to arrest you,<br>but if they don't have a warrant, they have to have probable cause that<br>you committed a crime. If they don't have either of those, your lawyer<br>should help you with that.<br><br>The other question at issue is the police entering your house uninvited.<br>There are certain circumstances under which police are allowed to do<br>this; the primary method by which they can do this is called *exigent<br>circumstances*. In other words, if the police feel that circumstances<br>exist in which someone could be hurt, or evidence of a crime could be<br>destroyed, or a suspect could escape, or some other consequence which<br>"improperly frustrates legitimate law enforcement efforts," they can<br>enter without a warrant.<br><br>The police are not required to explain any of this to you, either their<br>lack of a warrant or their entry into your home without permission. They<br>are only required to explain this to the judge. You are required to<br>explain exactly what happened, and your lawyer is there to help ensure<br>that the police followed the law to the letter. If they did not, the<br>arrest could be thrown out.<br><br>If you were not arrested, but you are still concerned that the police<br>forced their way into your home, you should file a complaint with the<br>department. It would be a waste of time to try to argue a trespassing<br>claim.<br><br>Just remember: there is never a legal requirement to open your front<br>door for anyone. If you don't like what the "police" are telling you,<br>don't open your door. If they have a warrant for your arrest, they're<br>coming in whether you like it or not. You can always refuse. If there is<br>a true warrant though, they can break down your door to arrest you and<br>you would be liable to fix the door. But if they don't have a warrant,<br>they won't break your door down. If you want to roll the dice, you're<br>free to do so; replacement cost of a front door notwithstanding.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
