<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [It makes for compelling movies, but it makes for bad<br/>portrayal of reality.\<br/>\<br/>The heart of hostage negotiation is patience and the simplification of<br/>logic. When the guy says \"drop your gun or I\'ll shoot this hostage,\"<br/>I\'d remind him that he\'d have little chance of pulling the trigger,<br/>swinging his gun towards me and firing before I can get at least one<br/>shot off, so he\'d be dead anyway. He may as well shoot himself and save<br/>me the trouble. And if he kills the hostage, I don\'t have to worry<br/>about hitting them. It\'s open-season, basically.\<br/>\<br/>Basically, ask the terrorist how killing that person is going to get him<br/>what he wants. It removes the only thing keeping him alive, his only<br/>leverage. Without that leverage, he\'s dead.\<br/>\<br/>(EDIT) I\'d also ask him where the logic is in killing his own human<br/>shield. \"Drop your gun or I will kill the only thing keeping me alive,<br/>and I\'ll give you the legal authority and the motivation to kill me on<br/>the spot.\" Huh?]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
