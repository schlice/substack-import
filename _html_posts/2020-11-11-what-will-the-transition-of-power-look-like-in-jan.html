<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What if Donald Trump doesn\'t concede by January 20, 2021?<br><br>There is no requirement in the Constitution for the President to<br>"concede." There is nothing requiring him to give a concession speech.<br>There's also nothing requiring him to participate in the ceremonies<br>regarding transition of power. If the election was certified and Biden<br>was declared to be the candidate who achieved 270 electoral votes, then<br>Trump's transition team will be moving him out of the White House<br>whether he wants it or not. Most likely, they will relocate his stuff to<br>his new home of residence in Florida. He doesn't own the White House;<br>the people do. He's only a temporary resident there. He's well aware of<br>this.<br><br>The Constitution provides the entire process for transition. There's no<br>real conceivable way that Trump could stay in the White House beyond<br>January 20th if he is not certified to be the winner.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
