<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can you successfully appeal an HOA denial for installing a fence?<br><br>Who exactly are you going to appeal to? There is no group which controls<br>HOAs, as they are nothing more than 501(c)(4) non-profit corporations<br>which you voluntarily joined by purchasing a home in a community which<br>is under covenant control.<br><br>To answer the specific question, if the HOA has denied your request to<br>install a fence, your only other option is to file a lawsuit against the<br>HOA and claim that they are either not enforcing the covenants fairly,<br>or that they have broken their own agreements in some way. You might<br>consider contacting a licensed real estate attorney in your area who<br>specializes in HOAs.<br><br>However, if there's something in the rules that says you cannot install<br>the fence you want to install, in the way you want to install it, and<br>they enforce that rule with everyone within that HOA, there is a fair<br>chance that you won't be able to get them to reverse that decision. HOAs<br>have broad latitude to write and enforce pretty much whatever rules they<br>choose, so long as they don't violate any higher laws or city codes.<br><br>You can claim you have some sort of exemption. We had a woman in our<br>neighborhood who installed unauthorized screening on the inside of her<br>split-rail fence, and she claimed that the dogs she had for her<br>disability required the screening. The HOA at the time didn't want to go<br>up against a possible disability lawsuit, so they dropped the matter.<br>She got to keep the screening. Perhaps you and your attorney can find<br>some sort of exemption you can claim in order to install your fence.<br><br>Beyond hiring an attorney, there's not much more you can do.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
