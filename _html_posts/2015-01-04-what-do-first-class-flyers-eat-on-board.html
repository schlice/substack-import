<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Menus vary widely, mostly dependent on the distance to the<br>destination. But in all cases, first class can start drinking from the<br>moment they plant themselves in their chair, often getting drinks during<br>boarding.\<br>\<br>International first class flyers dine as in a restaurant. Often,<br>business class on international flights eats very similarly to first<br>class, the luxury of the accommodations being the differentiator (i.e.<br>business class seats recline really far but not completely flat; first<br>class seats usually recline completely flat).\<br>\<br>(EDIT) I think that \"dining in a restaurant\" may have connotations<br>that I didn\'t intend. There is no \"stove\" in an airplane, there is no<br>\"chef\" preparing meals. All meals. including first class meals, are<br>essentially pre-cooked and then frozen. The meals are then re-heated on<br>the aircraft. The hot entreé is served on a tray with the remaining<br>cold/room temperature food items.\<br>\<br>Domestically (two-class aircraft), first class gets what Economy used to<br>get back in the day: a choice of hot entreé on a tray with fruit, salad,<br>bread, and dessert.\<br>\<br>Economy now has buy-on-board boxed food, which actually isn\'t too bad,<br>it\'s just not included in the price of your ticket any more. Some of<br>the buy-on-board boxed meals are warm as well.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
