<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My breasts hurt so bad, but one breast hurts more than the other. One<br>has severe pain and is constant. Could it be breast cancer?**<br><br>*Could it be?* *OF COURSE IT COULD BE!*<br><br>It could also be sunspots, although that's far less likely.<br><br>The point is that it *could be* anything. It could be a poor-fitting<br>bra. It could be the way you sleep. It could be something you're eating.<br>It could be breast cancer. Or it could be sunspots.<br><br>So before we jump to "my breasts hurt, I must have breast cancer," let's<br>talk quickly about the most common causes of breast pain.<br><br>Most commonly, the cause of breast pain is hormones. Specifically,<br>hormones in and around your menstrual cycle.<br><br>Breast pain is described as either cyclic or noncyclic,<br>depending on whether or not the pain can be correlated with the<br>menstrual cycle:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-521ac7ebf8878ab226850a92ffd02e44){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-521ac7ebf8878ab226850a92ffd02e44" master_w="675"<br>master_h="473"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(Source:* [[*Mayo<br>Clinic*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e18999&url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20350423){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="mayoclinic.org"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br>Mayo Clinic goes on to summarize breast pain like this:<br><br>> Most times, breast pain signals a noncancerous (benign) breast<br>> condition and rarely indicates breast cancer. Still, unexplained<br>> breast pain that doesn\'t go away after one or two menstrual cycles or<br>> that persists after menopause **needs to be evaluated by your<br>> doctor.**<br><br>Ultimately, **no one on the Internet can diagnose your breast pain<br>issues**. For that, you must see a doctor. Make an appointment with your<br>primary care doctor and explain this to him or her. Talk about whether<br>or not the pain is consistent or periodic, and whether or not the pain<br>is sharp, affects a single area, or is diffuse (i.e. the entire breast<br>hurts or just one small area).<br><br>TL;DR: So could it be breast cancer? Yes it could, but it's highly<br>unlikely. Breast pain that doesn't go away after one or two menstrual<br>cycles needs to be evaluated by your doctor.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
