<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Absolutely.<br><br>Don't believe me? [[Demorcats already said<br>so](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4c8e78&url=https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2025/01/21/adam_schiff_in_2020_presidents_dont_give_an_innocent_person_a_blanket_pardon.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="realclearpolitics.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>Adam Schiff accepted a pardon for his actions while part of the January<br>6th Subcommittee.<br><br>But interestingly, just five years before, he said the following about<br>President Trump's pardons of his family (*emphasis* mine):<br><br>> ADAM SCHIFF: I think the president probably has broader fears than<br>> that about his children. There are any number of reported<br>> investigations \-- some state, some federal \-- in which he may be<br>> concerned that they're facing criminal liability. He's obviously<br>> concerned about himself, from the press reporting, that he would even<br>> go so far as to consider trying to pardon himself somehow.<br>><br>> Look, this is the nature of those the president has surrounded himself<br>> with, including his family, and that is, it's been essentially a den<br>> of thieves environment. So I think the president views this as his way<br>> of trying to protect those that have protected him.<br>><br>> \...<br>><br>> JOY REID: Have you ever heard of somebody getting a preemptive pardon<br>> who was innocent of all crime, just an innocent person? Have you ever<br>> heard of that, just somebody getting a blanket pardon and they're an<br>> innocent person?<br>><br>> ADAM SCHIFF: No. I think that in the cases, the very few cases, where<br>> there have been prospective pardons, such as Ford pardoning Nixon for<br>> whatever he may have done during the presidency, ***there was some<br>> idea of the potential criminal liability facing Richard Nixon. Here,<br>> it's an effort not only to prospectively pardon people for things they<br>> have not yet been charged with and may never be charged with, but also<br>> it's the president's own family. It's people that have been covering<br>> up for the president.***<br>><br>> In addition to his own family, in the case of Roger Stone, it's<br>> someone who lied to help cover up, or Michael Flynn, who lied to help<br>> cover up. So there is a self-interest at play as well, and I think<br>> that makes this quite unique. There were accusations when President<br>> Bush conveyed a pardon to Casper Weinberger that the special counsel<br>> there thought that might have been an effort by then-President Bush to<br>> cover up, but nothing of the scale and scope of what Donald Trump has<br>> already done and is contemplating in the future.<br><br>Pot, meet kettle.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
