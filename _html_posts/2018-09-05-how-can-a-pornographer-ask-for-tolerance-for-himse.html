<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can a pornographer ask for tolerance for himself when rape victims<br>are not allowed to vote for a policy of gassing pornographers? Isn't it<br>the same form of hatred, that leads to death?**<br><br>Your question is flawed from the outset, because you are comparing two<br>things which cannot be compared.<br><br>In the United States, pornography (and production of pornography) is not<br>a crime. Rape is a crime. Rape causes demonstrably more harm than<br>pornography.<br><br>A pornographer (someone who produces pornography) has no need to ask for<br>tolerance because what he does violates no laws.<br><br>Are you trying to say that *consumption of pornography leads to rape?*<br><br>If that's what you're trying to say, then you are making an argument<br>with no proof. Your justification is probably littered with logical<br>fallacies and unproven accusations as well.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
