<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The gun makes it easy for a small person to kill a much<br>larger person. It makes it easy for a small person to kill anyone.\<br>\<br>But so does a homemade bomb made from a readily-available LP tank. I can<br>kill lots more people in a much shorter period of time with a bomb I can<br>make in my basement with parts I buy off the Internet, completely<br>legally.\<br>\<br>But that involves time, money, and effort. A gun involves much less<br>effort, and I can still kill a few people. To most people who have lost<br>the correct mental capacity to make rational decisions, the gun is the<br>faster and easier choice.\<br>\<br>But if all the guns in the world were simply vaporized in the blink of<br>an eye (along with the requisite information on how to make them), would<br>the person who has lost the mental capacity to make rational decisions<br>simply *not kill*? The answer, unfortunately, is no. They will use<br>whatever tool is at their disposal: IEDs, cars, hatchets, baseball bats,<br>sharpened sticks, etc.\<br>\<br>The tool provides the opportunity. The *killer* is often glossed<br>over, because that discussion (how to prevent killers) is ***orders of<br>magnitude harder*** to have than simply banning something tangible, like<br>the gun the killer used. And guns are a famous target of the \"we gotta<br>ban something\" crowd simply because the gun is purpose-built to kill.<br>Nothing else that a killer could potentially use is purpose-built to<br>kill. So the gun becomes a very natural target for their ire.\<br>\<br>Reducing guns should rightly reduce gun violence. But reducing guns<br>*will not reduce violence overall.* That\'s a much harder discussion<br>to have. But until we have it, these kinds of incidents will<br>continue.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
