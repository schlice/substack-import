<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sort of, in the same way that atheism is a sort of religion.<br><br>Atheists will immediately jump in and say, "No! Atheism isn't a religion<br>because we don't believe in a god!" This, of course, implies that the<br>definition of "religion" is "belief in and worship of a god." But there<br>are plenty of theistic religions which are acknowledged as religions<br>which also do not believe in a god, such as Taoism, Shintoism, Buddhism,<br>etc. So that's not really a reason to say that atheism isn't a religion.<br><br>Atheism is, therefore, a *non-theistic* religion, similar to<br>Confucianism in this regard. Atheism, like theism, has many<br>denominations: anti-theism, Gnosticism, agnosticism, apatheism (which is<br>more of an attitude than a belief system, but I digress), etc.<br><br>But still atheists will blanch at being categorized as a non-theistic<br>religion, primarily they associate "religion" with "god" and they either<br>affirmatively reject that a god exists, or they claim to have no belief<br>that a god exists. So to determine if atheism truly is a non-theistic<br>religion, we should be able to compare it to theistic religions. In such<br>a comparison, we should find that it does indeed share characteristics<br>with theistic religions:<br><br>1.  Do they have saints? Saints are people who were important<br>    leaders in their religion that have died but are remembered for<br>    their contributions. Atheism has these: Christopher Hitchens, Carl<br>    Sagan, George Carlin (?), etc.<br>2.  Do they have preachers? Preachers are people who stand on the<br>    stage and deliver a message to those with similar beliefs. Atheism<br>    has these: Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Matt Dillahunty, etc.<br>3.  Do they have core texts? Core texts (which are sacred or holy in<br>    theistic religions) are books or literature written by man that<br>    claims to tell its readers important truths about their beliefs.<br>    Atheists most definitely have these: *The God Delusion, God is Not<br>    Great, The End of Faith,* etc*.*<br>4.  Do they acknowledge blasphemy? Blasphemy would be acts or<br>    statements that are so offensive to their religion that they might<br>    cause emotion or anger in the listener. To see if blasphemy exists<br>    in atheism, try this: tell an atheist that God exists, and if the<br>    atheist is emotional or upset at hearing this, does that not imply<br>    the atheist feels he is being blasphemed against?<br>5.  Do they have apologetics? The definition of apologetics is<br>    "debate and argumentation that attempts to defend a religious belief<br>    against attack." There\'s a reason all the atheists are about to<br>    swarm the comments section: *to defend their religious beliefs*. If<br>    they truly believe in nothing (if they truly have a lack of belief<br>    in god), then there is no reason to defend nothing. Definitionally,<br>    "nothing" needs no defense, as it doesn't exist. A lack of belief<br>    does not need to be defended. Me blathering on about nothing<br>    shouldn't even be noteworthy. It should be nothing worth commenting<br>    on. So by responding, atheists, you are demonstrating the presence<br>    of something which is worthy of defense. And that can't be<br>    "nothing."<br><br>So with that understanding, let's answer the question: do they have<br>churches? Church is traditionally defined as a building (I went to<br>church), but as was demonstrated during Covid, the church clearly<br>identified that it is not a building, but a collection of like-minded<br>people with similar beliefs. Do not atheists have this? American<br>Atheists? Atheist Alliance International? Freedom From Religion<br>Foundation? Do not these organizations meet periodically to discuss<br>insights about their beliefs? Sounds a lot like a non-theistic church to<br>me.<br><br>And let's not forget that atheists can have *degrees of belief* just as<br>theists can. Not all atheists follow atheism religiously, just as not<br>all theists follow theism religiously. For example, just as some<br>Christians might not go to church, listen to pastors, or know the Bible<br>very well, they can still be somewhat religious, or even not religious<br>at all, while still believing in the core philosophy of their religion.<br>In fact, people tell me all the time that they are Christian while<br>either not acting like a Christian, or *even while holding non-Christian<br>beliefs.* In precisely the same way, an atheist may not know anything<br>about important and influential atheist figures, or associate with<br>atheist organizations, or go out seeking to engage in debate or<br>apologetics about atheism, and still just hold a quiet and private<br>belief that God does not exist.<br><br>Therefore, based on this comparison, I personally believe atheism is a<br>non-theistic religion, and atheists do have something akin to a church.<br><br>Cue the shrieking atheists in 3...2...1...<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
