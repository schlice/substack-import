Are there<br>issues with long term use?**<br><br>There are no documented, well-known issues with long-term use *so far*.<br>These second-generation antihistamines have only been around for roughly<br>ten years, so there isn't much longer-term studies that have been done<br>than that amount of time. But from what we have so far, there isn't<br>anything which has been documented which shows any known long-term issue<br>with their use.<br><br>There are, of course, anecdotal issues that occur. But there is nothing<br>documented to show repeatable, known long-term issues.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
