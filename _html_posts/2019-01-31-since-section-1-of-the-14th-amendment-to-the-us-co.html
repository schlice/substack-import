<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Since Section 1 of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution says a US<br>Citizen is any person "born or naturalized in the United States, does<br>that mean a fetus cannot be a US Citizen?**<br><br>Correct, a fetus is not yet "born" so it does not have the rights of<br>citizenship. It doesn't receive a Social Security Number until after it<br>is born. It doesn't receive any vital documentation (i.e. a government<br>birth certificate) until after it is born. So it is therefore not a<br>citizen until it is born.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
