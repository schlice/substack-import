<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the US, if you possess a nude photograph of someone under 18 years<br>old, you are in possession of child pornography, a federal crime. Your<br>age is irrelevant at that point.<br><br>If you give that photo to someone else, you are distributing child<br>pornography, a second federal crime.<br><br>These statutes are not jokes, they are federal crimes. While you<br>personally may only face punishment under the juvenile justice system<br>since you are a minor, that picture (if it makes it to the Internet)<br>will be there *forever*. You will never be able to fully delete it.<br>Think about trying to explain that photo to your future children, or<br>your future spouse, or to a potential employer.<br><br>My advice: destroy that photo before it gets out. If you really want to<br>send nudes, wait until you're 18.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it okay to share your nude if you\'re a minor and anonymous?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
