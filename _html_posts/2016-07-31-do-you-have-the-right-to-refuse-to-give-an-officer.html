<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>*When you are the driver*: no, you do not have the right to refuse to<br>give the police your license or registration. You have a license which<br>is issued by the state. Your license is not a right. Your driving<br>privileges were granted by the state, and the state can revoke your<br>license at any time.<br><br>Part of the privilege of driving on state-owned roads involves agreeing<br>to the state's rules. You must have insurance on your car; it's<br>required. Most states require you to carry proof of insurance in your<br>car at all times. Most states require you to carry a copy of your<br>registration information in your car, and when you are the driver, you<br>are required to carry your license on you.<br><br>State law also says that the police can stop your car, and you must<br>stop. Finally, you are required to present your license, your proof of<br>insurance, and your registration card at any time when a police officer<br>asks you to do so. If you fail to do this, you can be arrested for<br>driving without a license. You can get that charge dismissed in court,<br>but you have to go to court to show them you have a license. Big waste<br>of time.<br><br>*When you are a passenger*, you are not required to carry identification<br>on you. The only piece of information you are required to give to the<br>police when you are asked is your real name. If you fail to do that, you<br>can be arrested until the police verify your identity. Beyond that, you<br>do not have to talk to the police if you don't want to.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
