<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why does president Donald Trump keep screaming "witch hunt" during<br>Mueller's investigation when most of trumps campaign staff has already<br>been indicted or charged?**<br><br>There are several reasons.<br><br>1.  Trump capitalizes on buzzwords. Crooked Hillary and Lyin' Ted were<br>    only a thing because Trump made them so. And you can't hear "Mueller<br>    probe" without thinking "witch hunt" somewhere in the recesses of<br>    your mind. It's very effective marketing.<br>2.  Trump is trying to keep everyone focused on the central original<br>    goal of the Mueller probe: Trump colluding with Russia to steal the<br>    election from Hillary. To this day, no one who has been charged or<br>    indicted has been charged or indicted with any crime even<br>    tangentially related to Trump colluding with Russia to steal the<br>    election from Hillary. So he created the buzzword "witch hunt" to<br>    remind people that no one has yet been charged with anything related<br>    to Trump colluding with Russia to steal an election.<br><br>Yes, it's true that those people committed crimes. They did fail to<br>register as foreign agents, and they did lie to the FBI, and they did<br>evade paying taxes. This is what prosecutors do. They throw the net<br>wide, and they see who they catch. They then sit that person down and<br>tell them that they're going to jail for a long time for their crime<br>unless they agree to roll over on Trump. Whether or not anyone has<br>done this is anyone's guess, but it is highly unlikely.<br><br>Thus, Trump calls it a witch hunt.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
