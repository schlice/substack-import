<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can you tell if parents are violating your basic rights? Are there<br>violations that could get them time?**<br><br>Violating your "basic rights" (by which you probably mean your "civil<br>rights") is usually not a crime, so no one is going to jail over it.<br><br>Can a parent violate your civil rights? Usually not. Your parents<br>generally have broad latitude in how they are raising you. Unless they<br>are physically harming you, they aren't really restricted in how they<br>raise you. That includes violating what adults call "civil rights."<br><br>Try to work with your parents. Talk to them about what you would like.<br>Without threatening them, do inform them that if they don't talk with<br>you about these rights violations as you see them, it will weigh very<br>heavily on your decision to pack your stuff and move out of their house<br>on your 18th birthday and never speak to them again.<br><br>So if they refuse to play ball, make sure that as soon as you are<br>legally able in your state, get a job and start saving money. This way,<br>when you turn 18, you can walk out the door. Finish high school, and get<br>on with your life.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
