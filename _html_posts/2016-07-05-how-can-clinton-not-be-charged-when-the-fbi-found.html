<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The question the FBI had to answer was whether or not she did something<br>*criminal*. That means something that violates Federal law.<br><br>They were unable to find clear evidence that she did something criminal.<br><br>However, they did go so far as to say that Clinton was "extremely<br>careless" in using a personal email address and server for sensitive<br>information, declaring that an ordinary government official could have<br>faced administrative sanction for such conduct.<br><br>To warrant a criminal charge, there had to be evidence that Mrs. Clinton<br>intentionally sent or received classified information --- something that<br>the FBI did not find. "Our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor<br>would bring such a case," said FBI Director James Comey in a news<br>conference.\[1\](#VcWCV){#cite-VcWCV .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-VcWCV){.citation_index} [[F.B.I.
