<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think the Jedi know there is a prophecy, but they don't know what it<br>means. All they know is that they can't fully utilize all aspects of the<br>Force because they turn every time they try. They must, therefore,<br>divest themselves of the emotional aspect of their nature, because<br>delving into emotions puts them at risk for turning.<br><br>We know from all aspects of philosophy and logic that you can't have<br>just one side. A coin will always have a head and a tail. In order to<br>have light, there must be dark to distinguish it from nothingness. A<br>front isn't a front without a back. The Jedi know intuitively that they<br>are supposed to be able to use their logic *and* their emotion when<br>harnessing the Force, but they just can't figure out how to do it<br>correctly. They don't exactly know how the Chosen One will bring balance<br>to the Force. They just know that he is supposed to. They don't even<br>know how to know who the Chosen One is. They just know that Anakin has a<br>higher Midichlorian count than any other Jedi ever (including Yoda), and<br>was possibly fathered by the Midichlorians themselves, and in that case,<br>must be the Chosen One.<br><br>Anakin and Luke can tap into that emotional side of their nature and<br>harness the power of it while not fully turning. Yoda said that once you<br>head down the path to the Dark Side, forever will it dominate your<br>destiny. That wasn't true with Luke (who was able to start down the path<br>and still resist turning), and it certainly wasn't true with Vader, who<br>was able to be redeemed at the end of his life, essentially by "turning<br>back" from the Dark Side, which by all accounts was supposed to be<br>impossible.<br><br>The Jedi also know that the Sith are an anathema. While the Jedi exist<br>by denying an essential part of their nature but still following the<br>Order, the Sith *unnaturally* use the Force to do things that were<br>entirely unintended, such as attempting to cheat death. The Sith are<br>most definitely not part of the "balance" that the old legend spoke of,<br>as the Sith drive the Force *out* of balance. So there's the light and<br>the dark, and then there's the Sith's interpretation of the dark, which<br>is totally out of whack. So I do believe that balance in the Force means<br>that the continued presence of the Sith puts the Force into imbalance.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
