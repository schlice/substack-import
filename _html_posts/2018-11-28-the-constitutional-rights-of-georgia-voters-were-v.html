<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**The constitutional rights of Georgia voters were violated this month<br>by a system overseen by the man who won the governors' race, a lawsuit<br>backed by Stacey Abrams has claimed. Why?**<br><br>The lawsuit claims that some voter practices in Georgia not only violate<br>the right to vote for the citizens of Georgia, but also that they are<br>discriminatory because they unequally impact African-Americans.<br><br>Her lawsuit claims that it is unconstitutional for a state to purge its<br>voter rolls of those who have registered to vote but have not voted for<br>"several years." This is a matter of Georgia law.<br><br>Her lawsuit also claims that the "signature check" that the state does<br>to compare the voter's signature to the signature on the voter roll is<br>also unconstitutional. The signature check is also a matter of Georgia<br>state law.<br><br>Finally, her lawsuit claims that because Georgia does not have adequate<br>voting machines, voters had to wait in "long lines" which I guess is<br>also unconstitutional.<br><br>Who knows, maybe they will find somewhere in the "emanations and<br>penumbras" of the Constitution that purging voter rolls of those that<br>don't vote is unconstitutional somehow, while I'm not sure what<br>particular Constitutional provision you would be violating by properly<br>and adequately maintaining your voter rolls. Personally, this sounds a<br>bit like sour grapes to me.<br><br>Also, it's interesting that when a Democrat claims that an election was<br>mishandled (such as in Georgia, no matter how unfounded the complaint<br>may be), they are lauded as a "class act" and a patriot, but when a<br>Republican claims that an election was mishandled (such as in<br>neighboring Florida, using documented, court-confirmed irregularities in<br>two counties), then somehow they're "undermining democracy."<br><br>Hrmph.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
