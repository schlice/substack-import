<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because of the MS medication I am on, I am what they call<br>\"immuno-compromised\" so sinus issues are frequent with me. I know a<br>bit about them, so allow me to pass on a few things that will hopefully<br>help you out. Make sure you are otherwise healthy, and make sure that if<br>you take medications, you follow all of the instructions for doing it<br>properly. If you\'re under 12, you may not be able to take the adult<br>versions of medications; always check with your doctor (or your<br>parents, depending on how young you truly are) to get the correct dosing<br>of any over-the-counter medication.<br><br>1.  POUND THE FLUIDS. It will be a challenge, but you must drink more<br>    than you are used to. And no, coffee and soda do not count. Little<br>    to no caffeine, and minimize the sugar and HFCS (high fructose corn<br>    syrup). Water and clear juices like apple are your best bet.<br>    Flavored waters are fine, but flavor and sugar in any form is not<br>    what you\'re looking for. Look for waters with natural flavoring, or<br>    fake sugars like Stevia. I personally prefer [[Propel Fitness<br>    Water](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=be885a&url=http://propelwater.com){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="propelwater.com"}]{.qlink_container} when I need to<br>    pound water. Plus it has extra vitamins and stuff, so bonus.<br>2.  For medication, you\'re looking for \"guaifenesin\" which is a class<br>    of medications called an *expectorant*. You may recall that<br>    \"expectorating\" is a fancy word for \"spitting.\" Well, an<br>    \"expectorant\" is a chemical that helps to break up mucus, thinning<br>    it out so that it can be, well, expectorated. However, the part that<br>    most folks miss when using guaifenesin is that you must follow Step<br>    1 when you do. You have to have lots of fluid along with it. The<br>    medicine adds your fluid intake to your own mucus secretions to thin<br>    them out. Without drinking at least an 8 oz glass of water along<br>    with the pill, it won\'t do you any good whatsoever (although 8 oz<br>    is a bare minimum; you should already be drinking more than that).<br>    Anyway, the brand name in the US for straight-up guaifenesen is<br>    [Mucinex(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cc1a02&url=http://www.mucinex.com){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="mucinex.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br>3.  Limit your dairy intake, as dairy thickens mucus secretions.<br>4.  Increase your Vitamin C intake. I turn to<br>    [Emergen-C(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=20aad4&url=http://www.emergenc.com){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="emergenc.com"}]{.qlink_container} when I need to<br>    increase my Vitamin C, because not only does it up my Vitamin C<br>    (each packet contains 1000 mg of Vitamin C), but it also contains<br>    antioxidants, zinc, manganese, seven different B vitamins, and<br>    electrolytes. Good stuff. The label says no more than two per day.<br>    My doctor told me to take three per day until I was better. **Always<br>    do what your doctor tells you to do.** Aside from that, follow the<br>    label instructions and take the correct dosing of Emergen-C until<br>    you\'re better.<br>5.  Get enough rest. Your body heals while you sleep, and if you\'re not<br>    getting enough sleep, you\'re extending the amount of time it will<br>    take you to get better.<br>6.  Did I mention always do what your doctor tells you to do?<br><br>And finally, if you\'re not getting better running this protocol for at<br>least one week (but no more than two), if you have persistent cough, if<br>you have persistent sore throat, body aches, chills, and especially<br>if you are running a fever, *GO SEE YOUR DOCTOR* because you need<br>real medicine, not over-the-counter stuff.<br><br>Feel better!<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
