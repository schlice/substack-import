<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it legal for an HOA to ban drones if the hobbyist is complying with<br>federal laws?**<br><br>Yes, it is legal for an HOA to ban drones.<br><br>HOAs have broad authority over the areas which they control. They can<br>absolutely pass a Rule change which bans the use of drones **from within<br>the neighborhood. This means that you can't take off or land in the<br>neighborhood.**<br><br>Note the bolded statement above. If you are outside the neighborhood and<br>you *overfly* the neighborhood, this is legal, so long as you comply<br>with all other local regulations (which usually follow FAA regulations)<br>for drone flight. The FAA controls airspace above your house, not the<br>HOA.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
