<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are a few other answers which talk about the intricacies of<br>whether or not masturbation is a sin. In my view, it *can* be, and it's<br>really difficult to do it in a non-sinful way.<br><br>For now, let me address the second part of the question. There is a<br>section in the Bible which refers to man's seed falling to the floor.<br>But saying that this passage means that man is prohibited from allowing<br>his seed to touch the floor is a misinterpretation of that passage.<br><br>The passage is Genesis 38, but understanding what it means requires an<br>understanding of the culture at that time. In that culture, if a husband<br>died without children, the next of kin was sometimes obligated to "go in<br>to" the widow and produce children. The children would be considered to<br>be "descendants" of the late husband, and would be raised as such,<br>taking care of the widow, providing more people to work in the village,<br>and to potentially continue the family lineage.<br><br>Onan failed to keep this tradition. He did "go in to" the widow, but<br>instead of, er, "finishing the job," as it were, he intentionally<br>allowed his seed to spill on the ground. He intentionally dishonored the<br>widow, refusing to carry on his brother's family name, and potentially<br>left a woman without provision in the community.<br><br>It was *this action* with which God was displeased, and he killed Onan<br>because of it.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is masturbating a sin? If so, isn\'t there a verse in the Bible saying<br>for the man not to let his seed touch the floor?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
