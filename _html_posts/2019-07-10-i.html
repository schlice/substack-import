[[Thomas<br>Parsons](https://www.quora.com/profile/Thomas-Parsons-51)]{.qlink_container}<br>pretty much hit the nail on the head.<br><br>- Once you de-plane, you will find a gate agent nearby. You can ask that<br>  gate agent where you need to go and how to get there, and they will<br>  direct you.<br>- Most major airports have, on their websites, maps of the terminal<br>  which you can study beforehand.<br>- Technology can also help you while you are in the airport as well.<br>  Check out GateGuru on<br>  [iOS(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f93734&url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gateguru-airport-info-flight/id326862399?mt%3D8){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="apple.com"}]{.qlink_container} or<br>  [Android(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8ed814&url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Dcom.gateguruapp.android){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container}.
