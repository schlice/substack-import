<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, let me start by saying that Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) has recently<br>been approved by the FDA for treating both relapsing and primary<br>progressive MS. Ocrevus is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets<br>CD20 positive B lymphocytes ( a type of white blood cell), which<br>contribute to nerve damage in MS. This is notable because up to a few<br>moths ago, we didn't have any treatments for primary progressive MS.<br><br>Secondary Progressive MS is the form of the disease which someone who<br>was previously diagnosed with a relapsing form of the disease eventually<br>transitions into. The last statistic I knew said that *untreated*,<br>relapsing MS would transition to SPMS within 10 years for 50% of<br>relapsing patients, and 85% within 20 years. That was before effective<br>treatments to slow the disease progression. We still have relapsing<br>patients who have been on effective medications who have gone well over<br>20 years and have not yet transitioned, so the evidence is mounting that<br>getting on one of the therapy drugs as early as possible can contribute<br>to delaying the onset of SPMS.<br><br>That said, if the SPMS patient still shows signs of disease activity on<br>an MRI, or is still having relapses, the same drugs which were used for<br>relapsing MS will still be somewhat effective for SPMS.<br><br>From the MS Society (emphasis mine):<br><br>> The interferon beta medications (Avonex®, Betaseron®, Extavia®,<br>> Plegridy® and Rebif®), Aubagio® (teriflunomide), Gilenya®<br>> (fingolimod), Lemtrada™ (alemtuzumab),Tecfidera® (dimethyl fumarate),<br>> and Tysabri® (natalizumab) are all approved by the FDA for use in<br>> relapsing forms of MS, **which include those individuals who have<br>> transitioned to secondary-progressive MS but continue to have relapses<br>> and/or evidence of disease activity on MRI**. Therefore, a person who<br>> has been on one of these medications during the initial<br>> relapsing-remitting phase of the disease will likely continue on it<br>> unless his or her physician feels that it is no longer doing an<br>> adequate job of controlling disease activity. At that time, the<br>> physician will likely recommend changing to another one of these<br>> medications or to Novantrone® (mitoxantrone), a chemotherapeutic agent<br>> that has been approved by the FDA specifically for SPMS, as well as<br>> worsening relapsing MS.\[1\](#tbvot){#cite-tbvot .citation_link}<br><br>As you can see, not only are the relapsing drugs helpful for some SPMS<br>patients, Novantrone has been approved by the FDA specifically for SPMS.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-tbvot){.citation_index} [[Treating secondary progressive<br>MS<br>(SPMS)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=01a59b&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/Types-of-MS/Secondary-progressive-MS/Treating-Secondary-Progressive-MS){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
