<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, you can have an MRI without contrast.<br><br>The contrast dye, along with a specific type of MRI scan, will show<br>*current disease activity*. So in order to show whether or not the<br>disease is *active right now*, we use an MRI scan with contrast.<br><br>Without contrast, we will still be able to see the effects of the<br>disease, and performing multiple MRI scans over a period of time will<br>show disease progression when the scans are compared side-by-side.<br><br>If you cannot use contrast, a scan without contrast will still be very<br>useful, and will add to the body of evidence in diagnosing MS.<br><br>There are other tests which can be added to enhance the body of evidence<br>showing MS. Besides blood tests which can show other diseases and<br>conditions which produce white spots on an MRI (which we call the<br>"little white spot panel"), we can do things like lumbar punctures<br>(spinal taps) and visual evoked potential tests to add to the evidence<br>indicating MS. The physical neurological exam is not to be discounted<br>either, as a trained neurologist can detect the signs of the disease<br>during a physical neuro exam.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional medical advice.
