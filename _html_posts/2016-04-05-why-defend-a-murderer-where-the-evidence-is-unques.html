<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Thanks [[Chuck<br>Lee](https://www.quora.com/profile/Chuck-Lee-43)]{.qlink_container} for<br>your answer, you\'re absolutely correct.<br><br>I would ask this: whose job is it to \"question\" the evidence?<br><br>The defense.<br><br>Let me put it this way. Evidence is never \"unquestioned.\" Evidence is<br>always reviewed. The defense is there to do exactly what I\'m<br>suggesting: question everything. It is the job of the defense team<br>to question every piece of evidence. Was it obtained legally? Was it<br>obtained with properly executed warrants? Were the officers and the<br>prosecutors objective in their analysis of the evidence? Were there<br>extenuating circumstances? Was there anything the prosecutors<br>overlooked?<br><br>A \"murderer\" is only truly a \"murderer\" after he is convicted. Until<br>then, he is an \"accused murderer.\" As much as people like to talk<br>about OJ as a murderer, he\'s not. He was accused of murder, and found<br>not guilty, regardless how questionable the circus of a trial was.<br><br>It is the job of the jury to determine whether or not the evidence shows<br>that the murderer is, in fact, guilty \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" It<br>is the job of the defense team to bring to light that reasonable doubt.\<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
