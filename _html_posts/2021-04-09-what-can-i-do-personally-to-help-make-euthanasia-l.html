<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What can I do personally to help make euthanasia legal in the<br>future?**<br><br>Same thing that anyone who believes in a cause can do to work towards<br>that goal: organize and work together.<br><br>For you, look for affinity groups which share your beliefs. With 7.6<br>billion people on the planet, you can't be the only one who believes<br>euthanasia is good and should be legalized. Search for groups which<br>share your beliefs. Join them. Work with them. Help to advance their<br>cause. Donate your time and your resources (money, talents, etc) to do<br>just that.<br><br>Don't resort to illegal tactics to advance your agenda. Don't think that<br>killing a Senator who consistently votes against legalizing euthanasia<br>will help your cause at all. If you believe that is a good thing, you've<br>lost the narrative, and you may be mentally ill.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
