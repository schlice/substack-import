<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Long-term parking lots are not for employees. So it's perfectly natural<br>and normal for non-employees to park at airport long-term parking lots.<br>There are no flight checks before entering a long-term parking lot. You<br>are simply charged for your stay when you exit.<br><br>Most airport long-term lots limit the amount of time you can park there<br>to around 30 days without advanced notice. But in most long-term lots<br>which are rarely full, this wouldn't even be a problem unless the<br>vehicle was parked there for an extended period (6--12 months).<br>Ultimately, you pay the fee when you pick up your car, so as long as<br>there continue to be available parking slots, and you park in the<br>farthest area away from the airport (so you're less likely to impede a<br>space needed by the airport for other customers), you could probably<br>stay in long term parking for quite some time.<br><br>\<br><br>As for employees, there is usually a section of parking on the ground<br>floor of the garage (or just adjacent to the garage) which has its own<br>gate. Your employee badge gives you access to the garage parking<br>(through one gate with a badge reader), and then you have to badge in to<br>the employee parking area. They only check to see that when you badged<br>in to the paid parking area that you then badged in to the employee<br>area.<br><br>At least at the airport where I worked, they didn't care how long you<br>were in employee parking, or if you parked in employee parking when you<br>went on personal travel. They only cared that you weren't taking up<br>revenue spaces (i.e. once you badged in to ground level parking, you<br>then continued and badged in to the employee lot). And we had more than<br>enough room in the employee lot. There were dumpsters and parking<br>shuttles parked in our employee lot, so space wasn't really an issue.<br>The employee lot was the farthest lot away from the terminal in that<br>lot, so it's not like the employees got any great advantage in that<br>realm. It was still a decent hike from employee parking to the terminal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
