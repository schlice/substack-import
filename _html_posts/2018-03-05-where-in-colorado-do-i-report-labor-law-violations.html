<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Where in Colorado do I report labor law violations such as not giving<br>mandatory breaks and having safety violations in the workplace?**<br><br>This one's easy. The bit about "mandatory breaks" is covered by the<br>Colorado Department of Labor and Employment. They have [[an online<br>form](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1438e0&url=https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdle/complaint-forms){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="colorado.gov"}]{.qlink_container} to fill out to begin an<br>investigation.<br><br>> The Division of Labor Standards and Statistics may assist employees<br>> performing work in Colorado with the recovery of earned compensation,<br>> and labor law violations. If you wish to file a Wage and Hour Law<br>> Complaint with the Division, you must fully complete and submit to the<br>> Division a Wage and Hour Labor Law Complaint Form. The form includes<br>> instructions on the complaint process and the authority of the<br>> Division of Labor Standards and Statistics.<br><br>As for safety violations, this could be more serious. If it's an<br>occupational safety and health violation that could put the public at<br>risk, I suggest you contact by phone the [[Colorado Department of Public<br>Health and<br>Environment](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=93a241&url=https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/categories/concerns-and-emergencies){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="colorado.gov"}]{.qlink_container}. That website has contacts<br>for all sorts of public health-related issues and how to report them.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
