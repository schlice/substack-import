Most system tones are one to two short<br>chirps and take place on an interval of minutes, not days. Those system<br>chirps mean different things depending on the type of smoke detector you<br>have (for example, is it hardwired or battery only, does it include<br>carbon monoxide detection, etc).<br><br>Hearing alarm tones (not system chirps) every day or two sounds like an<br>issue with the detector itself.<br><br>If it were me, I'd advise you to replace the detector.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
