<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Refundable tickets cover the airline for their cost of<br>holding a seat for you and then you not showing up. It costs them much<br>more when you book a ticket and then fail to show up than it does for<br>them to book the right amount of seats. It screws everything up, but<br>most importantly it screws up their planning, since all of their<br>planning algorithms are based on ticket sales.\<br>\<br>FYI, it\'s cheaper for you to buy a non-refundable ticket and pay the<br>change fee plus the difference than to buy a refundable<br>ticket.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
