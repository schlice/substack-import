<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a minor has a sum of money and buys a bike without her mother\'s<br>consent and the mother cancels the contract between the minor and the<br>bike shop, what are the available remedies at her disposal?**<br><br>If it were actually a "contract," the contract would be invalid as a<br>minor does not have the authority to enter into a contract. There is no<br>legal liability if the bike shop hasn't fulfilled the contract yet, as<br>the contract is invalid from the beginning.<br><br>However, in most cases, such a transaction would be a "purchase," not a<br>"contract." In such a case, the "purchase contract" is complete at the<br>time of purchase. If a minor has a sum of money and buys a bike, the<br>contract is complete at the point of sale. If the mother doesn't want<br>the minor to own the bike, she can simply return it to the seller. If<br>the seller argues against the refund (i.e. all sales are final), the<br>mother can argue that the purchaser was a minor and did not have<br>authorization to buy a bike. Of course, the seller could argue that<br>money from a minor spends in exactly the same way that money from an<br>adult spends, but that's a bad look during a lawsuit.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
