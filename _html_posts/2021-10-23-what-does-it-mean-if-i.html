<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What does it mean? It means you think that, at 15 years old, that your<br>life is just so bad that it's not worth saving.<br><br>Except for *you haven't even started living your life yet*. You need to<br>be out of school first before you would even be qualified to make a<br>judgement like that, and even then, suicide is never the answer.<br><br>Society and your parents absolutely deny you freedom and rights. Because<br>you're still a minor. You still have to do what your parents tell you,<br>because they are legally responsible for you. And society denies you<br>specific rights because you are still under 18.<br><br>Now, if they are doing something specifically to harm you, then there<br>may be recourse for you. But planning to kill yourself because your<br>parents are "denying you rights and freedom" doesn't make too much<br>sense.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What does it mean if I\'m planning to commit suicide to escape my<br>parents and society denying me freedom and rights? I\'m 15.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
