<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It depends on the jurisdiction. In most states, the smell<br>of marijuana can provide probable cause to search the vehicle. In some,<br>the police need consent (or a warrant) to search your vehicle. If you<br>are in a state that allows the smell of weed to be probable cause, he<br>doesn\'t need your permission to search the car. The \"smell of weed\"<br>is probable cause, and makes the search valid and admissible in court.\<br>\<br>In consent states, they can either get your consent, get a warrant to<br>search your car (which means they have a valid suspicion that you have<br>drugs in your car), or bring in a drug dog. If the dog alerts (even on<br>the outside of the vehicle), this would also be considered probable<br>cause to search the vehicle, and no consent is required.\<br>\<br>In your case, your mom consented to the search. The only way this would<br>be admissible is if you\'re under 18. She is the legal guardian of the<br>vehicle operator. Ownership, presence on title, insurance listing her as<br>the primary driver, etc. are not factors. She is your legal guardian,<br>you were operating the vehicle, and if you are under 18, she can make<br>legal decisions for you, and these would be admissible in court as<br>well.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
