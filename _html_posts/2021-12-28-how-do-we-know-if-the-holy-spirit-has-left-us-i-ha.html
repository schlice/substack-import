As the Spirit is God, and God has<br>  stated plainly that he will never leave us or forsake us, we can<br>  presume that the Spirit will never leave us.<br>- That said, it is possible to get ourselves into a state of mind where<br>  we convince ourselves that we have done something "beyond redemption."<br>  You said that you "messed up way beyond repentance," and this just<br>  isn't a thing. **There is nothing you can do that can separate you<br>  from the love of God**.<br>  - The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in<br>    love. He will not always accuse, nor will he harbor his anger<br>    forever; he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us<br>    according to our iniquities. For as high as the heavens are above<br>    the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him; as far as<br>    the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions<br>    from us. --- Psalm 103:8--12 NIV<br><br>Once you realize that nothing can separate you from the love of God, you<br>can begin to repent of your sin. I'm certain that whatever you did was<br>not directly in conscious countervention of God's commands. i'm sure you<br>didn't think to yourself, "I know what the right thing is, but I'm going<br>to do the wrong thing anyway." You made a mistake. Mistakes are a<br>patently human thing to make. God understands this. He understands we<br>make mistakes.<br><br>Now, it's time to do what he commands: "Go, and sin no more." It's time<br>to "go," or move on with your life, don't get hung up on this, "and sin<br>no more," or repent for what you have done. Turn away from your sin<br>and your sinful desire. Make a conscious effort to avoid that in the<br>future.<br><br>Then know that you will feel the presence of the Spirit again. Remember,<br>God never left you. He was there with you the whole time. You just got<br>yourself into such a state that you couldn't hear his voice or feel his<br>presence.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How do we know if the holy spirit has left us? I have a feeling I messed<br>up way beyond repentance. because I haven't felt the spirit in me in 6<br>months no matter what I do or pray.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
