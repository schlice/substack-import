This is considered a mental defect, an abnormal<br>functioning of the brain. It is a *medical condition*.<br><br>We do not treat medical conditions with euthanasia.<br><br>We treat medical conditions humanely, with counseling, therapy, and in<br>some cases, medication, where it helps.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
