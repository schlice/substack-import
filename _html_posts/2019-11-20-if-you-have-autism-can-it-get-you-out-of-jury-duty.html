<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can autism disqualify someone from jury duty or not?<br><br>Not automatically, but autism, as a disability, can be the basis for<br>disqualification.<br><br>Since every person on the spectrum is different, each case must be<br>addressed individually. If someone is so affected by autism that they<br>cannot speak and who needs caregivers to assist them with daily life<br>activities, they would most likely be excused from jury duty. But there<br>are plenty of people who have mild autism, like Asperger's, who are<br>perfectly capable of serving on a jury.<br><br>Check with the clerk's office where you have been summoned to jury duty<br>to inquire about being excused from duty due to disability. All of the<br>courts have different procedures for this.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
