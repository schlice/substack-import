<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do you get out of an abusive marriage without getting deported if<br>you are illegal?**<br><br>The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends."<br><br>The only way you could be in the United States and be "illegal" is if<br>both you and your spouse are illegal aliens. In that case, you run the<br>risk of being deported at any time, whether you're married or not. If,<br>however, you were married to a US citizen and you're concerned that<br>leaving your marriage would ruin your chances of becoming a citizen<br>through naturalization, that is far more complicated. As long as you had<br>a bona-fide marriage, leaving the marriage because of domestic abuse<br>would not be considered evidence that your marriage was fake. So it is<br>possible, even after leaving your US citizen spouse, to be granted a<br>green card or to complete the process for citizenship. You'd have to<br>work with an immigration attorney at that point.<br><br>However, all of that aside, ending the abuse should be primary. Your<br>life may depend on it. If you're in an abusive marriage, *regardless of<br>your citizenship status*, I highly suggest you get out of it.<br><br>So how can you get out of your abusive relationship *and* not involve<br>law enforcement? There are alternatives. There are local support groups<br>and groups which assist victims of domestic violence which are NGOs<br>(non-governmental organizations). These vary depending on where you are<br>located, so you should first look for an organization near you which<br>helps victims of domestic violence. They can assist with temporary<br>housing, food and clothing, job placement assistance, and if needed,<br>permanent relocation assistance. They can also help connect you with<br>divorce attorneys who can help you get out of your marriage and ensure<br>that the appropriate documentation exists to ensure that your<br>immigration status is not affected.<br><br>Whatever you do, please don't stay in an abusive relationship to keep<br>your immigration status. You can get out, and you can keep your status.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
