<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If mobile phones and electronics shouldn\'t be on during flights, why<br>do airplanes get equipped with wifi on board?**<br><br>The problem is not with electronic devices being "on" during flight. The<br>problem has to do with cellular radios being on during flight, and<br>the reason has nothing to do with technical incompatibilities between<br>cellular radios and aircraft avionics and automatic flight controls.<br><br>When cellular telephones first came out, airlines required them to be<br>off for the duration of the flight, because they were "transmitting or<br>receiving devices" and they could potentially interfere with avionics.<br>There were some anecdotal stories of someone receiving a cell phone call<br>in-flight and an aircraft avionics cluster experiencing some strange<br>readings, but there has never been any large-scale testing, as doing so<br>would require massive amounts of clearance to violate FCC rules, inside<br>of a flying airplane. No aircraft manufacturer has yet desired to jump<br>through the regulatory hoops to even test, and the airlines simply found<br>it easier to disallow their use during flight (incidentally, Mythbusters<br>tried to test this with an airplane on the ground, but even that testing<br>was problematic. Ultimately, they didn't find much interference. Maybe<br>with some older planes, but indeed, most planes are shielded pretty well<br>against electromagnetic interference). Additionally, what would you<br>test? Phone hardware changes so frequently, and testing is so slow and<br>methodical, that by the time your findings were released, the industry<br>would have moved on to the next phone. Finally, when you use your cell<br>phone in-flight, you don't stick to just one cell, you bounce from cell<br>to cell mid-flight. If you allowed thousands of people in flight to use<br>cell phones, you'd disrupt the cell towers on the ground, not the<br>airplane. This is why it is the FCC, not the FAA, that makes the rules<br>regarding cell phone use in flight, and prohibits their use.<br><br>When phones moved into the "smartphone" category, people wanted to use<br>them to listen to music, or play games, or read books, just like any<br>other portable electronic device. Smartphones have an "Airplane Mode"<br>specifically designed to disable all of the radios so that the phone can<br>be used in an offline mode. Phones were then allowed to be activated<br>after takeoff, so long as they were in the "Airplane Mode" or other<br>suitably non-transmitting mode.<br><br>Finally, with Wi-Fi becoming nearly as ubiquitous as cellular towers,<br>and airlines wanting to provide more value to (read: make more money<br>from) their customers, they began partnering with in-flight Wi-Fi<br>solutions which utilize special in-cabin Wi-Fi antennas. Wi-Fi is a<br>totally different frequency and uses much lower power transmitters than<br>cellular radios. Wi-Fi can be used safely, and more importantly to the<br>airline, a captive Wi-Fi portal can be established inside the aircraft,<br>and the airline can provide a pay portal to access Internet content.<br><br>Next up in the airline's move to modernize: opening ports for Wi-Fi<br>calling (and charging for the privilege). We will see how well that goes<br>over. It will only be different from the Airphone days in that the price<br>won't be nearly as expensive as it used to be. Probably something like<br>\$5 to \$10 to allow Wi-Fi calling for the entire flight, similar to the<br>price of allowing Internet access for passengers.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
