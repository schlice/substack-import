<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is hypocrisy. Let me give you an example of similar<br>hypocrisy that explains the difference.<br><br>In 2011, 8583 people died from handgun-related violence. That\'s a big<br>number, certainly nothing to dismiss. But in the same year, the number<br>of people who died from \"alcohol-related death, not attributed to<br>accident or homicide\" was over 25,000.<br><br>To put this in perspective, over three times the number of people<br>were killed by alcohol-related illness (not accidents or homicides) than<br>were killed by guns. Add in the number killed in alcohol-related car<br>accidents (14,000), and the likelihood that at least half of those<br>deaths from handgun-related violence were probably fueled by alcohol,<br>and you find that it\'s likely that over 40,000 deaths were in some way<br>related to the consumption of alcohol. Why are we spending our time<br>worrying about guns (which, by the way, are protected by the<br>Constitution) when alcohol destroys far more lives than guns ever could?<br><br>How many kids go to sleep at night not terrified that they will<br>accidentally be shot, but terrified that a parent on a drunken bender<br>will decide to take out his or her frustrations on that child\'s face?<br>How many kids live in abject fear of what adults who use alcohol will do<br>next? The number of kids killed by violent or haphazard parents \--<br>their actions magnified by alcohol abuse \-- is orders of magnitude<br>greater than the number of kids killed in freak school shootings, and<br>their agony lasts far longer.<br><br>Alcohol provides no benefits at all. None. Guns at least protect me from<br>others with guns. But what good does a bottle of whiskey do in<br>protecting me from a drunk driver? There are no medical benefits to<br>alcohol. Studies in the late 70s which showed a link between red wine<br>and heart benefits were never proved, and were likely due to other<br>lifestyle advantages rather than a consumption of wine. Alcohol is an<br>*intoxicating* substance, that is, introducing toxins into your body.<br>Any perceived benefits can\'t be voiced with a straight face: it makes<br>ugly people pretty, annoying people tolerable, and at best, helps you<br>have a really good time that you\'ll barely remember. At worst, it will<br>provide you with \"liquid courage,\" removing your inhibitions (which<br>keep you safe), allowing you to do something foolhardy which will get<br>you hurt or killed.<br><br>Considering the fact that alcohol kills far more people than guns, and<br>provides no real benefits at all, why do we waste our time arguing to<br>ban guns, when logically we should first be banning alcohol? Because we<br>tried it before? Yes, Prohibition was an abject failure, and the people<br>attempting to ban guns fail to realize that a ban on guns would do<br>exactly the same thing: spur crime of all kinds (not just organized<br>crime) and enhance and reinforce the black market trade in guns. There<br>are over 300 million guns in this country; you can\'t hope to remove<br>them all simply by changing a law. Prime example: the \"War on Drugs.\"<br>We made it illegal. Did we actually stop people from getting it? Nope,<br>we just emboldened criminals and created a massive black market which<br>essentially funds the entire GDP of Mexico.<br><br>More importantly, if you have one of two things to ban, wouldn\'t you<br>ban the one that has absolutely no benefit whatsoever, contributes<br>nothing to society, and causes nothing but misery and pain? Wouldn\'t<br>you ban the one that is demonstrably more harmful? Especially when the<br>less-harmful one is protected by the Constitution?<br><br>I don\'t personally advocate for a ban on alcohol. I just point out the<br>hypocrisy of those who use statistics like the President did in his SOTU<br>address last night as a call to ban guns, when there are things that are<br>far more harmful and far less useful that no one is even thinking about<br>banning. The utter hypocrisy is palpable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
