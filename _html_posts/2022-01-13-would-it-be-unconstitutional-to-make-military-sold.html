<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not unconstitutional, just not what the military is doing. Some expenses<br>may have to be repaid by some members, but not everyone.<br><br>The military is using "administrative separations" to remove members for<br>vaccine refusal. For those who don't qualify for exemptions and who<br>flat-out refuse the vaccine, they are being administratively separated,<br>and the character of their separation is "General (Under Honorable<br>Conditions)". This means that the member will not be allowed to<br>re-enlist or join another military branch, but they will still likely<br>retain access to all of their VA benefits, just as if they were<br>discharged with an Honorable characterization.<br><br>As far as pay goes, no service member separated based on vaccine refusal<br>will be eligible for involuntary separation pay.<br><br>Also, officers separated for vaccine refusal but who have not yet<br>completed their service obligation for attending a service academy or<br>being awarded a Reserve Officer Training Scholarship will be required to<br>repay their educational expenses. This policy includes service members<br>who have received advanced education funds.<br><br>So in some ways, depending on who you are and what the military has<br>already paid for, you may have to repay some of your expenses.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Would it be unconstitutional to make military soldiers who refuse the<br>vaccine to repay the cost of their training?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
