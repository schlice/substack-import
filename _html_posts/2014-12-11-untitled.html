<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [If you are capable of fairness, then why must the evidence<br>become public?\<br>\<br>It sounds like you\'d prefer that a grand jury not hear the case, but<br>that the case be tried in the court of public opinion.\<br>\<br>If you were truly only concerned about fairness, you\'d be looking at<br>the composition of the grand jury, who the jurors were, and whether or<br>not they were capable of fairness. That should be sufficient for you.\<br>\<br>But it seems like you wanted this to go to trial simply so the evidence<br>would be made public. Most of it has already.\<br>\<br>But the family has to get their \"pound of flesh,\" so you\'ll probably<br>see your evidence in the wrongful death lawsuit that should follow<br>soon.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-do-police-officers-think-of-the-current-uproar-towards-the-lack-of-indictments-of-officers-who-have-used-lethal-force-against-unarmed-men/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
