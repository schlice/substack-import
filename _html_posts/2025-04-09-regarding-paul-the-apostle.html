<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Christians today are not hopeful that he's right about homosexuals or<br>ignorant about their own sin, because Christians today know that<br>everyone is a sinner, and all sins are forgivable. If you read on just a<br>little bit into 1 Cor 6:11, you find that those identifying labels are<br>removed when a person comes to faith in Christ and is declared righteous<br>by God.<br><br>> *And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified,<br>> you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the<br>> Spirit of our God. \-- 1 Corinthians 6:11 ESV*<br><br>Paul is saying here that a person forgiven in Christ defines those sins<br>as \"past tense.\" They do not define who they are, or who they will be.<br>Some of them *used to be* known by these labels because of their sin.<br>But that is not who they are any longer. Now, they are in Christ. So<br>even the people identified in verse 9 can be forgiven. **None of these<br>sins *disqualify* you from salvation *permanently*.**<br><br>There was only one unforgivable sin, and it could only be committed in<br>the presence of Jesus while He was performing miracles. Since Jesus is<br>not physically in our presence today, we can't commit that unforgivable<br>sin. This means that any sin we can commit can be forgiven in Christ.<br><br>For those who are in Christ, all sin is covered. All sin debt is paid by<br>Christ's sacrifice.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
