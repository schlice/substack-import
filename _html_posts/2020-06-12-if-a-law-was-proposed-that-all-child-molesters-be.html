<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a law was proposed that all child molesters be shot when convicted<br>of their first offense, who would likely oppose such a law and why?**<br><br>People who are wrongly convicted of molesting a child.<br><br>It does happen. And apparently, most of the false allegations are not<br>made by the child. They are made by adults who care for children, and<br>the large majority of those are part of court battles over child custody<br>during divorce proceedings.<br><br>> Findings of multiple studies performed between 1987 and 1995 suggested<br>> that the rate of false allegations ranged from a low of 6% to a high<br>> of 35% of reported child sexual abuse<br>> cases.\[1\](#WGXsJ){#cite-WGXsJ .citation_link}<br><br>Some legal systems lend themselves handily to people abusing the system.<br>In the UK for example, large payouts to alleged victims without proof of<br>the allegations required means that more people will be encouraged to<br>abuse the system.<br><br>A system which is known to be abused should not be given a mandatory<br>death sentence after the first conviction.<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being<br>isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I<br>wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is<br>un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m<br>wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,<br>not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,<br>you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.<br>Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be<br>followed by a block and a mute. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-WGXsJ){.citation_index} [[False allegation of child sexual<br>abuse -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a68d1f&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_allegation_of_child_sexual_abuse){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
