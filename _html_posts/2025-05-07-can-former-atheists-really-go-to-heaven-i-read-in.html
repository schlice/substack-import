<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The "unforgivable sin" was *blaspheming against the Holy Spirit.*<br><br>The only time it was committed was when Jesus performed miracles in<br>front of Jewish leaders, they saw the miracles, they *knew the miracles<br>came from God*, but they intentionally claimed that Jesus' power to<br>perform miracles came from Satan.<br><br>This is the unforgivable sin.<br><br>Since no one today can watch Jesus performing miracles and then speak<br>out against those miracles, instead attributing them to Satan, no one<br>alive today can commit the unforgivable sin.<br><br>\<br><br>In other words, ***anyone who repents and believes can be saved. Anyone.<br>No sin is too great to be forgiven.***<br><br>Period. Full stop.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
