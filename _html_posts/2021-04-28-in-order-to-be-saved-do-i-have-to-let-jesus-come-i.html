<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In order to be saved, do I have to let Jesus come inside of me?<br><br>It's figurative. It's not literal. A ghost spectre will not inhabit your<br>body like a Twilight Zone possession.<br><br>Often, you're told that you need to "ask Jesus to come in to your<br>heart." You should know that this statement is nowhere in the Bible.<br>Often, when people say that, they mean "ask Jesus to come into your<br>life" or "ask Jesus to take control of your life." But even those<br>statements should not be made in a vacuum. Before you think about any of<br>those things, you should understand sin and its penalty, what Jesus did<br>to pay for your sin, and what you need to do in order to benefit from<br>that gift that he gave you. If asking Jesus to come into your heart<br>helps you to understand that, all the better.<br><br>Remember, salvation is not about believing a list of facts. Salvation is<br>not about allowing Jesus to enter your heart. Salvation is about<br>trusting Jesus as your savior, believing what he did for you, and<br>accepting his forgiveness that he offers by grace. Salvation is about<br>being "made new" through his sacrifice and the power of the Holy Spirit.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
