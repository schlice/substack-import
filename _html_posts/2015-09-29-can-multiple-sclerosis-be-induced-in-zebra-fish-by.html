<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [As I understand it, there is currently no disease model<br>for multiple sclerosis in zebrafish. They do use zebrafish to study the<br>normal myelination process, as well as to test remyelination therapies.<br>While they use zebrafish to study remyelination, they cannot use the<br>same fish to study demyelination. The zebrafish has a very strong and<br>adaptive immune system.\<br>\<br>Zebrafish are cheaper to work with than mice, but mice can have an<br>MS-like disease induced in them, called [[experimental autoimmune<br>encephalomyelitis<br>(EAE)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=518c15&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_autoimmune_encephalomyelitis){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. This allows scientists<br>to study demyelination processes and treatments to slow this<br>process.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
