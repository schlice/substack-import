<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should there be laws regulating homeowners associations? If so, what<br>laws should there be? What should a homeowners association be allowed to<br>do and not to be allowed to do with regards to the rules they set?**<br><br>You asked a question regarding whether or not there should be laws<br>regulating HOAs and then you quoted a Reddit article which has a list of<br>complaints about HOAs in general (and probably his own HOA in specific).<br><br>So, should there be laws regulating HOAs? Yes, and there already are.<br>HOAs are 501(c)4 nonprofit corporations, and as such are governed by<br>corporate law. As you may know, there are many laws dictating how<br>corporations run, so I don't think a lack of laws is the case. But then<br>you quote the Reddit article which specifically complains about the<br>rules that HOAs put in place, so the question isn't whether or not there<br>should be laws, the real question is **should HOAs be able to control<br>nearly everything in the areas which they control?**<br><br>The answer to that question is yes, and the reason goes back to the very<br>reason HOAs exist in the first place.<br><br>*The purpose of an HOA is to keep home values as high as possible.*<br><br>Everything that an HOA does should be reflective of that ultimate goal.<br>How they do that is by making sure that there are some standards to<br>which homeowners must adhere in how they maintain the outside of their<br>house. This can be as detailed or as lax as the HOA decides, but<br>ultimately whatever they choose must further that goal of keeping home<br>values as high as possible.<br><br>So let's review the Reddit post and see what he doesn't like about HOAs:<br><br>> - HOAs shall not restrict native plants you use in your yard nor<br>>   require lawns<br>> - HOAs shall not restrict laundry or clothes drying on your premises<br><br>These first two points go towards exactly what we were discussing:<br>maintaining a certain aesthetic of the neighborhood, a look and feel, in<br>order to keep some uniformity in the look of the neighborhood, which<br>increases home values. Managing what you plant or what you erect in your<br>yards directly reflects that goal of maintaining a specific look of the<br>neighborhood. This squarely falls under HOA purview.<br><br>> - HOAs shall not lean/foreclose against your home for fines less than<br>>   \$1,000<br><br>Doing so is just stupid, since filing a foreclosure costs well more than<br>\$1000 in fees. But to be fair, it's more than just the outstanding HOA<br>dues. There's interest, as well as attorney's fees, which can cause that<br>\$1000 in unpaid dues to double or even triple. So usually the<br>Association's attorney would advise to not foreclose on a lien until<br>that amount gets much higher. But placing a lien on the home can be done<br>at any time at much lower cost than actually foreclosing on that lien.<br>The lien protects the interest of the HOA in ensuring that if any value<br>is derived from the property (through refinance or sale), the HOA is<br>paid what they are due.<br><br>> - HOA Board Members shall not serve more than 10 year terms in total<br>>   per HOA<br>> - HOA Elections/ballots shall be private and in writing and done at<br>>   least annually<br><br>This is something which can be added to the Bylaws of the HOA. It<br>requires a vote and signatures of all of the homeowners (usually, some<br>cities and some HOAs require less than 100%), but all procedures for how<br>the HOA operates are in the Bylaws, and were provided to you when you<br>bought your house. You agreed to them when you signed all those forms.<br><br>> - HOA fees shall not exceed \$100/month in administrative fees, fees<br>>   must be capped at 2% raises per year<br><br>This one is just silly. Capping the amount of dues just means more<br>special collections and emergency collections when things pop up, which<br>just increases overall administrative cost. You elect a Board to manage<br>this stuff; if they can't do it, elect someone else who can. HOAs don't<br>increase dues unless costs increase and they can't control those costs<br>in other ways. Perhaps your Board should do a better job at controlling<br>costs rather than just increasing dues. You should be doing a better job<br>of looking at the financials and forcing the Board to explain why things<br>cost so much.<br><br>> - All HOA board members are subject to impeachment if at least 2/3rds<br>>   of HOA members vote them out<br>> - HOA Members have a right to hold elections if 25% of HOA members<br>>   petition an election<br><br>Again, why did you elect someone if you're not going to allow them to<br>complete their term? But by all means, if all of the homeowners agree,<br>add this to your Bylaws. But don't be surprised when a majority of<br>homeowners change something because the political will to do so has<br>shifted. Your HOA will be changing based on the makeup of current<br>residents and will not be able to effectively do its core job because<br>the rules change so frequently. Also, I've found that HOAs with<br>stipulations like these tend to have Boards which are nothing more than<br>a popularity contest rather than a functioning Board. Perhaps you should<br>simply shorten the term of a Board member (i.e. instead of 3 years, make<br>them get re-elected every year).<br><br>And as far as holding elections goes, much of that is determined by the<br>HOA Bylaws which govern how the corporation is run. This includes<br>elections which must be held at specific times. Allowing out-of-cycle<br>elections is something which may not be legally permissible. The HOA<br>attorney would have to help sort that out.<br><br>> - HOA Members have a right to up to a 3 month grace period for dues<br>>   due to hardship<br><br>This can also easily be added to the Policies and Procedures. But here's<br>the problem: who gets to define "hardship?" What's a "hardship?" What<br>happens when the Board grants a hardship reprieve to one person and not<br>to another? I know what happens: lawsuits. Boards are not going to want<br>to do this because it opens the Association up to the possibility of<br>lawsuits. And who pays for the HOA's attorney in defending against those<br>suits? All of the homeowners.<br><br>> - Prospecting HOA members and current HOA members have a right to HOA<br>>   rules upon request for a reasonable fee (Capped at 10 cents per<br>>   page), 2% annual raise max for pages.<br><br>First of all, if your HOA doesn't post all of your Governing Documents<br>somewhere online, you need a new HOA. Everyone should have free access<br>to all of the documents, and if they don't, it's time to get some new<br>Board members in there.<br><br>Fees charged by the HOA Management Agency are contracted. The contracts<br>are renewed annually. If you don't agree with the fees charged by the<br>management agency, fire them and get a new one. Or negotiate with the<br>current one. Again, this is the job of the Board.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
