<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**When Donald Trump accuses Nancy Pelosi of treason, does he have<br>proof?**<br><br>This is what is called "political speech." And it is especially<br>protected by the 1st Amendment.<br><br>In other words, politicians say all sorts of things, but they have no<br>teeth.<br><br>If you have credible evidence that someone has actually committed<br>treason, you go to the authorities (or in Trump's case, you engage the<br>authorities who work for you), you don't go on television and accuse<br>someone of treason.<br><br>As you may or may not know, treason is a very specific crime. The<br>elements of treason are the same under state and federal law:<br><br>- the defendant owes allegiance to the government, and<br>- the defendant intentionally betrays that allegiance by either levying<br>  war against the government, or giving aid or comfort to the<br>  government's enemies.<br><br>So there are two elements that can constitute treason: levying war, or<br>giving aid and comfort to the government's enemies.<br><br>> Levying War<br>><br>> Levying war isn't limited to formally declaring war. It includes any<br>> forcible opposition to the execution of a public law. Such "forcible<br>> opposition" ordinarily requires actual use of force by multiple people<br>> with the common purpose of preventing some law from being enforced.<br>> Weapons aren't always required; sheer numbers can be enough.<br>><br>> Merely conspiring to overthrow the government isn't levying<br>> war---there must be an actual assemblage of people who are ready and<br>> intend to use force. (But see "Related Crimes," below.) So, no person<br>> acting alone can be guilty of levying war.<br>><br>> Providing Aid or Comfort<br>><br>> Providing aid or comfort to the enemy covers a variety of actions,<br>> from providing financial assistance to harboring an enemy soldier. Any<br>> intentional act that furthers the enemy's hostile designs or weakens<br>> the United States gives aid and comfort to, and "adheres to," the<br>> enemy.<br>><br>> Sympathy alone. Sympathy for the enemy by itself doesn't<br>> constitute aiding or comforting. Rather, the actor must take some kind<br>> of action to provide aid or comfort.<br>><br>> Time of war. Treason by aiding the enemy can't be committed during<br>> peacetime; there must be an actual enemy for the traitor to aid. The<br>> requisite enemy designation typically requires a formal declaration of<br>> war.<br>><br>> Attempt. Someone can be convicted of treason even if the attempt<br>> to aid isn't successful or the enemy's goal isn't<br>> achieved.\[1\](#ohFlM){#cite-ohFlM .citation_link}<br><br>Now, it's unlikely that Pelosi is "providing aid or comfort to the<br>enemy," because *we don't currently have an enemy*. The definition<br>of "enemy" can only be fulfilled during actual, formal declared war.<br><br>So is Pelosi "levying war" against the US government? Hardly. By<br>espousing a political position that is contrary to the President does<br>not constitute "levying war" against the government. It generally<br>requires some "forcible opposition to the execution of public law" and<br>mere political rhetoric doesn't rise to the level of "levying war."<br><br>TL;DR: everyone is engaging in political rhetoric. No one is<br>claiming that chargeable offenses have been committed.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ohFlM){.citation_index} [[What Is<br>Treason?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=680c00&url=https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/treason.htm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="criminaldefenselawyer.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
