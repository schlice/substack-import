<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In truth, the Bible is really unclear on exactly what happens in Heaven,<br>but it gives us a few clues.<br><br>Oddly enough, Pastor J.D. Greear *just talked about this* to The Summit<br>Church here in Raleigh, NC this past Sunday. His words answer your<br>question perfectly. Rather than me trying to distill down what he said,<br>let me reproduce it for you here (edited for clarity):<br><br>> Let's be honest: Some of us secretly are worried about heaven. We're<br>> afraid it's gonna be boring---endless days of purposeless leisure<br>> where we sit around in diapers on colorless clouds strumming our harps<br>> and sipping non-alcoholic pi√±a coladas. Our only real activity is<br>> gathering twide a day for choir practice. And you think, "This doesn't<br>> sound fun."<br>><br>> But the Bible describes heaven as a "renewed heavens and earth,"<br>> meaning that heaven is not so much a *replacement* of the old as it is<br>> a *renewed version* of it, with all the curse removed and now<br>> supercharged with the glory of God.<br>><br>> That means EVERYTHING you loved down here---the mountains, the rivers,<br>> the oceans, animals, solar systems, and even extreme sports that I<br>> never got to experience here---is waiting for you there, in glorified<br>> form.<br>><br>> In fact, the Apostle John goes so far as to say, Revelation 21:26,<br>> that God will "bring into heaven the glory and honor of the nations,"<br>> which means he'll bring into the new heavens and new earth the best of<br>> our cultures---the best Italian food, the best architecture, the best<br>> art, Mardi Gras (without the debauchery), Disney World (without the<br>> heat and the lines), the Jersey Shore (without the...Jersey).<br>><br>> And that means *everything we missed out on here we'll get to<br>> experience (in abundance!) there.* You never got to go to Hawaii? No<br>> big deal, the heavenly version will be better. Never got to fly to the<br>> moon? No big deal, you'll probably be able to fly up on your own up<br>> there. Maybe you missed out on marriage here, or a good one---don't<br>> worry, something better is just around the corner. There's no marriage<br>> in heaven, but Scripture says whatever state we're in up there is<br>> better than marriage.<br>><br>> So, ANYTHING you miss out on here---friends, good health,<br>> anything---you get in abundance there. (By the way---I can't prove<br>> this, but I'm pretty sure that in heaven all the foods that are bad<br>> for you here are good for you there, and vice versa. There, ice cream<br>> is good for the waistline, while cauliflower makes you gain weight.<br>> Like I said, I can't prove that, you know, but these things are<br>> spiritually discerned.)<br>><br>> We don't know all that we'll be capable of physically in the<br>> resurrection, but Jesus' resurrection is supposed to give us some<br>> hints, and with His resurrected body, Jesus ate meat, could fly, and<br>> walked through walls.<br>><br>> I've always wanted to climb Mt. Everest. My wife tells me it's off the<br>> table until my kids at least graduate college. And by that time, I may<br>> not be physically able and so I may never get the chance. But that's<br>> okay, because in heaven I'm confident I'll get to climb the renewed<br>> one, which will be a lot better anyway. And when I get to the top,<br>> I'll fly over to the heavenly Tuscany for dinner.<br>><br>> Paul tells us, "What no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no human<br>> heart has conceived---God has prepared these things for those who love<br>> him" (1 Corinthians 2:9). (In plain speak, that means that if you can<br>> think it, it's not awesome enough. That's pretty fantastic because I<br>> can think of some pretty cool things. Heaven likely will have all of<br>> them, plus a bunch of other stuff I can't even conceive of yet.)<br>><br>> By the way, remind me---why do I need a bucket list? Whatever I miss<br>> out on here I've got eternity to enjoy up there. I seek a city with<br>> foundations, whose designer and builder is God.<br>><br>> And of course, the greatest thing about heaven is that God himself,<br>> the source of all these beautiful things, is there and we get to be<br>> with him forever. That's the essence of heaven---being with<br>> God.\[1\](#pIHaY){#cite-pIHaY .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-pIHaY){.citation_index}<br>[https://summitchurch.com/GetFile\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d74399&url=https://summitchurch.com/GetFile.ashx?Guid%3D6d5369e6-15ee-4953-938e-93edb588e2ff){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="summitchurch.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
