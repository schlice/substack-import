<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Military police are charged with protecting the personnel and facilities<br>on a military installation. Their jurisdiction ends at the gate, and the<br>only exception to that is the "hot pursuit rule" which is similar for<br>both military and civilian law enforcement. The *Posse Comitatus Act*<br>prevents the military from enforcing civilian law; someone violating a<br>state or local ordinance on a military installation would be "detained"<br>until civilian law enforcement could come and pick them up.<br><br>Military police also enforce the rules listed in the Uniform Code of<br>Military Justice, and violations are referred back to the unit commander<br>for resolution.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
