<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You don\'t have a reasonable expectation of privacy when<br>you use BitTorrent. Your traffic is not encrypted. You are essentially<br>using the public Internet. Whether or not someone has the right to<br>monitor a particular network depends on the ownership of that portion of<br>the network (i.e. your ISP can watch your usage of their system to<br>ensure you are not violating their terms of service).\<br>\<br>If you are using TOR, that might be a different story. If you\'re using<br>a VPN, it\'s a different story altogether. But just using a particular<br>protocol doesn\'t give you a reasonable expectation of<br>privacy.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
