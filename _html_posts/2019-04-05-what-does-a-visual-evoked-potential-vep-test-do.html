<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What does a Visual Evoked Potential (VEP) test do?<br><br>Excellent question! Thanks for asking.<br><br>A VEP test, on its own, is not an incredibly useful test. However, when<br>used as part of the body of evidence used in determining whether or not<br>a person has Multiple Sclerosis (MS), it can be a very helpful addition.<br><br>When your eyes see an image, that image is converted into electrical<br>signals which travel down a series of nerves and are interpreted by the<br>brain. The VEP test measures those electrical signals in the brain, and<br>can show nerve issues which would otherwise be too subtle to detect<br>using other tests.<br><br>To perform the test, electrodes will be attached to your scalp, and you<br>will watch a series of checkerboard patterns appear on a screen. The<br>electrical signals delivered to the area of your brain that processes<br>visual signals will be measured, and the differences between your eyes,<br>the sides of your brain, and differences between "standard" responses<br>will be measured. The test is completely painless and takes about 20--30<br>minutes to run.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
