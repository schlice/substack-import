<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>***TRIGGER WARNING: This answer contains information about Christianity.<br>While you may have personal opinions about Christianity's view of<br>homosexuals and their behavior, this answer is not personally homophobic<br>or intolerant. It merely explains the Christian view of<br>homosexuality.***<br><br>***In other words, you may have a problem with Christianity, but try not<br>to take it out on the answer.***<br><br>***Please try to direct your dissatisfaction with Christianity<br>appropriately. The answer does not, itself, violate any Quora rules<br>simply because it explains how a religion treats a particular subject.<br>Additionally, I tried to be as sensitive as I can with the treatment of<br>the subject.***<br><br>*You have been warned. Please be nice.*<br><br>\<br><br>Homophobia means "fear of homosexuals." God is not homophobic, as he<br>does not possess the capacity for fear.<br><br>Intolerant means "not tolerant of views, beliefs, or behavior that<br>differ from one\'s own." In that respect, he is intolerant.<br><br>Why? Because he is perfect. He does not tolerate sin in any form. In his<br>kingdom, sin has no place. Sin is an earthly function. Since God is<br>just, as well as loving, all sin must be atoned. This means all sin must<br>be paid for. People with sin debt cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>Christians know that their sin debt was paid by Christ through his death<br>and resurrection. So our sin is paid for.<br><br>Non-Christians have to pay their own sin debt, and that cannot happen in<br>the kingdom of heaven, so they are banished from God's sight.<br><br>So what's the point of telling you all this? It's because the actual sin<br>is irrelevant. We're all sinners. We have all fallen short of God's<br>standard. It is impossible for us to earn our way into heaven.<br><br>But God loves us all. He gives us a way to heaven. It's very simple:<br>repent and believe.<br><br>*Repentance* means admitting, and then turning away from, sin. Jesus<br>said it many times in the Bible: **your sins are forgiven, go and sin no<br>more.** Admitting your sin and then *turning away from it* is what is<br>required. In simpler terms: admit that you did the bad things, and stop<br>doing the bad things. And the bad things are anything he says is bad. He<br>can say that because he is God. He is the creator of all. So he gets to<br>make the rules. In fact, he made the rules a very long time ago, like<br>when he created the universe and everything in it.<br><br>*Believing* means understanding why Christ had to die on the cross, and<br>what that means for our sin. Christ died once, for all. He cleansed us<br>of our sins with his death, and he defeated death when he was<br>resurrected.<br><br>That's it. It says nothing about who you love. It says nothing about<br>what you believe you were born with or not. It only says turn away from<br>doing the bad things, and live your life focused on him, not on anything<br>else.<br><br>Also, no one said it would be easy. Nowhere in the Bible does it say<br>that believing in Christ makes your life perfect. Far from it. The Bible<br>tells you to *expect* trouble, because it will come. You are admonished<br>to be ready for it.<br><br>So you're gay? So what? You have something born in you, just like I do.<br>I have things in me I've had to struggle with my whole life. Mine's not<br>homosexuality, but it is similarly difficult to ignore. We all do,<br>whether we admit it or not. The Bible calls them "thorns in the flesh,<br>messengers of Satan." When Paul talked about them in the Bible, he said<br>that he asked God three times to take it away, and God said no. He said,<br>"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in<br>weakness." (2 Cor 12:9) This means that God's grace is enough to<br>overcome any of your earthly struggles, and his power shines through<br>when you are weakest. We want our lives to glorify him rather than<br>ourselves. When we are weak, God is strongest in us, and our lives<br>reflect him instead of us.<br><br>So yes, living with the pain of not acting on the desires of your flesh<br>is hard. I fully expect it to be. But it's up to you to do it. It's not<br>up to you to shake your fist at God and say, "Why did you make me this<br>way? Fix me, or else!" Really? Accept your brokenness, just as we all<br>do. You are no more broken than I am.<br><br>But saying that you and I are broken doesn't make us homophobic. Far<br>from it. We love you. We don't love what you do. "Love the sinner, hate<br>the sin." Because we recognize that we are all sinners, I'm no better<br>than you. I'm a sinner, too. But I accept my sinful nature and I strive<br>to avoid the sin. I know my weaknesses. They tempt me daily. Hourly,<br>even. But living in Christ means that you recognize the fruits of Satan<br>and you consciously put them aside. It's hard, but it's doable. And it's<br>hard to hear someone tell you that you're broken, because you don't want<br>to hear that. No one wants to hear that they are broken. But I know<br>you're broken, because *we are all broken*, in different ways. You're<br>not unique in that respect. Don't live in your brokenness. Live *better*<br>than it.<br><br>And for the sake of your soul, I ask you to think about it. If you're up<br>for it, talk to God about it (in other words, pray about it). He will<br>never abandon you. He will never give up on you. He will always love<br>you. There is nothing you can do, nowhere you can go, to escape his<br>love.<br><br>He will love you through it. Now give yourself the opportunity to love<br>him, too.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why is the Christian God homophobic and intolerant?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
