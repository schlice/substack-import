<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So first of all, this comparison comes from the Gaza Media Office, so<br>you should already take it with a grain of salt.<br><br>That office reported on January 4th, 2024, that Israel had dropped<br>explosives with a *total weight* across everything dropped of over<br>65,000 tons, which "is more than the weight and power of three nuclear<br>bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima (during World War II).\"<br>Since the comparison to Hiroshima was intended to be inflammatory rather<br>than informative, it can be pretty much ignored.<br><br>Besides, it's a false comparison. Totaling up the weight of all the<br>bombs across an entire campaign and comparing it to a single bomb<br>dropped on one city is a pointless comparison designed only to inflame<br>readers.<br><br>Next, they claimed that about \"two-thirds of the bombs and missiles<br>\... are unguided and imprecise, commonly known as dumb bombs.\" They<br>claimed that the use of such bombs indicates \"the deliberate targeting<br>of indiscriminate and unjustified killing by the occupation, a clear and<br>explicit violation of international law and various international<br>conventions.\"<br><br>Understand what they're trying to tell you here: the use of conventional<br>munitions violates international law and "various international<br>conventions."<br><br>It's interesting because the United Nations Office for Disarmament<br>Affairs actually has a Convention on "Certain Conventional Weapons,"<br>which is actually the shortened title for "The Convention on<br>Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons<br>Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have<br>Indiscriminate Effects." Aha! This is exactly what Hamas is talking<br>about!<br><br>Except it doesn't ban dumb bombs.<br><br>There are four main categories of weapons considered to be excessively<br>injurious or to have indiscriminate effects:<br><br>- Protocol I: Prohibits the use of weapons that employ fragments not<br>  detectable in the human body by X-ray<br>- Protocol II: Regulates the use of landmines, booby-traps and similar<br>  devices<br>- Protocol III: Limits the use of incendiary weapons<br>- Protocol IV: Prohibits the use of laser weapons specifically designed<br>  to cause permanent blindness<br><br>As you can see, conventional munitions are not called out as a type of<br>weapon which produces "excessive injury or which have indiscriminate<br>effects."<br><br>Okay, but can't traditional, conventional weapons be used in a way which<br>causes "excessive injury" or used "indiscriminately?" Yes they can, but<br>this isn't what the Gaza Media Office is alleging. They are alleging<br>that the use of dumb bombs is violative of international treaties, and<br>clearly it is not. Regardless, let's be generous and look at whether or<br>not Israel's use of conventional bombs is "excessive" or<br>"indiscriminate." Even in late December, US President Joe Biden accused<br>Israel of using "indiscriminate" bombing. But is it really true?<br><br>Believe it or not, Politico summed up the truth:<br><br>> Whether it is to protect the lives of Israeli soldiers, accelerate the<br>> end of the war or send a message to Hamas that it will either release<br>> hostages or face certain death, Israel's willingness to liberalize the<br>> rules of engagement in Gaza isn't surprising. This doesn't mean,<br>> however, that the bombing campaign or its tactics are illegal,<br>> punitive or malicious. And to call it indiscriminate fails to grasp<br>> the extensive lengths gone to to minimize civilian casualties,<br>> especially considering Hamas' "human shield" policy.<br>><br>> While Israeli battlefield tactics may run counter to strategic war<br>> aims, calling its bombing campaign indiscriminate is a<br>> mischaracterization of both the IDF's conduct and its<br>> intentions.\[1\](#qJKCH){#cite-qJKCH .citation_link}<br><br>The IDF is a professional fighting force. They use extensive planning to<br>minimize civilian casualties and achieve the greatest military<br>successes. Hamas is also keenly aware that they have no chance of<br>defeating Israel on the battlefield. For them, "shaping public opinion<br>in Israel, around the world and especially in America is their strongest<br>weapon --- and the West's greatest vulnerability. Losing a battalion of<br>the al-Qassim Brigade is a small price to pay for Hamas if worldwide<br>media can film the prisoners surrendering, stripped naked and<br>humiliated." This is why Hamas is so aggressive in using human shields<br>and deploying weapons in homes and hospitals. Every IDF military victory<br>they can paint as a human rights travesty (which is eagerly and blindly<br>accepted by Western media) is a "win" for Hamas.<br><br>In other words, Hamas' only hope of victory is in the court of public<br>opinion, delivered through half-truths and outright subterfuge.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-qJKCH){.citation_index} [[Israel's bombing campaign in<br>Gaza isn't<br>'indiscriminate'](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=61f889&url=https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-bomb-campaign-gaza-hamas-war-defense-army/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="politico.eu"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
