<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is this legal? A president attempting to incite and form their own<br>militia?**<br><br>100% legal, and protected by the Constitution.<br><br>Additionally, there's no evidence that the oddly-named "Army for Trump"<br>is actually going to be an "army," like with M-16s and battle dress.<br><br>I believe the "Army" referred to in the video is more *figurative*,<br>engaged in the "combat" of "mobilizing" the "troops" who will go vote in<br>November.<br><br>It's kinda a poorly-named "get-out-the-vote" effort. I wouldn't have<br>called it an "Army," but whatever.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
