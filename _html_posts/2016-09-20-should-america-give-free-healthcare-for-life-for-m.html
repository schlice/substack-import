<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Our military does a job that few understand, and even fewer would<br>volunteer to do. We owe more to our veterans than we could ever repay.<br>And let's understand something else: their healthcare is not free. They<br>paid for it in sweat equity for 20 years. Should they do it? Absolutely.<br>For more reasons than you can count.<br><br>That said, the process they have in place currently is exactly what they<br>should have, no more, no less.<br><br>The actual post-retirement benefits programs are maintained by the<br>Veteran's Administration, not by the military service. The service only<br>runs healthcare while the member is active.<br><br>If you served honorably for 20 years, you and your dependents can remain<br>in the military healthcare system for the remainder of your life. This<br>is a benefit afforded to military members, and an incentive to<br>complete a career as a military member.<br><br>If you served for fewer than 20 years, you do not get healthcare for<br>life, unless you were disabled during military service with a disability<br>rating of at least 30%, with a condition directly related to your<br>military service (also known as a *service-connected disability*). If<br>this is the case, any healthcare needed to manage your disability is<br>covered by the veteran's healthcare system so long as you maintain that<br>rating (some conditions can improve, particularly mental health).<br><br>All gave some, some gave all.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
