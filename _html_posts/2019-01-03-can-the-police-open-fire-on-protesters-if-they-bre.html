<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can the police open fire on protesters if they break the law (for<br>example destroy private property or block a road)?**<br><br>To answer the question without snark, no one can use deadly force unless<br>a threat to life of a threat of grave bodily harm exists.<br><br>So the answer is no, police cannot use firearms against protesters for<br>simply breaking the law.<br><br>Police can use *non-lethal* rounds, like bean bag rounds, which are<br>fired from a shotgun, or rubber bullets. These rounds are fired from<br>actual firearms, so if the police are using these riot control methods,<br>it does appear that the police are actually shooting protesters when<br>they are not.<br><br>I'd prefer that the fire department use protesters blocking a road as<br>target practice for learning how to aim the truck-mounted fire<br>suppression system.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
