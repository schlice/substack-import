<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Should I buy a Samsung Galaxy S9? Is it worth it to buy that phone?<br><br>I will defer to [[Lewis<br>Hilsenteger](https://www.quora.com/topic/Lewis-Hilsenteger-1)]{.qlink_container}'s<br>opinion on that topic. Lew hosts the popular YouTube channel, "[[Unbox<br>Therapy](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1f2b69&url=https://www.youtube.com/user/unboxtherapy){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="youtube.com"}]{.qlink_container}," where he discusses<br>technology trends and does device reviews.<br><br>Lew has been using a Pixel 2 XL for quite some time because he is<br>enamored with its camera. In fact, he has convinced several people I<br>know to get the Pixel 2 because of that outstanding camera. But as a<br>test, he started carrying and using the S9 (actually, the S9+, but the<br>comparison is similar). He then did a video comparing the S9+ to the<br>Pixel 2 XL. He went into the video without a preconception about which<br>device he was going to choose.<br><br>His observations are quite interesting. I'll let you watch for yourself.<br><br>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8be94d&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DSIR67et5tcs){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="youtube.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
