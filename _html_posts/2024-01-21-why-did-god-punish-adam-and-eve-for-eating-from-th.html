<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **Why did God punish Adam and Eve for eating from the tree of<br>> knowledge of good and evil?**<br><br>Because He told them not to, and they disobeyed Him.<br><br>It's really simple. He told them not to do something, and they did it<br>anyway. The tree didn't have any magical properties. The change in Adam<br>and Eve came from their disobedience. They became sinners when they<br>disobeyed God. Their eyes were opened because they were now sinners.<br>They "knew" evil because they *experienced* the evil of sin.<br><br>> Isn't knowledge of good and evil the right way to live?<br><br>Objectively, no. The *right* way to live would be to live in full<br>obedience to God. What has our sinful nature gotten us? Sorrow, hate,<br>disease, and death. God tried to spare us from that life, but that's the<br>life we chose. And because of that sin nature, we continue to choose<br>that life every day of our lives.<br><br>Still, in our sin, God sent His only Son to become human and take the<br>punishment for our sins that we deserve so that we can be reunited with<br>Him.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
