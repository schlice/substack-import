And it also might be<br>conceivable that the President wanted to "set the record straight," as<br>it were, with regards to whatever toadstool-like quality may or may not<br>be present in his penis. Therefore, in at least one viewing of the<br>situation, it is at least conceivable that the President might pass this<br>information on to his press secretary.<br><br>> Is this normal business practice for a CEO?<br><br>No, this isn't listed in the standard business practices of a CEO. But<br>this is irrelevant because at the time, Trump wasn't a CEO, so I'm not<br>sure why you're asking about whether or not this is a normal thing for a<br>CEO.<br><br>It is, however, conceivable that a President may want to brief his Press<br>Secretary about a question that she may receive, and how he wants her to<br>answer that question.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>When Stormy Daniels described Trump\'s penis as very small, he called<br>all of his female staff individually to deny this and described its size<br>and girth to them to set the record straight.
