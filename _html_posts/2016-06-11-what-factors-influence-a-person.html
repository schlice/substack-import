<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let me answer your second question first: *Does the military even<br>suggest one branch over the other based on a recruits personality,<br>skills or background?*<br><br>No, they do not. What branch you choose is entirely up to you.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-ab7cc663015e914a52db70278675ef50){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-ab7cc663015e914a52db70278675ef50" master_w="762"<br>master_h="393"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>This is what our recruiting office area looks like here in town. I'm not<br>sure if you can see the doors, but there is an office for each service,<br>plus the Air Force Reserve. Which door you walk into is entirely up to<br>you. Each service has its ups and downs, so depending on what you're<br>looking for in a military career will determine which door you enter.<br><br>Many times, which branch you enter is based on which branch your<br>relatives were in. Generally, experiences of relatives will strongly<br>influence or dissuade decisions about entering any particular branch.<br><br>Some people have preconceived notions about each branch, what they do,<br>how much they value their people, and the sorts of jobs and experiences<br>you may have in that particular service. Those sorts of ideas about what<br>each service does, and what you might like (or more appropriately, not<br>like) to do weigh heavily on decisions about which service to join. Each<br>service has a "culture" that is a good fit for some, and clashes with<br>others. Finding the culture you like and the one that suits you the<br>best, are also big motivating factors.<br><br>Most folks do like to pick their careers before they start; some people<br>simply walk into the recruiting office and say they'll do whatever the<br>service needs them to do. Recruiters love those people, by the way, but<br>they are the exception rather than the rule these days. Some services<br>are more flexible in terms of allowing you to pick your own career field<br>than others; for example, the Army and the Navy are far more flexible in<br>terms of allowing you to pick your own career field than the Air Force<br>or the Marine Corps.<br><br>The Air Force is the youngest service in the bunch. It's coming up on<br>its 75th anniversary, where the other services have been around no fewer<br>than 150 years apiece. This is sometimes a motivating factor, as the Air<br>Force is less encumbered by "tradition" and "the way things have always<br>been done" as some of the older services. The Air Force is also unique,<br>in that if you're enlisting in the Air Force, you may be a part of a<br>flight crew, but you won't be flying the plane. Only Air Force officers<br>fly planes. So the one service that is centered on missions off the<br>ground doesn't let enlisted personnel actually fly planes. Sometimes,<br>that's a dichotomy which is too much to wrap your brain around. Too bad,<br>because the jobs the enlisted force does in the Air Force are not only<br>sorely needed, they are highly technical and vital to accomplishing the<br>mission. Being the "stick actuator" is not always the job to have.<br>Besides, of the entire officer corps, only around 13% of them actually<br>fly planes. So even among officers, there are very few actual flying<br>jobs. Their scarcity makes them coveted, but UAVs are changing that<br>somewhat. Some people who were formerly not pilot qualified can now fly<br>UAVs.<br><br>The decision about which service to join may also hinge on ASVAB scores.<br>Each service has a low threshold below which you will not be accepted<br>into that service. Based on the technicality of the jobs in that<br>service, the Air Force has historically demanded the highest ASVAB<br>scores, followed closely by the Navy, and then the Marine Corps, and the<br>Army traditionally has accepted the lowest ASVAB scores. This "natural<br>selection" has also influenced the "types" of people who end up in each<br>service; this is where the perception that people who are just slightly<br>smarter than a bag of rocks end up in the Army. Note that this is just a<br>perception; the Army has some extremely talented and motivated<br>individuals, but the bottom of the ASVAB score range typically fuels<br>those negative perceptions about each service.<br><br>Ultimately, the decision about which service to join is a very personal<br>one. The service has to be the right "fit" for the person, and different<br>personality types and personal motivations will find homes in different<br>services.<br><br>Bill Stein, USAFA '94, USAF 94--99, USAFR 99--05<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
