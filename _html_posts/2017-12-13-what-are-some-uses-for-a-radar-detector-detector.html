<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The only use for a radar detector detector (RDD) is to find vehicles<br>which have active radar detectors in areas in which they are prohibited.<br><br>It's a constant battle between radar detector manufacturers and RDD<br>manufacturers. A radar detector uses a [[superheterodyne<br>receiver](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3ba0c1&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superheterodyne_receiver){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} which is built around a<br>local oscillator, which radiates slightly. The RDD can detect the local<br>oscillator in the radar detector. But since the RDD also uses a local<br>oscillator, the radar detector can essentially contain a "radar detector<br>detector detector" (hehe, that was fun) and when it detects the presence<br>of a RDD, it shuts off the local oscillator so as to avoid detection.<br><br>The original RDD was called the VG-2, but this device has been<br>supplanted by the Spectre brand of RDDs, developed by Stealth Micro<br>Systems. The "cat-and-mouse" game between Stealth Micro and the radar<br>detector manufacturers has been going on since the original VG-2 was<br>released before 2000. Today, we're up to the Spectre IV and there are a<br>few detectors which are immune to it, but many are not.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
