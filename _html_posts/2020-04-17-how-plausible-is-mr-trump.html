<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How plausible is Mr Trump\'s suggestion that covid-19 originated in a<br>Chinese lab? It seems that the US\'s virus labs have very sloppy<br>procedures too (see link) and may well have posted live virus in a cheap<br>jiffy-bag to their colleagues in Wuhan.**<br><br>"Mr. Trump's suggestion"? Like he came up with the idea on his own? Like<br>he was sitting on the can one day and thought, "Hmm, I bet those Chinese<br>baked up this coronavirus in a lab."<br><br>No, someone told him that "suggestion."<br><br>In fact, it was a whole lot of "someones" who told him that<br>"suggestion."<br><br>> There is increasing confidence that the COVID-19 outbreak likely<br>> originated in a Wuhan laboratory, though not as a bioweapon but as<br>> part of China\'s attempt to demonstrate that its efforts to identify<br>> and combat viruses are equal to or greater than the capabilities of<br>> the United States, **multiple sources who have been briefed on the<br>> details of early actions by China\'s government and seen relevant<br>> materials** tell Fox News.<br>><br>> This may be the \"costliest government cover-up of all time,\" one of<br>> the sources said.<br>><br>> The sources believe the initial transmission of the virus -- a<br>> naturally occurring strain that was being studied there -- was<br>> bat-to-human and that \"patient zero\" worked at the laboratory, then<br>> went into the population in Wuhan.<br>><br>> The "increasing confidence" comes from classified and open-source<br>> documents and evidence, the sources said. \...\ Sources emphasized<br>> \-- as is often the case with intelligence \-- that it's not<br>> definitive and should not be characterized as such. Some inside the<br>> administration and the intelligence and epidemiological communities<br>> are more skeptical, and the investigation is<br>> continuing\[1\](#MySQz){#cite-MySQz .citation_link}.<br><br>True, it is not definitive, until investigations reveal the truth:<br><br>> The U.S. is conducting a full-scale investigation into whether the<br>> novel coronavirus, which went on to morph into a global pandemic that<br>> has brought the global economy to its knees, escaped from a lab in<br>> Wuhan, China, Fox News has learned.<br>><br>> Intelligence operatives are said to be gathering information about the<br>> laboratory and the initial outbreak of the virus. Intelligence<br>> analysts are piecing together a timeline of what the government knew<br>> and "creating an accurate picture of what happened," the sources said.<br>><br>> Once that investigation is complete \-- something that is expected to<br>> happen in the near-term \-- the findings will be presented to the<br>> Trump administration. At that point White House policymakers and<br>> President Trump will use the findings to determine how to hold the<br>> country accountable for the pandemic.\[2\](#GnBFi){#cite-GnBFi<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>And yes, I have to quote the center-right Fox News because no one else<br>is carrying this.
