<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's literally okay to think anything you like, in the sense of you are<br>human, and you have a right to your opinion.<br><br>But if we're going to talk about objective reality, the US doesn't<br>have anything close to what we call "regimes."<br><br>If you take just the *base* definition of a "regime," and you squint<br>real hard and turn your head a little, you *might* be able to justify<br>your belief that the US has a "regime." I mean, the base definition of a<br>"regime" is "a governing body, especially one that is authoritarian or<br>tyrannical." Does President Trump sometimes give the *appearance* that<br>he somehow runs the entire government, and does so in what one might<br>perceive to be an *authoritarian* way? Sure, I can understand how you<br>might think that.<br><br>But if you look more closely at what makes a regime, you start to<br>see that it is actually Cuba which fits the definition of a regime much<br>more closely than the US. A regime often implies a system of government<br>that is not based on democratic principles, such as a one-party system,<br>a dictatorship, or a military junta.<br><br>- The US is a primarily two-party Constitutional democratic republic<br>  which has experienced 245 years of peaceful transitions of power to a<br>  duly-elected administration. The US has an independent (some might<br>  claim "hostile") media, and it protects the fundamental rights and<br>  freedoms of its citizens.<br>- Cuba\'s political system is characterized by a single-party communist<br>  government led by the Communist Party of Cuba. This system does not<br>  allow for political opposition or independent media, and it restricts<br>  fundamental rights and freedoms.<br><br>Which one sounds more like a regime?<br><br>\<br><br>Then, you say that the reason you believe the US is a "regime" is<br>because they have imposed sanctions against Cuba. The United States<br>maintains a comprehensive economic embargo against Cuba, primarily due<br>to historical issues, concerns over human rights, and the Cuban<br>government\'s communist ideology. The embargo was initiated in 1960,<br>primarily as a response to the Cuban Revolution and the nationalization<br>of US assets. It aims to exert pressure on the Cuban government to<br>change its policies, including its human rights record and international<br>behavior.<br><br>The embargo stemmed from the Cuban Revolution in 1959, which led to the<br>overthrow of the U.S.-backed government of Fulgencio Batista and the<br>establishment of a communist regime under Fidel Castro. The Cuban<br>government then immediately nationalized U.S.-owned properties without<br>adequate compensation, further escalating tensions.<br><br>The U.S. has long expressed concerns about human rights abuses in Cuba,<br>including restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly. The U.S. has<br>viewed Cuba\'s communist government as a threat to its interests and the<br>interests of its allies. The U.S. has also cited Cuba\'s involvement in<br>regional conflicts and its support for other communist governments as<br>reasons for the embargo.<br><br>So unless and until those things change, the US will keep its trade<br>embargo against Cuba in place.<br><br>So maybe you should talk to Miguel Díaz-Canel and get Cuba to improve<br>their behavior if they really want trade with the US to resume.<br><br>\<br><br>TL;DR: Can you believe that the US is a regime? Can you call for "regime<br>change" (á la the Cuban Revolution) and the installation of a communist<br>government to get trade to resume? Of course you can! You are free to<br>believe whatever you like!<br><br>But is there a *snowball's chance in Hell* that it will actually happen?<br>Nope. Not at all.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
