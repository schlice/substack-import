If the CD-R session is<br>closed, you will not be able to burn to it at all.<br><br>If it is a CD-RW or CD+RW, you can erase and re-burn the CD, in which<br>case the CD will be completely wiped.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
