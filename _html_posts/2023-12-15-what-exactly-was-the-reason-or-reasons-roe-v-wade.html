<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The exact reason *Roe* was overturned was because it was built on a<br>faulty premise.<br><br>*Roe* was the case which established the precedent that there is a<br>Constitutional right to abortion. The Court examined *Roe*'s reasoning<br>and found that the Constitutional right which *Roe* claimed existed<br>really doesn't exist. Therefore, if there is no Constitutional right to<br>abortion, *Roe*'s legal foundations are gone. *Roe* (and *Casey*, which<br>mostly referenced the precedent of *Roe*) was overruled, and the power<br>to control abortion was returned to the states and to the people<br>respectively.<br><br>As for rape and incest, their presence or absence has absolutely nothing<br>to do with whether or not abortion is a Constitutional right. The only<br>thing that *Dobbs* decided was that abortion is not a Constitutional<br>right. The states can decide whether or not (and if so, when) abortion<br>will be allowed. Some states completely permit abortion with no<br>restrictions. Ohio just recently added a right to abortion into their<br>state constitution. Some states restrict abortion after a certain number<br>of weeks, but allow it in the case of rape or incest, or to save the<br>life of the mother. Some states completely restrict abortion, including<br>in the case of rape or incest. It comes down to the will of the people<br>in those states.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
