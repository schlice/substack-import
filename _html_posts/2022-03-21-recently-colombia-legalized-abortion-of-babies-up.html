<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, there are no international "laws." There are only<br>international agreements about certain things which can be accepted or<br>not by individual nations.<br><br>Secondly, the closest thing to international agreement about life is the<br>UN and its *Universal Declaration of Human Rights* (UDHR).<br><br>However, it is intentionally ambiguous on when life begins, and whether<br>or not they regard that life as protected.<br><br>For example, Article 1 says, "All human beings are born free and equal<br>in dignity and rights." The UN Human Rights Committee, an organization<br>within the UN which deals with treaties, reminds us that the language<br>says that all human beings are *born* free, thus their human rights<br>do not begin until birth. However, the UDHR does not explicitly say<br>this.<br><br>Then, Article 2 says, "Everyone is entitled to all the rights and<br>freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind,<br>such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other<br>opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status." We<br>should note that it clearly says that everyone is entitled to all the<br>rights and freedoms in the UDHR, without distinction of birth. To<br>me, this is a plain reading that you don't have to be born in order to<br>be entitled to the rights in the UDHR.<br><br>Of course, Article 3 says, "Everyone has the right to life, liberty and<br>security of person." They do not clarify who "everyone" is. Is it only<br>those who are covered by Article 1, or does that mean "everyone,"<br>including the unborn?<br><br>So even the United Nations, which is the closest body to any<br>representing any sort of international understanding of the issue, is<br>conspicuously vague about exactly to whom these rights apply.<br><br>No matter, because the UDHR is just *boilerplate* for nations to build<br>their own, *binding*, human rights documents. Sovereign nations can<br>still do as they choose, and Columbia is no exception.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Recently, Colombia legalized abortion of babies up to 24 weeks. Is this<br>not against international human rights laws?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
