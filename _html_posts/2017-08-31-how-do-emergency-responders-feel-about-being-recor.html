<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Woohoo! Bring it on! I'll get my 15 minutes of fame on your YouTube<br>channel, viewed by your tens of subscribers.<br><br>See, cops don't become cops to be loved. Wanna be loved? Be a<br>firefighter. Everyone loves them. I'm fully aware that when I step into<br>a public area, there is always at least one camera somewhere recording<br>everything I do (primarily because someone is just itching for me to<br>screw up), and in some amount of time in the future, there will be one<br>on me recording everything I do (because the people itching for me<br>to screw up learned about body cams and tricked politicians into making<br>me do my own dirty work at taxpayer expense).<br><br>I am in public, I have nothing to hide, nor do I have any legal<br>expectation of privacy. So record away. But keep your distance.<br><br>And when I make it on to your YouTube channel, be a dear and send me the<br>link!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
