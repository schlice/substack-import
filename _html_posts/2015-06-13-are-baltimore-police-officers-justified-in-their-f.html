<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I think this goes way beyond Baltimore. This sort of<br>behavior sends a strong message to cops: if the public thinks you\'re<br>wrong, the city for whom you work will arrest you and prosecute you for<br>doing nothing more than your job. Honest mistakes? No more. Can\'t make<br>them. But whether or not you\'ve done your job correctly is no longer<br>relevant. It\'s all about perception. Doesn\'t matter whether or not you<br>followed procedure to the letter. If it looks bad, it is bad. And<br>that\'s a problem, as many arrest control tactics look really bad even<br>though they don\'t really cause lasting physical trauma.\<br>\<br>For example, one arrest control technique involves kneeling on the<br>suspect from the side, one knee in the back and one knee in the crook of<br>the neck. What you can\'t see is that 95% of the officers weight is on<br>the knee in the back. The knee at the neck simply prevents the suspect<br>from raising his head, there is no real body weight there. But from the<br>bystanders point of view, it looks like the officer is crushing the<br>suspect\'s neck with his knee.\<br>\<br>Batons also look much more brutal than they are. Officers try to counter<br>this perceived \"beating\" by performing targeted pressure point strikes<br>that can incapacitate with few blows.\<br>\<br>And if prosecutors are not going to stand behind their officers, if<br>prosecutors are going to jump to arraign officers for doing their jobs,<br>you will see fewer officers going \"above and beyond\" to stop crime,<br>for fear that their actions will land them in jail.\<br>\<br>I predict that if prosecutors around the country behave as they did in<br>Baltimore, it will have a chilling effect on law enforcement, and a<br>corresponding increase in violent crimes.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
