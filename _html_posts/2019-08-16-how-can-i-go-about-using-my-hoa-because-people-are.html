What<br>can I do? This will invade my privacy and I will no longer feel safe.**<br><br>I think you meant to ask how you can go about "suing" your HOA because<br>of things going on behind your house.<br><br>Your HOA is not responsible for telling you about ongoing building<br>projects in areas outside of their control. So you can't really sue them<br>for not doing something that they were not required to do in the first<br>place.<br><br>Secondly, if the area was zoned correctly, you should have known that<br>the area behind your house was commercial property and that it could<br>have had commercial buildings built on it. If it wasn't zoned for<br>commercial, then the city would have had to re-zone it in order to<br>approve the building there, and you would have been notified by the city<br>of the zoning change.<br><br>Finally, you are not locked into your house. You can always sell it and<br>leave if you don't feel safe.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
