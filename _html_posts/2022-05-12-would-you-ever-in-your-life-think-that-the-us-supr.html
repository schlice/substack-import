<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Absolutely. And you only need to look at history in order to understand<br>that this is not new.<br><br>Perhaps you may remember the landmark Supreme Court decision in the case<br>of *Plessy v. Ferguson*. No? You should. It was the decision that<br>basically said that the racial segregation laws in the south following<br>the civil war were constitutional. This is the case which codified<br>"separate but equal," so long as the separate facilities were equal in<br>quality.<br><br>It's hard to think about that today. The Supreme Court said that racial<br>segregation was constitutional. But again, this case was decided in<br>1896.<br><br>However, it was immediately rectified, right?<br><br>Not so much. *Plessy* stood as "settled law" and "precedent" (sound<br>familiar?) for almost 60 years until 1954, when *Brown v. Board of<br>Education* found that racial segregation laws in schools were<br>unconstitutional, even if the facilities were equal in quality. This was<br>the beginning of the end of the road for *Plessy*, which was then<br>*effectively* overturned with subsequent findings of unconstitutionality<br>of racial segregation.<br><br>So a Supreme Court decision standing for decades before being<br>effectively overturned is not new.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Would you ever in your life think that the US Supreme Court decision<br>made almost 50 years ago in the case of Roe v. Wade would be reversed?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
