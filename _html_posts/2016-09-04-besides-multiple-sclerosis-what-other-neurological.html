<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are many disorders which can cause the symptoms of MS, but there<br>are a scant few that cause white spots on an MRI, and there are none<br>others that I know of which cause lesions which grow in size and number<br>over the years.<br><br>As a matter of fact, there is one disease that is specifically ruled out<br>by checking to see if there are both old and new lesions. **Acute<br>disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)** is a disease which causes brief<br>but intense inflammation in the brain and spinal cord, and sometimes the<br>optic nerve, as well as causing white-spot-producing damage to myelin.<br>Neurologists will look for evidence of old and new lesions, which would<br>indicate a progression in disease more similar to MS than ADEM. At a<br>first attack with no old lesions, it is difficult to differentiate MS<br>from ADEM. Doctors will closely monitor patients who experience such<br>attacks to see if there is reoccurrence to suggest that the disease is<br>MS.<br><br>Lyme Disease can sometimes produce positive MRI results, especially<br>in Lyme which is undiagnosed for long periods of time. Again, though,<br>progression of disease usually indicates MS and not Lyme. Early Lyme<br>disease responds well to antibiotics, whereas MS does not.<br><br>Finally, leukodystrophies are a group of diseases which affect<br>myelin, or the white matter of the brain. Myelin is made up of about ten<br>different chemicals. These leukodystrophies affect how the body<br>metabolizes or produces these chemicals. Each of the leukodystrophies is<br>a defect in a gene which controls the formation and metabolization of<br>one of these chemicals. Specifically, they are metachromatic<br>leukodystrophy, Krabb√© disease, adrenoleukodystrophy,<br>Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, Canavan disease, Childhood Ataxia with<br>Central Nervous System Hypomyelination or CACH (also known as Vanishing<br>White Matter Disease), Alexander disease, Refsum disease, and<br>cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.<br><br>There are likely others, but this is what I came up with off the top of<br>my head. Hopefully some of my esteemed colleagues can fill in the<br>blanks.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
