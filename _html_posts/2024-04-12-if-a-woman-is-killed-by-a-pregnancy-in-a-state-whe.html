<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, but the people who were the most proximate cause of her death should<br>be, and that would be **her doctors and the hospital lawyers who told<br>the doctors that they could get in trouble for performing such a<br>procedure because it might be considered an illegal abortion. *Shame<br>on them, damn them all to hell.***<br><br>People want to jump on the legislators in this case, but the legislators<br>wrote abortion exceptions into all state laws. Yes, you read that right.<br>Despite what some are claiming, ***every state which has an abortion ban<br>of any form in place has exceptions to save the life of the mother.<br>Every. Single. One.***<br><br>Anyone telling you that "a woman died because abortion was illegal" is<br>trying to play on your emotions.<br><br>Cue the commenters filling the comment section with news articles<br>claiming that a woman died because abortion was illegal. Those "news<br>organizations" are the "anyone" I referred to above. Every one of those<br>news articles is clickbait, trying to play on your emotions. They're<br>trying to get you to believe that the doctors had no choice; the law<br>tied their hands. They couldn't save the poor dying mother because<br>abortion is illegal.<br><br>It's all emotion-filled lies. All of it.<br><br>\<br><br>*I'll respond to the clickbait articles if I can (there are lots of<br>them, because news organizations are shady scam-artists), but I'll<br>delete any shrieking harpies who try to tell me that I'm an emotionless<br>piece of garbage who just wants to keep women subservient, barefoot and<br>pregnant in the kitchen. I'll have none of that. You know nothing about<br>my life and my experiences, so don't pretend that you know me because I<br>don't want you to kill babies. And there is no limit to the number of<br>comments I can delete, and no limit to the number of shrieking harpies I<br>can block.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
