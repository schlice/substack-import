<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Your best bet is situational awareness. Knowing what\'s<br>going on around you at all times. It\'s great in the car, too. If I have<br>to change lanes in a hurry, I know what way to go, because I know who is<br>around me.\<br>\<br>And since video recording is such a big deal these days, I got a video<br>surveillance system for my home. It doesn\'t hook into the alarm system,<br>but it doesn\'t have to. It records any time there\'s motion, and it<br>will preserve video for over a month. It\'s on a UPS, so don\'t bother<br>trying to cut the power. The alarm system uses cellular primarily, so<br>don\'t bother trying to cut the coax for the Internet. My cameras will<br>still record you, and my alarm system will call the police. They may not<br>respond any time soon, but there will be a record that we notified the<br>police. I want the evidence of who did it. I know that my locked doors,<br>as secure as they are, won\'t keep a truly determined bad guy out. So<br>the best thing I can do is to get some evidence I can hand over to the<br>police.\<br>\<br>As far as when I\'m home, I have a dog. She would absolutely love any<br>intruder to death. But you can\'t tell from outside the door, because<br>all you hear is a very loud, very scary-sounding bark. Good thing<br>burglars can\'t speak dog, because they will hear, \"Hey, come on in!<br>Let me get my ball and we\'ll play!\"\<br>\<br>And as [[Al<br>Saibini](https://www.quora.com/profile/Al-Saibini)]{.qlink_container}<br>mentioned, you don\'t have to make your home a fortress. A story which<br>illustrates this point: Two hunters are out on safari when a cheetah<br>spots them first and starts heading their direction. On seeing this one<br>hunter stops, takes off his backpack, and retrieves a pair of running<br>shoes. The other hunter says, \"Man, what are you doing? Why are you<br>bothering with those? You can\'t outrun a *cheetah!*\" The first hunter<br>replies, \"I don\'t need to outrun a cheetah. I just need to outrun<br>*you.*\"\<br>\<br>You don\'t need to turn your house into a fortress. You just have to<br>make it look like less of a target than your neighbor\'s<br>house.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
