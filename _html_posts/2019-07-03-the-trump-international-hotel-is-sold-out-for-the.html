<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**The Trump International Hotel is sold out for the 4th of July Trump<br>extravaganza despite charging double what similar properties are<br>charging. Does this violate the emoluments clause?**<br><br>Short answer: no.<br><br>Longer answer: The Emoluments Clause does not prevent a president from<br>running a business. The Emoluments Clause prevents a president from<br>working for (and being compensated by) a foreign government.<br><br>Trump has already stepped down from the board of directors of the Trump<br>organization, and has placed his assets into trust. Some have argued<br>that he hasn't done enough, because his assets are not in a *blind<br>trust*.<br><br>However, it's difficult to put the Trump name into a blind trust; the<br>Trump name on a hotel makes money regardless of whether or not the<br>assets are in a blind trust.<br><br>Now, does this mean that the president can't violate the Emoluments<br>clause using his hotels? Not at all. For example, if the president<br>charges foreign dignitaries triple the going rate at the Trump Hotel and<br>then later on makes a foreign policy change which positively benefits<br>that foreign country, the Justice Department should be looking very<br>closely at whether or not Trump was "paid" (however indirectly) to make<br>that particular policy change.<br><br>But running a business (and charging *market value* for a hotel room,<br>whatever the market will bear) is not in and of itself a violation of<br>the Emoluments Clause.<br><br>The Constitution never intended the president to lose his businesses<br>just to be President.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
