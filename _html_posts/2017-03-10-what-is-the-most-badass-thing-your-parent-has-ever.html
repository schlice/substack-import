<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let me start off by saying that I am not my dad's biggest fan. Since<br>I've reached adulthood (which I define as having the mental acuity to<br>see through the childhood glamour we have of our parents and see them as<br>the flawed humans they are), we have had a falling out, and I don't talk<br>to them anymore.<br><br>That said, while my dad was a cop, he was pretty badass.<br><br>I remember when he won two "Top Cop" awards two months in a row. This<br>was a department-level award that was presented monthly. I guess it was<br>a pretty big deal to win one. But to win two in a row? That's something.<br><br>\[WAR STORY ALERT: and this one is fairly graphic. No images other than<br>the ones you form in your mind. You've been warned.\]<br><br>The first month, he was responding to a domestic disturbance. I call it<br>a domestic disturbance because that's how it was characterized over the<br>radio. But the victim he found was, for lack of a better term,<br>*disemboweled* but still alive. He was on the ground, and much of the<br>contents of his lower GI tract was on the outside of his body, hanging<br>out of a large knife wound which spanned the width of his torso. My dad<br>removed his uniform shirt, and removed his white T-shirt (the only<br>color-free cloth he had access to) and, using his T-shirt, carefully<br>returned the man's "guts" to his gut, and stuffed the wound with the<br>improvised trauma dressing. After many hours of surgery, the man did<br>survive.<br><br>The second month saw him back on the department's hazmat unit. Now, I<br>know what you're thinking: isn't he a cop? Don't firefighters do hazmat<br>stuff? Well, yes and no. Yes he was a cop. But where I lived growing up,<br>all of the fire departments were volunteer. No paid firefighters means<br>very little training budget, and certainly no budget for the extensive<br>training required to man a hazmat crew. So my dad was recruited out of<br>Emergency Services to start a hazmat team. One hazmat call he took was<br>for a truck crash on one of our local highways. A box truck had gotten<br>into an accident, and when fire crews checked the back of the truck,<br>they found it full of 55-gallon drums of unidentified chemicals, which<br>the driver identified as various toxic and highly dangerous chemicals he<br>was illegally hauling to be illegally dumped. Not only were the<br>chemicals toxic, but they were highly unstable, and the truck was well<br>on its way to catching fire. We're talking nitroglycerin in one drum and<br>sulfuric acid in another (memory is a little fuzzy on that second one; I<br>remember the nitroglycerin but I don't remember what the other chemicals<br>were specifically). The drums were not labeled, some of the drums were<br>damaged in the crash and were leaking, and an explosion would have<br>decimated a 20 square block radius, and the ensuing chemical cloud would<br>have injured many millions more. The firefighters did what they could to<br>keep the fire down, but how were they going to get these drums out<br>safely? My dad donned a Class 1 fully-encapsulated hazmat suit replete<br>with SCBA gear (kinda like SCUBA gear, just not underwater) and entered<br>the back of the truck. He sprayed liquid nitrogen on all of the barrels,<br>freezing them solid so they could be safely removed, preventing what<br>could have been one of the largest losses of life and damage to the<br>environment that the region would have ever seen.<br><br>All in all, pretty badass. Like I said, we may not be friends now, but<br>gotta give credit where credit is due.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
