<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with all legal answers, the answer is "it depends." And as always,<br>this is not intended to be legal advice, this is just general<br>information that anyone can find from insightful use of Google. If you<br>want legal advice, talk to a lawyer. Seems like common sense, but I have<br>to put it out there.<br><br>Just the simple fact that you are "inside your home" doesn't necessarily<br>alleviate you of liability. Some states are very strict when it comes to<br>indecent exposure. Illinois has some very strict rules around this.<br><br>Colorado...slightly less so.<br><br>Colorado's indecent exposure and public indecency laws center around<br>*lewd behavior*, not just simple exposure. From the statute (C.R.S.<br>18--7--301 and 302):<br><br>> *Public Indecency*: When a person, in a public place in view of<br>> others, does any of the following:<br>><br>> - Has sex<br>> - Exposes one\'s intimate parts except for genitals (i.e. the anus,<br>>   perineum, pubes, or breasts) in a lewd manner, if done to arouse a<br>>   sexual desire in anyone<br>> - Fondles or caresses another\'s body in a lewd manner<br>> - Knowingly exposes one\'s genitals to another person in a way likely<br>>   to alarm or offend the person<br>><br>> *Indecent Exposure*: When a person does any of the following:<br>><br>> - Knowingly exposes one\'s genitals in view of another in a way likely<br>>   to cause alarm or offend with the intent to arouse or to satisfy the<br>>   sexual desires of anyone<br>> - Knowingly masturbates (real or simulated touching or rubbing one\'s<br>>   genitals or pubic area for sexual gratification whether covered or<br>>   exposed) in view of others in a manner likely to alarm or offend<br>>   them\[1\](#FczHa){#cite-FczHa .citation_link}<br><br>You can be naked in public in Colorado. What you *cannot* do is<br>expose yourself in a lewd manner, or in a way which would be deemed to<br>arouse sexual desire in anyone. Clearly from the statute, this is<br>different from simply being in a state of undress.<br><br>I think if you're in your home, you should at least try to avoid issues<br>by staying away from uncovered windows and maybe closing the blinds so<br>as not to cause issues. But legally, you have to be doing something<br>lewd, or exposing yourself in a lewd manner, in order to be eligible to<br>be charged under this statute.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-FczHa){.citation_index} [[Colorado Indecent Exposure<br>Laws](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=feb62d&url=http://statelaws.findlaw.com/colorado-law/colorado-indecent-exposure-laws.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="findlaw.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
