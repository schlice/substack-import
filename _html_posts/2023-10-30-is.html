<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Wait, I see an error in your question there...let me fix it for you.<br><br>**Is Senator Tommy Tuberville right that servicemembers should not use<br>taxpayer dollars to fund abortion services, or use taxpayer dollars to<br>fund travel to receive abortion services in another state? What effect<br>will that have on the recruitment of women into the service?**<br><br>There. Fixed. I may have even removed some of the condescending tone<br>from it. Sorry if you didn't mean to do that.<br><br>Anyway, let's answer the revised question. Yes, Senator Tuberville is<br>right. No one else can use taxpayer dollars to pay for abortion, and no<br>one else can use taxpayer dollars to fund travel to receive abortion<br>services, *because it is illegal*. The Hyde Amendment has been<br>appended to Congressional appropriations bills for over 40 years and has<br>been repeatedly approved by both Republican and Democrat Congresses. It<br>basically says that taxpayer dollars cannot be used to fund abortion<br>services. Initially, the Hyde Amendment only affected funding for<br>abortions under Medicaid, a state and federal health program for<br>low-income individuals. Because Congress reauthorizes the Hyde Amendment<br>annually as an attachment to the appropriations bill for HHS, it also<br>restricts abortion funding under the Indian Health Service, Medicare,<br>and the Children's Health Insurance Program. Over the years, language<br>similar to that in the Hyde Amendment has been incorporated into a range<br>of other federal programs that provide or pay for health services to<br>women including: the military's TRICARE program, federal prisons, the<br>Peace Corps, and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The<br>Affordable Care Act (ACA) also included a provision that applied similar<br>abortion coverage limitations to plans that are sold through the<br>Marketplace for women who receive federal income-based subsidies to<br>purchase private health insurance.<br><br>But in a shocking move, the Pentagon decided, through a policy change,<br>to allow servicemembers to use military "Space-A" travel to fly to<br>abortion-friendly states to receive abortion services, and that the<br>military would reimburse them for their trip expenses. This policy is,<br>admittedly and clearly, a violation of Federal law, and apparently no<br>one cares.<br><br>Well, no one except Senator Tuberville.<br><br>I'd like to say that what he's doing is Constitutional, but it is not.<br>The "hold" process he has placed on military promotions isn't really<br>supposed to be used in the way he is using it. If he has an objection to<br>a Pentagon policy, he can introduce legislation to clarify or alter any<br>law, encourage judicial resolution, or even run for president himself.<br>But he must abide by his constitutional oath.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
