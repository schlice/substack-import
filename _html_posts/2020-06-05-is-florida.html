<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is Florida\'s suggested shooting of rioters who break into houses<br>constitutionally acceptable?**<br><br>Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said that there is a difference between a<br>protester and a rioter. One is legally exercising his First Amendment<br>rights, and the other is a criminal.<br><br>Florida has a *very* strong Castle Doctrine. Florida law states<br>*unequivocally* that a criminal who forcibly enters or intrudes into<br>your home or occupied vehicle is, *by law*, presumed to be there to<br>cause death or great bodily harm. Therefore, a person may use any manner<br>of force, including deadly force, against that criminal.<br><br>Since that person is breaking into my house to either kill me or do me<br>great bodily harm (or burn my house, which would also do the same), I<br>can use whatever force I choose, up to and including deadly force, to<br>stop them.<br><br>My ability to protect my own life and the lives of my family members is<br>most certainly acceptable under the Constitution, which guarantees me<br>the right to life, and to not have my life unlawfully removed from me.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
