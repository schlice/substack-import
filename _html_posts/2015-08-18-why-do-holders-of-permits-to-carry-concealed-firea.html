<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If I want it known that I am armed, I will open carry.<br>Then you can take one look at me and know that I am armed. I don\'t need<br>a permit for that in my state.\<br>\<br>If I *don\'t* want it known that I am armed, I will conceal. And<br>I\'m good at it. I have not yet been identified by anyone as a concealed<br>carrier. Even in situations where my gun has inadvertently \"printed\"<br>(i.e. shown through my clothing), I wasn\'t ever identified as a<br>concealed carrier.\<br>\<br>And that\'s the point.\<br>\<br>Concealed carry, as has already been pointed out several times here, is<br>exactly that: concealed. The only time you should ever know that I\'m<br>carrying is when I tell you. Other than that, it\'s a secret. It\'s<br>supposed to be.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
