<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There isn't a "best" way. There are ways, and some of them are more<br>intrusive and adversarial than others. ideally, the best way is for the<br>Board to respond. But failing that, there are ways to force them to<br>respond.<br><br>The first (and arguably, the most amenable) way to do it is to get a<br>group of neighbors together to address the Board. Send certified letters<br>so you know they received them. Remind them that they have a fiduciary<br>duty to respond to homeowners. The Board should have periodic meetings<br>that they are required to hold, and those meetings should be open to<br>homeowners. Find out when those meetings are, and attend those meetings<br>to get your concerns heard. If those meetings are not being held, the<br>HOA may be facing some other legal challenges.<br><br>If you still don't get any response, you can engage an attorney who can<br>compel the HOA to respond. As I mentioned, the HOA has a fiduciary<br>responsibility to respond to homeowners, and failing to respond is an<br>abrogation of that duty.<br><br>Continued failure to respond could result in steps being taken to remove<br>the Board. The details of those legal operations differ by state, as<br>well as the rules laid out in the Governing Documents. Your attorney can<br>help you navigate those operations should you need to implement them.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What is the best way to deal with a neighborhood association board that<br>is unresponsive?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
