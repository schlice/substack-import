<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How many prophecies were fulfilled from the time Jesus was born till<br>His ascension?**<br><br>The best estimate I've seen is somewhere between 61 and 108, depending<br>on what you count as a prophecy in the Old Testament. And that's<br>certainly something. The probability of that happening at all is<br>astounding.<br><br>But what makes it a statistical impossibility (unless it is true) is<br>that all of them were fulfilled *in the life of one person*. For<br>someone doubting Jesus being the fulfillment of the prophecies, they<br>would have to show that it is at least statistically possible that all<br>of those prophecies could at least accidentally be fulfilled in one<br>person's lifetime.<br><br>Statistics shows us that this is a statistical impossibility.<br><br>> When forensic scientists discover a DNA profile match, the odds of<br>> having the wrong person is frequently less than one in several billion<br>> (something for deviants to keep in mind). It would seem we are in the<br>> same neighborhood of odds, and numbers of zeros, in considering a<br>> single individual fulfilling these prophecies.<br>><br>> Professor of mathematics Peter Stoner gave 600 students a math<br>> probability problem that would determine the odds for one person<br>> fulfilling eight specific prophecies. (This is not the same as<br>> flipping a coin eight times in a row and getting heads each time.)<br>> First the students calculated the odds of one person fulfilling all<br>> the conditions of one specific prophecy, such as being betrayed by a<br>> friend for 30 pieces of silver. Then the students did their best to<br>> estimate the odds for all of the eight prophecies combined.<br>><br>> The students calculated that the odds against one person fulfilling<br>> all eight prophecies are astronomical-one in ten to the 21st power<br>> (10²¹). To illustrate that number, Stoner gave the following example:<br>> "First, blanket the entire Earth land mass with silver dollars 120<br>> feet high. Second, specially mark one of those dollars and randomly<br>> bury it. Third, ask a person to travel the Earth and select the marked<br>> dollar, while blindfolded, from the trillions of other<br>> dollars."\[1\](#TRzfV){#cite-TRzfV .citation_link}<br><br>Here's a list of Stoner's eight:<br><br>> 1.  The Messiah will be born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2).\<br>>     The average population of Bethlehem from the time of Micah to the<br>>     present (1958) divided by the average population of the earth<br>>     during the same period = 7,150/2,000,000,000 or \[math\2.8 x<br>>     10\^5\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br>> 2.  A messenger will prepare the way for the Messiah (Malachi 3:1).\<br>>     One man in how many, the world over, has had a forerunner (in this<br>>     case, John the Baptist) to prepare his way?\<br>>     Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or \[math\1 ×<br>>     10\^3\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br>> 3.  The Messiah will enter Jerusalem as a king riding on a donkey<br>>     (Zechariah 9:9).\<br>>     One man in how many, who has entered Jerusalem as a ruler, has<br>>     entered riding on a donkey?\<br>>     Estimate: 1 in 100 or \[math\1 × 10\^2\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br>> 4.  The Messiah will be betrayed by a friend and suffer wounds in His<br>>     hands (Zechariah 13:6).\<br>>     One man in how many, the world over, has been betrayed by a<br>>     friend, resulting in wounds in his hands?\<br>>     Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or \[math\1 ×<br>>     10\^3\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br>> 5.  The Messiah will be betrayed for 30 pieces of silver (Zechariah<br>>     11:12).\<br>>     Of the people who have been betrayed, one in how many has been<br>>     betrayed for exactly 30 pieces of silver?\<br>>     Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or \[math\1 ×<br>>     10\^3\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br>> 6.  The betrayal money will be used to purchase a potter's field<br>>     (Zechariah 11:13).\<br>>     One man in how many, after receiving a bribe for the betrayal of a<br>>     friend, has returned the money, had it refused, and then<br>>     experienced it being used to buy a potter's field?\<br>>     Estimate: 1 in 100,000 or \[math\1 ×<br>>     10\^5\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br>> 7.  The Messiah will remain silent while He is afflicted (Isaiah<br>>     53:7).\<br>>     One man in how many, when he is oppressed and afflicted, though<br>>     innocent, will make no defense of himself?\<br>>     Estimate: 1 in 1,000 or \[math\1 ×<br>>     10\^3\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br>> 8.  The Messiah will die by having His hands and feet pierced (Psalm<br>>     22:16).\<br>>     One man in how many, since the time of David, has been crucified?\<br>>     Estimate: 1 in 10,000 or \[math\1 ×<br>>     10\^4\/math\]{.render_latex}.<br>><br>> Multiplying all these probabilities together produces a number<br>> (rounded off) of 1 × 10²⁸. Dividing this number by an estimate of the<br>> number of people who have lived since the time of these prophecies (88<br>> billion) produces a probability of all 8 prophecies being fulfilled<br>> accidently in the life of one person. That probability is 1 in 10¹⁷ or<br>> 1 in 100,000,000,000,000,000. That's one in one hundred<br>> quadrillion\!\[2\](#rJZib){#cite-rJZib .citation_link}<br><br>And those "virtually impossible odds?" The odds of *all of those<br>prophecies being accidentally fulfilled in the life of one person* is so<br>astronomically high, that it is improbable to believe that it could<br>actually happen. Once you hit 48 prophecies being accidentally fulfilled<br>in one person's life, the odds are one in 10¹⁴⁷. Lee Strobel, the famous<br>former atheist turned pastor, estimated in his book *The Case For Faith*<br>that the probability of all 108 being fulfilled in the life of one<br>person is "one chance in a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion,<br>trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion,<br>trillion, trillion."<br><br>The number is so large that it effectively approaches infinity. This<br>means that it is a functionally statistical impossibility to be an<br>accident. To that end, if it did happen as the Bible said it did, it<br>must be true.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-TRzfV){.citation_index} [[What are the Odds? -<br>Y-Jesus.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6a11f2&url=https://y-jesus.com/what-are-the-odds/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="y-jesus.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-rJZib){.citation_index} [[Applying the Science of<br>Probability to the<br>Scriptures](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1bddff&url=https://christinprophecy.org/articles/applying-the-science-of-probability-to-the-scriptures/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="christinprophecy.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
