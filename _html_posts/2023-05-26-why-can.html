<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's not a system of *fairness*. It's a system of *justice*.<br><br>Did your friend who became a felon simply because he had no money to pay<br>child support try to work with the court and/or opposing counsel to work<br>out a payment plan? Or did he claim IFC (indigence for costs)? Did he<br>declare bankruptcy?<br><br>If he did not do any of these things, then it's likely that he still had<br>the ability to pay, but chose not to. Did he have a \$1000 cell phone in<br>his pocket? Probably. Did he own a car? Probably. Did he have enough<br>money to pay for rent? Maybe. But it's likely he has money, but he's<br>spending it in the wrong places.<br><br>He probably didn't claim IFC because he's not indigent. If he would have<br>claimed indigence, he would have not become a felon. You can't get blood<br>from a turnip; if you truly have no money, you can file for bankruptcy<br>or claim IFC and you won't be charged with felony failure to pay child<br>support.<br><br>Is it *fair*? No, it definitely is not fair. But is is *just*? The court<br>seems to think so.<br><br>\<br><br>THAT SAID, I still support non-violent felons not losing their 2nd<br>Amendment rights. We paint too broad a brush when we say that all felons<br>lose their 2nd Amendment rights.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
