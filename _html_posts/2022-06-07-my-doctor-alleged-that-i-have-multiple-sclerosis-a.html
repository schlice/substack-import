<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If your doctor has offered a preliminary diagnosis (not an allegation),<br>it will need to be confirmed through testing.<br><br>The main piece of diagnostic equipment we use to diagnose MS is the MRI.<br>A positive MRI along with symptoms is enough to meet the [[McDonald<br>Criteria](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9cdf98&url=https://mstrust.org.uk/a-z/mcdonald-criteria){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="mstrust.org.uk"}]{.qlink_container} to diagnose you with MS.<br><br>The McDonald Criteria is important. This is the standard your<br>neurologist will use to guide you through the diagnosis of MS, and to<br>order the appropriate tests. The criteria was published in 2001 by<br>Professor Ian McDonald, and it has been extensively used and revised<br>several times. It was most recently updated in 2017 to reflect our<br>growing confidence in the MRI as a descriptive and predictive diagnostic<br>tool.<br><br>Your doctor will use other testing to add to the body of evidence:<br><br>- Potentially, a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) can be ordered to look for<br>  fragments of the damaged nerve material. The LP is not necessary in<br>  all situations, but if other tests come back inconclusive, the LP can<br>  be ordered.<br>- Blood tests will be ordered to rule out the other possible causes for<br>  little white spots on an MRI (generally called the "little white spot<br>  panel")<br>- Evoked Potential tests, particularly Visual Evoked Potential, in order<br>  to assess the damage to the optic nerve which can be caused by MS (if<br>  vision issues are one of your symptoms, like mine were)<br>- Plus, of course, a full neurological exam and a patient history will<br>  also be taken<br><br>One more note about your last question:<br><br>> Do I have a say on the type of testing I should be performed?<br><br>You always have a say on what happens to you. Your neurologist should be<br>telling you the types of tests you need to diagnose MS, and why you need<br>them. Where options are available, you should be given those options.<br>But healthcare is a *cooperation* between you and your doctor. It is not<br>"one-sided."<br><br>But trust your neurologist to order you the correct tests to properly<br>diagnose what's going on with you. Some tests (like the MRI) will be<br>crucial for your diagnosis. Other tests are not absolutely necessary,<br>but may be needed to aid your diagnosis. If you are ever unsure about a<br>test, ask. Ask your neurologist why you are being ordered to take that<br>test, and what they hope to see in the results of that test.<br><br>MS is a difficult, life-changing diagnosis. As such, you should always<br>feel free to seek second opinions if you are unsure about your<br>diagnosis. We're all in this together.<br><br>If it's MS, don't worry, it's not the end of the world. Your world will<br>change, but it will not end. Plus, there are whole communities of MS<br>patients and caregivers all over the world who can help you. Even right<br>here on Quora, the [[Multiple Sclerosis<br>Forum](https://multiplesclerosisforum.quora.com/)]{.qlink_container}<br>exists for exactly this reason.<br><br>Good luck to you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
