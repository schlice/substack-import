This benefit letter should have described what<br>benefits you are now entitled to being 50% disabled. If you don\'t have<br>an explanation of benefits, call your VA Regional Customer Service<br>Center.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
