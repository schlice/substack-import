<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Thanks for the A2A, but I\'m sorry, I have to agree with<br>the other posters.\<br>\<br>I\'ve had surgery. My quality of life is far better now than it was<br>before. \"A healthy person\" is a holistic definition, not defined by<br>the number of surgeries one has.\<br>\<br>And where would you rank elective surgery in this measuring? For some,<br>the nose on their face is the bane of their existence. Getting it<br>changed drastically improved their self-esteem, and thus their quality<br>of life. Would you consider them \"more\" or \"less\" healthy overall,<br>post-surgery?\<br>\<br>And your analogy of \"If something breaks and you fix it, it\'s not so<br>effective as it was before\" is also not true. Have you ever seen wood<br>glue? It\'s like white glue on steroids. It permanently bonds to the<br>fibers of the wood, and in actuality, once the glue dries, the glued<br>area is stronger than the surrounding wood.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
