Your original works are protected from<br>the moment you create them and record them in a place where others can<br>perceive them.<br><br>However, in order for that protection to be *recognized*, you must file<br>for a copyright. A fully-filed copyright is needed to initiate legal<br>actions against those who might try to duplicate your original works.<br><br>Take a look at the [[U.S. Copyright<br>Office](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=49661f&url=https://www.copyright.gov/index.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="copyright.gov"}]{.qlink_container} to find out how to<br>register a copyright.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
