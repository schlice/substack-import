<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How do you get around the whole Posse Comitatus Act?<br><br>Petition your Representatives to repeal it.<br><br>Otherwise, the military can't enforce civilian law. And I suspect that's<br>the way you'd like it. Because the military isn't designed to be local<br>law enforcement. I think you'd be much happier with your local chief of<br>police or sheriff than you would be with the Army batallion commander.<br><br>(EDIT) Another way to avoid Posse Comitatus is to follow the provisions<br>of the Insurrection Act. If the Governor went to the President and<br>claimed an insurrection was more than the fully-constituted National<br>Guard could handle, the President is authorized to commit troops to the<br>control of the Governor to quell the insurrection.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
