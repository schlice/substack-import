<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**At what point will the Republican leaders in the House and Senate<br>finally say this country is more important than their donors and the<br>Koch brothers and stop Trump?**<br><br>I think you're going to have to be a little bit more clear about what<br>exactly you think is going on in Washington.<br><br>- How are Representatives and Senators voting against the will of the<br>  voters and in line with "their donors and the Koch brothers?"<br>- What is Trump doing that "needs stopping" that Congress is failing to<br>  do?<br><br>Representatives and Senators should always be voting in their<br>constituents' best interests, or they may not get re-elected. I would<br>have though that would have been clear by this point, but I guess not:<br>if you don't vote in accordance with the will of the electorate, you<br>don't get re-elected. More to the point: if your representative or<br>Senator is not voting in the way you like, don't re-elect them.<br><br>I'm still curious what you think Trump is doing that needs stopping, or<br>what Trump can do without the support of Congress that similarly needs<br>stopping. Unemployment is at its lowest rate in over 5 decades. Black<br>and Hispanic unemployment is at its lowest rate, *ever*. Tax cuts<br>have created jobs and have put more money back in your pocket. Stifling<br>government regulations have been rolled back at an amazing rate, getting<br>government off of your back and allowing you to be more free. The<br>military is getting funding again so that they can continue to fight<br>both the Global War on Terror as well as other military campaigns<br>simultaneously. We are stopping terrorist from making their way onto our<br>shores to execute their terror plots. We are trying to enforce the<br>border, despite Democrats' best efforts to stop us. So I ask again: what<br>exactly is Trump doing that "needs to be stopped?"<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
