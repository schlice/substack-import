<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This memo was leaked by Kyle Seraphin, who was a special agent at the<br>bureau for six years before he was indefinitely suspended without pay in<br>June 2022. He published the document "Interest of Racially or Ethnically<br>Motivated Violent Extremists in Radical Traditionalist Catholic Ideology<br>Almost Certainly Presents New Mitigation Opportunities," on<br>[UncoverDC.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=366d6c&url=https://www.uncoverdc.com/2023/02/08/the-fbi-doubles-down-on-christians-and-white-supremacy-in-2023/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="uncoverdc.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>There are significant problems with this particular FBI work product.<br>The document warned against "radical traditionalist Catholic ideology,"<br>and claimed it "almost certainly presents new mitigation opportunities,"<br><br>In part, the document reads: "In making this assessment, FBI Richmond<br>relied on the key assumption that \[racially or ethnically motivated<br>extremists\] will continue to find \[radical-traditionalist Catholic or<br>RTC\] ideology attractive and will continue to attempt to connect with<br>RTC adherents, both virtually via social media and in-person at places<br>of worship,."<br><br>It adds that "RTCs are typically categorized by the rejection of the<br>Second Vatican Council (Vatican II) as a valid church council; disdain<br>for most of the popes elected since Vatican II, particularly Pope<br>Francis and Pope John Paul II; and frequent adherence to anti-Semitic,<br>anti-immigrant, anti-LGBTQ, and white supremacist ideology.<br>Radical-traditionalist Catholics compose a small minority of overall<br>Roman Catholic adherents and are separate and distinct from<br>'traditionalist Catholics' who prefer the Traditional Latin Mass and<br>pre-Vatican II teachings and traditions, without the more extremist<br>ideological beliefs and violent rhetoric."<br><br>One of the big problems I can see right away is that the definition of<br>an RTC is very broad. In fact, many non-Catholic sects could easily be<br>swept up in that definition since they, by default, reject the papacy,<br>and are often labeled as anti-LGBTQ because they adhere to traditional<br>Biblical views of marriage and sexuality.<br><br>The other big problem I have with the report: it relied heavily on<br>information from the Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization which<br>includes conservative nonprofit organizations like the Family Research<br>Council, Alliance Defending Freedom and the American College of<br>Pediatricians on its list of "hate groups" alongside groups like the Ku<br>Klux Klan and the Nation of Islam. Seraphin said that "a real<br>intelligence product would quote \SPLC\ and say, 'unsubstantiated.'"<br><br>He also said that if an intelligence product were to cite *Salon* (as<br>the leaked document does) it would need to cite a separate "source on<br>the other side." This document does not.<br><br>The FBI had previously excluded the SPLC from reports because "there was<br>no analytical rigor or basis for the majority of their assertions that<br>they would write about on their website" according to George Hill, a<br>former supervisory intelligence analyst.<br><br>Therefore, this memo feels like an attack on Christianity.<br>Again.\[1\](#gEbNo){#cite-gEbNo .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-gEbNo){.citation_index} [[The FBI Doubles Down on<br>Christians and White Supremacy in 2023 -<br>UncoverDC](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=366d6c&url=https://www.uncoverdc.com/2023/02/08/the-fbi-doubles-down-on-christians-and-white-supremacy-in-2023/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="uncoverdc.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
