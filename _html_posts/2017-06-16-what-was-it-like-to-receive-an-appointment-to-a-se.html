<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Each Member of Congress can have up to 5 appointed cadets in any one of<br>the service academies. Once one of them leaves for any reason, the slots<br>re-open and that Congressman can appoint more cadets.<br><br>In the year that I applied, my Congressman had two slots. There were<br>roughly 100 applicants. Which meant that I had a roughly 2% chance of<br>getting an appointment.<br><br>But I approached it in exactly the same way I approached everything<br>while going through the Academy entrance process. There were forms,<br>essays, and interviews. Interviews were conducted by a panel of people<br>at the Congressman's office. I got my nomination from [[Congressman<br>Norman F.<br>Lent](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9c0d08&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_F._Lent){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, who was our<br>representative at the time (New York's 5th Congressional District).<br><br>He announced his selections for appointment in a press conference at his<br>office on Long Island, which was also pretty cool.<br><br>I don't know how difficult it was for that team to make its choice. They<br>did have roughly 100 candidates to choose from. Was I a good candidate<br>by a little? A lot? I think that information may be lost to the ages.<br><br>I hope that answers your question. If there was something more specific<br>that you wanted to ask, please do.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
