<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is Trump killing his supporters by taking little action to slow the<br>spread of coronavirus? States with democratic leaders have largely taken<br>some or a lot of action against the virus while states with republican<br>leadership have largerly not.**<br><br>A few things.<br><br>1.  I'm not sure exactly how the virus distinguishes your political<br>    affiliation before it kills you. So if (and that's a big if) Trump<br>    did something which is affirmatively killing people, it would kill<br>    everyone regardless of who that person supports.<br>2.  Trump is President, not a King. There are a scant few actions he can<br>    take which states must do. I mean, he could direct the CDC to start<br>    bullying states to do things, but this isn't right either.\<br>    \<br>    I love the hypocrisy:\<br>    \<br>    DEMOCRATS: "Trump is actually a fascist dictator!"\<br>    \<br>    After Coronavirus hits:\<br>    \<br>    DEMOCRATS: "Why isn't Trump acting like more of a fascist dictator?"<br>3.  I also fail to see what "taking action" has to do with slowing the<br>    spread of the virus. As other answerers have noted, not all actions<br>    have been universally good. Allowing infected seniors to return to<br>    their nursing homes to spread the virus to others was terrible, but<br>    it still counts as "taking action." Sometimes, not "taking action"<br>    is better. It just depends on the action. Simply taking action for<br>    the sake of taking action could lead to disastrous consequences.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
