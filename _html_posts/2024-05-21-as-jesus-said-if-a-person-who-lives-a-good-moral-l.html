<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's take your two questions in order:<br><br>> **As Jesus said, if a person who lives a good, moral life dies without<br>> believing, will he go to hell?**<br><br>It's hard to believe that a "good person" might end up outside of the<br>gates of the Kingdom of God, and not be let in.<br><br>*Isn't it "good enough" to just be a good person?*<br><br>The Bible is clear: it is not "good enough" to just "be a good person."<br>If this were true, then we wouldn't need Jesus. We'd get into heaven all<br>by ourselves. It would be *our* efforts which saved us.<br><br>But this is absolutely not the case. There is nothing we can do to save<br>ourselves. In fact, without God's intervention, we are *dead* in our<br>sins.<br><br>> *As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which<br>> you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the<br>> ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in<br>> those who are disobedient. All of us also lived among them at one<br>> time, gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires<br>> and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath. But<br>> because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy,* <br>> *made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in<br>> transgressions---it is by grace you have been saved. --- Ephesians<br>> 2:1--5 NIV*<br><br>Can a dead man save himself? Nope. It is only through the grace of God<br>that we are saved. Without God, we are powerless to save ourselves. **It<br>is by grace that we are saved, not by our own works.** A little further<br>in Paul's letter to the Ephesians, he continues:<br><br>> *For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your<br>> own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no<br>> one may boast. --- Ephesians 2:8--9 NIV*<br><br>You are saved by grace, not your own works.<br><br>\<br><br>> **Will God, who tells those who slap you to turn the other cheek,<br>> respond to good people with evil?**<br><br>You are basically saying that it is evil for God to tell unbelievers<br>(who also lived a good life) that they cannot enter the Kingdom of<br>Heaven without believing.<br><br>But is it really *evil* though? If a person cannot be bothered to<br>worship God for an hour a week, would it be a kindness to bring them<br>into the Kingdom of Heaven where we will be worshipping God 24x7x365? To<br>an unbeliever, that actually sounds like torture. It would be cruel,<br>therefore, to impose such an eternity on to an unbeliever. It is<br>actually an act of mercy to exclude them from God's kingdom.<br><br>Even Jesus said that "good people who don't believe" won't be saved:<br><br>> *"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of<br>> heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in<br>> heaven. Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not<br>> prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your<br>> name perform many miracles?' Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never<br>> knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'" --- Matthew 7:21--23 NIV*<br><br>Those people did very good things. They drove out demons in Jesus' name.<br>They performed miracles in Jesus' name! They were *preachers!* They<br>prophesied in Jesus' name and proclaimed His Good News. They still<br>didn't go to heaven because they didn't repent and believe.<br><br>You'll probably be surprised at the number of pastors who end up in<br>hell. Or maybe you won't, I don't know.<br><br>The bottom line is you can't "do good" into heaven. You can only do<br>God's will to get into Heaven.<br><br>> *Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one<br>> comes to the Father except through me. --- John 14:6 NIV*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
