<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Hello [[Karanbir<br>Singh](https://www.quora.com/profile/Karanbir-Singh-3)]{.qlink_container},<br>thanks for this question.<br><br>You're in college, so let's put this in terms you should be able to<br>understand.<br><br>You're a good student. You study hard. You turn in all your assignments<br>on time. And you have a 4.0 GPA to show for it.<br><br>Your roommate loves to party. You've never seen him open a textbook. You<br>often see him return to your room early in the morning, drunk, and pass<br>out on his bed. He's barely surviving with a 2.0 GPA.<br><br>Now it comes time for graduation. The college says that, to be fair to<br>everyone, they are going to "redistribute" your grade points. To that<br>end, they will take one grade point from you and give it to your<br>roommate. There. You both have a 3.0 GPA now. Isn't that better? Isn't<br>it more fair now that you both have the same GPA?<br><br>But you're thinking, how exactly is this fair? I worked my *tail* off to<br>get that 4.0 GPA. He did basically *nothing* and we both come out with<br>the same result! This is entirely *not* fair at all!<br><br>That's wealth redistribution in a nutshell.<br><br>Wealth is determined by individual effort. Wealth redistribution turns<br>*individual effort* into a *group outcome*. This nation was not founded<br>on equality of outcome. This nation was founded on equality of<br>opportunity. And if you have equality of opportunity, your<br>wealth is determined by your *individual effort.* The more individual<br>effort you put in, the more you get out. *Quid pro quo.* Taking from<br>someone who earned more and giving it to someone else who did not is<br>Robin Hood-style theft. It may be for a good cause, but the ends do not<br>justify the means.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
