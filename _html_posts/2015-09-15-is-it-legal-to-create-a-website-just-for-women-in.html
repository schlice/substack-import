<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You can create a website for anyone you want in the United<br>States. You probably won\'t be able to prevent men from accessing it,<br>though. Even if you set up your policies so that only women could become<br>members and access certain content, you know, people *lie* online.\<br>\<br>You can certainly create content specifically tailored for women and<br>things that are of importance to women more than men. There are several<br>such websites currently in operation today.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
