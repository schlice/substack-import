<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We'll chop the question down to the two actual questions.<br><br>**How would you explain to a person that doesn\'t live in the US the<br>need to have so many guns?**<br><br>I'll explain it using things you might understand by changing the<br>wording just a little.<br><br>**How would you explain to a person that doesn\'t live in the US the<br>need to have so many pairs of shoes?**<br><br>Well, I have some shoes for hiking, and some shoes for running. I have<br>one specialized pair of shoes that attach to the pedals of my road<br>racing bicycle, and I certainly can't use those when I hike. I have one<br>pair of shoes when I play the organ (actually, I do have one of those).<br>I also have some specialized water shoes, and some sandals. I have a<br>pair of waterproof flip flops that I wear in the shower at the gym<br>because I don't trust how they clean the floors in there.<br><br>As for guns (not shoes), I have a long gun for plinking. I have an air<br>rifle which I can legally shoot within city limits for scaring the<br>woodpeckers off of the top of my home since I can't legally kill them. I<br>have a rifle for home defense. I have a pistol for concealed carry. I<br>have a pistol for open carry. I have a pistol for home defense. So<br>that's five firearms and one air rifle, and that's just the baseline of<br>guns that I feel you'd *need,* let alone the ones you want just because.<br><br>\W\hy do people need AR-15s and similar guns?<br><br>The AR-style platform is literally the most popular gun in America. It<br>is lightweight, accurate, and easy to modify. There are mod kits to do<br>literally anything you want with it for any use case. It's easy to<br>clean, easy to break down, and easy to shoot.<br><br>\<br><br>But to be fair, just as I don't need to explain why I need so many pairs<br>of shoes, I don't need to explain why I need so many guns. I'm legally<br>allowed to buy them, so I do. I don't have to justify my purchases to<br>anyone.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
