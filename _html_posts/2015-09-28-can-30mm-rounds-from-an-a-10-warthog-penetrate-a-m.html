<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Since most modern-day bank vaults are made from<br>steel-reinforced concrete, I would say that it would be close. The<br>PGU-14 depleted uranium projectiles fired by the GAU-8 cannon might<br>penetrate the walls of a modern bank vault.\<br>\<br>Modern bank vaults are made from steel-reinforced concrete. The concrete<br>is extremely strong, but it is thin, usually only about three inches<br>thick, but it uses steel-reinforcement and special additives to make the<br>concrete extremely strong. It\'s roughly 10 times stronger than the<br>18-inch thick concrete that used to be used to make bank vaults.\<br>\<br>PGU-14 rounds will penetrate anywhere from 55 to 75 mm of hardened<br>steel\<br>\<br>So it\'s close.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
