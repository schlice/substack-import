<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you use Verizon 5G Home instead of a home internet service<br>provider, such as Spectrum?**<br><br>Verizon 5G Home is, specifically, home internet service. It is designed<br>to replace your traditional home internet service provider (ISP). It's<br>all pretty pie-in-the-sky on their website, as it is currently in a<br>limited-availability rollout, As of today (6 Dec 2018), the service is<br>only available in Los Angeles, Sacramento, Houston, and Indianapolis.<br>They are offering free equipment rental, free service for the first<br>three months, free upgrades, and no data caps. Speeds are supposed to be<br>around 300 Mbps. For comparison, I have Xfinity (cable) and I pull<br>around 175 Mbps down.<br><br>[http://speedtest.xfinity.com/res\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c527fb&url=http://speedtest.xfinity.com/results/JPCU9MHER51VXTK){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="xfinity.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Pricing is currently set at a fixed \$70/mo if you're not a Verizon<br>Wireless customer, and \$50/mo if you have at least one line of Verizon<br>Wireless (mobile smartphone) service on your account. It has to be a<br>minimum of a \$30/mo mobile plan, and data-only plans do not count. So<br>if you're already rocking a Verizon smartphone, you could get this<br>wireless home internet service for an added \$50/mo, and no data caps,<br>and speeds which purportedly are double what you can achieve with<br>traditional cable.<br><br>It will be interesting to see if this can scale and if they can actually<br>deliver the speeds and the bandwidth they promise.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
