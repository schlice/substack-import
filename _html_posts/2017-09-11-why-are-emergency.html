<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Your understanding of learned irrelevance appears to be flawed.<br><br>In rat models, when a tone and a shock were repeatedly administered, the<br>rat developed a learned irrelevance to anything other than a tone and a<br>shock. The rat was less able to develop a light-then-shock association<br>because of the learned irrelevance.<br><br>This does not directly correlate to the inability to use recalled data<br>in the event of an emergency. Simply seeing a sign repeatedly does not<br>make the sign irrelevant. This is not the definition of learned<br>irrelevance. Learned irrelevance related to the correlation of a<br>predicted and predictor stimuli, not a single stimulus over time.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
