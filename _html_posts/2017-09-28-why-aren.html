<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are several reasons.<br><br>1.  Bandwidth. That's a lot of image traffic flowing over wireless<br>    networks.<br>2.  Manpower. Monitoring video feeds is very manpower intensive.<br>3.  Return on investment. Very few situations, if any at all, that<br>    require immediate assistance are *not* reported by the officer. The<br>    officers usually do a very good job letting dispatchers know that<br>    they need help. So monitoring dashcams live doesn't get help to them<br>    any faster.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
