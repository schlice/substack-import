<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [I think it\'s pretty clear that the father won\'t be<br/>charged with a crime, since he was in the act of self defense.\<br/>\<br/>Sadly, if you watch the state of affairs of the US legal system, the<br/>rapist may have a civil claim against the father for using unreasonable<br/>force to stop him. That, too, would be an uphill battle for the rapist,<br/>but we\'ve seen burglars sue the homeowners of the houses they were<br/>robbing for the injuries they sustained while in the commission of their<br/>crimes, so it\'s not uncommon to see this kind of thing in court. And in<br/>rare cases, they win.\<br/>\<br/>The rapist would argue exactly what most people here are arguing: the<br/>father used more force than was necessary to stop him from committing<br/>his illegal act. The extra force was excessive, and he should be held to<br/>account for that.\<br/>\<br/>The father would argue \"heat of the moment\" or \"heat of passion\" in<br/>the protection of his child. It\'s the same motivation that drives<br/>voluntary manslaughter, where crimes are so disgusting that the<br/>retaliation tends to be swift, immediate, and generally more than what<br/>is minimally necessary. Like killing the guy you catch in bed with your<br/>wife and not raping her.\<br/>\<br/>The judge would have a very hard time finding the point at which the end<br/>of the crime happened and the unlawful beating started. I still think<br/>the rapist would have a tough row to hoe.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
