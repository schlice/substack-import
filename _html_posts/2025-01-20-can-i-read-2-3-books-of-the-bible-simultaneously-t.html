<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is no "right way" to read the Bible.<br><br>- You can read the Bible cover to cover.<br>- You can read two or three books at a time.<br>- You can read one book at a time.<br>- You can even read one *verse* at a time.<br><br>The important part is that *you're getting into the Word daily!*<br><br>So long as you are daily getting in to the Word, and praying through<br>your reading, you are doing WAY better than many people who call<br>themselves Christian.<br><br>If you like, [[the Bible<br>app](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=89cdcd&url=https://www.bible.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bible.com"}]{.qlink_container} has a "Verse of the Day" you<br>can use to get into a single verse a day, and to pray through it. It<br>helps to develop the habit of getting in to the Word every single day.<br><br>Get after it, every day!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
