In some<br>cases, it does.<br><br>That said, MS lesions do not frequently impact long term memory. They<br>most frequently impact the ability of short term memory to function<br>well. However, since everyone's MS is different, and in some cases, MS<br>can impact long term memory, if that happens, it can actually alter your<br>personality.<br><br>Whether it's for the "better" or for the "worse" is a matter of opinion.<br>But it can alter personality.<br><br>(Source: me)<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
