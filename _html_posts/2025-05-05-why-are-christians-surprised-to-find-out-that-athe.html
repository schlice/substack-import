<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Atheists would not be "members" of the church. They may attend, listen<br>to the music and the message, enjoy some free coffee and donuts, spend<br>some time with some truly wonderful and kind people, but they cannot be<br>"members" because they do not share the church's beliefs.<br><br>Membership in a Christian church is not automatic. It is not something<br>you inherit from your family. **Membership involves an affirmative,<br>personal step, which includes assenting to a belief statement.** That<br>means they sign a document which states that they believe in the same<br>things the church believes. There's nothing wrong with this, either.<br>Anyone is welcome to attend, but only those who believe as the church<br>does will be admitted as *members*. The atheist may attend as often as<br>he likes as a *guest*, but won't be a *member*.<br><br>So yes, a Christian would be surprised to find an atheist as a member,<br>because they would have had to sign the belief statement under false<br>pretenses, and it simply doesn't make sense for an atheist to join a<br>church as a member when the atheist affirmatively doesn't believe<br>anything the church does.<br><br>\<br><br>(EDIT) Sometimes, when you answer a question, it takes the comments to<br>steer the conversation in a particular direction.<br><br>So it seems that when some people read this question, they believe that<br>some atheists joined the church as children, no longer believe, but<br>continue to attend church because it would be embarrassing personally to<br>leave the church, and may even cost them friendships. One commenter said<br>that a person admitting he no longer believed "could get threats, be<br>shunned, lose all his friends, even job and family might be on the<br>line."<br><br>I don't know the culture of religion around the world. If you live in a<br>culture where you are shunned for having a belief which is not shared by<br>others, I feel for you. That must be a terrible way to live.<br><br>I can't speak to those issues. I can only speak to Christianity in the<br>United States. If such a person were here, present in the US, I would<br>recommend they talk to their pastor about their concerns. But I can<br>understand that some people may feel uncomfortable doing that. You are<br>welcome to live your life in whatever way you choose, including<br>attending a church whose beliefs you affirmatively reject. I suppose you<br>can just think of it as a cool social club with coffee and donuts. I<br>would recommend not telling anyone that you don't believe. You wouldn't<br>want to out yourself, and you wouldn't want to dissuade anyone else from<br>their belief, would you?<br><br>So I guess if you're a closeted atheist, you should stay in the closet.<br>But do keep going. Maybe you'll hear something that may change your<br>mind.<br><br>\<br><br>(EDIT 2) So can you join a church and not be a believer? Of course you<br>can! Either you do so intentionally, knowing that you are not a<br>believer, or you do so unintentionally, *thinking* that you are a<br>believer but you are not.<br><br>What the comments section is telling me is that people do this<br>unintentionally. They join the church, but then they stop loving God.<br><br>The Bible tells us that for believers, *this does not happen.* The Bible<br>says that when you are saved, God changes you. He replaces your heart of<br>stone with a heart of flesh. Right, we knew that. It's a process called<br>*regeneration*. In fact, no one comes to God unless God has<br>*already* done that work in him.<br><br>> *No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I<br>> will raise him up on the last day. \-- John 6:44 ESV*<br><br>Also, we see it in Ephesians 2, although more subtly:<br><br>> *And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once<br>> walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of<br>> the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of<br>> disobedience---among whom we all once lived in the passions of our<br>> flesh, carrying out the desires of the flesh and the mind, and were by<br>> nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. \-- Ephesians<br>> 2:1--3 ESV*<br><br>See that? You were dead in your sins. Can you save yourself if you<br>are already dead? No, you can't.<br><br>So God regenerates you, gives you a new heart. Salvation includes \"the<br>washing of regeneration.\" This refers to the spiritual cleansing which<br>takes place when a person accepts Christ in salvation. At that moment, a<br>person\'s life is \"regenerated,\" or \"made new.\" The Holy Spirit<br>renews our lives when we come to faith in Christ.<br><br>Awesome. *But crucially, this new heart is only capable of loving God.<br>It is incapable of not loving God.*<br><br>So if a "believer" "falls away" from loving God, *were they ever really<br>regenerated in the first place?*<br><br>This is a valid question. Can someone who has been saved "fall out of<br>love" for God?<br><br>If you believe the Bible, the answer is no.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
