If it was that easy, there<br>would only be one religion, because it would be blatantly obvious which<br>one was the true religion.<br><br>Every person, who holds any particular faith, always says the same<br>thing: my religion is the only religion, and every other religion is<br>false. No one says anything otherwise, or else their faith is<br>meaningless. Even the atheists can be considered to be a religion,<br>because they behave in exactly the same way. They believe that their way<br>is the only right way, and everybody else is wrong.<br><br>As long as there is freedom of opinion, there will always be more than<br>one religion.<br><br>That said, I will tell you one thing that you can use to help you<br>determine for yourself how you should believe.<br><br>All world religions, except one, involve you seeking God. One religion,<br>only one, involves God seeking you.<br><br>All of world religions, except one, involve you doing something to gain<br>your salvation. One religion, only one, offers you your salvation<br>freely, as a gift that\'s already been paid for. All you have to do is<br>accept it. You don\'t have to do anything special in order to get it.<br><br>That one religion, so unique amongst all of the world\'s religions,<br>might be something worth looking into.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How can I tell which religion is the true religion, since the existence<br>of one religion nullifies the validity of the other?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
