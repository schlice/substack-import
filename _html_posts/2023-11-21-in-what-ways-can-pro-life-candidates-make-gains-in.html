<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>They need to not shy away from it.<br><br>While I'm not Ronna McDaniel's biggest fan, she's not wrong on the<br>pro-life issue, and what Republican candidates need to do to win.<br><br>> "We ... have to define ourselves before the Democrats define us,"<br>> Ronna explained on NBC. "And this is my number one message. If you're<br>> digging yourself out of a hole, you're going to lose. But if you go on<br>> TV and you say to the American people, 'Listen, we all are passionate<br>> about this issue and it's confusing right now, but in a time of<br>> consensus, can't we agree on reasonable limitations at 15 weeks when a<br>> baby feels pain?'"<br>><br>> She reiterated that position to \Tony\ Perkins, \[President of<br>> Family Research Council,\] insisting, "We shouldn't be silent. Listen,<br>> we're proud to be a party that stands for the unborn. And I think<br>> coming out of Roe, after 50 years of ... people not having to navigate<br>> this issue, it's really important that we define ourselves before the<br>> Democrats do. Let's talk about pregnancy \care\ centers. Let's talk<br>> about getting rid of cumbersome regulation to adoption. But let's also<br>> put the Democrats on the defense because they stand for late-term<br>> abortion. They stand for gender-selection abortion."<br>><br>> It's time to say to them, McDaniel urged, "'Won't you agree that when<br>> a baby feels pain, when a baby can physically feel its life being<br>> taken away from them, that that is a bridge too far?' And they won't<br>> meet us even there. They are the extreme on this issue. And when you<br>> say that to the voters, we win."\[1\](#pqeNH){#cite-pqeNH<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>When Republicans go front and center and highlight the extremism of the<br>Democrat platform, they win, every time. When they obfuscate and shy<br>away from it, they allow Democrats to define them as "anti-woman" and in<br>favor of women as nothing more than "baby factories."<br><br>Candidates need to get out in front of the issue and define themselves.<br>That's what voters want.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-pqeNH){.citation_index} [[RNC Chair: If Republicans Want<br>to Win, 'We Can't Be Silent on<br>Life'](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=113ae5&url=https://washingtonstand.com/commentary/rnc-chair-if-republicans-want-to-win-we-cant-be-silent-on-life){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="washingtonstand.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
