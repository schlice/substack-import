<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You may be able to learn some of the visual cues using<br>flight simulator software, but without a force-feedback yoke you\'ll be<br>missing out on absolutely all of the feeling that the controls provide<br>when you fly.\<br>\<br>And you\'ll also miss out on all the \"seat of your pants\" flying that<br>only real flight can provide. Once you start flying into thermals and<br>the plane starts reacting in ways that the software doesn\'t teach you,<br>you\'ll understand that you can only gain that experience actually in a<br>seat in an airplane.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
