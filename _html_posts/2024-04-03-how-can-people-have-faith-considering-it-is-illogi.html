<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The evidence is abundant. The rub is that people who demand evidence<br>usually won't accept the evidence that is provided to them.<br><br>First, "concrete evidence" of an immaterial God is illogical and is<br>self-defeating. It's like trying to use a metal detector to find a<br>plastic cup. In other words, you're never going to see God's footprint<br>or find one of God's hairs, because those things simply don't exist.<br><br>Secondly, if, when you say "evidence," you mean "scientific findings<br>following empirical testing using the scientific method," that also<br>wouldn't make sense. There are plenty of things that science can't<br>prove, but we're all rational to believe. For example:<br><br>1.  Math and logic. Science can't prove them, because science<br>    presupposes them.<br>2.  Metaphysical truths, such as there are minds that exist outside of<br>    my own.<br>3.  Moral judgements. Science can't prove that the Nazis were evil.<br>4.  Aesthetic judgements. The beautiful, like the good, can't be proven<br>    by science.\<br>    \<br>    And surprisingly,<br>5.  Science itself. The belief that the scientific method accurately<br>    discovers truth itself can't be proven by the scientific method.<br><br>You may be able to use logic or reason to gain enough "evidence" to<br>believe something, even if science can't prove it.<br><br>Be careful relying on science when science itself can't be proven by<br>science.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
