<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The telephone was invented in the United States by<br>[[Alexander Graham<br>Bell](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=53c2e3&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. The modern-day phone<br>system started in the United States, and spread to the rest of the<br>world.\<br>\<br>It only makes sense that the country with the largest density of phones<br>would not need an international calling prefix. *Other* countries would<br>need one.\<br>\<br>More specifically, when international calling was introduced (after the<br>introduction and popularization of the telephone in America), it was<br>United States systems that were routing to overseas locations. We needed<br>country codes to identify other countries.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
