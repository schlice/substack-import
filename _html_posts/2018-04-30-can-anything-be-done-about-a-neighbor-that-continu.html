<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can anything be done about a neighbor that continually keeps calling<br>the cops on me? My dog sits in my yard while I do exercises on my porch,<br>cops get called. Nothing happens, they say it\'s okay if the owner is<br>outside.**<br><br>The calling of police is between the police and the caller. You are not<br>affected, and if you are not in violation of any laws or city<br>ordinances, it's literally none of your business. It's annoying, but<br>it's not your concern.<br><br>Eventually, the police will get wise to this person and will no longer<br>respond to "loose dog" complaints from that address.<br><br>If the police do not get wise within a timely manner, you might consider<br>filing a complaint at the police station, and complain that the police<br>are not addressing the behavior. Abusing the 911 system is a crime in<br>most locations, and they have to see that his pattern of behavior is<br>abusive.<br><br>You could also consider a harassment lawsuit if you were so inclined.<br>You might even check with a lawyer about doing so. But bear in mind that<br>if you and your neighbor were friends (which I doubt if he's calling the<br>police about your behavior), be prepared for that relationship to be<br>unrecoverable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
