<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Since I'm assuming you are not talking about what they "said" in the<br>Constitution, let's look at everything that is *not* the Constitution,<br>such as the Federalist Papers, the Articles of Confederation, state<br>constitutions, and usage in the early republic.<br><br>I would refer you to [[this<br>paper](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0140f0&url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id%3D3487898){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ssrn.com"}]{.qlink_container} which is pretty comprehensive<br>on the topic.<br><br>In a nutshell, when the framers talked about "emoluments," they were<br>looking specifically at the salary and benefits derived from holding a<br>government office. **The term was specifically not applied to profits<br>related to non-government business or investments.**<br><br>It would be challenging to think that non-government business or<br>investments should be included in that definition, because that would<br>mean that any president who ever invested in any company which did<br>business with the government would be in violation of the clause.<br>Additionally, the emoluments clause doesn't just apply to the president,<br>but to every member of Congress, and indeed, every Federal "office of<br>profit or trust." That means that every one of them who invests or does<br>business with any company which also does business with a foreign<br>government would be in violation of the clause.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What did the Founding Fathers say about the Emoluments Clause?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
