<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Many people receive incorrect diagnoses at first.<br><br>MS is a diagnosis of exclusion, because there is no one symptom which<br>definitively proves you have MS. Every sign and symptom of MS can appear<br>with other diseases and conditions. Therefore, you must exclude every<br>other disease which can cause those signs and symptoms. MS is known as<br>"The Great Imitator" for exactly this reason.<br><br>For example, when I got my first MRI, which showed lesions on my brain,<br>my neurologist performed a "little white spot panel" on my blood, ruling<br>out a variety of diseases which can cause white spots on an MRI. My MRI<br>plus my symptoms were enough to diagnose MS.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
