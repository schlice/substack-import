<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I have seen police cars ride with fire trucks with their<br>lights and siren on and I have watched them pull drivers over for<br>failing to yield to emergency vehicles. This had been an issue here a<br>few years back. It became less of an issue when the police started<br>cracking down on it.\<br>\<br>And in your hypothetical, it would not be entrapment. The officer is not<br>offering for someone to break the law. They merely set the conditions<br>for someone to break the law. They neither encourage nor suggest that<br>someone should break the law, so entrapment does not<br>apply.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
