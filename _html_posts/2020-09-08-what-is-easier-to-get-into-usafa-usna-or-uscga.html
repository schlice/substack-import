<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What is easier to get into? USAFA, USNA, or USCGA?<br><br>All of the military academies are going to be challenging to get in to,<br>but it can be done. The challenge comes when you realize you have to be<br>both *appointed* by an "appointing official," and you have to be<br>*accepted* by the academy itself.<br><br>Appointments are given by "appointing officials:" Members of Congress,<br>the Vice President, and the President. Most cadets are nominated by<br>their Representative in the House. Getting your nomination is always a<br>challenge, because your member of Congress can only have five (5) cadets<br>in any one of the three service academies (USNA, USMA, and USAFA) at any<br>one time. The US Merchant Marine Academy gives ten (10) slots to each<br>member of Congress. The member can nominate up to ten candidates for<br>each slot. If they have slots, your member of Congress can nominate you<br>to attend more than one service academy. It's easier to get your<br>appointment from your Representative in the House than it is from your<br>state senator, the VP or POTUS, because you are dealing with a smaller<br>applicant pool with your Represeattive.<br><br>Next, you have to actually be *accepted* by the academy. This is just<br>like applying to college, but on steroids. The acceptance process is<br>separate from the nomination process, and is not dependent on the<br>nomination process. You can be nominated by your Representative and<br>still not be accepted by the academy, or vice versa.<br><br>USCGA is only easier because it doesn't need a nomination. You still<br>have to be accepted by the Coast Guard, but you don't need a nomination.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
