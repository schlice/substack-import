<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why are we trying to *punish* *anyone* for an unwanted pregnancy? You<br>said "punish men for unwanted pregnancies in light of Roe v. Wade being<br>overturned" and if I'm reading your intent correctly, what you're really<br>saying is "now that abortion is no longer a right protected by the<br>Constitution, I may not be able to abort my unwanted baby, so SOMEONE<br>has to pay for that perceived injustice."<br><br>The only reason why someone might need to be punished is if the sex was<br>not consensual, and we already punish that, as it's called rape.<br><br>See, here's the problem we are facing. People are under the false belief<br>that you can consent to sex but you can *not consent* to pregnancy. This<br>is illogical, and is not valid thinking.<br><br>In order to understand this, you have to understand what *consent* is.<br>Consent is a process which involves three things:<br><br>- A person requesting permission<br>- A person granting permission<br>- A thing which is being requested<br><br>In the case of sex, you can consent to sex. There is a person requesting<br>sex, and a person granting permission to sex.<br><br>Pregnancy is not a condition which is subject to consent. It's a<br>natural body process and is a natural consequence of sexual intercourse.<br>You can no more "consent" to pregnancy than you can "consent" to your<br>stomach processing your last meal. You can *assent* to eating food (you<br>can't even "consent" to eating food, as there aren't two people<br>involved), but you can't consent to your stomach processing that food.<br>"I can eat the food, but I do not consent to my stomach processing the<br>meal." Seems a little absurd, don't you think?<br><br>How can you *consent* to pregnancy? To whom would you be granting<br>consent? Your uterus? The baby? The baby is not in a condition to which<br>it can request permission to use your uterus for 9 months. Pregnancy is<br>a natural body process, and is the well-known outcome of sex.<br><br>The only action, therefore, you can consent to, is sex. Therefore, if<br>you consent to sex, you consent to all of the things that your body<br>automatically does with that consent, which includes pregnancy.<br><br>In other words, in order to not consent to pregnancy, you must not<br>consent to the action which causes pregnancy.<br><br>Trying to say that you consent to sex but you don't consent to pregnancy<br>goes against biology, and unless we enter a *Brave New World* scenario<br>where sex is free and pregnancy is specifically limited to certain women<br>who still have a functioning uterus, we're not going to be able to parse<br>that any more granularly than the consent to sex as the lowest level of<br>consent.<br><br>With all of that understanding, you can see that pregnancy isn't<br>anyone's "fault" other than biology's. Birth control is never 100%<br>guaranteed to work, so when you willingly consent to sex, you at least<br>take on the responsibility that it may result in pregnancy. You<br>certainly don't have to be a *mother*. Safe haven laws in all 50 states<br>allow women to give up their newborns for adoption, even days after they<br>are born, no questions asked. But you already consented to sex, which<br>implies that you consented to everything that comes along with sex,<br>including the possibility of pregnancy.<br><br>Cue the shrieking harpies shouting "My body, my choice" in 3, 2, 1......<br><br>I agree with you, you absolutely have a choice! To me though, the only<br>choice you have happens long before the pregnancy ever occurs.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can states punish men for unawanted pregnancies in light of Roe v. Wade<br>being overturned? Shouldn\'t the men who made such a critical mistake<br>have some responsibility as well?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
