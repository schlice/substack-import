<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The short answer is yes, that's the whole purpose of the toleration<br>clause. Essentially, it means you know of an honor violation, you've<br>already addressed the cadet, and the issue was not resolved to your<br>satisfaction.<br><br>Once you've reported the incident, your job is done, and you're not in<br>violation of tolerating an honor violation. Whether or not an honor team<br>decides to bring an honor incident forward is not your concern. Once you<br>have reported, you're done.<br><br>The toleration clause is important to both the accused and to the<br>tolerator. If you go in front of an honor board and someone else knew<br>about it, they go down for tolerating, so it's in their best interest to<br>deal with you first rather than dealing with their own honor board<br>later.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
