<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How good of drivers are police officers?<br><br>Selection of police officers requires an *impeccable* driving record. If<br>you've had excessive speeding tickets, or excessive traffic accidents,<br>you won't be selected to attend the police academy.<br><br>Police officers receive some advanced driving training. In our state,<br>officers receive 40 hours of driving training in their police academies,<br>and it does cover emergency vehicle operations. This is 40 more hours of<br>training than civilians have received, so in theory, they should be<br>slightly better drivers.<br><br>Also, their cars are their offices, so they spend 8 hours a day or more<br>in their cars. With that much additional experience, they should be<br>pretty good.<br><br>However, beyond a little extra training and (potentially) more time<br>behind the wheel, they are no different than anyone else with regard to<br>how well they drive. Some officers are really good drivers, and others,<br>despite the training and experience, still are really bad.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
