The<br>helicopters you see are used exclusively for Distinguished Visitor (DV)<br>transport, and for one other specialized function: this is the unit<br>that, to this day, sits alert to evacuate the President, the First<br>Family, and key WH staffers, as well as some key Pentagon staffers, out<br>of the White House and the Pentagon and back to Andrews where they board<br>Air Force One or Air Force Two during a national emergency.\<br>\<br>]<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-74961aff9be1036820867d4720788f03){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-74961aff9be1036820867d4720788f03" master_w="340"<br>master_h="269"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-d4137b4fd5e5010b6fb0da517c0412a4){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-d4137b4fd5e5010b6fb0da517c0412a4" master_w="340"<br>master_h="227"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>(Images courtesy Joint Base Andrews media)\<br>\<br>I was privileged to fly an alert hop with these guys.

I also<br>got to fly on Air Force Two during my stay at Andrews, but because I<br>didn\'t have the necessary security clearance, I was not able to meet<br>the Vice President (Quayle) who was aboard.
