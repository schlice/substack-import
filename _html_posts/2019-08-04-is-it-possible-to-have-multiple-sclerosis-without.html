<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it possible to have multiple sclerosis without lesions on scans?<br><br>The answer is, while extremely rare, you can have MS without a positive<br>MRI.<br><br>The MRI is a great tool, and the results of the scan will absolutely add<br>to the body of evidence which indicates MS. Under the updated McDonald<br>criteria, one symptom and a positive MRI can indicate MS. However, two<br>symptoms separated by space and time, along with other evidence, can<br>still indicate MS. That other evidence does not need to include a<br>positive MRI.<br><br>This is why you need a neurologist to diagnose MS; it is as much an art<br>as it is a science. There is no one test that can indicate MS.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
