<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can publish a "human-readable" license as long as your artists agree<br>to the wording of the actual license. Your human-readable version will<br>have to start with something like "This is a condensed version of the<br>license agreement. By agreeing to these terms, you are agreeing to the<br>terms of the actual license which you can read \<here\>."<br><br>The problem is the interpretation between the actual license text and<br>the "human-readable" version.<br><br>If you produce a human-readable version of your license, your attorney<br>will have to approve it to ensure that it captures the major facets of<br>the actual agreement.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
