<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Avoid conflict with Israel?* THEY WANT CONFLICT WITH ISRAEL!<br><br>It's their stated goal.<br><br>Before you ask silly questions like this, you should check out Hamas'<br>stated goals. They want the complete and total destruction of Israel.<br><br>It's even in their chants. "From the river to the sea." The "river" is<br>the Jordan, the eastern border of Israel. The "sea" is the<br>Mediterranean, the western border of Israel. That means they want<br>*ALL* of Israel to be "free." From who? Israelis. They want a new<br>caliphate across all of the Middle East, and they can't have it with<br>those pesky democratic Israelis in the way.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
