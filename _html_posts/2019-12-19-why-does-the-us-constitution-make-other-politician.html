It seems like an obvious and severe breach of the<br>separation of powers.**<br><br>The terms "jurors" and "trial" make it seem like it's a judicial trial.<br><br>It's not.<br><br>It's a political proceeding, not a trial. So it's appropriate that<br>politicians prosecute the entire procedure, and not judges.<br><br>The framers were worried about judges or the Supreme Court managing an<br>impeachment trial, because that would give the SCOTUS too much authority<br>and power over purely political processes which did not involve the law,<br>and they feared giving SCOTUS that much power.<br><br>They also feared having the same body pass articles of impeachment and<br>determine whether or not that person would remain in office. So that was<br>out.<br><br>The compromise was to have the House draft and pass the Articles, and<br>have the Senate act as the "jury" to determine whether or not the<br>impeached person will be removed from office. The Senate was supposed to<br>be the more deliberative body anyway, appointed by the States, not<br>directly beholden to the "will of the people," at least in the original<br>plan anyway. Once Senators became directly elected, there became much<br>less difference between Senators and Representatives (not the way the<br>system was designed, by the way).<br><br>And to ensure that impeachments were only conducted for the most<br>egregious crimes and abuses of power, a supermajority of Senators is<br>required to remove a president from office.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
