<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I assume you\'re talking about a wiretap, which is exactly<br>what it is called.\<br>\<br>There is no difference between a \"police wire\" or any other wiretap. A<br>court order is required before a line can be tapped by law enforcement.\<br>\<br>It\'s a lot less technical than it used to be. You bring the tap order<br>to the phone company who clicks a few buttons and records every<br>conversation on that phone number from then on out until the expiration<br>of the order.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
