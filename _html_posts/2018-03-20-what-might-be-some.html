<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What might be some \"common sense\" legislative options to address the<br>issue of gun violence in America and what would be the<br>legal/constitutional basis upon which it could be based?**<br><br>First of all, common sense is uncommon. That means that what might seem<br>"common sense" to you might seem totally unreasonable to someone else.<br>So using the term "common sense" is pointless. There is nothing that<br>everyone agrees is "common sense."<br><br>You asked about "gun violence in America" as if it is a really big<br>problem. Statistically, it's not a very big problem at all, either<br>compared to other countries, or compared to violence overall. I don't<br>know why people focus on "gun violence" but ignore "knife violence,"<br>"bomb violence," "rental truck violence," and "baseball bat violence."<br>Couldn't we just look at how we reduce violence in general, regardless<br>of the tool used?<br><br>The reason why it's so pointless to focus on the gun: **you will never<br>get rid of guns. Ever.** The only way to get rid of guns in America is<br>to invent a device which can simultaneously vaporize all guns all over<br>the world *while at the same time* obliterating the knowledge about how<br>to make one. As you've probably guessed, this is an impossible task. You<br>could create new laws that ban gun violence, but we already have laws<br>that ban violence. So how will adding a law that bans violence, but this<br>time specifically using guns, going to make any bit of difference when<br>we already have laws which ban violence irrespective of the tool used?<br>If you have existing laws and they don't work, how will they start<br>working by adding more laws?<br><br>So let's start by asking some better questions, such as *why don't<br>existing gun laws work*? This is a good one. Why do criminals use guns<br>when they commit violence? Overwhelmingly, criminals use guns when they<br>commit violence because they can. The punishments for using guns are<br>nonexistent. *But...but...the laws!* I can hear you saying right now.<br>Yeah, you actually have to *enforce* the law in order for it to be<br>effective. Criminals may have warped values, but when it comes to the<br>crimes they are committing, they're generally not all that stupid. They<br>know that they can commit a crime with a gun and they can get that gun<br>charge dropped pretty easily. Prosecutors plea bargain gun charges away<br>in exchange for "bigger" charges. So for example, if I were a criminal<br>who was involved in a drug deal gone bad and I shot someone else, the<br>first thing I would be telling that prosecutor is, "I can give you five<br>levels of dealers above me if you make this gun charge go away." It's<br>all part of plea negotiations, and gun charges are one of the<br>sacrificial lambs that tends to get dropped in favor of other charges.<br>So the first thing we can do is **forbid prosecutors from using gun<br>charges in plea deals.** If a crime is committed with a gun, it must be<br>charged; it cannot be removed as part of a plea bargain.<br><br>Secondly, **make and enforce tough sentences for using a gun in a<br>crime.** I am no fan of mandatory sentences, because it takes the legal<br>system out of the loop. But for the time being, *the legal system is the<br>problem.* So get rid of it! If you do a crime with a gun, you get a<br>mandatory 10 year sentence for using a gun, **in addition to any other<br>charges**, and the penalties run *sequentially*, not *concurrently*.<br>That means it's an automatic 10 years on top of any other crime you're<br>charged with. That means that a 5 year robbery stint becomes a 15 year<br>armed robbery stint. When you start making the penalties tougher, and<br>you start making the penalties mandatory, you will see gun crimes<br>plummet.<br><br>Of course, that just means that knife crime will begin to rise. Don't<br>believe me? [[Look at the<br>UK](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d16c3c&url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/knife-gun-crime-stats-latest-england-wales-rise-increase-a8177161.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="independent.co.uk"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>So therefore, the final leg in this barstool of common sense gun laws is<br>CCW reciprocity. If you allow someone who was trained to drive a car<br>in Kansas to operate that car in New York City, you should also allow<br>someone who was trained to carry a concealed weapon in Wichita to carry<br>that gun in Columbus. Make gun carry *ubiquitous* and *safe*.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
