<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I can appreciate the goal of the \"copwatch\" groups and<br>similar groups.\<br>\<br>But I think it\'s important to note that **this was the absolute WRONG<br>way to handle this situation.**\<br>\<br>Those of us who answer police-related questions on Quora have all said<br>the same thing over and over, and it is just as true in this case:\<br>\<br>*[There are many remedies available to you to deal with alleged police<br>abuse.]{.underline}* *NOT ONE{.underline}* *[of those remedies<br>takes place at the scene.]{.underline}*\<br>\<br>What would have happened if, instead of getting in his car and driving<br>away, the officer got in his car and called for backup? We would have<br>had a huge fight between officers and citizens, and lots of people would<br>have gotten hurt, and quite possibly one or more persons may have been<br>killed. The police would have been well within their rights to do so,<br>and also to arrest every single one of those folks on multiple charges,<br>some charges may have been impeding a police investigation, interfering<br>with law enforcement, resisting arrest, failure to follow lawful orders,<br>etc. *The protestors were clearly in the wrong.*\<br>\<br>It may have ended well from a social justice point of view, but while<br>our states are still protected by the police, then the police decide who<br>gets arrested, not the citizens. If the citizens feel the police made a<br>bad arrest, they should go down *en masse* to the police station and<br>protest the arrest. But interfering with a police officer while he is<br>performing his duties is a really bad idea and is very dangerous.\<br>\<br>*I can\'t stress this enough.* Don\'t ever do something as stupid as<br>this. And please don\'t comment and say silly things like, \"it worked,<br>didn\'t it?\" Yes, in a very Macchiavellian sort of way, it may have<br>worked this time. But next time, will the officer leave, or will they<br>call for backup? ***Please remember, pushing the button on a police call<br>box when there is no requirement for police assistance is a crime.***<br>Please don\'t lose that fact in the midst of the perceived \"David and<br>Goliath\" victory you may be celebrating.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
