<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is sex good for high blood pressure?<br><br>The answer is a *qualified* yes.<br><br>In general, any aerobic exercise is good for blood pressure, and sex is<br>most definitely an aerobic exercise.<br><br>Sex is generally safe for heart patients, if you are cleared by your<br>doctor first. As of 2012, less than 1% of acute heart problems were<br>directly linked to sexual activity.\[1\](#fhGZM){#cite-fhGZM<br>.citation_link}<br><br>For women especially, orgasm releases the hormone oxytocin, which lowers<br>blood pressure.<br><br>Sex releases stress, which can also be detrimental to your heart. Stress<br>causes blood vessels to constrict and causes heart rates to increase,<br>which indirectly increases blood pressure. Lower levels of stress have<br>been shown to result in lower blood pressure.<br><br>I would caution you, as I would for anyone, to check with your doctor<br>before you start, stop, or change any of your exercise routines,<br>especially if you already have heart issues.<br><br>But that warning aside, sex is indeed a good (and fun) way to help lower<br>your blood pressure, maintain overall heart health, and in general, help<br>maintain your overall health as well.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-fhGZM){.citation_index} [[Why You Should Have More Sex for<br>Heart<br>Health](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4732d9&url=https://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-health/why-you-should-have-more-sex-for-heart-health.aspx){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="everydayhealth.com"}<br>]{.qlink_container}<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
