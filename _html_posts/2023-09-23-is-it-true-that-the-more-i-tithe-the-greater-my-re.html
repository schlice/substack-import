<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the *vast* majority of cases, no.<br><br>You cannot *buy* favor with God. And you only need to read Mark<br>12:41--44 in order to recognize this.<br><br>> Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and<br>> watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many<br>> rich people threw in large amounts. But a poor widow came and put in<br>> two very small copper coins, worth only a few cents.<br>><br>> Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, this poor<br>> widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. They all<br>> gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in<br>> everything---all she had to live on."<br><br>Jesus was watching not only their offerings, but their *hearts*. He<br>could see not only what they gave, but *why* they gave it. The text says<br>"Many rich people threw in large amounts." Today, we often see<br>celebrities donate large sums of money to charities in an effort to<br>*virtue signal* to people; to telegraph their supposed kindness or<br>benevolence. Do we "clang our coins" while we donate, so that others may<br>notice? Do we donate for the praise of man, or for the glory of God?<br><br>The poor woman was praised for donating her two coins not because of the<br>amount, but because she gave out of *faith.*<br><br>Our challenge is the same. We are challenged to not only to give from<br>what we have in abundance, but to give what we have out of *faith*.<br><br>The other thing to note is that Jesus is not saying it's bad to have<br>wealth. But in this story, as well as with the story of the rich young<br>man who was told to give away his money (Matthew 19:16--30), our wealth<br>can "get in the way" of our discipleship and our walk with Christ. We<br>must also be cautious of this, and not allow money to get in our way of<br>our faith walk, as it can very easily become the "god" in our lives.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
