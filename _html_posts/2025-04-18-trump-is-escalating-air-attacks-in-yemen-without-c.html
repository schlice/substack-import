<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's start with legality first, then move to how the military executes<br>attacks.<br><br>\<br><br>Legality has been a sticky wicket for the last 228 years, and it doesn't<br>look like it's going to be solved any time soon.<br><br>Only Congress can declare war, but the President is the Commander in<br>Chief of the military. The last time Congress declared war was against<br>Japan in 1941. Every other operation was done without the US declaring<br>war.<br><br>Congress *tried* to rein the President in with the War Powers Act of<br>1973. Most presidents have complied with some of it and ignored some of<br>it, believing it unconstitutionally constrains the power of the<br>Executive to command the military. The War Powers Act requires the<br>President to notify Congress within 48 hours of deployment of troops<br>(which most presidents comply with), and restricts the presence of<br>troops in country for more than 60 days without an AUMF (Authorization<br>for the Use of Military Force, which most presidents have roundly<br>ignored).<br><br>The disagreement between Congress and the President has never been<br>severe enough to make it to the SCOTUS, and that's probably by design.<br>Congress doesn't want to be responsible for committing troops, and the<br>president doesn't want to have his ability to use the military as he<br>sees fit limited.<br><br>\<br><br>As of today (18 Apr 25), we have been engaged for 35 straight days<br>in air attacks on Houthi targets in Yemen, trying to prevent them from<br>launching missiles against cargo ships and the US Navy in the Red Sea.<br>Our strikes target Houthi missile banks, and our B-2 Spirit bombers<br>(based out of Diego Garcia) have been dropping Bunker Buster bombs on<br>Houthi dug-in targets. But the Houthis continue firing missiles into the<br>Red Sea, so our air campaign continues. Additionally, they've already<br>shot down at least four Reapers, and a fifth was brought down using<br>other means. A single Reaper retails for \$30 million. So we'd kinda<br>like to keep those.<br><br>You said that there is "little to no concern over civilian casualties."<br>If that were true, we wouldn't be using precision targeting munitions<br>delivered by manned fighters from carrier groups. We'd deploy BUFFs and<br>carpet-bomb the whole place. 35 days of continuous air bombardment would<br>have a tremendous psychological effect on a population. If you needed to<br>break a nation's fighting spirit, we can do it.<br><br>But because we are not, you must presume that we are not intending<br>civilians to be in the crosshairs. Any civilian casualties are<br>*collateral damage*; not intended targets. We always use the best intel<br>we have to target only military objectives. So we do the best we can,<br>and try to minimize civilian casualties. And we will continue striking<br>Houthi targets until the missiles stop.<br><br>It's important to note that we have carried out over 500 airstrikes in a<br>little over a month. But the Saudis have carried out over 25,000<br>strikes since 2019. None have yet been able to stop Yemen (an Iranian<br>proxy) from engaging in continued attacks on targets in the Red Sea.<br>Shipping has to go around the tip of Africa in order to avoid the Red<br>Sea, which adds weeks to their journeys and interrupts the free flow of<br>goods in the region.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
