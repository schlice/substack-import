<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A majority of states have communicable disease laws that make it a crime<br>to expose another person to a contagious disease on purpose. The<br>specific contagious disease is irrelevant. Notice that the communicable<br>disease law says that you must spread the contagious disease **on<br>purpose**. This means that the state must prove that you knew that you<br>had the contagious disease, you knew you were contagious, and you<br>*intentionally* acted in a way which could reasonably cause the<br>disease to spread.<br><br>There are also laws against assault and reckless behavior which can be<br>used to prosecute those who knowingly spread contagious diseases.<br><br>If there are emergency public health orders in place (like<br>"stay-at-home" orders), you can be arrested for violating those orders<br>as well.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What contagious diseases can you be arrested for spreading? Do you think<br>that covid-19 will become one of them?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
