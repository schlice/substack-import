<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How will Trump likely respond to the national emergency veto?<br><br>I don\'t understand what a national emergency veto is. They\'re isn\'t<br>actually any such thing.<br><br>The process works like this:<br><br>1.  The President declares a national emergency.<br>2.  If Congress chooses to end the national emergency, they must issue a<br>    joint resolution to do so. That means that both the House and<br>    the Senate must pass the same resolution.<br>3.  The resolution goes to the President\'s desk for signature. The<br>    President can veto the resolution. If a joint resolution actually<br>    made it to his desk (which is highly unlikely), he would likely veto<br>    it.<br>4.  Congress would need a 2/3 majority in both Houses in order to<br>    override the veto.<br><br>So in this case, there isn\'t much that can stop a national emergency.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
