Each department has it\'s own policies about whether<br>or not they can be visible while in uniform.\<br>\<br>In many departments, visible tattoos are permitted, my own included. I<br>must admit I was surprised by this myself. We have one deputy who has<br>\"sleeves\" as well.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
