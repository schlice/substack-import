He calls me<br>like 5 times in a row and if I dont pick, he sends tons of messages both<br>on text and WhatsApp. I don't want to sound rude too and also what does<br>this mean? Please I need answers.**<br><br>Block him now. Block him everywhere. Make it clear that you are not<br>interested and you don't want to hear from him again, then block him. If<br>he tries again, tell him that continued attempts at communication will<br>be considered harassment and reported to the police.<br><br>Why am I taking such a hard line now? Because if you give a guy like<br>this *even a little bit of wiggle room, letting him think you might be<br>interested,* *he will never give up.* This one just sounds a little<br>too needy, or too controlling, and trust me, you don't need either in<br>your life.<br><br>Just cut it off now, cut your losses, and move on.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
