<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's easy to protect while it is on your phone. The trick is *keeping*<br>it on your phone.<br><br>Apple (whose iPhones are in the hands of just over half of the US<br>population) obfuscates this in order to make it easy. Basically, the<br>data on your phone is encrypted any time your phone is secured with a<br>passcode or Touch ID or Face ID (depending on iPhone). [[You can check<br>pretty<br>easily](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5ab957&url=https://www.lifewire.com/encrypt-iphone-5193023){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="lifewire.com"}]{.qlink_container} if your data is encrypted.<br><br>However, the data in your iCloud backup is not encrypted. You can be<br>hacked and your private homemade porn can be leaked. It has happened<br>before. Just ask [[all the celebrities whose nudes were leaked after<br>their iCloud accounts were<br>hacked.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6bb152&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_celebrity_nude_photo_leak){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>In other words, while your iPhone's encryption protects your data while<br>on your iPhone, data which is synced with iCloud is unencrypted. A hack<br>of your iCloud account will reveal your photos and videos.<br><br>This exercise gets *much clearer and easier on Android devices*,<br>especially Samsung devices.<br><br>Samsung offers *secure folders* which are secured using their Knox<br>framework. Samsung's phones basically create a *separate operating<br>system partition* which is secured through the Knox framework. This<br>partition is only visible to the OS when it has been unlocked. You can<br>store any data you want in there, but it is only visible when it is on<br>the phone and decrypted using Knox. When you backup your Samsung phone,<br>the backup of your Knox partition is a complete data backup,<br>*fully-encrypted.*<br><br>So if you have a recent Samsung device, go into Settings \> Biometrics<br>and Security \> Secure Folder. If you haven't set up your Secure Folder<br>yet, tap Start to begin. If you have, you will see Secure Folder<br>settings.<br><br>Once setup is complete, you will have a new app in your App Drawer<br>called Secure Folder. If you open it, you'll see a whole slew of apps<br>with a little folder icon with a lock on them---things like Calendar,<br>Gallery, Camera, Samsung Notes, etc. You can add copies of any other app<br>to the Secure Folder, just press the "+" icon. The data in the apps<br>inside the Secure Folder will not be visible outside of the Secure<br>Folder. By default, the Secure Folder will be locked when you lock your<br>phone, and you will need to unlock it again before that data will become<br>visible.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How can I protect my homemade porn if I keep it on my phone?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
