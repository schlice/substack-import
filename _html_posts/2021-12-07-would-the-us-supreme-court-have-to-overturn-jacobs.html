<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Jacobson v. Massachusetts* was a case which established that the state<br>can compel *private citizens* to get a vaccine under the state's police<br>powers.<br><br>Some states have already been requiring *businesses* to vaccinate all of<br>their workers. This is a different style of mandate than was created by<br>*Jacobson*. This is more of a workplace health and safety directive than<br>a broad vaccine mandate for the entire state population, which is what<br>was held to be Constitutional by *Jacobson.*<br><br>So no, it's unlikely that SCOTUS would have to strike down *Jacobson*<br> in order to overturn New York's private-sector mandate.<br><br>But regardless, SCOTUS has not interfered with state-level mandates,<br>either for or against, so it is unlikely that SCOTUS would interfere<br>here either.<br><br>They *have*, however, stepped in when the Federal government attempted<br>to compel private companies to mandate vaccinations, as they do not have<br>the authority to do so.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Would the U.S. Supreme Court have to overturn Jacobson vs. Massachusetts<br>to strike down New York City's recent vaccine mandate for most<br>private-sector workers?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
