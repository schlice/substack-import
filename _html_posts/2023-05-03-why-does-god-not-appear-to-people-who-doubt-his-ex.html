<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You mean *visually* appear? Like in front of you? Yeah, that's not going<br>to happen because that's not the kind of believer He's looking for.<br><br>Instead, He's looking for the believer who believes *despite* not seeing<br>him.<br><br>The trick is that God gave us free will. We can choose to love Him<br>or reject Him, with no adverse effects in our lifetime. None. Nothing<br>different will happen to you today or tomorrow or the next day, until<br>the day you die, if you either love Him or reject Him. That's the core<br>of our free will. You have to be able to make that choice freely,<br>without coercion.<br><br>Now let's think about this for a second. If God appeared to people who<br>doubt His existence, **would they be stupid enough to doubt Him any<br>more?** Well, a few might, but most would not. They would be *convinced*<br>to believe in Him. They would be *coerced* into believing in Him.<br><br>*And He doesn't want that.*<br><br>But why? Why doesn't He just make everyone to automatically believe in<br>Him?<br><br>Because the very purpose of this life is to choose Him ***freely*,<br>with no coercion.**<br><br>> One beauty of God's creation is this: if you're not willing to accept<br>> Christianity, then you're free to reject it. This freedom to make<br>> choices---even the freedom to reject truth---is what makes us moral<br>> creatures and enables each of us to choose our ultimate destiny.<br>><br>> This really hits at the heart of why we exist at all, and why God<br>> might not be as overt in revealing Himself to us as some would like.<br>> For if the Bible is true, then God has provided each of us with the<br>> opportunity to make an eternal choice to either accept Him or reject<br>> Him.<br>><br>> And in order to ensure that our choice is *truly* free, he puts us in<br>> an environment that is filled with evidence of His existence, *but<br>> without His direct presence*---a presence so powerful that it could<br>> overwhelm our freedom and thus negate our ability to reject Him. In<br>> other words, God has provided enough evidence in this life to convince<br>> anyone *willing* to believe, yet he has also left some ambiguity so as<br>> not to compel the *unwilling*. In this way, God gives us the<br>> opportunity either to love Him or to reject Him without violating our<br>> freedom. In fact, the purpose of this life is to make that choice<br>> freely and without coercion. For love can only be freely given, it can<br>> never be coerced.<br>><br>> C. S. Lewis said it this way: "the Irresistible and the Indisputable<br>> are the two weapons which the very nature of \God's\ scheme forbids<br>> Him to use. Merely to over-ride a human will (as His felt presence in<br>> any but the faintest and most mitigated degree would certainly do)<br>> would be for Him useless. He cannot ravish. He can only<br>> woo."\[1\](#ROcCS){#cite-ROcCS .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ROcCS){.citation_index} [[I Don\'t Have Enough Faith to Be<br>an Atheist: Geisler, Norman L., Turek, Frank, Limbaugh, David:<br>9781433580758: Amazon.com:<br>Books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=770f5b&url=https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Have-Enough-Faith-Atheist/dp/1433580756){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
