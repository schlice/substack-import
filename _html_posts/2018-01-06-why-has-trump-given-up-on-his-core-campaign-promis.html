<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, you\'re reading mainstream media liberal lies. These guys<br>have absolutely no idea whether or not Trump has actually "given up" on<br>having Mexico pay for the border wall.<br><br>they probably believe that the only way to pay for a border wall Is to<br>do so up front. However, Trump has already explained how Mexico will pay<br>for the border wall:<br><br>> *Mexico must pay for the wall and, until they do, the United States<br>> will, among other things: impound all remittance payments derived from<br>> illegal wages; increase fees on all temporary visas issued to Mexican<br>> CEOs and diplomats (and if necessary cancel them); increase fees on<br>> all border crossing cards of which we issue about 1 million to Mexican<br>> nationals each year (a major source of visa overstays); increase fees<br>> on all NAFTA worker visas from Mexico (another major source of<br>> overstays); and increase fees at ports of entry to the United States<br>> from Mexico \Tariffs and foreign aid cuts are also options\. We will<br>> not be taken advantage of anymore.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
