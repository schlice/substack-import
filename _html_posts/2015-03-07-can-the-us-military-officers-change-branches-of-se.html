<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Almost everything that [[David<br>Rishel](https://www.quora.com/profile/David-Rishel)]{.qlink_container}<br>said was absolutely correct, except that officers will retain their<br>ranks upon changing services. Each branch of the service has programs in<br>place for personnel to do so, and each program is different, depending<br>on the from/to branches, and whether or not the person is officer or<br>enlisted.\<br>\<br>For example, to answer your specific question, there has been in place<br>for quite some time \"[[Operation Blue to<br>Green](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5e59fe&url=http://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/current-and-prior-service/continue-serving/transitioning-services/blue-to-green.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="goarmy.com"}]{.qlink_container}\" which allows Air Force and<br>Navy officers and enlisted personnel to transfer their eligible<br>commissions or grade to the Army. I recall as I was leaving the Air<br>Force Reserves that such a program existed, and that was nearly 10 years<br>ago, so I know this program has existed for some time. Officers will<br>retain their rank, and they will either directly enter a MOS that<br>matches their AFSC or Rate, or will receive MOS-specific retraining to<br>enter a new MOS.\<br>\<br>The Air Force has a similar program, allowing officers to perform<br>\"interservice transfer,\" but not for enlisted personnel. There is a<br>Prior Service enlistment program that allows eligible Prior Service<br>enlisteds to transfer into the Air Force. They may not be able to retain<br>their exact rank, it is different for each person.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
