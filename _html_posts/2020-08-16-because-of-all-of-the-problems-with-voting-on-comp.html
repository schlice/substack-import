Remember those? You fill in the bubble on the sheet of<br>paper. You then run your own ballot into the voting machine, watch it go<br>in, confirm your votes, and your votes are counted. The paper ballots<br>are retained so that you can perform recounts easily if there is doubt<br>as to the actual vote totals or if the race is so close that it triggers<br>an automatic recount.<br><br>The problem in the United States is that we don't have just one<br>election. We actually have 51 separate elections, and each state's rules<br>are different.<br><br>The most effective systems are the ones which use paper but count by<br>machine.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
