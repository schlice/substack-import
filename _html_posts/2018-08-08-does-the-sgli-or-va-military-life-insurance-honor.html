<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does the SGLI or VA military life insurance honor the policy and pay<br>out if a service member or veteran commits suicide?**<br><br>Cause of death is irrelevant for paying out of SGLI. So if the<br>servicemember was not wearing a seatbelt, or commits suicide, it's<br>irrelevant. SGLI will pay out.<br><br>There are certain scenarios under which SGLI will not pay, but they are<br>related to whether or not the servicemember was covered at the time of<br>his death.<br><br>That's not the same as Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) under<br>the VA. DIC is for servicemembers who died in the line of duty or whose<br>death was caused by a service-related disease or condition. In order for<br>your dependents to be eligible for DIC, your death must not have been<br>due to your own misconduct. SGLI doesn't have this restriction.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
