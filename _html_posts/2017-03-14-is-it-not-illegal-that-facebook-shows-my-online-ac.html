<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It *would* be illegal *if* you explicitly denied permission to show your<br>online status and Facebook did it anyway. At the very least it would be<br>a privacy violation.<br><br>If you never explicitly denied permission to show your online status,<br>Facebook includes that as part of their Terms of Service, so signing up<br>for Facebook and accepting the ToS and the User Agreement implies<br>consent to showing your online status unless you specifically opt-out of<br>that feature.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
