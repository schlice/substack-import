<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Lots of hugs, some tears, lots of pictures, probably lots of adult<br>beverages, etc.<br><br>Once the ceremony is done, the newly-minted Second Lieutenants usually<br>have a little bit of leave left over (around a week or so). Following<br>that, they ship out to their first duty assignment, which is normally<br>some form of tech school to start their new jobs. If they are pilots,<br>there is usually a little more downtime before UPT begins, but that's<br>generally how it goes.<br><br>They already have their personal effects boxed up and ready to leave,<br>and Transportation will ship them to their next duty station.<br><br>Transportation will also coordinate their transport to their next duty<br>station. If available, they will fly on military transport directly to<br>their next duty station. If not, tickets will be provided for civilian<br>air transport.<br><br>There's been a famous meme that has been running around the Academy for<br>decades that the best view of the Academy is the one in your rear-view<br>mirror. It's certainly an amazing feeling to see that, and consciously<br>or subconsciously, everyone takes an extra-long look in their rear-view<br>mirror after they have graduated and are literally leaving the base for<br>the last time. But it doesn't last.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
