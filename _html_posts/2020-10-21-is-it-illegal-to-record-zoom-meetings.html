<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it illegal to record Zoom meetings?<br><br>Zoom allows Zoom meetings to be recorded. However, when the host begins<br>recording the meeting, participants are given the *option* to disconnect<br>from the meeting. Thus, by continuing on with the meeting, the<br>participants *consent to recording*.<br><br>When you screen record a Zoom session, you do not give the participants<br>the option to opt out of being recorded.<br><br>So depending on why you are recording, and what your intended use is for<br>the recording, most likely the recording would violate privacy laws<br>where at least one person attending the meeting lives.<br><br>The only exception I could see is recording a Zoom session that is<br>already being recorded. All participants have already consented to being<br>recorded, so consent is not an issue there. The issue may be *control of<br>the recording,* which the host may have wanted to retain. Depending on<br>what you do with the recording, you could still run into legal trouble.<br><br>The most legal way to record a Zoom session: ask the host to record it,<br>and then ask the host to give you a copy. If you can do that, you can be<br>sure you have a legal and permitted copy of the meeting.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
