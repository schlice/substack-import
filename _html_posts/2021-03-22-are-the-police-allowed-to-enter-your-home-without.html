<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Are the police allowed to enter your home without a warrant due to<br>probable cause?**<br><br>No.<br><br>Probable cause is enough to get a warrant. Warrants are ridiculously<br>easy to get these days; officers can get a warrant right on their mobile<br>phones.<br><br>The only way an officer can enter your house without permission or a<br>warrant is through *exigent circumstances*. Exigent circumstances<br>include, but are not limited to: if they believe that someone is hurt,<br>if they believe that critical evidence is about to be destroyed, or they<br>believe a criminal is about to escape.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
