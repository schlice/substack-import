<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's assume we're talking about children. We're not talking about<br>college students, because they are technically adults.<br><br>Children model what they see from their adult mentors.<br><br>So the easiest way to change the behavior of children is to *model<br>better behavior.* Changing the behavior of children first involves<br>changing our own behavior. If we are rude, condescending, or dismissive<br>of police during our own interactions, or even if we see them as we<br>drive by and we make a comment, kids hear that. They absorb that, and<br>they model their own behavior after it. It's hard to believe, but while<br>you may think they are ignoring you, they are most definitely not.<br><br>Change the narrative.<br><br>The narrative of late has been the one that cops are nothing but racist<br>killers. The facts and the data say otherwise, but that doesn't stop the<br>antagonists in groups like Black Lives Matter. *Their entire platform is<br>based on a lie.* Plain and simple. Yet, they are given ample airtime by<br>a complicit media, and the message, however false and misleading,<br>spreads.<br><br>When you see these examples on TV, take the time to explain to your kids<br>why this is wrong. Explain that most cops will go their entire careers<br>and never shoot anyone, and that the vast majority of cops are decent,<br>hard working men and women dedicated to their communities. Lumping them<br>all in with the few bad seeds (and yes, we know they are there) is not<br>fair to the vast majority of the law enforcement community.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
