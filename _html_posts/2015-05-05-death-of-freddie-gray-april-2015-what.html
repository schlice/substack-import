<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There is a very low chance that the officers will be<br>convicted of murder.\<br>\<br>Even knowing that their brutality \"was resulting in him becoming<br>mortally wounded or would result in his death\" does not rise to the<br>standard of murder. That might rise to the standard of \"voluntary<br>manslaughter\" but definitely does not rise to the standard of murder.<br>And if they are charged with murder, the only possible outcome is that<br>they will be acquitted.\<br>\<br>The problem in this case is the same as what happened in the Zimmerman<br>case in Florida: \"prosecutorial overreach.\" She jumped to charge the<br>officers with a charge that is far and above what she could reasonably<br>determine in such a short period of time. When prudence dictates that<br>the evidence be given more weight and more opportunity for review, she<br>did not do that. The reviews of the Michael Brown case took 108 days,<br>and the review of the Eric Garner case took 140 days. But Ms. Mosby can<br>determine in just a few hours that murder charges are warranted, and she<br>didn\'t even consult a grand jury? It\'s clear to even the casual<br>observer that the charges were *politically* motivated, not<br>*judicially* motivated. That is a travesty and an absolute<br>*abdication* of her responsibilities of her office. I predict that if<br>she hasn\'t already been elected to Congress by the time this is all<br>over, she\'ll be fired as Baltimore City State\'s Attorney.\<br>\<br>She levied these charges to stop the riots. Our system of justice is not<br>based on appeasing the rioting crowds, it\'s based on law. Maybe there<br>are some other cultures in the world which use mob rule, but not this<br>country. This is a sad, sad day for the legal system. Because of her<br>overreach, not only will these officers likely go free, but it\'s also<br>likely that even if they were guilty of some lesser offense, they will<br>never be brought to justice.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
