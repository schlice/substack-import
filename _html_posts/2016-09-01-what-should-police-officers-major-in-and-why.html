<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Since you're talking about college, I would look into a Bachelor's<br>degree in Criminal Justice or something similar. Barring that (if your<br>college doesn't offer), a Legal Studies or another Pre-law related<br>Bachelor's degree would be useful.<br><br>While a specific degree isn't required to become a police officer in any<br>jurisdiction that I'm aware of, if you're in college getting a degree,<br>focusing on understanding the foundation of the legal system in our<br>country is a great way to focus your efforts towards any law-related<br>field. If you have the ability to take a Criminal Justice and a<br>Constitutional Law class, do it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
