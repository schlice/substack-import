<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is, of course, one major exception to this: the US Military.<br><br>We *can* shoot someone in the back who is fleeing.<br><br>The military provides 8 scenarios in which deadly force is authorized:<br><br>1.  Self defense<br>2.  Defense of others (i.e. serious crimes against the person)<br>3.  Protection of property or information vital to national security<br>    (i.e. stopping someone escaping with Top Secret information)<br>4.  **Protection of property or information substantial to national<br>    security** (i.e. stopping someone escaping with Secret information)<br>5.  Protection of property inherently dangerous to others (i.e.<br>    stopping someone escaping with High Explosive ordnance or a<br>    thermonuclear detonator, or something similar).<br>6.  Apprehension<br>7.  Prevention of prisoner escape<br>8.  Enforcement of a lawful order<br><br>Note that five of those eight (I highlighted them above) could be<br>effected against someone who is running away.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
