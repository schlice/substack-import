Check the pro bono<br>websites<br>([here(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1f68df&url=https://www.probono.net/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="probono.net"}]{.qlink_container} is an example) for<br>attorneys who might be able to assist you.<br><br>You might also check with the advocacy group for your particular<br>disability. For example, I have MS, so I would check with the<br>Colorado-Wyoming chapter of the National MS Society. They can also put<br>you in touch with legal aid resources who can assist you.<br><br>Or, as [[Colleen<br>Jones](https://www.quora.com/profile/Colleen-Jones-49)]{.qlink_container}<br>said, you can file a complaint yourself with the DOJ.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
