<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [However, the right thing to do is to check in with the<br>airline which issued the ticket. They may tell you to go check in with<br>the codeshare partner, they may not.\<br>\<br>But don\'t you think the best advice in all situations is to check in<br>with the ticketing airline first?\<br>\<br>And if I\'m giving someone advice, I\'m not going to tell them to go<br>check somewhere else first, codeshare or not. I think the airlines can<br>figure out where to send you if you\'re not in the right spot.\<br>\<br>So maybe I will append my advice and say \"make sure you attempt your<br>check-in *extra early* to account for any cross-airline checkins you<br>may need to do, but always start with the airline that issued the<br>ticket.\"\<br>\<br>Especially considering your OGG example, the other airline\'s desk is<br>like 50 feet away. No big shakes there.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/I-have-a-flight-with-the-United-Airlines-flight-number-but-the-flight-itself-is-on-another-airline-Where-do-I-check-in-United-or-Air-Canada/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
