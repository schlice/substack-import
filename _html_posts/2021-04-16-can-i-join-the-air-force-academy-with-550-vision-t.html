They can be<br>perfectly corrected with glasses/contacts.**<br><br>I don't have much to add to [[Zenen<br>Cardenas](https://www.quora.com/profile/Zenen-Cardenas)]{.qlink_container}'<br>excellent answer. It's great to see that current cadets are<br>participating here on Quora. It's funny, as grads, we often say that no<br>one who came after us had it as tough as we did. But in this case, with<br>this virus, I can safely say that Zenen and his classmates are having a<br>really tough go of it. I'm glad to see the participation.<br><br>Anyway, here's the current admissions standards for people wishing to<br>apply to the Academy:<br><br>> Visual Acuity<br>><br>> Current distant visual acuity of any degree that does not correct with<br>> spectacle lenses to at least 20/40 in each eye. Current near visual<br>> acuity of any degree that does not correct to 20/40 in the better eye.<br>><br>> Refractive Error<br>><br>> Current refractive error (hyperopia, myopia, astigmatism) in excess of<br>> -8.00 or +8.00 diopters spherical equivalent or astigmatism in excess<br>> of 3.00 diopters.\[1\](#GoREw){#cite-GoREw .citation_link}<br><br>Your correctable vision is perfectly acceptable to become a cadet at<br>USAFA.<br><br>I strongly suggest you take a look at the [[Academy<br>Admissions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60e33c&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} website.
