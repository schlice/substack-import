<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, it is not illegal to not move your car after an accident. But I will<br>tell you that the first arriving police officer will ask you if your car<br>is still drivable, and if it is, to pull it off the side of the road.<br><br>If your car is still drivable, it is strongly advised that you move it<br>out of traffic. It doesn't have to be in place on the road in order for<br>police officers to figure out exactly what happened in the accident..<br><br>Also, it's much safer for you and for the rest of the traveling public<br>for you to move your car off of the active roadway. There's less chance<br>of a secondary accident taking place, and it's safer for responding<br>police officers to work on the side of the road rather than in traffic.<br><br>TL;DR: If you are able, please move your car out of traffic after an<br>accident.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it illegal to not move your car after an accident?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
