<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's answer the Constitutional questions:<br><br>> **Does the U.S. Constitution guarantee its citizens the right to allow<br>> themselves to get sick**<br><br>The Constitution is not about what people are allowed to do. The<br>Constitution is all about what government is or is not allowed to<br>do.<br><br>The Constitution, additionally, does not grant or revoke rights. The<br>rights existed before the Constitution was written.<br><br>That said, the Constitution does not prohibit citizens from allowing<br>themselves to get sick. There is no right to not get sick.<br><br>> and possibly others in the process?<br><br>So here's where things get sticky. The Constitution is not the place for<br>this type of prohibition. The place for this is in *law*. Laws exist so<br>that my free exercise of my rights doesn't interfere with your free<br>exercise of your rights.<br><br>*And nowhere in the Constitution is there a right to not get sick.*<br>States have prohibitions on *intentionally* infecting others with<br>communicable diseases, but that's more under the "assault" banner than<br>it is because of any right to be free from illness.<br><br>That said, states have a responsibility to promote the public health,<br>and the federal government has the responsibility to promote the general<br>welfare. So there is a compelling state interest in designing public<br>health policy that allows people their freedom of choice while still<br>giving them all of the information they need to make an informed<br>decision about what healthcare options they should choose.<br><br>**Over the course of this "pandemic," the government has failed to do<br>this.**<br><br>Nevertheless, this is not a Constitutional question. The Constitution<br>does not prohibit anyone from allowing themselves to get sick, and<br>nowhere does it guarantee anyone the right to never get sick.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Does the U.S. Constitution guarantee its citizens the right to allow<br>themselves to get sick and possibly others in the proces<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one. Waaaaaay too much acrimony, and too<br>many people pushing this sickening condescension towards people with<br>legitimate concerns regarding vaccine skepticism.*<br><br>*If you don't like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I'm wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is<br>a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply going<br>to comment to tell me "ackshually, you're wrong," then youre the reason<br>why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for everyone.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
