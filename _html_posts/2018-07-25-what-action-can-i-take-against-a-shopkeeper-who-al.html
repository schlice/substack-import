The<br>police officers might be helping him in running his shop.**<br><br>You didn't mention where this is happening. Since I know the laws in the<br>US, I'll address this as if it is happening in the US.<br><br>In order to be able to do something about it, you have to be an<br>*aggrieved party*. In other words, there must be some *demonstrable<br>harm* caused by what's going on. For example, you own the neighboring<br>shop, and the actions are causing you to lose business. If you're not<br>experiencing some demonstrable harm from the action, it's unlikely that<br>your suit would go anywhere as you do not have *standing* to bring a<br>suit.<br><br>Secondly, you have to ensure that you're targeting the right person.<br>Unless the shopkeeper is responsible for enforcing laws on the street in<br>front of his shop, he probably is not the right person to address. You<br>should be talking to the city, asking them why they are not enforcing<br>the laws.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
