I recognize my<br>wallet is still on me, so thinking my wallet pinged the machine, I send<br>it through the X-ray, at which time the metal blade of the knife becomes<br>fully visible on the screen. It was the knife blade that pinged the<br>magnetometer, not the aluminum wallet.<br><br>Anyway, I told them to throw it away, because it would have cost me more<br>to send it home than I paid for it (which was nothing).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
