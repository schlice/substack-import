<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do I behave as an employer, when one of the female employees is<br>too attractive and many times she\'s been a love target for other male<br>employees?**<br><br>It seems like you're trying to make the assertion that your male<br>employees are pigs and can't control themselves, and the poor<br>defenseless woman who is simply too attractive for her own good needs to<br>be shoehorned into a closet for her own safety.<br><br>Perhaps you'll have to clarify a little bit of your question so we can<br>answer it more thoroughly.<br><br>- "How do I behave" --- What exactly does this mean? Are you asking what<br>  you do about this "untenable" situation?<br>- "Too attractive" --- Are you saying that your employee is in violation<br>  of some dress or personal appearance standard at your workplace? If<br>  she is, then you deal with that issue. If not, then I don't see that<br>  there is anything you need to concern yourself with.<br>- "Love target" --- This doesn't even make sense. Are you saying your<br>  male employees simply cannot control themselves? Are they acting<br>  inappropriately around her? If not, she can likely handle herself.<br><br>Here's how you handle it: if your female employee has been harassed, you<br>deal with the harassment complaint when it comes up. If she comes to you<br>complaining of a hostile work environment, you fire the men responsible<br>for creating a hostile work environment.<br><br>It mostly seems like what you have to do is fire the children, and you<br>hire adults next time.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
