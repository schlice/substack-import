<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Benign MS is not a form of MS. It is a term used to describe<br>Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS) with periods of relapse characterized<br>by very mild symptoms, and extended periods of remission (in the span of<br>years).<br><br>You can really only say that you have benign MS if you've gone at least<br>15 years with no symptoms, and you have little to no disability related<br>to MS.<br><br>Benign MS does not mean that you do not have MS. This simply means<br>that your *symptoms* are mild to non-existent. MRIs still show disease<br>progress, even if the progress does not produce symptoms. Additionally,<br>benign MS can become active at any time.<br><br>Most neurologists shy away from this term because it only describes<br>*past experience,* not future potential. And it confers a false sense of<br>security which may lead patients to forego needed treatment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
