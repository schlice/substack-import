<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Thanks for the A2A, but I don\'t have PPMS. I have<br>Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS), so I can\'t relate to what it\'s like<br>living with PPMS.\<br>\<br>What I do know is that PPMS is fundamentally different from all the<br>other forms of the disease. The other forms of the disease, including<br>RRMS and Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS) (to a degree), are<br>characterized by demyelination and nervous system inflammation. In other<br>words, the other forms of the disease are inflammatory in nature. The MS<br>medications we have today treat the inflammation in the nervous system,<br>reducing severity of symptoms and decreasing the duration of relapses.\<br>\<br>PPMS is primarily not inflammatory in nature, it is categorized by nerve<br>degeneration without the relapsing/remitting inflammation. Therefore,<br>none of our current treatments, which target the inflammatory response<br>and not the degenerative response, are effective with PPMS. While we<br>have a fair understanding of the inflammatory response, and we have a<br>fair ability to control that response to a degree, the underlying<br>degenerative response is still unknown.\<br>\<br>PPMS primarily affects the spinal column, so the most prevalent symptoms<br>are gait, bowel/bladder problems, and sexual dysfunction.\<br>\<br>I can imagine what it would be like if my right-side weakness never got<br>better. I think I\'d be using a cane by now.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
