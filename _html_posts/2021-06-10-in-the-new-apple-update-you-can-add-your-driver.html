<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not yet, but perhaps at some time in the future, you may. The question<br>is not one of whether or not the digital representation is your actual<br>license. The question is whether or not the state or a business will<br>accept it as a form of identification, and whether or not the police can<br>use it to say that you possess a valid driver's license on your person,<br>and those are a matter of state law.<br><br>Apple is following the "if you build it, they will come" philosophy of<br>placing the technology first, and allowing states to certify it.<br><br>Many states are already in the process of beta testing "digital driver's<br>licenses" through a dedicated state app. So while the addition to<br>Apple's digital wallet may be a good step, and one that states can<br>capitalize on, it does not automatically mean that you can add your<br>license to your Apple wallet today and expect it to be accepted when you<br>get pulled over.<br><br>**TL;DR: It's up to your state to certify the technology before they<br>will accept it in lieu of your physical license.**<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>In the new Apple update, you can add your driver's license to your Apple<br>wallet which is digital. Can you show that to the police if you get<br>pulled over?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
