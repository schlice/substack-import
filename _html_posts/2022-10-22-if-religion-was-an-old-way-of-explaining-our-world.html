<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How the world was really made is not at issue. We all know how the world<br>was made. It was the Big Bang. That was the beginning of all time,<br>matter, and space. Everything in our known universe was created from<br>that one event.<br><br>But that begs the question: *what caused that?* This, by the way, is<br>what we call the Cosmological Argument:<br><br>1.  Everything that had a beginning had a cause.<br>2.  The universe (and everything in it) had a beginning.<br>3.  Therefore, the universe (and everything in it) had a cause.<br><br>Premise 1 is what we call the Law of Causality. It's *the* fundamental<br>principle of science. Without this, no scientific inquiry would be<br>possible. Science is a search for causes. That's what scientists do ---<br>try to determine what caused what. So Premise 1 is true.<br><br>Is Premise 2 true? We know that the Big Bang happened. Evidence for the<br>Big Bang is numerous, and growing. While there is still plenty of doubt<br>as to whether or not the Big Bang was actually the beginning of all<br>time, space, and matter, Einstein's Theory of General Relativity (which<br>relies on the fact that everything in the known universe all began at a<br>single point) has been proven to five decimal places, and has been the<br>source for other discoveries (red shift, galaxy seeds, etc).<br><br>Therefore, we know that something (or Someone) caused the universe to<br>come into existence.<br><br>Because that Someone exists outside of time and space, we cannot detect<br>that Someone using traditional scientific inquiry. You can't measure<br>God. You can't detect God's presence. But the Law of Causality says that<br>an effect must resemble its cause. So can we look at the effect and<br>infer anything about the cause?<br><br>In fact, we can. From looking at the creation (the universe), here's<br>what we can tell about the Creator:<br><br>- He must be supernatural in nature (as He created time and space).<br>- He must be powerful (incredibly).<br>- He must be necessary (the maker must be self-explanatory).<br>- He must be omnipresent (He created space and is not limited by it).<br>- He must be immaterial because He transcends space/physical.<br>- He must be personal (the impersonal cannot create personality).<br>- He must be infinite and singular as you cannot have two infinites.<br>- He must be diverse yet have unity as unity and diversity exist<br>  simultaneously in nature.<br>- He must be intelligent (supremely). Only cognitive being can produce<br>  cognitive being.<br>- He must be purposeful as He deliberately created everything.<br>- He must be moral (no moral law can be had without a giver).<br>- He must be caring (or no moral laws would have been given).<br><br>Interestingly, it is only the Abrahamic God of the Bible who fits these<br>requirements completely.<br><br>That's why we still devote our lives to religion. Because religion fits<br>the available evidence better than any other explanation out there.<br>There is more evidence to prove that religion is right than there is<br>that atheism is. Because there is *more evidence*, it requires *less*<br>*faith* to believe that there is a Creator than to believe that there is<br>not. And I just don't have enough faith to believe there is no Creator.<br><br>**TL;DR: We devote our lives to religion because we don't have enough<br>faith to be atheists.**<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If religion was an old way of explaining our world, and we now know how<br>it was really made, why do people still devote their lives to religion?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
