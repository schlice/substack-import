<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [*(NOTE: This would be one of those times where adding two<br>bios would be awesome, as this question intersects my civilian job at<br>EMC Corporation, and my passion for law enforcement)*\<br>\<br>[[Bryce<br>Christensen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Bryce-Christensen-1)]{.qlink_container}<br>has got it nailed.\<br>\<br>I would love to see every cop with a full time recording device (which<br>he can switch off in privacy situations), or a recording device which he<br>can switch on and off at will, and then be held accountable when he<br>doesn\'t record something he was supposed to. The problem, as Bryce so<br>aptly pointed out, is not the camera. It\'s the storage of the video.\<br>\<br>It\'s actually not as complex as he made it seem; every incident is<br>recorded separately, so every incident can be tagged with a video, and<br>since the reports are electronic, it\'s a simple matter to \"attach\" a<br>video to a report. The problem is the storage of this massive amount of<br>data. Departments simply don\'t have the funding to buy the increased<br>amount of storage.\<br>\<br>With the increase in storage, you will need an increase in the number<br>and complexity of your IT staff. You will need storage specialists on<br>your IT staff who are trained in the configuration and the<br>administration of large-scale enterprise storage systems.\<br>\<br>So not only do you need more money to buy more storage, but you\'ll need<br>more money to hire more IT staff, and apparently while everyone wants to<br>see every cop with a camera, no one wants to pay more in taxes to hire<br>more IT people or buy more storage.\<br>\<br>So while we\'d all like to see it happen, it\'s not very likely to<br>happen in the near future.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
