<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Most likely. US citizens are not authorized to assassinate anyone.<br>Neither is any police department in the US. If a US citizen were to<br>shoot him dead on the streets, that citizen would be arrested and<br>charged with Murder 1.<br><br>Once at trial, the possibility of extenuating circumstances (i.e. it was<br>Osama bin Laden) and plea bargains could reduce the time served to a<br>minimum.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
