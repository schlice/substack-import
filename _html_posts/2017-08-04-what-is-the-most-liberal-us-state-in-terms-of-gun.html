<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *What is the most liberal US state in terms of gun laws (people are<br>> most free to own a gun)?*<br><br>To answer your specific question, no state can restrict your ability to<br>*own* a gun. I may not be able to legally *carry* that gun, or even<br>have it in my *home*, but no one can prevent me from *buying* a gun, so<br>long as I meet the requirements for doing so. I may not be allowed to<br>carry it out of the store, but I can still buy it.<br><br>Now, which state is the most free when it comes to *possessing* a gun<br>that I legally purchased? Arizona. They are a Constitutional Carry<br>state (also called "permitless carry"), meaning that if you can own it,<br>you can carry it, anywhere, open or concealed. They have the best laws<br>when it comes to transfer of guns, they allow anything that the Federal<br>government doesn't ban, and they have a very strong gun culture.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
