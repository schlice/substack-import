<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a person ran in front of a speeding police car and had a signed DNR<br>form, would the police respect the DNR? Or would they turn into bullies<br>and get you to the hospital so you could get better and they could<br>arrest you?**<br><br>I'm not sure the first responder would even know of, or care about, a<br>DNR. ***In most cases, they're not for the first responder. They're for<br>the hospital.***<br><br>A DNR is a "Do-Not-Resuscitate" order. It basically says that a doctor<br>cannot resuscitate a patient in the hospital whose heart stops or who<br>has no pulse. It is not an order to withhold *all* treatment. Secondly,<br>a DNR comes from a *doctor*, not a patient. In order to get a DNR, you<br>must discuss the situation with your doctor before he or she will issue<br>the order. DNRs are written orders and are on file with the hospital.<br><br>Getting a first responder to both know about, and abide by, a DNR can be<br>challenging, especially if you are incapacitated. Perhaps a Medic-Alert<br>bracelet with your DNR information printed on it might help, but Good<br>Samaritans are not bound by DNRs as they are not medical professionals.<br>So if you get hit by a police car and a civilian stops and renders first<br>aid, including CPR, you cannot hold them liable for failing to follow<br>your DNR.<br><br>Whether or not first responders (i.e. police), EMTs or paramedics are<br>bound by valid DNR orders varies by state. Some states require DNR<br>orders on a specific form; if it's not on that form, first responders<br>are not required to comply. Other states will allow any DNR order signed<br>by a doctor to be honored by paramedics. And again, it only applies to<br>*resuscitation*. It does not preclude *all* first aid. It only applies<br>when the heart stops and there is no pulse.<br><br>Finally, police wouldn't want you to get better so they can arrest you.<br>They'd want you to get better so you can receive psychological care for<br>attempting to commit suicide using a police car.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
