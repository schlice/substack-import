However, most of the time that pepper spray is used<br>on someone (which constitutes a simple assault), you have an<br>*affirmative defense.* An affirmative defense is one in which you<br>*affirm* that you committed the offense, but you did so because of a<br>generally accepted reason (i.e. you used pepper spray in self-defense).<br><br>If you were not using pepper spray to defend yourself, then you could be<br>seen as an aggressor and you could be charged with assault.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
