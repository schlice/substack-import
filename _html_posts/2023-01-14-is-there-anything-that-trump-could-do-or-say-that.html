He could come out<br>in support of the entirety of the Democrat Party agenda. He could<br>support appointing Supreme Court justices who are not textualists.<br><br>Any one of those things would be a bridge too far for Republicans.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
