<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I think you\'re in a unique position. People marry \"for<br>better or for worse\" and then when someone develops an incurable<br>disease, they realize they didn\'t really mean it, or didn\'t really<br>understand that they were committing to someone even when the physical<br>quality of their life changes, sometimes drastically.\<br>\<br>I think that if you can appreciate that you are there for her in<br>whatever way she may need, then her MS should not make a difference.<br>It\'s a big deal and it is going to be something you will both have to<br>deal with for the rest of your lives. But it should not change how you<br>feel about someone. And if you truly care for her, then you will want to<br>support her and help her through the rough patches and be that shoulder<br>to lean on when the challenges of MS become unbearable to endure alone.\<br>\<br>If you can be that person, then you are perfect for<br>her.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
