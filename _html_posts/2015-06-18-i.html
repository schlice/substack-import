<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You\'ve got a bit of a myopathy problem, and it\'s driven<br>by today\'s culture. Sadly, society puts a lot of focus on the act of<br>sex rather than the joys of marriage. Marriage is a commitment to live<br>with someone, for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and<br>in health, \'till death do you part. The better or worse part includes<br>sex. So if you\'re looking for the Christian perspective, sex is really<br>low on the totem pole. Marriage is the lifetime commitment, sex pales in<br>comparison to the commitment of marriage.\<br>\<br>Looking for a religious loophole so you can have sex that God sanctifies<br>is not gonna cut it. We are human, we are imperfect. If sex means that<br>much to you, you\'re going to have to make a choice. If sex is more<br>important to you than marriage, skip the religion. Find a girl and do<br>your thing. It will be a wonderful first experience.\<br>\<br>But if your religion is truly important, find a woman you think is the<br>right one for you, and who shares your values. That\'s going to be key.<br>When you\'re married, sex won\'t occupy that much of your time anyway<br>(well, it will during the honeymoon phase, but I\'m thinking more<br>long-term). Spending your life with the woman who completes you is what<br>it\'s all about. Sex is just gravy.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
