<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does the right to travel 5th and 14 amendment really mean you dont<br>need a license?**<br><br>No. Not even close.<br><br>The federal government is extremely limited in its authority, by<br>Constitutional design, to essential functions in making the states work<br>together. But the state government is the main source of governmental<br>authority. The states make the laws that govern your everyday life.<br><br>To that end, while freedom of movement is most definitely a<br>Constitutional right derived from the 5th and 14th Amendments, as well<br>as the "privileges and immunities clause," the courts have held<br>consistently that the federal government does not *protect* freedom<br>of movement. That duty falls squarely on the state, under that same<br>privileges and immunities clause of the Constitution. The courts have<br>consistently held that the state is responsible for protecting freedom<br>of movement. In the same way, subsequent court rulings have found that<br>states cannot restrict freedom of movement.<br><br>To that end, if the state has the Constitutional responsibility to<br>protect freedom of movement, they also have the concomitant<br>responsibility to ensure that drivers are duly trained and licensed to<br>operate motor vehicles in order to effect their Constitutional<br>responsibility. States are free to license drivers in the way in which<br>they see fit, and licenses are recognized by other states when those<br>licenses meet certain minimum standards for driving ability. Since all<br>states have met those minimum standards, all states recognize driving<br>privileges from other states. Since the state is the primary protector<br>of freedom of movement, it falls to the state to ensure the safety of<br>that movement, and the Constitutional provision of freedom of movement<br>does not override the state's authority in licensing drivers.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
