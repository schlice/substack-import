<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it illegal for an 18-year-old to have sex with a minor?<br><br>Yes. This is a crime called statutory rape. It is a crime because it<br>is universally accepted that minors do not have the mental capacity to<br>consent to sex.<br><br>However, in some states, there are "close-in-age" exceptions which state<br>that if the two participants are within a certain number of years apart,<br>they won't be charged with statutory rape. This is an exception designed<br>to exempt a minor couple from statutory rape charges when the law is<br>designed to target older adults taking advantage of the less-developed<br>mental capacity of minors. Check the laws in your state to see what<br>kinds of exemptions it may contain.<br><br>There is also a "marriage exemption" in some states which allow minors<br>to marry adults (with parents' permission). In such a circumstance,<br>statutory rape does not apply.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
