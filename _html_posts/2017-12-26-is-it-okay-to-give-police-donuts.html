<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it okay to give police donuts?<br><br>Thanks for your kindness in thinking of the police. I will tell you<br>though that the police are unlikely to simply eat a box of donuts that<br>was brought in by a random citizen, as there is often a high chance that<br>someone was actually trying to *hurt* the police by giving them tainted<br>food. They're even sometimes skeptical when *one of their own* brings in<br>food.<br><br>If you happen to be in line at the donut shop with an officer, maybe you<br>can offer to buy a dozen donuts for the squad. Explain that you'd like<br>to give donuts to them, but because of the aforementioned reasons, you'd<br>rather not just drop off a box of donuts to the station. Instead, offer<br>to pay for a dozen that the officer can take possession of directly from<br>the store.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
