<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What would you if the passenger next to you on a flight put down your<br>seat tray and started using it without asking permission?**<br><br>You might try the following:<br><br>1.  Tell him he put the wrong tray down and he should use his own tray<br>    instead of yours. Put his tray down, put his stuff on his tray, and<br>    put yours back up.<br>2.  If he does it again, notify a flight attendant. They will either<br>    direct him to use his own tray and not yours, or if they can't work<br>    out the issue with him, they may be able to re-seat you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
