<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Well, you'll have a lot more time on your hands!<br><br>Anyway, maybe talk to her? Find out why. Maybe there is a physical<br>problem (and if there is, you need to determine if she's really<br>interested in working on fixing it or not). Maybe it's the fact that she<br>pushed three kids out of that hole and she really doesn't want anything<br>else going in there. Or maybe she just doesn't love you anymore. Until<br>you sit down and have an honest conversation with her about this, you'll<br>never know. Talking about things together would solve like 90% of<br>marital problems.<br><br>As for the sex, I can think of at least...*\<counting on<br>fingers\>...*six other things off the top of my head that she can do<br>that don't involve intercourse but still satisfy my needs. Perhaps she<br>could find one of those that she could do instead. Until you find out<br>what the problem is, you won't be able to determine what to do to fix<br>it.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What will you do if your wife doesn\'t want to make love with you<br>anymore?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
