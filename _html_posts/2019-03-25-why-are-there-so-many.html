<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why are there so many \'Trump exonerated\' claims by the right and<br>alt-right when not even US Attorney General (and Trump flunky) William<br>Barr says this?**<br><br>I'm not exactly sure what you've been reading, but AG Barr's report<br>*does* say this. You may be getting confused by the fact that Mueller's<br>team did not render an opinion on the obstruction charge, but the lack<br>of evidence led AG Barr to determine that there is not enough evidence<br>to even think about pursuing an indictment on obstruction charges.<br><br>The report is in two parts:<br><br>> 1.  Russian collusion: *The Special Counsel\'s investigation did<br>>     not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it<br>>     conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence<br>>     the 2016 U.S. presidential election. As the report states:<br>>     \"\T\he investigation did not establish that members of the<br>>     Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian<br>>     government in its election interference activities.\"*<br>> 2.  Obstruction of justice: *After making a \"thorough factual<br>>     investigation\" into these matters, the Special Counsel considered<br>>     whether to evaluate the conduct under Department standards<br>>     governing prosecution and declination decisions but ultimately<br>>     determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment. The<br>>     Special Counsel therefore did not draw a conclusion - one way or<br>>     the other - as to whether the examined conduct constituted<br>>     obstruction...The Special Counsel states that \"while this report<br>>     does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also<br>>     does not exonerate him.\"*<br><br>This verbiage is obviously confusing and problematic, since it doesn't<br>make clear that the President either did or did not do something<br>criminal when it comes to obstruction of justice.<br><br>When this happens, it's up to the Attorney General to review the<br>findings and make his own determination, which he does:<br><br>> *After reviewing the Special Counsel\'s final report on these issues;<br>> consulting with Department officials, including the Office of Legal<br>> Counsel; and applying the principles of federal prosecution that guide<br>> our charging decisions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I<br>> have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special<br>> Counsel\'s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the<br>> President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.*<br><br>He goes on to explain his rationale behind this decision:<br><br>> *In making this determination, we noted that the Special Counsel<br>> recognized that \"the evidence does not establish that the President<br>> was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election<br>> interference,\" and that, while not determinative, the absence of such<br>> evidence bears upon the President\'s intent with respect to<br>> obstruction. Generally speaking, to obtain and sustain an obstruction<br>> conviction, the government would need to prove beyond a reasonable<br>> doubt that a person, acting with corrupt intent, engaged in<br>> obstructive conduct with a sufficient nexus to a pending or<br>> contemplated proceeding. In cataloguing the President\'s actions, many<br>> of which took place in public view, the report identifies no actions<br>> that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to<br>> a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt<br>> intent, each of which, under the Department\'s principles of federal<br>> prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be proven beyond<br>> a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction-ofÂ­-justice offense.*<br><br>Basically, the AG determined that since a corrupt intent could not be<br>established because there was no evidence of any underlying crime<br>related to Russian election interference, the crime of obstruction of<br>justice could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, the AG<br>will not be bringing obstruction charges against the President.<br><br>That amounts to about as much of a complete exoneration as you're going<br>to get.\[1\](#qtmbH){#cite-qtmbH .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-qtmbH){.citation_index} [[Read the Mueller report<br>findings: Barr's letter to<br>Congress](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=234947&url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/read-the-mueller-report-findings-barrs-letter-to-congress){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="foxnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
