<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How does the fact that there is a whistle blower describing evidence<br>that the Trump administration is interfering with mandatory audits for<br>all Presidents\' and Vice Presidents\' taxes strengthen the case for<br>Congress to see President Trump\'s taxes?**<br><br>1.  It doesn't pass the smell test. We also have very public knowledge<br>    that the President has placed his assets in trust and that he<br>    donates his salary (or its equivalent) to charity. Why exactly would<br>    he want to conceal his returns from audit after he has become<br>    President? It makes very little sense.<br>2.  It's not physically possible to prevent the IRS, the very agency<br>    with which you file your taxes, from then subsequently auditing<br>    them. They already possess the returns; the President (or his staff)<br>    cannot stop the audit process. If this is actually occurring, it is<br>    a problem within the IRS, not with the President.<br>3.  The IRS has claimed that they have audited the President's tax<br>    returns. So who is lying? The IRS, or the whistleblower? Has the<br>    IG's office been engaged to look into this whistleblower's claims?<br>4.  EVEN IF ALL THIS WERE TRUE, this *still* doesn't strengthen<br>    Congress' case to see the tax returns.<br>    1.  Congress is known to leak like a sieve, which will cause more<br>        damage to the President than Congress will gain by seeing his<br>        returns. Democrats in Congress have a vested interest in<br>        actually leaking those returns so they can use them as political<br>        ammunition. They have already visually demonstrated the depths<br>        to which they will sink in order to harm their political<br>        enemies. This situation does not seem as if it would be any<br>        different.<br>    2.  If Congress needs to see how laws are being implemented, they<br>        only need to subpoena the IRS agents and directors. If those<br>        people refuse to testify, they should be held in contempt of<br>        Congress. There's been a lot of bloviating about holding<br>        individuals in contempt of Congress, but for all of their tough<br>        talk, I don't see the courts actually holding any of those<br>        contempt charges up for scrutiny.<br>    3.  Congress should have turned those contempt charges over to the<br>        US Attorney's Office for continued investigation. Why has this<br>        not been done? Could it be because Congress' agenda isn't really<br>        determining how effectively the law is being followed, but<br>        actually trying to dig up dirt on the President? Who can say,<br>        really...<br>    4.  Congress is only authorized to see aggregate tax data, not tax<br>        data on identifiable individuals. Congress is not the FBI, they<br>        are not the Inspector General, and they are not the IRS. They<br>        need to stay in their lane.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
