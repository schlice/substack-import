<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can file a lawsuit for slander, not press charges.<br><br>A slander lawsuit alleges that you were damaged by a false statement. It<br>seeks *monetary* damages for harm caused by the statement, such as pain<br>and suffering, damage to reputation, lost wages or a loss of ability to<br>earn a living, and personal emotional reactions such as shame,<br>humiliation, and anxiety.<br><br>The key, however, is false statements. Statements are slanderous<br>only if they are first false. The absolute defense to slander is<br>truth.<br><br>Perjury is lying under oath, but it's highly unlikely you'll see charges<br>for perjury in rape cases, even if the accusation is false. Perjury<br>charges are rare in and of themselves, but even so, courts are unlikely<br>to charge potential rape victims, even if they are actual liars, because<br>of the chilling effect that charging a victim may have. The courts do<br>not want to discourage anyone from reporting, and potential charges if<br>you are accused of lying about the incident may have a chilling effect<br>on rape reporting.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>***Can you press charges for slander and/or perjury if a woman falsely<br>accuses you of rape?***<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
