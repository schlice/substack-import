<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Prior to *case law* existing (which was a *long time ago*), the<br>police could stop and question anyone about anything. They didn't read<br>rights. Heck, there were no rights to read.<br><br>Then some people were arrested, and they didn't think that the police<br>followed the spirit of the Constitution, and they were right, and case<br>law was born. It clarified and expounded on the meaning of those rights<br>in the Constitution and how they should be applied to police work.<br><br>Now, we have *Terry v. Ohio*, which allows police officers to use the<br>"reasonable suspicion" standard to stop anyone on the street who<br>they think is about to commit a crime, or has just committed a crime,<br>and question them. They can then, in conjunction with the stop,<br>frisk that person (which means pat down the outermost layer of<br>clothing) looking for weapons, so that the stop can go safely. This<br>practice, based on the bolded words, is called stop and frisk.<br><br>There is a similar set of laws called stop and ID statutes, and<br>these laws vary by state. They basically say, in their simplest forms,<br>that for the same reasons and the same justifications under which police<br>can stop and frisk, they can also ask you for your name, your personally<br>identifying information (PII), your valid ID if you have it, and what<br>you're doing. Note that in America, you don't have to have a driver's<br>license in your possession unless you're driving a car. So you can't<br>demand that someone on the street has a valid ID.<br><br>So if the police demand identification from an illegal immigrant, and<br>they don't have it, what then? If they give false identifying<br>information, what then?<br><br>The police were initially stopping someone because of suspicion of<br>criminal activity. If their investigation is unable to substantiate that<br>suspicion, the person is released.<br><br>But what if that person is an illegal immigrant? First of all, stop and<br>frisk or stop and ID does not cover legal status in the country. It<br>covers a specific, articulable reason for a stop, and that has to do<br>with criminal activity, not legal immigration status. Secondly,<br>immigration and legal status in this country is a Federal matter, not<br>covered by local police departments. In fact, states are specifically<br>enjoined from enforcing Federal law, because it is Federal, and the<br>police enforce state law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
