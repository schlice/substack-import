For example, the Hebrew language has fewer words than<br>English, so some words in Hebrew have multiple meanings in English. But<br>when translating from Koine Greek, we have exactly the opposite problem.<br>For example, there are at least six words in Greek that we represent<br>with the word *love* in English. If I translate one of them to *love*,<br>which one did the original author mean? Without context cues (or<br>something else added), I won't know. If I'm writing a word-for-word<br>translation, I would just say "love" and leave it at that. If I were<br>writing a thought-for-thought or paraphrase translation, I would<br>translate what the author was intending to say rather than just the word<br>itself.<br><br>Word-for-word translations, therefore, translate each word into the<br>target language, and present an accurate translation, but because of the<br>issues we described above, can result in some misunderstandings.<br><br>Thought-for-thought translators will read a sentence in the source<br>language and translate it to the target language. Some words may change,<br>some words may be added, and some words may be consolidated, but the<br>translator is going for the idea of the sentence rather than<br>word-for-word accuracy.<br><br>Paraphrase translations will expand on that concept, restating a<br>paragraph in different words, but attempting to express the main idea of<br>the paragraph.<br><br>All three translations seek to accurately express what the author was<br>trying to say, but they do it in three different ways. So it really<br>comes down to what you're looking for, and why.<br><br>If you want something that's *readable* so you can read the whole thing<br>through in one sitting and get a good understanding what the writers<br>were trying to say, then choosing a paraphrase translation is a<br>better fit. If you want something that is more closely related to the<br>source material and you want that word-level accuracy, but some of the<br>sentences may not make complete sense, a word-for-word translation<br>is better for you. If you want something somewhere in the middle, choose<br>a thought-for-thought translation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
