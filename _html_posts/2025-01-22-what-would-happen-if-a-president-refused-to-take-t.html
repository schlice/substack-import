<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If the President-elect fails to take the oath of office, then he does<br>not become President. Section 3 of the 20th Amendment says that the Vice<br>President, who took the oath just before the President-elect, would<br>serve as the President, and he would appoint a Vice President.<br><br>In theory, the President-elect should be able to later take the oath<br>and assume the office of the President to which he was elected, but this<br>is untested territory.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
