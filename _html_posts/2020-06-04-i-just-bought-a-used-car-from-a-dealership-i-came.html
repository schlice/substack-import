<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I just bought a used car from a dealership. I came home and realized<br>that the price on the receipt is higher than the price of the car on the<br>internet. What should I do? What are my rights?**<br><br>While the correct answer is *caveat emptor,* you may have a claim if you<br>believe the dealership quoted you one price and sold you on another. An<br>*auto dealer fraud lawyer* can help with unfair business practices such<br>as failure to disclose damages, price packing or deal packing, and<br>misleading dealer add-ons and bundled extras. They can also help you<br>with bait-and-switch scams and misquoted or intentional overcharging.<br><br>If you think this is what happened to you, consider contacting an auto<br>dealer fraud lawyer in your area.<br><br>[[Auto Dealer Fraud Lawyer - Auto Dealer Fraud Attorney, Law Firm<br>Directory](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7ade37&url=https://lawyers.findlaw.com/lawyer/practice/auto-dealer-fraud){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="findlaw.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>If this didn't happen to you, it may be that the price on the Internet<br>was only valid if you did certain things (like use their preferred<br>financing, or buy a certain add-on package). If this is true, then<br>you're probably out of luck. Check the fine print on the Internet ad. It<br>would usually state something like the price is only valid if you<br>finance through the dealer, or something else you have to do to get that<br>price.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
