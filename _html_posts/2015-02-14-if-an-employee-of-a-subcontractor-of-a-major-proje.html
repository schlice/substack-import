<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'m unsure of the contractual relationship here. Are you<br>the GC? Who is getting paid? Would not the sub get paid for his work?\<br>\<br>Presumably, there is a contractual relationship here: payment for work.<br>If the work has been done and the payment has not been made, you will<br>have to take the individual to court to hold him to the terms of the<br>contract. If it\'s longer-term work and payment stops, then work stops<br>too.\<br>\<br>Maybe you could clarify a little?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
