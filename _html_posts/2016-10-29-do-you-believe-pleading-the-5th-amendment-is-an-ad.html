<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This question really only makes sense when asked about a witness, not<br>about the defendant. A defendant shouldn't be asked such direct<br>questions, such that he would have to plead the 5th. The questions for<br>the defendant should be non-incriminating questions. If a prosecutor<br>asks a defendant direct incriminating questions, they shouldn't be<br>surprised if that defendant refuses to answer on the grounds that<br>through his answer, he may incriminate himself.<br><br>When a witness "pleads the 5th," it's a little different. The 5th<br>Amendment to the Constitution prevents a citizen "from being a witness<br>against himself." In other words, by answering the question, you would<br>be admitting guilt in this, or another, crime.<br><br>So back to your question: if someone pleads the 5th, would this be an<br>admission of guilt in the eyes of the jurors?<br><br>The answer is yes, but guilt for *what*, we do not know. The witness is<br>not on trial, the defendant is on trial. If a witness pleads the 5th, he<br>may be involved in the crime at trial, or he may be involved in a<br>related (but not yet prosecuted) crime.<br><br>So in either case, a witness or the defendant pleading the 5th should<br>not hold any relevance for the jury. When a defendant pleads the 5th,<br>the presiding judge will issue instructions to the jury to not regard<br>such a plea as an admission of guilt. When a witness pleads the 5th,<br>there is no way to know why, or for what crime, he is doing so. Juries<br>are instructed to decide the case based on the facts presented. If the<br>defendant or witness cannot produce such fact through testimony, the<br>jury cannot use it as a basis to decide the case, so it is irrelevant.<br>*Why* the person pled the 5th is not relevant. The fact that they did<br>means that evidence was not presented, and the jury cannot use that<br>evidence to aid their decision.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
