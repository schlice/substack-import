<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should advertisers still support Fox's Tucker Carlson after his<br>refusal to apologise for his vile comments about women and child rape<br>victims? Which ones are still doing so, and are they therefore endorsing<br>his opinions?**<br><br>So let me get this straight.<br><br>Tucker Carlson says some offensive things ten years ago on a radio show<br>hosted by *Bubba the Love Sponge* and no one blinked. Because truly, if<br>anyone tuned in to the *Bubba the Love Sponge* show looking for<br>intellectual dialogue, they were drunk.<br><br>Fast forward to today, and Media Matters<br>[essentially(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a62406&url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/11/media/tucker-carlson-misogynistic-comments/index.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cnn.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br>[admitted(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5c3491&url=https://twitter.com/GoAngelo/status/1104969000537214976){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="twitter.com"}]{.qlink_container} that they released these<br>ten year old recordings specifically during a Fox event for advertisers,<br>specifically trying to target ad sales to Fox, and Carlson is supposed<br>to apologize? Because of a targeted hit?<br><br>Carlson, for his part, admitted to the comments, and said that anyone<br>who disagrees with him is welcome to come on his show and debate the<br>topics.<br><br>Let's be honest. If you're digging up ten year old comments in order to<br>be "offended" by them, you are disingenuous. The timing, ***which is<br>freely admitted***, is opportunistic and is nothing more than a smear<br>job. Contrived outrage.<br><br>He's right to not apologize. The fake outrage crowd doesn't deserve an<br>apology.<br><br>If any advertisers pull out of Carlson's show over this, please be sure<br>to let us know who they are. I will stop using their products forthwith.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
