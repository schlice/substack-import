<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What you should do depends on whether or not the police have a search<br>warrant.<br><br>If the police have a warrant, check the warrant to make sure that the<br>address on the warrant is yours. If it is, you have no choice but to let<br>them in to search for the person, even if they literally have the wrong<br>house and the person they are looking for is not associated with you in<br>any way. If the warrant is for the wrong house, advise them that they're<br>at the wrong address.<br><br>If the police do not have a warrant, insist that they have the wrong<br>house and the person is not there. They cannot enter. Let them hang out<br>in front of your house for as long as they wish to waste their time.<br>Hopefully, you already have security cameras in front of your house and<br>you can capture the entire incident and save it in case they damage<br>something. You'll need the video evidence to seek damages from the<br>department for whatever they break.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
