<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can the President of the United States disparage the F.B.I during<br>an investigation and not be considered interfering?**<br><br>Either you don't know the definition of "interfering" is and how it<br>applies to actual law, or you don't believe that the President has a 1st<br>Amendment right to speak out against the government in the same way that<br>everyone else does.<br><br>As far as "interference" goes, interfering with a criminal investigation<br>does not rise to the standard of obstruction of justice in 18 USC ยง 1512<br>(*United States v. Ermoian, 727 F.3d 894, (9th Cir. 2013).* So while it<br>may be something the football referee can call as a penalty, it's not a<br>crime.<br><br>Secondly, the President has as much right to give his opinion about<br>current events as any other citizen of the United States does. In fact,<br>the 1st Amendment is specifically designed to allow citizens to seek<br>redress of grievances they have against the government. So Trump<br>criticizing the FBI is most definitely protected under the 1st<br>Amendment. Not to mention, the FBI works for him! It's his *job* to<br>criticize them, because it's also his job to make them better.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
