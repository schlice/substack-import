<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>An excellent question!<br><br>We can partially glean the answer from what free will will look like in<br>the future kingdom that believers will inherit. Clearly, evil will be<br>defeated, and we will have no desire for sin. Therefore, in heaven, our<br>free will will be limited by the inability to choose what is evil. We<br>will only be able to choose that which is true, noble, right, pure,<br>lovely, and admirable (ref Phillipians 4:8).<br><br>Also, in order to answer the question you posit about free will, we have<br>to come to an understanding about what it is. In my opinion, free will<br>consists of three elements:<br><br>- agency over oneself<br>- at least two choices freely available to pick from<br>- control over our own actions<br><br>If you have these three, you have free will. God knowing which choice<br>you will make doesn't influence your decision in that moment. You still<br>have complete agency over your thoughts and control over your actions,<br>so you still have free will. God may know what you're going to do, but<br>you still have the freedom to choose in the moment. It's a function of<br>being creatures who are bound by time.<br><br>So now to answer the question. You said that if humans were created with<br>free will, then that must mean that we were meant to exist in a realm<br>with evil.<br><br>Knowing what we know now, we can see that this is not true. God created<br>Adam and Eve with free will (they chose to eat the apple), but without a<br>desire for sin, as sin did not enter the world until they made their<br>choice. Without the tempting of the serpent, Eve would not have been<br>coerced into eating the apple, because she had no *desire* for sin. It<br>was the serpent who planted the seeds of doubt and question into Eve's<br>mind. Before the serpent, Adam and Eve existed nearly exactly as we will<br>in heaven, *except that they had an extra choice, provided by the<br>serpent, a choice we will not have in heaven.*<br><br>So knowing this, we at least know that humans can function with full<br>free will *in an environment without evil.* And knowing this, you can<br>see that we were created with the *ability* to live in an environment<br>filled with sin, but without the actual sin. Our free will allows us to<br>function in that environment, even though it wasn't part of the original<br>design.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If humans are created with free will, doesn\'t that suggest that we were<br>meant to exist in a realm between good and evil? Had we not the<br>knowledge of evil, what other could we choose from? (referring to the<br>forbidden fruit).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
