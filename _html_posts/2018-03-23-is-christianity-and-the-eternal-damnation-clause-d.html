It's<br>for everyone.<br><br>Because it applies to everyone.<br><br>John 3:16:<br><br>> *For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that<br>> whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.*<br><br>Notice it says "whoever believes in him." That literally applies to<br>everyone. And then it says that whoever believes in Him "shall not<br>perish." This means that some will perish; clearly, the ones who do not<br>believe in Him.<br><br>Eternal damnation. It's isn't just for agnostics anymore.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
