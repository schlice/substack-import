<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>For Jews, the Shema expresses the essence of Judaism, that God must be<br>loved and obeyed at all times. These words are inscibed on small scrolls<br>contained in a box called a mezzuzah fastened to the doorpost of Jewish<br>homes. The wearing of a small mezzuzah (usually a cylinder) around the<br>neck on a chain is a modern adaptation of the ancient custom.<br><br>The Shema is recorded in Deuteronomy 6:4--9.<br><br>> Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord<br>> your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your<br>> strength. These commandments that I give you today are to be on your<br>> hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at<br>> home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you<br>> get up. Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your<br>> foreheads. Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your<br>> gates.<br><br>Some more relevant verses:<br><br>> You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and<br>> shudder. (James 2:19)<br>><br>> To you it was shown that you might know that the Lord, He is God;<br>> there is no other besides Him. (Deuteronomy 4:35)<br>><br>> For this reason You are great, O Lord God; for there is none like You,<br>> and there is no God besides You, according to all that we have heard<br>> with our ears. (2 Samuel 7:22)<br>><br>> O Lord, there is none like You, nor is there any God besides You,<br>> according to all that we have heard with our ears. (1 Chronicles<br>> 17:20)<br><br>And that's just the tip of the iceberg. There are many verses which<br>support the idea that there is only one God.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
