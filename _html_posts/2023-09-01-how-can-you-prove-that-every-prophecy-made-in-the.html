<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can't prove that. Because each prophecy could have happened<br>spontaneously to someone else.<br><br>But if you believe that the Bible is true (and we have evidence that<br>shows us beyond a reasonable doubt that it is), and the Bible says that<br>all of these prophecies were fulfilled in the life of Jesus, then we<br>have reason to believe that it is true.<br><br>You cannot prove that every prophecy made in the Bible concerning Christ<br>was fulfilled in Him alone. But if you believe in the truth of the<br>Bible, and the Bible says that it happened, then you can rest assured<br>that they all were fulfilled in His sinless life.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
