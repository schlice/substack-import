<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Am I obligated to participate in the meetings that my HOA conducts to<br>discuss issues in the subdivision?**<br><br>As a homeowner, you have the ability to attend any monthly HOA board<br>meeting of your choice. The HOA also holds annual meetings, as required<br>by law. I would highly suggest that you attend, at the very least, the<br>annual meeting. The board will discuss how the year went, and plans for<br>the upcoming years<br><br>It\'s probably not necessary that you attend each and every monthly<br>meeting as a homeowner, unless you have a specific concern that you want<br>the board to address.<br><br>Also, bear in mind that the board can go into executive session at the<br>monthly meeting, as required to protect individual homeowner<br>confidentiality. You cannot attend an executive session. Executive<br>sessions are governed by state law; some states do not allow executive<br>session for anything other than attorneys' meetings, or personnel<br>issues.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
