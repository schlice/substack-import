<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why do you need that? Do you need God to float down from heaven on a big<br>cloud with thundering trumpets and angels singing praises and for God to<br>zap all the evil with His lightning-bolt fingers? Will you believe then?<br><br>The problem with that scenario is that if God does that, *what choice do<br>you have* *but* *to believe that He exists?* That doesn't sound like<br>free will, does it. Because then even the unbelievers will believe.<br><br>Here's a little hint: *God doesn't want unbelievers.* God wants<br>believers. God wants those who *haven't* seen Him, and yet still<br>believe. He wants people who see the evidence all around them and<br>believe in Him without His direct presence compelling their belief.<br><br>Let's also be clear: one day, everyone will believe. One day, every knee<br>will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus is Lord (cf Phil<br>2:9--11). You may not want to, but eventually you'll believe. But those<br>who were compelled to believe will not be saved. Those who did not<br>freely accept Jesus *while they had the opportunity to do so* will not<br>be saved. Even the demons believe in God; they just affirmatively reject<br>Him. Unbelievers will share their fate.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
