<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's the same reason why people are claiming that the Justices "lied" in<br>their confirmation hearings.<br><br>People truly believed that *Roe v. Wade* **was "settled law" and<br>could never be overturned.**<br><br>Indeed, they believed that when the justices talked about "precedent"<br>and *stare decisis*, this was an indication that if a case ever came<br>before the Court questioning the very foundation of *Roe*, the Justices<br>would vote to pass on the case, because somehow *stare decisis* makes<br>the case untouchable.<br><br>The logic doesn't pass muster. And you only need to look at *Plessey v.<br>Ferguson* to understand why. *Plessey* was the case in the late 19th<br>century which decided that racial segregation was Constitutional. It was<br>the "separate but equal" decision. So long as the facilities offered<br>were equal, racial segregation was Constitutional. That decision was<br>"precedent" and was treated as *stare decisis* for over 60 years before<br>the Court, in *Brown v. Board* determined that racial segregation in<br>schools was, in fact, unconstitutional. That was the beginning of the<br>end for the *Plessey* finding, and over the next few years, more<br>decisions were made which functionally overturned the decision.<br><br>But why did they keep it so long? People may have understood that the<br>decision was not Constitutionally accurate, and that *Plessey* actually<br>did violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, but<br>ultimately, it came down to the fact that **people liked the outcome,<br>and so the decision wasn't reviewed.**<br><br>This case is absolutely no different. The Justices are looking to fix an<br>error in a Constitutional decision. Legal scholars have long agreed that<br>the *foundation* of the *Roe* decision was flawed, Constitutionally<br>speaking. But, exactly as in the case of *Plessey*, people liked the<br>outcome, and so the decision wasn't reviewed. However, the draft opinion<br>in *Dobbs* says that the basis on which they wrote the *Roe* decision,<br>as well as the decision on *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, was without<br>merit (the right to privacy in the Constitution). Therefore, because<br>there is no right to privacy in the Constitution, there is no right to<br>an abortion in the Constitution, either.<br><br>\<br><br>Now that all of this is established, why do people believe that<br>interracial marriage and same-sex marriage are next?<br><br>Well, their limited logic goes, if a *sacrosanct ruling* like *Roe* can<br>be overturned, can't the other decisions as well?<br><br>The short answer is yes, they can. However, it is *extremely unlikely*<br>that they ever would.<br><br>But why not? What makes those cases different from this one?<br><br>The first reason is because **the basis upon which those cases were<br>decided is Constitutionally sound.** Both of those cases found that the<br>right is protected under the Equal Protection clause of the 14th<br>Amendment. Knowing this, it would be exceedingly challenging to claim<br>that somehow, the right to interracial marriage or the right to same-sex<br>marriage are somehow unconstitutional.<br><br>The other reason is that there is difference between interracial<br>marriage/same-sex marriage and abortion, and it is the idea of<br>*victimless rights*. Professor Alan Dershowitz coined this term a<br>few weeks ago.<br><br>In the case of interracial marriage or same-sex marriage, does the<br>exercise of the right impact the exercise of anyone else's rights? The<br>answer is no. Therefore, these are *victimless rights.* In contrast,<br>does the exercise of the right to abortion impact the exercise of anyone<br>else's rights? The answer is *potentially*, because at least<br>potentially, the exercise of the right to an abortion impacts the right<br>of the fetus to life. The *Roe* court *passed* on the opportunity to<br>declare whether or not the fetus has such a right, because, at the time,<br>the medical and philosophical communities could not answer the question<br>as to whether or not the fetus is alive, and thus possessing the right<br>to life, and thus to not have that life taken without due process. It<br>appears that this Court is at least willing to state that the fetus<br>*may* have a right to life, and therefore the Court should proceed<br>assuming that it *does*. If that is the case, therefore, the right to an<br>abortion is not a victimless right, and the right to have an<br>abortion must be weighed against the right of the fetus to life.<br><br>\<br><br>TL;DR: People fail to realize that the basis upon which interracial<br>marriage/same-sex marriage are based is Constitutionally sound, unlike<br>the basis upon which *Roe* was built.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why do people think that if the Supreme Court overturns abortion that<br>they would go after same sex marriage next, despite the lack of any<br>substantial movement to do so in the last seven years?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
