<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You, questioner, are under the mistaken belief that Quora is a *debate<br>site*.<br><br>It is not.<br><br>Quora is a question and answer site.<br><br>Someone asks a question, people provide answers. If I answer you, my<br>answer is my own. So too are any comments to my answer. I am under no<br>obligation to debate with you. If you feel your viewpoint is correct and<br>you absolutely want to refute my answer, you are more than welcome to<br>write your own answer from your own viewpoint.<br><br>If you want a site where people engage in debate, feel free to make<br>**[MyLincolnDouglasDebateSite.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=70059c&url=http://MyLincolnDouglasDebateSite.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="mylincolndouglasdebatesite.com"}]{.qlink_container}**<br>(assuming it's not already taken because that would be downright *cool*)<br>and allow people to engage in Lincoln-Douglas style debates from all<br>over the internet. Then let your users judge the debate in exactly the<br>same way as in the NFL. Yes, I was in the NFL. Okay, it's the National<br>Forensic League. Which they have had to change, because there's some<br>other organization in America that also uses NFL. Whatever. Now they're<br>called the NSDA (National Speech and Debate Association).<br><br>*But in any case, that's not Quora.*<br><br>I block much more frequently, and with much less regret, now that I've<br>been on the site for some time. I don't have a problem with it. The<br>problem is not mine. There are some people who just *insist* on arguing<br>with me. Like I'm going to have some great revelation or something.<br>Yeah, I don't think so. Again, as I mentioned, if you really believe so<br>wholeheartedly in your point of view, write your own answer. Quora would<br>prefer it, since answers generate site traffic. Comments, not so much.<br><br>People tend to argue for removing the ability to disable comments<br>because of the altruistic. If every user on Quora shared the same noble<br>goals, fine. But not all users have the greater good in mind. Some do,<br>and I have altered my answers, or even gone back and revisited things I<br>thought I knew. I once deleted an answer completely because my belief<br>(from college onward) was actually wrong. Oh well, nobody's perfect.<br>However, if our answers truly belong to us, then we should be able to<br>selectively maintain our answers and all comments on our answers.<br><br>(EDIT) People still are not understanding the correct way to handle<br>answers which are wrong. They still think the best way to handle wrong<br>answers are to shout them down in the comments to that answer, as if<br>you'll change the mind of the answerer.<br><br>This approach literally helps no one.<br><br>So let me, once again, share how we deal with wrong answers.<br><br>Let's say someone writes an answer to a question that sounds legit, but<br>is totally wrong. They've disabled comments. What do you do?<br><br>Here's what you do:<br><br>- Downvote the answer. The more downvotes an answer gets, the further<br>  down in the list of answers it will move, and will eventually be<br>  collapsed from view due to downvotes.<br>- Report the answer as "Factually Incorrect." State your reasons why it<br>  is Factually Incorrect in the Comments section of the Report, and let<br>  Quora handle it. Don't worry, when you Report an answer, Quora<br>  automatically downvotes the answer.<br>- Alternatively, you can write your own answer that is Factually<br>  Correctâ„¢. Since your answer is right, it should get more upvotes,<br>  correct? Remember, don't call out the answerer in your answer, but<br>  feel free to call out the answer by saying, "Other answers are telling<br>  you to do X, but that is totally wrong, and I'm an expert so here's<br>  why that's wrong." And off you go, you're on your way to 1K upvotes!<br><br>We don't discredit wrong answers by forcefully removing them or starting<br>arguments with the answerer (which gets you nowhere but a BNBR strike).<br>We discredit wrong answers by writing *better* answers.<br><br>(*Incidentally, this is exactly how we should handle hate speech, and<br>other speech we don't like. We don't argue with them, or shout them<br>down, or get them cancelled. We stand up to* *bad* *speech with*<br>*more* *speech, not* *less.*)<br><br>Think about this: when someone Googles the question, which answer comes<br>up? The one with the most upvotes. Clearly, the *correct* answer should<br>get all the upvotes, and the wrong answer should get all the downvotes.<br>Rely on the community to help you; make sure that the correct answer is<br>written, and you explain (politely, not personally attacking) why the<br>other answer is factually incorrect. **This is why it's so crucial that<br>the correct answer is its own answer and not a comment to someone else's<br>answer.**<br><br>And this helps Quora as a whole: answers get site clicks, whereas<br>comments do not. Quora has no interest in forcing comments to stay on<br>since they don't generate site traffic. It is only answers which<br>generate site traffic.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
