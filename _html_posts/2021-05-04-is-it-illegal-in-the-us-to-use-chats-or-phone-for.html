<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think it might be actionable if the aggressor is "making an obscene<br>phone call" which may be considered sexual harassment. In the case of an<br>obscene phone call, he would be using his own harassing words to provide<br>for his own gratification. You could argue that the pretext of the call<br>was something else, but was actually sexual harassment. If you think<br>this is what happened, you should talk to an attorney in your area.<br><br>However, if he was just listening to you willingly speaking and using<br>your words as gratification, it is probably not actionable. How he uses<br>your words is his business. You've willingly spoken your words; you were<br>not coerced into doing so. Misrepresenting his intention in listening to<br>your words simply violates your trust, it doesn't necessarily<br>violate a law.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it illegal in the US to use chats or phone for sexual gratification<br>under false pretense?
