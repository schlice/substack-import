<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Recognize that the problem is not for the Christian to resolve. The<br>problem is for *you* to resolve.**<br><br>Regardless of what the Christian does or does not believe, your lack of<br>respect for them is exactly that: your lack of respect. Nothing<br>*they* do is going to earn your respect, because (I presume) they would<br>have to change something fundamental about themselves before you would<br>respect them. Note that you didn't tell us what about Christians is<br>causing you to not respect them, so I am presuming that you believe<br>something fundamental about them is causing you to fail to respect them.<br><br>Asking someone else to change in order to *earn* your respect is<br>anathema to normal human interactions.<br><br>The sherpas who accompany hikers up Mt. Everest will often say something<br>similar to this: "If conditions on the mountain are not to your liking,<br>change your liking." In other words, it's not our responsibility to<br>change the Mountain to suit you. It's your responsibility to change your<br>liking to suit the Mountain.<br><br>Similarly, it's not the Christian's responsibility to change anything<br>about themselves to suit you. It's up to you to change your thinking so<br>you can properly interact with them.<br><br>If you can't, well, then I guess you'll never respect them, and that'll<br>be the end of it. And the Christian will go on about his or her merry<br>way, you know, *still being a Christian,* and you still won't respect<br>them. They probably won't lose a wink of sleep over it, either. They're<br>not trying to please you. They're similarly not trying to harm or anger<br>you either. But if you choose to dislike something about them, to the<br>point to which you lose respect for them, you must recognize that this<br>is your *choice*. No one is forcing you to believe this way. The<br>Christian certainly does not force you to believe that way. You do that<br>all on your own. You are in control of you. No one else makes you<br>believe as you do.<br><br>Recognize that the problem here is not within the Christian, but within<br>yourself. **You may not control how others act, but you can control how<br>you respond to how others act.**<br><br>To quote from that old dusty book of stories those wacky Christians call<br>"the Bible":<br><br>\"Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother\'s eye and pay<br>no attention to the plank in your own eye?" --- Matthew 7:3<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**How do I bring myself to believe that Christians are respectable?<br>Don\'t give me some \"gOd Is ReAl\" crap, I don\'t believe in that. But<br>how can I learn to respect Christians?**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
