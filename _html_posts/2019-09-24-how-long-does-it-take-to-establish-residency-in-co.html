<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How long does it take to establish residency in Colorado once you move<br>there?**<br><br>Residency in any state (including Colorado) occurs when you *arrive* in<br>a state and *state your intention* to live in that state.<br>Congratulations, you're a state resident.<br><br>Generally, *proof* of residency will consist of something you retain to<br>show that you actually do mean to fulfill your intention to stay here,<br>like a utility bill or a rental agreement.<br><br>You'll need one of those when you go get your license. You have 30 days<br>to switch your license to Colorado, and you have 90 days to transfer<br>your registration for your car. You can even [[start the transfer<br>process<br>online](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ced853&url=https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/dmv/new-colorado-0){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="colorado.gov"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>Residency for in-state tuition purposes is completely different<br>and usually requires you being a state resident for a period of time,<br>either 6 or 12 months.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
