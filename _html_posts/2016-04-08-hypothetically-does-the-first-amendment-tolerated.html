<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The First Amendment says, as you said, \"Congress shall make no law<br>respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free<br>exercise thereof.\" This means the government cannot establish a state<br>religion, nor can it prevent you from practicing whatever religion you<br>choose. The First Amendment does not say that once you apply a<br>uniform to your body, you can no longer practice a religion.<br><br>The problem we run into is the unwritten \"separation of church and<br>state\" that has become so popular over the last 60 years. The First<br>Amendment simply says that the government can\'t endorse a religion,<br>which means that the government itself can\'t write a law endorsing a<br>religion. A military member (essentially an agent of the government)<br>practicing a religion (essentially endorsing it) is not a violation of<br>the First Amendment, because the very same statement which says that<br>Congress can\'t make a state religion *ALSO* says that the<br>government cannot prohibit the *free exercise* thereof. That means<br>that if an agent of the government wants to practice a religion, the<br>government is specifically enjoined from prohibiting that practice.<br><br>That\'s why Mikey Weinstein\'s Freedom From Religion Foundation is so<br>very dangerous. He claims that the First Amendment guarantees that you<br>can be free *from* religion, not just be free to practice whatever<br>religion you choose, or none at all. This implies that religion, and its<br>free exercise, can actually be prohibited in certain places, namely<br>anywhere where someone not of that religion is present. Therefore, the<br>religious practice of \"proselytizing\" would be prohibited based on<br>Weinstein\'s definition.<br><br>However, the Constitution does not read this way, nor has it ever been<br>interpreted in this way. The Constitution prohibits *the government*<br>from making laws which endorse, or prohibit, religion, or its free<br>exercise. Government agents, such as military members, may practice a<br>religion, but they cannot write orders which \"order\" people to<br>participate in a religion, or to practice any particular religion.<br><br>Some commanders (military officers, not cadets) at the Academy would<br>tell their cadets, \"I\'m participating in \<religious_event\> this<br>Saturday. You are encouraged to go; you are not ordered to go.\"<br>Weinstein\'s contention is that constitutes a *de facto* order to go<br>because \"encouragement\" from a commander is tantamount to an unspoken<br>order (despite the fact that the same commander, in the same sentence,<br>said you are not ordered to go). His argument is that the military<br>climate would lead itself to believe that the \"not ordered to go\" part<br>would be ignored and the first part would be considered a de facto<br>order.<br><br>There is a religious culture at the Academy. And it is largely<br>Protestant. Look at the Cadet Chapel (if there was ever an indication<br>that military members could participate in religion without endorsing<br>it, the very existence of the Cadet Chapel proves that).<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-9941fea18b2ed8f4d29b86f5299fffce){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-9941fea18b2ed8f4d29b86f5299fffce"<br>master_w="3264" master_h="2448"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>The upstairs area, the grandest area in the Chapel, is the Protestant<br>worship area, which holds 1200 people. Immediately below the upstairs<br>doors (down the steps below ground level) is the Catholic Chapel, which<br>holds 600 people. Behind the Catholic Chapel is the Jewish Chapel which<br>can hold 100. We then have two All-Faiths Rooms which can be set up in<br>any configuration. Currently, one of the rooms is set up for Buddhist<br>worship.<br><br>The desires of military members to practice their faith must be balanced<br>with the desires of those who choose to not exercise any faith, as the<br>Constitution allows. To that end, there can be no pressure to<br>participate in any religion. There can be no reprisals for not<br>participating in a religion. There can be no special treatment given to<br>anyone of any particular faith, and there can be no negative<br>consequences for failure to participate in any given faith. This leaves<br>you free to talk about your religion. You can \"proselytize:\" tell<br>people about the benefits of practicing your religion (none of which<br>have anything to do with your military career). Most sane people can<br>make this distinction in their minds quite easily.<br><br>This is the rule, and is abundantly clear, at the Academy. And even when<br>people try, wholeheartedly, to ensure this remains the order of the day,<br>misinterpretations and the few who fail to follow orders cause the<br>majority to look bad.<br><br>*(Full disclosure: I was Catholic at the time I attended the Academy<br>\1990-1994\. I am no longer Catholic; I am officially a<br>non-denominational Christian. My roommate was Protestant. One of my<br>roommates was Mormon. We\'re all still good friends.)*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
