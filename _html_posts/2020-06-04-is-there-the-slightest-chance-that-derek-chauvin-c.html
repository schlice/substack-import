<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Not that he deserves it, but is there the slightest chance that Derek<br>Chauvin could find an impartial jury?**<br><br>It is especially for people like Derek Chauvin that the concept of<br>"everyone has the right to an impartial jury" exists. You may believe<br>that his *actions* deserve punishment, but that should not include<br>losing the right to an impartial jury. We are nothing as a nation if we<br>so easily dispose of our rights when we feel someone doesn't "deserve"<br>them. Don't fall into that trap. Chauvin deserves an impartial jury.<br><br>However, an "impartial" jury is not a jury comprised only of people who<br>have no opinion about the case. In today's climate, that will be nearly<br>impossible to find. What an "impartial" jury legally consists of is<br>jurors who are simply willing to decide the case only on the basis of<br>the evidence presented, and ignoring their own<br>bias.\[1\](#ckmhu){#cite-ckmhu .citation_link} In the court's view,<br>there are three safeguards which ensure that the jury does just that:<br><br>- *Voire dire*, or the process by which lawyers can remove jurors who<br>  they believe cannot decide a case impartially<br>- The ability of the judge and counsel to watch jury deliberations<br>- The ability of jurors to report unusual behavior to the court before a<br>  verdict is read<br><br>In *this* respect, I believe there are enough good, smart people to act<br>as jurors, who can logically put aside their biases and decide a case on<br>the facts presented alone.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ckmhu){.citation_index} [[Impartial<br>Jury](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8eb1c9&url=https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/amendment-06/07-impartial-jury.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="justia.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
