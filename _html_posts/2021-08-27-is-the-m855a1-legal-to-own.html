<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer, as with all "is this legal" questions, is "it depends."<br><br>The M855A1 is a 5.56 mm ammunition for M4 Carbine rifles the M-249 SAW,<br>and the M16A2, or any medium rifle with a 1--7 twist in its rifling. The<br>M855A1 is a round optimized for the M4's shorter barrel, where the M855<br>was optimized for the M16.<br><br>The only problem is that M855A1 ammo is not available for civilian<br>purchase. So if someone is selling M855A1 ammunition, they somehow got<br>the ammunition from the military and is out there selling it as a<br>private seller. It's not available to be resold yet.<br><br>I'd avoid buying ammunition that is not available for sale to civilians.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is the M855A1 legal to own?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
