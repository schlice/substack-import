<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's true that for the first 300 years or so, Christians didn't use the<br>cross as a symbol. They used fish and shepherd's crooks, doves, and even<br>boat anchors. But the cross didn't become a thing until at least 300 AD.<br><br>Why?<br><br>The Roman cross was a horrifying symbol, a symbol of oppression used by<br>an authoritative regime to control and cower the masses. It wasn't until<br>the Christianization of the Roman empire and the ending of the practice<br>of crucifixion that anyone started using the symbol.<br><br>But it's not a symbol of power, as some of the other commenters here are<br>saying. It's a symbol of suffering. It's a reminder of what Christ<br>suffered to pay for our sins. And to do that for us sinners? "But God<br>demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners,<br>Christ died for us." (Romans 5:8 NIV). Christ *suffered on that cross*<br>to pay for our sins.<br><br>Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Whoever wants to be my disciple must<br>deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me." (Matthew 16:24<br>NIV). What did he mean by "take up their cross"? Did he mean "carry a<br>cross" like he carried his own cross up to Golgotha? *Or was he<br>referring to preparing to be crucified for their faith, as he was?*<br><br>In fact, if you look at the scripture, he was referring to preparing to<br>be crucified. We need to be prepared to face our deaths to proclaim him.<br>And when Satan offered Jesus all the kingdoms of the world for just<br>following him, we need to recognize that we are being offered the same<br>bargain. But Jesus reminds us that Satan is a liar and his bargain is a<br>scam. "What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit<br>their soul?" (Mark 8:36 NIV)<br><br>But Jesus offers us life. "Whoever tries to keep their life will lose<br>it, and whoever loses their life will preserve it." (Luke 17:33 NIV)<br>"Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for<br>my sake will find it." (Matthew 10:39 NIV)<br><br>For those who "lose their lives," for those who follow "in the way of<br>the cross" and lose their lives for him will save them. *This* is<br>what it means to take up your cross and follow him.<br><br>This is what the cross signifies. It is a symbol of power through<br>suffering. It is a symbol which signifies that we must be willing to die<br>for his sake. We must be willing to die to sin and be reborn in him.<br>This is why the cross is powerful.<br><br>Suffering is powerful. God uses our suffering for his good, as it is<br>when he is most powerful. "\I<br> order to keep me from becoming<br>conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to<br>torment me. Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me.<br>But he said to me, "**My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is<br>made perfect in weakness**." Therefore I will boast all the more gladly<br>about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why,<br>for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in<br>persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong." (2<br>Cor 12:7--10 NIV) The symbol of the cross reminds us that we are<br>perfected through suffering, just as Christ's suffering was the perfect<br>sacrifice to pay for our sins.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>For the first 300 years of the Church, the Cross was NOT a Christian<br>symbol. Why is it being used now as a Christian symbol? Who introduced<br>it?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
