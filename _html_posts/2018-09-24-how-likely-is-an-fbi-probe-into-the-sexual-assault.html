<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How likely is an FBI probe into the sexual assault allegations against<br>Brett Kavanaugh?**<br><br>Extremely unlikely.<br><br>First of all, the Senate Judiciary Committee has no authority to direct<br>the FBI to investigate the allegations. The FBI does not work for<br>Congress, and Congress does not have the authority to direct the FBI to<br>do any independent investigations. If Congress learns of a Federal<br>crime, they can indeed refer the evidence of that crime to the FBI for<br>investigation, but there is no evidence that a Federal crime took place<br>here.<br><br>Secondly, the FBI does *background investigations* on Supreme Court<br>nominees, at the behest and the direction of the nominator. In other<br>words, the FBI works for the White House. It has already conducted<br>multiple background investigations on Judge Kavanaugh and it has<br>presented that information to the White House. The only way that the FBI<br>is even allowed to investigate these allegations is if the White House<br>decides to re-open the latest background investigation on Judge<br>Kavanaugh and to direct them to investigate this new allegation. The<br>White House has already stated its reluctance to re-open the<br>investigation, as it is virtually impossible to determine without any<br>evidence and with spotty recollection of over 36 years ago whether or<br>not the allegations are credible.<br><br>Now, before you hit the comments to trash me for calling Dr. Ford a<br>liar, I can tell you that she most likely did not lie. However, her<br>memory is likely faulty, and several pieces of evidence show this to be<br>the case.<br><br>Therefore, unless the White House has a change of heart, there will be<br>no FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
