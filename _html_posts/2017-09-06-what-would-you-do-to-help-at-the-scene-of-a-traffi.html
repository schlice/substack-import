<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If the person is not in immediate danger, you treat them where they lie.<br>If you cannot safely treat the person without being in danger yourself,<br>you either have to divert traffic or move the person. It's very<br>dangerous to move the person, and you would only want to do so if<br>leaving them where they are poses more of a risk to their life than<br>moving them. You risk severely injuring the person by moving them, so<br>only move them if their life is in danger by leaving them.<br><br>Outside of those narrow exceptions, if you can treat the victim *in<br>situ*, do so. In American first aid, we use the three B's to prioritize<br>first responder medical care:<br><br>- Breathing<br>- Bleeding<br>- Broken Bones<br><br>We treat breathing before bleeding because the victim will die faster<br>from not breathing than they will from bleeding out.<br><br>Ideally, we make sure that they are breathing and not bleeding to death.<br>If those two things are accomplished, ideally we *do nothing.* We call<br>911 and stay on the phone with the dispatcher until help arrives. Keep<br>the victim conscious and calm. Don't give water other than small sips.<br>Treat for shock: *If the face is red, raise the head; if the face is<br>pale, raise the tail.* Don't move the head if the victim is unconscious.<br>They have to be able to lift their own head. If you raise the head while<br>the victim has a broken spinal column, you could permanently paralyze<br>the victim for life. Try to avoid that. But if the victim's pulse starts<br>to get rapid and shallow, and their face starts to pale, try to calm<br>them down, and elevate their feet above their heart. Keep any other<br>movement of the body to a minimum unless the victim chooses to get up<br>and move.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
