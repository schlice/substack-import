<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why do some states require a homeowner to have a "duty to retreat"<br>from an intruder before using lethal force? Shouldn't all people have<br>the right to protect your home, your family, and your life from anyone<br>willing to enter your home illegally?**<br><br>That's the beauty of the state system. The voters in that state get to<br>determine the kinds of laws that will be present in that state. Since we<br>have such wild variation in population types across the country, the<br>local governments are best able to meet the needs of the local voters.<br>Therefore, some states have a duty to retreat because that's what the<br>majority of that state's voters want.<br><br>If you don't like the laws in your state, you can either elect people<br>who will change those laws, or move to another state.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
