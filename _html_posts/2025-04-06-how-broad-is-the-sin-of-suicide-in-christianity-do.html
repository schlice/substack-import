title: '"How broad is the sin of suicide in Christianity? Does knowing of danger but
  willingly continuing a dangerous action count as suicide, like Jesus not fleeing

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The motivation is key. *Why* you are sacrificing yourself matters.<br><br>Are you sacrificing yourself to save others? *Isn't that what Jesus<br>did?* Didn't He sacrifice Himself to be the Lamb of God who takes away<br>the sins of the world?<br><br>The Bible also tells us:<br><br>> *Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for<br>> his friends. \-- John 15:13 ESV*<br><br>The writer is describing Jesus, but the idea is the same.<br><br>\<br><br>Clearly then, taking your own life *selfishly* is a wholly different<br>story. *Suicide is selfish.*<br><br>Let me explain before you rush to the comments.<br><br>Now, while it's true that not everyone suicidal thinks this way, some<br>people believe that *the world will be a better place without them.*<br>Maybe it's family, who they wrongly think to whom they are a burden.<br>Maybe it is the world. But believing that the world will be a better<br>place *without* you in it is just as dubious as believing the world<br>is a better place *with* you in it. That's pretty selfish.<br><br>Some people have pain in their lives. So much pain that they can't live<br>with it. So rather than doing the hard work to overcome the pain, they<br>choose to take the easy way out. Some video game designers, upon the<br>character blowing themselves up or falling off a cliff, characterize<br>this as "the coward's way out." I do not personally, but I understand<br>the thought. Still, rather than doing the hard work, they choose the<br>easy work. To me, that's also pretty selfish.<br><br>Finally, God has plans for you. They are good plans. *But that doesn't<br>mean that there won't be pain along the way*. The greatest characters<br>are seared with scars. Churchill said, "If you're going through Hell,<br>keep going." That's the truth. We have to endure the pain to get to the<br>paradise. Christ said it:<br><br>> *I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In<br>> the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome<br>> the world." \-- John 16:33 ESV*<br><br>Jesus is the model. Go through the pain to get the reward.<br><br>So yes, if you end your life yourself, by your own choice, and not to<br>save others, that is what is considered suicide, and it is indeed a sin.<br>And it's a bad one because you die before you can repent of your sin.<br>You take that sin to the grave, which is quite a dangerous thing to do.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
