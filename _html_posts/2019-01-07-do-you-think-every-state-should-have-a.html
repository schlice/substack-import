<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you think every state should have a "Stand your ground" law? If<br>someone breaks into your house and threatens your family, would you<br>rather retreat or engage the threat?**<br><br>I think every state (and the voters in that state) should decide for<br>themselves how they want to structure their laws. I don't want anyone<br>outside of that state to tell that state how it should work its laws. If<br>a state decides not to incorporate a Stand Your Ground or Castle<br>Doctrine law, that's up to that state.<br><br>That said, in my personal opinion, I think that all states *should* have<br>Castle Doctrine laws.<br><br>The Castle Doctrine comes from the old adage, "a man's home is his<br>castle." Residents should feel completely safe within their own homes.<br>To that end, residents should have the full authority of the state to<br>use whatever force is necessary, up to and including deadly force, to<br>counter a threat within their own home.<br><br>Whether or not they have Stand Your Ground laws (or the opposite of<br>"duty to retreat" laws) should be up to the residents of that state.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
