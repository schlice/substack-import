<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The United States is not a monetary sovereignty. The United States *has*<br>monetary sovereignty over its currency. It gets to define the currency,<br>and issue and destroy currency.<br><br>If there is a deficit, it may affect the United States\' credit rating<br>in other countries. In general, though, the United States has run a<br>deficit for many years, and our credit rating with other countries is<br>generally fairly stable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
