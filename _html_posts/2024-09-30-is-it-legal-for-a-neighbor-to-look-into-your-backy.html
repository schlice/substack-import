<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is "it depends."<br><br>And in the United States, it first depends on which state you're in, and<br>from where you are "looking into the back yard."<br><br>For example, if you have a privacy fence but I'm in my own house next<br>door which has a second story on it, it's legal for me to look out my<br>window and look into your yard. It's also perfectly legal for me to<br>mount a security camera and have it see your yard, so long as it is<br>performing nominal security of my own property. Incidental viewing of<br>your property is legal if it happens while I'm surveilling my own<br>property.<br><br>One of the other commenters said something along the lines of "My wife<br>doesn't care if someone looks into our yard and sees her in the pool or<br>the hot tub. She's usually nude."<br><br>In the scenario I gave (a house next door with a second story),<br>depending on the state, that nudity *might be illegal*.<br><br>In New Jersey, for example, if your display of nudity, ***even in your<br>own backyard,*** could be seen by someone who did not *affirmatively<br>consent to seeing such nudity*, that person could be charged with<br>indecent exposure. Worse, if a child sees that nude person, the nude<br>person could also be charged with contributing to the delinquency of a<br>minor.<br><br>So the answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends." Check with an<br>attorney who is licensed in your local area to get the final answer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
