<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there any real importance connected to Trump being the only<br>president impeached in the first term?**<br><br>There would have been, had there been real evidence of crimes being<br>committed and had there been broad, bipartisan support for articles of<br>impeachment.<br><br>What you have here, that you have never had before in any presidential<br>impeachment in history, is exactly what Alexander Hamilton warned us<br>against: impeachment based solely on which party controls the House.<br><br>This was a partisan show, not an impeachment. So the fact that it<br>happened in the first term is entirely insignificant, a footnote in<br>history. It shows more that this was nothing more than a three-year<br>temper tantrum on the part of the Democrats who are still butt hurt that<br>the pantsuited she-devil who they had anointed to become President was<br>overthrown by a poorly spray-tanned and horribly coiffed reality TV<br>star.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
