<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the lives saved by guns by civilians vs. life's taken by<br>guns?**<br><br>Make sure you ask the question correctly. Of the 33,000 deaths per year<br>involving guns, roughly 2/3 of those are suicides. Should we count<br>those?<br><br>Let's assume we're smart and we don't count those. Of the remaining<br>11,000, about 8,000 of them were criminal killing other criminals while<br>committing crimes. The remaining 3,000 includes 1,000 killed in police<br>activity, and 2,000 which are true homicides not involving multiple<br>criminals or criminal activity, and accidents.<br><br>So if we're honest, we're only looking at roughly 2,000 people a year<br>killed in true violence or accidents.<br><br>We know, even by the most stringent estimates, that about 40,000 crimes<br>a year are stopped with a gun, most of them stopped without a single<br>shot being fired. The mere presence of a gun stops the crime.<br>Realistically, that's closer to somewhere between 800,000 and 1 million,<br>but most of those are never reported because no shots were fired, so no<br>crime is reported.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
