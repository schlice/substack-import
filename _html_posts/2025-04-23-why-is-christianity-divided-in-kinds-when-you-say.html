<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Think of this quote which was (supposedly) said by St. Augustine:<br><br>> *In essentials, unity; in non-essentials, liberty; in all things,<br>> charity*<br><br>What this means in the context in which you asked is that while all<br>Christian denominations agree on the essentials (the nature of God, the<br>nature of the Trinity, the nature of Christ, the means for salvation,<br>etc), the Bible allows us to disagree on the non-essentials.<br><br>And sometimes, those disagreements are severe enough that people<br>self-sort into groups who believe in a like-minded way. Those groups<br>form *denominations*.<br><br>Because the Bible allows us to have liberty on the non-essentials, we<br>have many denominations. We all share common beliefs about the<br>essentials, but we have sometimes very different views of the<br>non-essentials. This is not universally bad.<br><br>\<br><br>What *becomes* bad is when we start to deviate on the *essentials*.<br>And if you're looking from the outside in, you never know if you're<br>looking at a disagreement on non-essentials or essentials.<br><br>For example, here's some areas of essential disagreement:<br><br>1\. Salvation and Good Works:<br><br>- Most denominations, like Protestantism, emphasize the importance of<br>  faith alone as the basis for salvation, with good works being a result<br>  of that faith.<br>- Some, like Catholicism, believe that salvation requires both faith and<br>  good works, with good works being a necessary component of living out<br>  a Christian life.<br><br>2\. The Trinity and the Nature of God:<br><br>- Unitarianism denies the Trinity, believing that God is a single entity<br>  rather than three persons.<br>- Mainline Christian denominations, like Catholicism, Orthodoxy, and<br>  most Protestant groups, affirm the Trinity, believing in one God<br>  existing in three persons: Father, Son (Jesus), and Holy Spirit.<br><br>3\. Scripture and Authority:<br><br>- Different denominations have varying approaches to interpreting<br>  scripture and the authority of tradition.<br>- Most, like most Protestant groups, emphasize the Bible as the primary<br>  source of authority, while others, like Catholicism and Orthodoxy,<br>  give more weight to church tradition and the authority of the early<br>  Church Fathers.<br><br>4\. The Role of the Church:<br><br>- Some denominations, like Presbyterianism, emphasize the importance of<br>  the church as a community of believers, while others, like<br>  Catholicism, emphasize the hierarchical structure of the church with a<br>  clear line of authority.<br>- Different denominations also have varying views on the role of the<br>  church in society and its relationship with the secular world.<br><br>5\. Sacraments and Rituals:<br><br>- Denominations have many different understandings of which sacraments<br>  are considered essential and the nature of these sacraments.<br>- Some denominations, like Catholicism and Orthodoxy, recognize a<br>  greater number of sacraments than others.<br>- Even worse, *within the same denomination*, there can be varying<br>  practices and interpretations of sacraments.<br><br>Differences between denominations on essentials is problematic. But<br>Christianity itself is not a religion, and there is no central governing<br>authority. This sort of division is a natural outgrowth of that feature.<br><br>That said, we Christians can continually pray for and work towards<br>agreement at least on the essentials.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
