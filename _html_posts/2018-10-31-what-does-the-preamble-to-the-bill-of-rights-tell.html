<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> One of the many points of contention between Federalists, who<br>> advocated a strong national government, and Anti-Federalists, who<br>> wanted power to remain with state and local governments, was the<br>> Constitution's lack of a bill of rights that would place specific<br>> limits on government power. Federalists argued that the Constitution<br>> did not need a bill of rights, because the people and the states kept<br>> any powers not given to the federal government. Anti-Federalists held<br>> that a bill of rights was necessary to safeguard individual liberty.<br>><br>> Madison, then a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, altered<br>> the Constitution's text where he thought appropriate. However, several<br>> representatives, led by Roger Sherman, objected, saying that Congress<br>> had no authority to change the wording of the Constitution. Therefore,<br>> Madison's changes were presented as a list of amendments that would<br>> follow Article VII.<br>><br>> The House approved 17 amendments. Of these, the Senate approved 12,<br>> which were sent to the states for approval in August 1789. Ten<br>> amendments were approved (or ratified). Virginia's legislature was the<br>> final state legislature to ratify the amendments, approving them on<br>> December 15, 1791.\[1\](#VWWJJ){#cite-VWWJJ .citation_link}<br><br>In order to quell dissent between the Federalists and the<br>Anti-Federalists (and in order to get all the states to sign the<br>Constitution, the promise was made that the first Congress would pass a<br>Bill of Rights, which is very similar to, and strongly influenced by,<br>the Virginia Bill of Rights.<br><br>The preamble to the Bill of Rights begins this way:<br><br>> THE Conventions of a number of the States having at the time of their<br>> adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent<br>> misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and<br>> restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of<br>> public confidence in the Government, will best insure the beneficent<br>> ends of its institution<br><br>The preamble basically says that in order for "a number of the States"<br>to ratify the Constitution, they had to add protections in the form of<br>"declaratory and restrictive clauses" "in order to prevent<br>misconstruction or abuse of \the Constitution's\ powers\.\"<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-VWWJJ){.citation_index} [[Bill of Rights - Bill of Rights<br>Institute](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b4bb7a&url=https://billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/bill-of-rights/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="billofrightsinstitute.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
