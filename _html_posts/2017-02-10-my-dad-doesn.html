<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: no.<br><br>Longer answer: While you don't have to speak English to drive a car, or<br>get a license, you still have to follow the law regarding DUI. The<br>native language of the person driving the car doesn't change his or her<br>blood alcohol content, and there is no provision in the driving laws of<br>any state that I know of which would require that the driver fully<br>understand exactly what the officers were doing in order for them to do<br>their jobs.<br><br>Officers can suspect a driver of DUI (they did), stop that driver (they<br>did), and perform field sobriety tests for DUI (and clearly, he<br>understood enough to perform the field sobriety test or to blow into a<br>BAC tester), which are required of every driver, regardless of native<br>language.<br><br>Therefore, whether or not the driver had a clear understanding of the<br>officers is not material. Unless you're claiming that he wasn't actually<br>drunk, he just failed his field sobriety test because he didn't<br>understand what the officers were asking him. This is highly unlikely,<br>but perhaps that is the case you can make.<br><br>I suspect, however, that the officers stopped the car which was being<br>operated in a manner which suggested the driver may be drunk, there was<br>a strong odor of alcohol from the driver, and the driver blew a XXX on<br>the meter, which is X times over the legal limit. If the police have<br>this sort of evidence, language is irrelevant.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
