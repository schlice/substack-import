<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why do many different diseases end with the term sclerosis?<br><br>Because many different diseases produce "scars," otherwise known as<br>*scleroses*. Thus, multiple sclerosis means "many scars."<br><br>In MS, when the myelin sheath is destroyed by the immune system, it is<br>replaced with a plaque made of cholesterol, primarily. These areas of<br>*demyelination* cause nerve signals to be attenuated, so they don't<br>travel at the same pulse frequency, causing the muscle response on the<br>distant end to be a different intensity than when it was launched from<br>the brain. This causes the various symptoms of MS.<br><br>Another disease which ends in "sclerosis" is ALS, or amyotrophic lateral<br>sclerosis (also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease). In this disease, a very<br>similar disease process occurs, but instead of in the Central Nervous<br>System, motor neurons are attacked, and scars are produced. The<br>difference in ALS is that eventually, the motor neurons affected will<br>die, and the person with ALS will eventually be unable to move that<br>muscle.<br><br>When a disease process produces a "scar," the disease may be referred to<br>with the term "sclerosis."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
