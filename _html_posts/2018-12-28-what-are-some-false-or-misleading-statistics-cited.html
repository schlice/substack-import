<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are some false or misleading statistics cited in the debate on<br>racial disparities in police violence?**<br><br>Where do I start?<br><br>*Police routinely shoot unarmed black suspects.*<br><br>- A recent "deadly force" study by Washington State University<br>  researcher Lois James found that police officers were *less* likely to<br>  shoot unarmed black suspects than unarmed white or Hispanic ones in<br>  simulated threat scenarios.<br>- Harvard economics professor Roland Fryer analyzed more than 1,000<br>  officer-involved shootings across the country. He concluded that there<br>  is *zero* evidence of racial bias in police shootings. In Houston, he<br>  found that blacks were 24 percent *less* likely than whites to be shot<br>  by officers even though the suspects were armed or violent.<br>- An analysis of the Washington Post's Police Shooting Database and of<br>  Federal Crime Statistics reveals that fully 12 percent of all whites<br>  and Hispanics who die of homicide are killed by cops. By contrast,<br>  only four percent of black homicide victims are killed by cops.<br><br>***Blacks make up 26 percent of police-shooting victims, but only 13<br>percent of the national population. Therefore, blacks are killed twice<br>as often as others by police.***<br><br>- Police shootings occur more frequently where officers confront armed<br>  or violently resisting suspects. Those suspects are disproportionately<br>  black.<br>- According to the most recent study by the Department of Justice,<br>  although blacks were only about 15 percent of the population in the 75<br>  largest counties in the US, they were charged with 62 percent of all<br>  robberies, 57 percent of murders and 45 percent of assaults.<br>- In New York City, blacks commit over three-quarters of all shootings,<br>  though they are only 23 percent of the city's population. Whites, by<br>  contrast, commit under two percent of all shootings in the city,<br>  though they are 34 percent of the population. New York's crime<br>  disparities are repeated in virtually every racially diverse city in<br>  America.\[1\](#LWfYZ){#cite-LWfYZ .citation_link}<br><br>Suffice it to say that the real problem facing inner-city black<br>communities today is not the police, but the criminals.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-LWfYZ){.citation_index} [[Are the Police<br>Racist?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f59bf9&url=https://www.prageru.com/videos/are-police-racist){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="prageru.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
