<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not at all. And the reason is that *no human actually interprets the<br>Bible.*<br><br>Correctly understanding the truth of God's word is never a matter of<br>personal opinion. The apostle Peter said the following:<br><br>> We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable,<br>> and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in<br>> a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your<br>> hearts. Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture<br>> came about by the prophet's own interpretation of things. For prophecy<br>> never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human,<br>> spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. --- 2<br>> Peter 1:19--21 NIV<br><br>Peter is saying here that Scripture was not a product of the<br>interpretation of things by the writer. The Bible writers were "carried<br>along" by the Holy Spirit in their writings.<br><br>Similarly, when we read the Bible, it is the Spirit which gives us the<br>interpretation of what we are reading. We are not "self-referential"<br>when reading the Bible. God has the power to not only give us the Word,<br>but to ensure that we get the proper understanding of it when we read<br>it.<br><br>We would do well also to remember that our goal is not to gain an<br>understanding of the Bible. Our goal is to know God and grow in the<br>grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ through a study of His word.<br><br>The Bible is the most widely-translated and distributed work. As of<br>September 2022 all of the Bible has been translated into **724<br>languages**, the New Testament has been translated into an additional<br>1,617 languages, and smaller portions of the Bible have been translated<br>into 1,248 other languages according to Wycliffe Global Alliance. I am<br>grateful for godly men like John Wycliffe and William Tyndale, who put<br>their own lives on the line so that we could read God's Word in our own<br>native language. That was done for you, so that you could read the Bible<br>yourself, and you too can grow in a Spirit-inspired knowledge of God,<br>*through the reading of His word.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
