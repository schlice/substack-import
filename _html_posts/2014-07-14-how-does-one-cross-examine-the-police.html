<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [A few things to remember.\<br/>\<br/>1. You always have control over police encounters, and you have many<br/>legal remedies. However, in the VAST majority of instances, ***NONE OF<br/>THEM HAPPEN AT THE SCENE!*** Do not be belligerent during the incident.<br/>Ever. It only makes things worse for you. Always be polite and<br/>compliant.\<br/>\<br/>I say this from experience on both sides of the badge. When the officer<br/>is on the scene, the officer is in charge. You\'re not going to convince<br/>anyone, especially the officer, that he\'s wrong and that he should go<br/>away. If the officer tells you to jump, say \"Yes, officer\" and jump.<br/>If the officer tells you to quack like a chicken, while it may make you<br/>look like a goofball, I\'d squawk like the dickens and then sue the<br/>living sh1t out of the department if it were illegal for him to tell me<br/>to do that. Then, I\'d do what they do, keep tacking charges on.<br/>Unlawful detention, unlawful traffic stop, conduct unbecoming an<br/>officer, and on and on. If the officer tells you to do something that is<br/>illegal, it\'s okay and it\'s on him because he told you to do it and he<br/>has the authority to tell you to do something illegal. If it\'s *illegal<br/>for him to tell you to do it*, meaning if he doesn\'t have the authority<br/>to tell you to do it, that\'s where you get him. But I digress. My main<br/>point is: while you are at the scene, don\'t disobey orders. Swallow<br/>your pride and do what you are told, period. Just think of how good that<br/>juicy, fat check is going to feel in your hand when you win your<br/>lawsuit.\<br/>\<br/>The officer wants the incident to go down smoothly, and so do you. So<br/>don\'t give him any reason to make it happen otherwise. Roid-heads who<br/>are looking to make trouble for citizens are few and far between these<br/>days; relics from a different time in this country. Today\'s law<br/>enforcement is highly educated, and does more damage with words and a<br/>Taser than with a night stick and fists.\<br/>\<br/>2. When the incident is over, DOCUMENT, DOCUMENT, DOCUMENT! Write down<br/>everything you remember, in as much detail as possible:<br/>who/what/when/where/why/how. At 12:34 PM, I moved into the living room<br/>and sat on the couch. At 12:35 PM, I observed my son enter the room. At<br/>12:36 PM, I heard a vehicle enter the driveway. I observed a \'05 Honda<br/>CR-V, CO reg ABC-123, color blue, one occupant, enter the driveway. Or<br/>details about the officer, the statements he made, etc. If I were pulled<br/>over, I might even start the recorder on my cell phone so I can capture<br/>the events from the stop in detail. The officer is recording the stop on<br/>his dash cam, no reason I can\'t do the same.\<br/>\<br/>3. If I received a summons, I\'m going to court. There\'s none of this<br/>\"admit guilt and pay the fine\" business. Tear the incident down, look<br/>at every detail. You know that the officer\'s chain of command is doing<br/>the same thing. During discovery, subpoena the officer\'s training<br/>records, the vehicle maintenance records, the radar gun calibration<br/>records, etc. Make sure that everything meets both department policy and<br/>manufacturer\'s specifications. If the radar gun wasn\'t calibrated<br/>within the proper time period, a speeding ticket using that gun can be<br/>thrown out. If the officer hasn\'t received the proper refresher<br/>training on the equipment he is using, the ticket can be dismissed.<br/>Question everything.\<br/>\<br/>Can this strategy backfire? Absolutely! If you look like you\'re wasting<br/>the judge\'s time and the court\'s time, the judge will allow the ticket<br/>to stand as is, and you\'ll have to pay for it anyway, but that\'s the<br/>worst that can happen.\<br/>\<br/>However, if you are respectful of the court and the court\'s time and<br/>resources, you have a Constitutional right to defend yourself. You have<br/>a right to review all of the information and if any of it is incorrect,<br/>it could be grounds to dismiss the charges or at least have the fine<br/>reduced.\<br/>\<br/>Now, all that said, I can tell you that the police have their ducks in a<br/>row and it would be an oversight if something like that happened, not<br/>standard operating procedure. So while you\'ll definitely be rowing<br/>upstream, you have every right to do so.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
