House of Representatives if it passes Articles of<br>Impeachment against him?**<br><br>The best retaliation of all:<br><br>- Being found not guilty in the Senate trial, allowing him to stay in<br>  office<br>- Winning re-election in 2020<br><br>This effectively makes the impeachment pointless, other than to add<br>another footnote to history.<br><br>But already, based on the partisan nature of this investigation, the<br>Democrats have already tarnished impeachment, turning it into a<br>political weapon instead of a tool reserved only for the most egregious<br>presidential conduct. For lack of a better term, they have sullied the<br>good name of impeachment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
