<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Omicron is a result of natural viral processes.<br><br>As a virus mutates, it becomes more *virulent* (i.e. easier to infect<br>people), but less *deadly* (i.e. won't kill you). I may not be a<br>virologist or an infectious disease specialist, but I remember a few<br>things from Biology 101. Viruses mutate and become more virulent and<br>less deadly. Killing your host is bad for the virus too, and so it is as<br>undesirable a condition for the virus as it is for the host.<br><br>And to answer that other guy who answered, unvaccinated people are<br>catching Omicron. There are five people in my house: four vaccinated,<br>and one unvaccinated. One of the vaccinated is also on<br>hydroxychloroquine for an unrelated condition. The only person in the<br>house who did not catch Omicron is the person on hydroxychloroquine. The<br>virus hit all of us, vaccinated and unvaccinated. It is extremely fast<br>moving and very contagious. But our symptoms were all comparatively mild<br>and flu-like.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is the Omicron variant a result of vaccination (because it is more<br>resistant to the vaccines while at the same time weaker/less severe)?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
