<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Can I get sued for saying someone is unqualified?*<br><br>The short answer is it depends. I know that's not much of an answer, but<br>to be fair, it's not much of a question either. *Touch√©.*<br><br>Firstly, we probably need a little more context. Unqualified for what?<br>Are you in a position in which your job is to determine someone's<br>qualifications (i.e. a recruiter)?<br><br>In order to be sued for slander, your statement that someone is<br>unqualified would have to cause some harm to that person (i.e. because<br>you said that they were unqualified, they lost their job).<br><br>That said, truth is always a defense to slander claims. If you do get<br>sued for slander, you could prove that the person truly is unqualified.<br>Do that, and slander does not apply, even if your utterance of that<br>statement did cause harm.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
