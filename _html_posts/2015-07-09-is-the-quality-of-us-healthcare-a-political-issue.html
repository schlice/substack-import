<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The quality of healthcare in the United States has never<br>been an issue. We have some of the best healthcare in the world here.\<br>\<br>There are other factors of healthcare that are political issues, and the<br>biggest, baddest, elephant-in-the-room issue is how to pay for<br>healthcare.\<br>\<br>As any sentient being knows, healthcare is not free. Nor should it be.<br>Doctors train for years to become specialists in their fields of study,<br>and deserve to make money for their work. *Someone* has to pay them. The<br>question then becomes *who* should pay them.\<br>]<br><br>- Should governments pay them? Governments don\'t make money; they<br>  redistribute tax dollars taken from their citizens. So the extent to<br>  which government can pay for healthcare is directly tied to the amount<br>  of money they take in tax dollars from citizens. Canada has<br>  government-funded healthcare, but they also have very high taxes.<br><br><!-- --><br><br>- Should insurance companies pay them? Perhaps there should be insurance<br>  involved, but to what extent? Today, insurance pays 100% of your<br>  doctor\'s fees, which makes the cost of care a negotiation between the<br>  insurance company and the doctor. The insurance company then<br>  negotiates with your employer to determine what that coverage will<br>  cost you. You, as a payer, are mostly out of the loop (see the next<br>  bullet).<br>- Should individuals pay them? Currently, individuals pay a \"copay\" or<br>  \"co-insurance\" so that individuals have some \"skin-in-the-game,\"<br>  so to speak, so that they don\'t use healthcare services willy-nilly<br>  and waste the insurance company\'s money. But the actual cost of<br>  treatment is borne by the insurance company, not the individual. The<br>  individual pays for healthcare as a deduction from his/her paycheck,<br>  which the employer uses to pay for the insurance plans sponsored by<br>  the company, along with a sizeable contribution directly from the<br>  company, out of the company\'s profits. So the bulk of healthcare<br>  costs are paid for by a portion of your paycheck, and your company.<br><br>Under our current system, if you\'re employed by a company of 50<br>employees or more, you get healthcare from your employer. If you\'re<br>unemployed, you can buy insurance from a state-run healthcare exchange,<br>or from the Federal government\'s healthcare exchange. In the United<br>States, you must buy health insurance, or you pay increased taxes to<br>cover your lack of contribution to the system. However, you still have<br>to pay for it, one way or another. There are government subsidies<br>available if you are unemployed, but that doesn\'t equate to \"free\"<br>healthcare. It means you can buy an insurance plan at a discount, but<br>your care still must be paid for by someone.\<br>\<br>How to fix this particular issue (i.e. make healthcare more affordable,<br>reduce the size/influence/necessity of healthcare insurance companies,<br>ensure that essential care is paid for by tax dollars, etc) is a<br>political issue that Washington has struggled with for years. Our<br>current law, the Affordable Care Act, has not adequately addressed these<br>issues. It has not made healthcare more affordable, it has not reduced<br>the size or necessity of healthcare insurance, and it has not ensured<br>that essential care for all people is covered by tax dollars. This is<br>the big political issue. Solving this will definitely be a challenge for<br>years to come.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
