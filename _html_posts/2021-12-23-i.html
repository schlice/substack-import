They do this<br>because "the work of the Law \is\ written in their hearts" and "their<br>conscience...alternately accusing or else defending them."<br><br>God has written his truth in our hearts. This is backed up by studies<br>which show that young children know right from wrong without ever having<br>been taught it. We have an innate sense of fairness and justice and<br>morality. That's not by accident; God wrote it on our hearts. In this<br>way, no one can claim ignorance.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I\'m a born again Christian but the state of the dead, how they<br>supposedly know nothing, I find disturbing. Why\'s this?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
