<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because it is illogical.<br><br>The Law of Causality speaks against the universe being the ultimate<br>cause of all we know for this simple fact: an effect must resemble its<br>cause. This being true, no atheist can explain how an impersonal,<br>purposeless, meaningless, and amoral universe accidentally created<br>beings (us) who are full of personality and obsessed with purpose,<br>meaning, and morals. Such a thing, from a causation standpoint,<br>completely refutes the idea of a natural universe birthing everything<br>that exists. No atheist has been able to adequately explain how this<br>could be.<br><br>Former atheist Lee Strobel summed up the atheist conundrum this way:<br>"Essentially, I realized that to stay an atheist, I would have to<br>believe that nothing produces everything; non-life produces life;<br>randomness produces fine-tuning; chaos produces information;<br>unconsciousness produces consciousness; and non-reason produces reason.<br>Those leaps of faith were simply too big for me to take, especially in<br>light of the affirmative case for God\'s existence. In other words, in<br>my assessment the Christian worldview accounted for the totality of the<br>evidence much better than the atheistic worldview."<br><br>Atheism is insufficient because it requires far more faith to believe it<br>than to believe that a creator created everything. Atheism is<br>insufficient, therefore, because it takes too much faith to be an<br>atheist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
