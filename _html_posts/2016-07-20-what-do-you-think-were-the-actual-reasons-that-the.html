<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The grand jury delivered a vote of "no true bill" which means that there<br>was not probable cause that a crime was committed. This is the actual<br>reason. There is not a litany of reasons. There either is enough<br>evidence to indict, or there is not. In this case, there was not enough<br>evidence to show that a crime was committed, so no indictment was<br>returned.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
