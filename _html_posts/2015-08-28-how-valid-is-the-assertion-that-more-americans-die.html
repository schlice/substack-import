<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The numbers are true, but the numbers are misleading. 9/11<br>was the largest terrorist attack on US shores, and only around 2900<br>died.\<br>\<br>In 2011, about 8500 died from gun homicides. But that same year, over<br>15,000 died from alcohol-induced liver disease. Over 16,000 were killed<br>by a drunk driver. When you look at all alcohol-related deaths (not<br>caused by accident or homicide), it\'s over 25,000.\<br>\<br>Care to bet how many of those 8500 homicides involved alcohol in some<br>way?\<br>\<br>Yet I bet you that you\'re not thinking of banning alcohol. Hmm, I<br>wonder why that is.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
