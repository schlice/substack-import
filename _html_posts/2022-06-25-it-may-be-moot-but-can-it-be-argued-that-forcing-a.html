<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So let\'s throw a hypothetical in here.<br><br>If you woke up one morning and found yourself trapped in a cabin with a<br>newborn baby, and there was no one else in the cabin, would it be<br>illegal to allow that baby to die without you feeding it? Assume there<br>is an adequate supply of baby formula is in the cabin with you (as well<br>as a full supply of food for you).<br><br>Most people agree that you have a moral responsibility to feed that<br>baby, and the laws around child neglect support this view.<br><br>Now, let\'s change the hypothetical a little bit. Instead of baby<br>formula, let\'s say that you are a lactating mother. That baby in the<br>cabin with you is not yours. *Does that change the morality of the<br>situation at all?*<br><br>Again, most people, at this point, still believe that because you are<br>the only person around who has the ability to feed that baby, and it<br>doesn\'t hurt you to do so, that you have a moral obligation to feed<br>that baby.<br><br>Why is pregnancy any different?<br><br>You are forced to feed a baby, that baby relies on you for its food and<br>shelter, and there is no one else near you who has the capability to<br>support that baby.<br><br>Some people immediately jump to a bodily autonomy argument. It\'s inside<br>my body, so I can choose to take it out. But morally, how is that any<br>different from using your body to feed that baby on the outside? You are<br>still providing the baby food and shelter. In fact, I would argue that<br>it is *more difficult* if the baby is outside, because you have to stop<br>what you\'re doing in order to feed the baby.<br><br>If the baby has a right to food and shelter outside of your body, why<br>does the baby not have the same right to food and shelter inside of your<br>body?<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>It may be moot, but can it be argued that forcing a woman to use her<br>body as what Rep. Cawthorn called an \"earthen vessel\" for an unwanted<br>fetus for 6-7 months be considered \"involuntary servitude\" under the<br>14th Amendment?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
