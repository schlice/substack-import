<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Colorado calls this their "three strike" laws, but what they actually<br>have are a progressive series of "habitual offender" laws, and their<br>penalties can be stiff. The objective of these laws is to try to punish<br>more harshly criminals who have a propensity to be violent offenders.<br><br>Lawyers tend to call the smallest of the penalties the "little habitual"<br>or the "baby habitual" statute. It's also referred more colloquially as<br>"little bitch." It states that if you are convicted of a Class 1, 2, 3,<br>4, or 5 felony, and you've been convicted of any two other felonies<br>within the previous ten years (even felonies in other states where the<br>same crime is a felony in Colorado), you get classified as a "habitual<br>offender," and your penalty for your most recent conviction becomes<br>three times the maximum sentence for the presumptive range for the<br>most recent felony. So if your crime carried a two to five year<br>sentence, it becomes a mandatory fifteen year sentence.<br><br>If you are subsequently released, and you are then convicted of a fourth<br>felony, regardless of the felony class, you will be classified a<br>habitual offender under what lawyers call the "big habitual" statute, or<br>more colorfully, "big bitch." If you are convicted under big habitual,<br>the penalty is increased four times above the presumptive maximum<br>for that felony. If the same two-to-five crime as above, you would get a<br>mandatory 20-year sentence.<br><br>Finally, if you are released after a fourth felony and are then<br>convicted *again* of *any violent felony*, you are classified a habitual<br>offender under the "biggest habitual" statute, which comes with a<br>mandatory life sentence with parole possibility after 40 years.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
