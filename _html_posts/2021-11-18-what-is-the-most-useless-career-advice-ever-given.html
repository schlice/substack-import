<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The most popular answer here says that telling someone "follow your<br>passion is terrible advice" is not good advice because you should only<br>work hard and focus on whatever you do. "The only constant in success is<br>hard work and focus."<br><br>But that's not *career advice.* That's *life advice.*<br><br>"Follow your passion" *is* **the most useless career advice ever<br>given.**<br><br>[https://www.prageru.com/video/do\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=930673&url=https://www.prageru.com/video/dont-follow-your-passion){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="prageru.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>If you are a fan of Mike Rowe and his down-to-earth career advice, take<br>five minutes out of your day and watch his (admittedly funny) video.<br><br>And take his word for it: following your passion is terrible career<br>advice.<br><br>The reason? People who do will ultimately realize that their<br>*passion* and their *ability* **have absolutely nothing to<br>do with each other.**<br><br>A small handful of people will follow their passion and will be<br>successful at it, and that's great. But for the vast majority of us, the<br>truth is that *your happiness with your work actually has very little to<br>do with the work itself.*<br><br>Mike says you only need to look at the current job market to see why:<br><br>> Right now, millions of people with degrees and diplomas are out there<br>> competing for a relatively narrow set of opportunities that polite<br>> society calls "good careers." Meanwhile, employers are struggling to<br>> fill nearly 5.8 million jobs that nobody's trained to do. This is the<br>> skills gap, it's real, and its cause is actually very simple: when<br>> people follow their passion, they miss out on all kinds of<br>> opportunities they didn't even know<br>> existed.\[1\](#HKeDy){#cite-HKeDy .citation_link}<br><br>The point is that telling people to follow their passion is, for most<br>people, very bad career advice, because it will cause you to focus on<br>doing something that will be unsuccessful. The advice regarding hard<br>work and focus is unrefined. It's only appropriate to go nose to the<br>grindstone, head-down and barrel forward *when you're headed in the<br>right direction.*<br><br>So, to kind of bring both answers together, I'd just say this final<br>thought:<br><br>Don't *follow* your passion. ***Apply your passion to<br>whatever you choose to do*.**<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What is the most useless career advice ever given?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-HKeDy){.citation_index} [[Don\'t Follow Your Passion \|<br>PragerU](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=930673&url=https://www.prageru.com/video/dont-follow-your-passion){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="prageru.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
