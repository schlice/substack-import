<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why haven\'t gun rights advocates backed up their claim that they are<br>mainly trying to prevent the government from over-reaching their<br>authority, but yet have not come to the defense of children being caged<br>or blacks being brutalized by government?**<br><br>I'm a gun rights advocate.<br><br>- I'm highly against placing children in cages at any time.<br>- If you can show me some proof that blacks are being brutalized by the<br>  government, I'd be against that, too.<br><br>However, as it stands, both of those claims have been shown to be false.<br>I haven't seen any real evidence that either exists. And if your "proof"<br>is news reports, you can forget it. Too much fake news. You can't rely<br>on the media to give you facts.<br><br>That said, you don't have to be a gun rights advocate to either support<br>or oppose placing children in cages or brutalizing blacks. This is<br>what's called a *false equivalency*. One doesn't have anything to do<br>with the other.<br><br>Unless you have some proof of this, your false equivalency is what's<br>known as a "logical fallacy." Logical fallacies don't make good policy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
