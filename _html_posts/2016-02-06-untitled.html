<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I\'m glad you like it. I do not work for DU (promise), but over the<br>years of using Android, I found that their speed booster and battery<br>saver work far better than others, their notifications and reminders are<br>not too annoying, and the feature set is polished and user friendly. I<br>recommend their products to friends and family who struggle with the<br>quirks of Android, and it makes their experience a little more pleasant.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Where-do-I-find-the-recycle-bin-on-Galaxy-S6-to-delete-a-video-recording-so-storage-space-is-freed-back-up/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
