<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It appears that everyone is glossing over the fact that in the US legal<br>system, you don't prove yourself innocent. The onus is on the government<br>to prove you are a gang member.<br><br>And "due process" for a non-citizen looks different than it does for a<br>citizen. Everyone receives due process, but non-citizens, for<br>immigration issues, receive an administrative hearing in Immigration<br>Court in front of an immigration judge. They can appeal (to another<br>immigration judge) if they believe there was an administrative error,<br>but barring that appeal, if they lose, their deportation process begins.<br>This still counts as due process, and it definitively does not indicate<br>that due process is "unavailable."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
