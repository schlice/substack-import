<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How could it be Trumps fault that people are purchasing fewer trees?<br><br>I have no idea, especially because the quoted article blames the Great<br>Recession for the rise in tree prices. From the article:<br><br>> *Christmas tree farms often cut down trees only as they are sold.<br>> Because the farms sold fewer trees during the recession, they had less<br>> space in which to plant new ones. Nearly 10 years later, the trees<br>> that should have been planted then are not around to be cut in a<br>> better sales climate.*<br><br>If this is true, then Trump had nothing to do with rising prices of<br>Christmas trees. He had nothing to do with causing the Great Recession.<br>In fact, Trump the businessman was hit just as hard by the Recession as<br>everyone else.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
