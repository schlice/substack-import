<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When you bought your house, you would have signed the Governing<br>Documents for the HOA in that big stack of papers you signed. Therefore,<br>your deed would reflect that your home is part of a Homeowner's<br>Association.<br><br>You can check with your County Property Appraiser's office to retrieve a<br>copy of your deed as filed with them, and it will indicate whether or<br>not your home is part of an HOA. In fact, simply pulling the electronic<br>records of your property on file with the County Appraiser's office<br>should show clearly if the property is part of an HOA.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
