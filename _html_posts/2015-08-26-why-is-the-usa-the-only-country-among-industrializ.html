<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [1. Healthcare is expensive. From pharmaceutical companies,<br>to durable medical equipment manufacturers, to hospitals, healthcare is<br>one of the costliest fields to be a part of. Simply changing the payer<br>from insurance companies to the government is not possible. Half of your<br>paycheck would go to taxes just to fund the medical system (and that\'s<br>after cost controls). Where do I come up with half? Ask a Canadian how<br>much of his paycheck goes to taxes.\<br>\<br>2. This also amounts to a *government takeover* of the entire<br>medical system, and most Americans are skeptical of anything that<br>government takes over. For two brilliant, shining examples of how<br>\"efficiently\" government runs things, one need only look at the US<br>Postal Service and Amtrak. Since the government took over those two<br>enterprises, they have *lost money* every single year they have been in<br>operation. They are money pits. Why? The government is not good at<br>for-profit business. They\'re good at not-for-profit business, and they<br>don\'t therefore care if their businesses are not profitable, or even if<br>they lose money. They\'re not accountable to any shareholders, so who<br>cares if the business loses money? Just dump more taxpayer dollars into<br>it.\<br>\<br>In order for government to successfully fund the medical system, they<br>would not only have to take it over, but they would have to eliminate<br>healthcare insurance, as well as implementing cost controls onto<br>healthcare providers. Without a market controlling this interaction,<br>most healthcare providers would leave the profession and would seek<br>gainful employment elsewhere, rather than becoming low-paid government<br>employees.\<br>\<br>It is possible for government to implement universal healthcare within<br>our current system, but they would have to create *tiered* healthcare.<br>They would have to create government-funded local clinics to handle the<br>majority of healthcare needs. The private system would still be in place<br>as a Tier 2 option for people who need it. They would have to be cleared<br>through a Tier 1 doctor before they would be able to move into Tier 2.<br>The insurance companies could still operate here, as well as specialist<br>doctors, surgeons, ERs, and other acute care. The largest majority of<br>basic healthcare needs could be met in the Tier 1 facilities, while the<br>Tier 2 facilities would still operate much as they do today, but with<br>lower caseload.\<br>\<br>Yes, there are still gaps. There are areas where people would not be<br>able to see a Tier 2 doctor because they don\'t have health insurance.<br>Perhaps the efficiencies in the new system will allow some government<br>subsidies to be used for patients (as referred by Tier 1 docs) to see<br>Tier 2 doctors, but they will have to include some cost-sharing with the<br>patient. Doctors and insurance companies will have to look for ways to<br>reduce the cost to the end user.\<br>\<br>But where will you get doctors to staff the Tier 1 facilities? Won\'t<br>all the money-hungry bastards simply stay in Tier 2 practice and never<br>work in Tier 1? It\'s actually pretty simple. Fund their medical school<br>with government grants. Make them pay back their medical school with<br>time in the Tier 1 clinic. Make them do their residency and the first<br>five years of their practice in a Tier 1 clinic. Also, open up<br>inner-city Tier 1 clinics to groups like Doctors Without Borders. They<br>may have to change their name to Doctors Within Borders, but at least<br>the acronym (DWB) can stay the same.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
