<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If God knows everything and has a plan for each of us, why do we need<br>to pray? Doesn\'t he know what we want?**<br><br>Yes, God knows everything. Yes, he has a plan for us. No, we don't pray<br>to inform God about what we need. He already knows. He know everything<br>about us. He knows what we need, before we even ask.<br><br>So why pray? If we don't need to ask him for things because he already<br>knows, then why do we pray?<br><br>*Because praying isn't about asking God to give you things.*<br><br>God is not some cosmic vending machine that only dispenses blessings<br>when you drop your quarter in. He wants to hear from you! He wants you<br>to talk to him, he wants you to confide in him, he wants you to give him<br>all the little updates, even though he already knows them all.<br><br>He also wants you to understand that he is in charge, and you are not.<br>He has a plan for you, and he will implement his plan, in his time, for<br>his glory. Pray, then, that you can gain understanding about his plan,<br>and comfort that he keeps his promises.<br><br>So instead of praying for things, pray that you'll gain wisdom and<br>understanding that he will keep his promises, and that you can be<br>comforted in that understanding. "Not my will, but yours be done." He<br>does want you to bring him your concerns, but he will still implement<br>his plan in his time.<br><br>[[Larry<br>Seiler](https://www.quora.com/profile/Larry-Seiler-1)]{.qlink_container}<br>pointed out the CS Lewis quote that I love: "I don\'t pray to change<br>God, I pray to change me."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
