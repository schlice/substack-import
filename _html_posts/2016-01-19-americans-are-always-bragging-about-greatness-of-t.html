<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I have to agree with [[Arttu<br>Holappa](https://www.quora.com/profile/Arttu-Holappa)]{.qlink_container}<br>here. The measure of greatness of a country does not, in my mind,<br>necessarily include percentage of the population in prison. And while<br>this is mostly true (Seychelles actually ranks higher than the US \"per<br>capita\" as the question states, but Seychelles has such a small<br>population that their incarceration rate gets unfairly overblown per<br>capita, I don\'t even think they count), there are several reasons why<br>the US has the largest population of people in prison:<br><br>1.  The US has longer jail sentences than other countries.<br>2.  The US has \"three-strike rules\" which mean that repeat offenders<br>    are guaranteed to spend much longer in prison.<br>3.  The US has \"mandatory sentencing\" rules which take the sentencing<br>    out of the hands of the judge and places it in the hands of the<br>    legislature. Mandatory sentences also keep people in prison for<br>    longer periods of time.<br>4.  The \"war on drugs\" has (unfairly, in my opinion) incarcerated drug<br>    users at a significantly higher rate than you can find in nearly any<br>    other country in the world. More than half of the population of all<br>    US jails and prisons is comprised of drug abusers. *This should not<br>    happen, and is the biggest reason we have the highest incarceration<br>    rate in the world.*<br><br>In my opinion, we should not incarcerate drug users. Definitely<br>incarcerate drug dealers and drug manufacturers. But drug users?<br>They\'re addicts. They should be *patients*, not *prisoners.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
