<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Homeowner's Associations (HOAs) routinely prohibit changes in the<br>neighborhood. That's because this is how they are designed. HOAs are<br>designed to maintain a consistent look and feel in the neighborhood. For<br>example, if all of your houses in your neighborhood are "beach coastal"<br>design and you want to change your garage door to a faux wood look in<br>the craftsman style, the HOA would deny that, because it would be out of<br>place.<br><br>And when it comes to architectural approvals, the HOA has the final say,<br>and it is solely based on their opinion of what looks good and what<br>aesthetically matches the rest of the neighborhood<br><br>But you said that the HOA's prohibitions are "unreasonable." That's a<br>subjective judgement, not an objective standards-based judgement.<br><br>So, what to do? Here's what I would do:<br><br>- First, make sure that their decisions are truly unreasonable, by<br>  making sure that you have a good understanding of reasonableness. When<br>  it comes to approvals, what is reasonable? What makes a particular<br>  change reasonable or not?<br>- When it comes to *subjective* decisions (i.e. what looks good, what<br>  will match the neighborhood), you really don't have much wiggle room.<br>  The HOA makes those decisions, you do not.<br>- When it comes to *objective* decisions (i.e. not based on looks, but<br>  based on restrictions in the Governing Documents), this is where you<br>  may have some room to object. For example, let's say the HOA says you<br>  can't put up a bird feeder. You've been over your Governing Documents<br>  and you can't see anything in there prohibiting bird feeders. You may<br>  have a valid objection. In this case, write a letter to your HOA<br>  explaining your objection to their decision.<br>- Finally, if you really believe the HOA is being unreasonable and they<br>  are threatening to fine you (or they have fined you), perhaps it's<br>  time to get one of those free consultations from a real estate<br>  attorney in your area who specializes in HOA law. You may be able to<br>  either send a lawyer letter to the HOA or perhaps if it's bad enough,<br>  you could file a lawsuit to compel their action.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
