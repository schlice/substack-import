<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The wording you provided from the lease basically says<br>that your kids can\'t have parties unless you\'re there. As long as you<br>or any other cosigner on the lease is present, social<br>gatherings/meetings/parties are permitted.\<br>\<br>If your landlord verbally told you that you can\'t have guests, I\'d<br>point him to the lease and tell him that the lease agreement doesn\'t<br>prohibit social gatherings or guests. It only specifies that a lease<br>cosigner be present.\<br>\<br>If he\'s trying to add conditions to the lease, I\'d ask him to file an<br>amendment to the lease agreement so that you have his current conditions<br>in writing.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
