<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The phone must then have specific software built into it to a) recognize<br>when the camera is looking at a QR code and not your family reunion, and<br>b) interpret that QR code.<br><br>While some phones may have b) built in, most phones are not constantly<br>scanning for QR codes while you're trying to take a picture. This is<br>generally why you need to indicate to the phone in one way or another<br>that you would like to scan a QR code. If your phone's camera app does<br>not have a built-in QR reader (most camera apps do not), you will need<br>an external app. Even then, you would have to indicate to the camera app<br>that you would like to scan for a QR code so that the app can search for<br>it.<br><br>The default camera app in Android does not continuously scan for QR<br>codes, nor does it have QR software built in to the camera app. If you<br>want to scan QR codes, you must download a third-party scanner.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
