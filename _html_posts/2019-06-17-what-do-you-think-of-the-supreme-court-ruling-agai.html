<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What do you think of the Supreme Court ruling against Virginia's House<br>of delegates for their racial gerrymandering of state districts to<br>benefit Republicans in elections?**<br><br>First of all, your take on the racial gerrymandering "to benefit<br>Republicans" flies in the face of traditional Democrat talking points.<br>It's simply an incorrect assumption, which is how most of the drive-by<br>media is painting this decision.<br><br>The maps that the Virginia House of Delegates were arguing to keep were<br>gerrymandered along racial lines, to ensure that at least 55% of every<br>district was black. If it were only to benefit Republicans, the current<br>logic goes, then it should have been drawn to minimize the black vote,<br>no? Because isn't that what evil Republicans do? They want the black man<br>in chains again, right?<br><br>Regardless, SCOTUS already ruled in 2015 that race cannot be the main<br>factor in drawing state district boundaries. Lawyers for the Virginia<br>House argued that by making sure that each legislative district had at<br>least 55% black voters, the state was protecting their voting power.<br><br>The Virginia House appealed, and SCOTUS simply ruled, this time, that<br>they did not have standing over the state AG. \"The House, we hold,<br>lacks authority to displace Virginia\'s Attorney General as<br>representative of the state,\" stated Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the<br>majority opinion. \"We further hold that the House, as a single chamber<br>of a bicameral legislature, has no standing to appeal the invalidation<br>of the redistricting plan separately from the state of which it is a<br>part.\" Virginia law gives the authority and responsibility to represent<br>the state in court \"exclusively\" to the attorney general.<br><br>RBG goes on to state that the Virginia House won't be injured by<br>allowing the new district maps to stand, because the entire Virginia<br>Assembly, not just the House, is elected using those maps.<br><br>The new maps have already been used in Virginia's state primaries.<br><br>So, my take on this? Fine, if you want your districts to *not* take<br>racial makeups into account, then certain districts are going to lean<br>very heavy towards one race, and certain districts are not, and that<br>race's voting power will be diminished in those districts. I guess you<br>can't make the claim of voter suppression by redistricting in Virginia,<br>because the Democrats ensured that you can suppress the black vote using<br>redistricting.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
