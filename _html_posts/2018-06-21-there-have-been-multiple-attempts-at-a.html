<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**There have been multiple attempts at a \"good\" immigration policy. In<br>the end there is always outrage (some times more than others).<br>Crowdsourcing here... what would make an actual good immigration policy<br>that is both fair and compassionate?**<br><br>To be honest<br>[Ollie(https://www.quora.com/profile/Ollie-Townsend-III)]{.qlink_container},<br>you don't want what's fair. Because what's fair has to be fair for<br>everyone. "Fair and compassionate" do not make great immigration<br>policies. They make great "open border" policies, and that's the exact<br>opposite of an immigration policy. A good immigration policy is<br>inherently "unfair" because not everyone gets to come in. That is the<br>textbook definition of "unfair."<br><br>"Fairness" really means being fair to the immigrant, and being fair<br>to the American citizens, either born or naturalized. You have to<br>balance both of their needs.<br><br>To that end, a good comprehensive immigration policy would include<br>all of the following:<br><br>- Get rid of multiculturalism. This is another sham of a program<br>  foisted upon the American people by Progressives, and it is ruining<br>  this country, creating more division instead of more unity. We must<br>  re-establish the fact that the United States is a *sovereign nation*,<br>  we have a *national identity*, and we have our own view of how to live<br>  in the world, different from that of other countries, ***and that's<br>  not a bad thing!*** We need to return to the "Great American Melting<br>  Pot" concept of naturalization. Require immigrants to learn English.<br>  Require immigrants to pass a basic primary school US history test.<br>  Require immigrants to swear allegiance to the United States and its<br>  Constitution. In case you're unsure of what the "Great American<br>  Melting Pot" is, those from my generation learned a lot about the<br>  country from *Schoolhouse Rock*. Heck, I memorized the Preamble to the<br>  Constitution solely from Schoolhouse Rock. Anyway, here's "The Great<br>  American Melting Pot:"<br><br>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=01b861&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D5ZQl6XBo64M){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="youtube.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>- Fix the immigration system. If it takes decades to become a<br>  citizen, people are going to look to other means to enter the country.<br>  We must reduce the amount of time it takes to complete the immigration<br>  process. Part of this is communication with other countries, and their<br>  willingness to hand over information about their citizens who want to<br>  emigrate. If they don't do it within certain timeframes, we should be<br>  cutting off immigration from that country, plain and simple. Let<br>  immigrants argue with their host countries about sending information<br>  faster. But one way or another, we must shorten the amount of time it<br>  takes to become a citizen.<br>- Fix the border. We must do everything we can to eliminate illegal<br>  immigration. This includes preventing illegal aliens crossing into the<br>  country across the southern border.<br>- Keep better track of visa holders. The other big source of illegal<br>  immigrants is people who overstay their visas. We need to do a better<br>  job of integrating those systems which track visa holders with our law<br>  enforcement systems and other systems so that we can catch them<br>  quicker and repatriate them appropriately.<br>- End birthright citizenship. The practice of birthright citizenship<br>  is not part of the Constitution; it was established by law. This<br>  should be overturned. You should only become a born citizen if you are<br>  born to citizens. Being born to illegal aliens in-country should not<br>  entitle you to automatic citizenship.<br>- End businesses hiring illegals. If the system to track illegals is<br>  broken, fix it. We should be able to identify whether or not a person<br>  is legally in this country. This takes the incentive away from someone<br>  wanting to illegally stay in this country and being able to find work.<br>  If you're an employer and you're paying an illegal under the table, we<br>  shut down your business, period. Come down hard on employers hiring<br>  illegals.<br>- And on that note, END SANCTUARY CITIES. Anyone at any level of<br>  government harboring known illegals should be dealt with harshly. I<br>  have no problem withholding Federal funding for cities which refuse to<br>  follow the law. This is yet another incentive for illegals to come<br>  into the country: a great place to stay where they know they won't be<br>  deported. It's like another country inside of the US. This practice<br>  must end, and it must end quickly.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
