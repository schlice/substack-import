<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>The media is in full-on panic mode.<br><br>They have never had to deal with anyone like Trump, and to them, that is<br>"dangerous." Trump is not beholden to them, so he represents a threat to<br>their position in the order of things. And people will go to great<br>lengths to protect their place in the hierarchy.<br><br>So they are doing their utmost to do the only thing they can: absolutely<br>destroy and decimate Trump.<br><br>*Nah, Bill, the media isn't really trying to destroy Trump. They're<br>impartial!*<br><br>Heh, they used to be a long time ago. We've known for quite some time<br>that they were nothing more than the media arm for the Democrat Party,<br>but this week, they have actually admitted that this is what they<br>are. They have admitted that they are in fact trying to destroy Trump.<br><br>In this piece, normally-level-headed-for-a-journalist writer Jim<br>Rutenberg lays it all out there. He says it's time to throw objectivity<br>out the window, and it's time to be oppositional (as if they haven't<br>been oppositional for the past 25 years, if not longer):<br><br>> If you\'re a working journalist and you believe that Donald J. Trump<br>> is a demagogue playing to the nation\'s worst racist and nationalistic<br>> tendencies \\...\ how the heck are you supposed to cover him?<br>><br>> Because if you believe all of those things, you have to throw out the<br>> textbook American journalism has been using for the better part of the<br>> past half-century, if not longer, and approach it in a way you\'ve<br>> never approached anything in your career.<br>><br>> If you \a journalist\ view a Trump presidency as something that\'s<br>> potentially dangerous, then your reporting is going to reflect that.<br>> You would move closer than you\'ve ever been to being oppositional.<br>> That\'s uncomfortable and uncharted territory for every mainstream,<br>> non-opinion journalist I\'ve ever known, and by normal standards,<br>> untenable.\[1\](#rDWrl){#cite-rDWrl .citation_link}<br><br>I needed to go over this piece in the New York Times to underscore what<br>you're dealing with here in the media.<br><br>Since their stated end-game is the complete decimation and<br>destruction of Trump, they will latch on to *anything* that they can,<br>blow it out of proportion, and try to make you believe it. This is the<br>new media playbook. Under the old playbook, if the media did this, the<br>candidate would have to make a public appearance, walk back his<br>statement, and he would be so decimated that he would have to drop out<br>of the race. They've been very successful doing this in the past. But it<br>doesn't work with Trump. When they do this against Trump, he *doubles<br>down* his previous "misstatement" and turns it back on his opponent.<br>It's like nothing they've ever seen. But they keep trying.<br><br>It happened a few weeks ago, when Trump was giving a press conference<br>during the Democrat National Convention (another unfathomable thing,<br>according to politics-as-usual, but yet the media covered every word of<br>it). He was discussing the then-recent email dump on Wikileaks, and he<br>was asked whether or not he thought Russia was the source of the emails.<br>He said (paraphrasing), hey Russia, maybe you can find Hillary's missing<br>30,000 emails. I'm sure the media will reward you mightily. It was an<br>attempt at humor, aimed at people who clearly have no sense of it.<br><br>The liberal media, at that moment, lost their collective minds. They<br>believed that Trump was *actually asking Russia to conduct espionage<br>against the United States*. It's unheard of! We have never seen anything<br>like this before in our lifetimes! It's untenable! A presidential<br>candidate *actually calling for Russia to conduct espionage against the<br>US!* He should be arrested! The FBI should start an investigation!<br><br>But it didn't have any legs. Because it's a bunch of crap.<br><br>And it's happening again. Remember the new media playbook: listen for<br>words. Twist the words into something completely different. Attempt to<br>get the American people to believe the new twisted words to destroy the<br>candidate. These words are in relation to Second Amendment people.<br><br>"If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks," he said.<br>"Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don't know."<br><br>Once again, the media decided these would be the words they'd use to try<br>to destroy Trump. *He's calling on gun owners to assassinate Hillary!<br>He's a maniac! He's inciting violence!*<br><br>In true Trump form, he doubled down, reminding people that he was<br>calling for Second Amendment supporters to *vote* against Hillary, not<br>*aim or fire* at her:<br><br>"This is a political movement, this is a strong powerful movement, the<br>Second Amendment. Hillary wants to take your guns away. She wants to<br>leave you unprotected in your home.<br><br>\"And there can be no other interpretation,\" Trump said. \"I mean, give<br>me a break.\"<br><br>The "I mean, give me a break" was a dig at the media for, once again,<br>trying to twist his words and destroy him, which he will never allow to<br>happen. Mike Pence, the Vice Presidential nominee, also weighed in on<br>the statement: \"Trump is urging people around this country to act<br>consistent with their convictions in the course of this election, and<br>people who cherish the Second Amendment have a very clear choice in this<br>election.\"<br><br>#UnderstatementOfTheYear. All people have a very clear choice in this<br>election. Liberty or tyrrany. It's as simple as that.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-rDWrl){.citation_index} [[Trump Is Testing the Norms of<br>Objectivity in<br>Journalism](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=af43e9&url=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/08/business/balance-fairness-and-a-proudly-provocative-presidential-candidate.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nytimes.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
