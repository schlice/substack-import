<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with all legal answers, the correct answer is "it depends." In order<br>to be absolutely sure, you would need to consult with a lawyer in your<br>area. I'll try to respond in a general way, for informational purposes<br>only.<br><br>So long as the camera does not record audio (there are separate laws<br>which cover that), and is in a shared space, not a space in which<br>there is a reasonable expectation of privacy (such as a bedroom or a<br>bathroom), then a landlord can likely install a surveillance camera for<br>security purposes.<br><br>The laws in your area may require that he post signage advising all who<br>enter that there are security cameras and entering the space implies<br>consent to monitoring, but those laws vary. Your local laws may not<br>require this.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
