<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How should Trump supporters be punished for Trump naming Jerusalem the<br>capital of Israel and no doubt inciting violence against American<br>people?**<br><br>Why do you want to punish people who had nothing to do with this<br>decision for the results of the decision?<br><br>If you are to punish anyone, the only logical entity to punish is<br>*Congress*.<br><br>It is Congress that passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act on October 24,<br>1995, which named Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The law was never<br>signed or vetoed by the President, and so it became law without the<br>President's signature on November 8, 1995.<br><br>Just one part of this law:<br><br>> JERUSALEM EMBASSY ACT OF 1995<br>><br>> Public Law 104-45<br>><br>> 104th Congress<br>><br>> An Act<br>><br>> To provide for the relocation of the United States Embassy in Israel<br>> to Jerusalem, and for other purposes.<br><br>\<..snip..\><br><br>> The Congress makes the following findings:<br>><br>> \(1\) Each sovereign nation, under international law and custom, may<br>> designate its own capital.\<br>> (2) Since 1950, the city of Jerusalem has been the capital of the<br>> State of Israel\<br>> (3) The city of Jerusalem is the seat of Israel\'s President,<br>> Parliament, and Supreme Court, and the site of numerous government<br>> ministries and social and cultural institutions.\<br>> (4) The city of Jerusalem is the spiritual center of Judaism, and is<br>> also considered a holy city by the members of other religious faiths.\<br>> (5) From 1948-1967, Jerusalem was a divided city and Israeli citizens<br>> of all faiths as well as Jewish citizens of all states were denied<br>> access to holy sites in the area controlled by Jordan\<br>> (6) In 1967, the city of Jerusalem was reunited during the conflict<br>> known as the Six Day War.\<br>> (7) Since 1967, Jerusalem has been a united city administered by<br>> Israel, and persons of all religious faiths have been guaranteed full<br>> access to holy sites within the city.<br><br>As you can see, it is Congress that declared Jerusalem the capital of<br>Israel. Trump is simply fulfilling the will of Congress, since Clinton,<br>Bush, and Obama refused to do so.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
