<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What happens if humans no longer have an emotion of embarrassment so<br>100% surveillance will prevent more problems and there will be no more<br>privacy and secrets?**<br><br>Humans develop a sense of what is public and what is private at<br>somewhere around age 3 to 4. Not long after, they begin to develop a<br>sense of modesty about that which is private. Granted, some of the<br>modesty is dictated by society, but even children innately know the<br>difference between what is public and what is private.<br><br>There is no evolutionary shift that will "deprogram" the fact that some<br>things are public and some things are private.<br><br>We would simply have to nurture the idea that even private things are<br>not private from the government before a 100% surveillance state could<br>ever be workable. This is not something that would happen overnight.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
