Once a content creator publishes content<br>under CC, licensees can use that content based on the terms of that<br>agreement for the duration of that license.<br><br>You can certainly stop distributing new content under the CC license<br>at any time, but once you publish content using the CC license, you<br>cannot retroactively go back and re-license that existing content, or<br>change the terms of the license agreement on content already released<br>under CC. Anyone who has a copy of that CC-licensed content can continue<br>to use it based on the terms of that license.<br><br>As a content creator, therefore, you should think carefully before<br>distributing your content under CC.\[1\](#TCUCK){#cite-TCUCK<br>.citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-TCUCK){.citation_index} [[Frequently Asked<br>Questions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=587b41&url=https://creativecommons.org/faq/%23what-if-i-change-my-mind-about-using-a-cc-license){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="creativecommons.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
