<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Bible doesn't prohibit smoking and drinking directly.<br><br>But it does warn that you must care for your body, and it also directs<br>Christians to avoid drunkenness, since it clouds judgement and is called<br>debauchery.<br><br>Care for your body:<br><br>> Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit<br>> within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were<br>> bought with a price. So glorify God in your body. --- 1 Cor 6:19--20<br>> ESV<br>><br>> So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory<br>> of God. --- 1 Cor 10:31 ESV<br>><br>> Do you not know that you are God\'s temple and that God\'s Spirit<br>> dwells in you? If anyone destroys God\'s temple, God will destroy him.<br>> For God\'s temple is holy, and you are that temple. --- 1 Cor 3:16--17<br><br>Drunkenness:<br><br>> Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity,<br>> sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of<br>> anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies,<br>> and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those<br>> who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. --- Galatians<br>> 5:19--21 ESV<br>><br>> And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled<br>> with the Spirit --- Ephesians 5:18<br><br>So you can be a good Christian even if you smoke and drink. But you must<br>take care of your body, and you must avoid drunkenness. So bear that in<br>mind!<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can one be a good Christian and still smoke and drink alcohol a lot?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
