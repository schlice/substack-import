<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Probably not. No one has the capability to be sinless, by our human<br>nature.<br><br>But we can probably be so sanctified that while we may still<br>unintentionally sin, in our thoughts and in our words, in what we have<br>done, and what we have failed to do, that we recognize it right away,<br>and we can address it with God.<br><br>God knows our hearts. He knows our capabilities, because he designed<br>them. He knows what we are capable of doing. He leads us through<br>sanctification so that we can *recognize* our sinful nature, *prevent*<br>sin as much as we can, and *repent* for the rest.<br><br>We should, however, rest assured that there will continually be sin.<br>Only one was ever sinless, and only one will ever be sinless. We are<br>always human, we are always fallen, and we will always sin. But we<br>always improve, and we always repent.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can a Christian be so sanctified that he no longer sins?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
