<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What time will it take to get a handgun ready for use if it\'s stored<br>at home accordingly to the rules and regulations?**<br><br>As with any legal question, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>In this case, it depends on which state you live in. Only Massachusetts<br>requires that guns be stored with a lock on them. Three states (New<br>York, California, and Connecticut) have laws which require guns to be<br>stored with locks on them, but only if the gun is in a residence in<br>which there resides a prohibited person, and in Connecticut, that's only<br>true if the gun is loaded.\[1\](#pOBwS){#cite-pOBwS .citation_link}<br>The District of Columbia used to have a safe storage law, but it has now<br>been scaled back to a "strong, non-binding policy" after their safe<br>storage law was ruled unconstitutional as part of the landmark decision<br>*DC v. Heller* on 26 June 2008.<br><br>For all other states, there is no legal requirement for a gun to be<br>stored locked.<br><br>Therefore, to answer your question, in Massachusetts, it will probably<br>take you a few minutes to get your handgun ready for use. You'll have to<br>get the gun, get the key, unlock the lock, remove the lock, and load the<br>gun. If you're really fast, you may be able to do this within a minute,<br>but a few minutes is a good estimate.<br><br>In any other state, guns can be stored in whatever condition and<br>whatever state of lock is appropriate for your situation, meaning that a<br>gun can be ready instantly.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-pOBwS){.citation_index} [[Safe Storage \| Giffords Law<br>Center to Prevent Gun<br>Violence](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c2a582&url=https://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/child-consumer-safety/safe-storage/%23state){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="giffords.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
