<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How can you protect your phone from being hacked?<br><br>It's extremely unlikely that your physical device would be hacked<br>remotely. So long as you are using a modern device and you haven't<br>rooted/jailbroken your device, the security from the manufacturer is<br>usually sufficient to prevent the device from being attacked remotely.<br><br>Specifically for Android, don't install applications from the Internet<br>if you are unsure about their origin.<br><br>You are far more vulnerable on your connections than you are on your<br>phone, especially if you connect via Wi-Fi. If you go to Starbuck's and<br>you allow your phone to connect to their free Wi-Fi, your connections<br>can be monitored, pretty easily.<br><br>If you frequently connect to open Wi-Fi, you should invest in a Virtual<br>Private Network (VPN). This secures your connection from start to<br>finish.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
