<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does it bother you that Trump states he is willing to completely<br>destroy an entire country, namely Iran (i.e. genocide)?**<br><br>It would bother me if he woke up one day and said, "You know, I don't<br>like Iran any more, let's destroy the entire country." That would be<br>closer to genocide than what we have now.<br><br>To be fair, questioner, if a country is destroyed in a war, while it is<br>technically the destruction of an entire country, so it technically<br>meets the book definition of the term, it's not done with the express<br>purpose of wiping out a people, or a culture, or a nation.<br><br>For example, the Holocaust was a genocide, as its sole purpose was to<br>eliminate a religious group. The people killed did nothing to inspire<br>such measures.<br><br>If Iran goes to war with the United States, and they lose, and as<br>President Trump tweeted, their entire nation is destroyed, that would be<br>a consequence of their own actions.<br><br>Additionally, in order to qualify as a genocide, most scholars believe<br>that a necessary part is the "intent to destroy." This means that the<br>intention of the act is to remove the group in question from existence.<br>While Trump's tweet was grammatically sloppy in this way, he doesn't<br>intend to destroy the entire country. Specifically, he said that if Iran<br>provoked the United States, they would be destroyed in a subsequent war.<br>"Destroyed" stated in this way is a turn of phrase which means "complete<br>and total defeat" instead of "every person in the country killed." The<br>US would still follow the Geneva Convention's rules for combat and would<br>not intentionally harm civilians, would allow the injured to get<br>treatment, would provide safe quarter for prisoners of war, etc.<br><br>To that end, I think the term "genocide" would be wrongly applied to a<br>war between Iran and the US.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
