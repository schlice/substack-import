<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I will not say yes, because Nexplanon is *mostly* effective at<br>preventing pregnancy.<br><br>It is a birth control hormone, which is slowly released over time<br>into your body. It's exactly like taking the pill, but without having to<br>remember to take a pill.<br><br>It is greater than 99% effective. In studies, less than 1 woman out of<br>100 with the Nexplanon implant got pregnant. But that is not zero. There<br>is a risk of pregnancy with Nexplanon. It is just a very low risk.<br><br>It's also important to know that the implant does not protect you<br>against other things that can happen during unprotected sex, like the<br>transmission of *sexually transmitted infections* (STIs).<br><br>So for the most part, you can safely have unprotected sex with your<br>significant other without having to worry *too much* about unplanned<br>pregnancy. So long as you understand the risks.<br><br>Talk to your doctor about your questions when you talk to him or her<br>about getting any implanted birth control.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If I were to get the Nexplanon implant, would my significant other be<br>able to ejaculate in me without having to worry about pregnancy?<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
