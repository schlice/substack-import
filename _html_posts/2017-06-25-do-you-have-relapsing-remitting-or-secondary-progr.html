<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I have RRMS.<br><br>I started on Copaxone, and used it for about seven years. It worked<br>great until it stopped working. I had a relapse and picked up a new<br>symptom.<br><br>I switched to Tysabri. It worked great. So well, in fact, that over the<br>18 months I was on it, some of my lesions started to *shrink.* But the<br>method of administration (infusion) was hard on my liver, which was<br>already taxed processing depression meds. This altered the levels of<br>meds between infusions, and sent my mood into a monthly roller coaster.<br>So we were forced to switch again.<br><br>We settled on Gilenya, and while it has caused some GI issues, it has<br>largely been effective.<br><br>Best medicine overall for my MS? Tysabri.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
