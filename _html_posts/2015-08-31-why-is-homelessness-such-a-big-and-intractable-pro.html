<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There are many reasons the homeless population has<br>skyrocketed in this country since the 70s:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>- [Deinstitutionalisation(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=57d7ab&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deinstitutionalization){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}: Some studies state<br>  that up to one third of the homeless population is comprised of people<br>  who were displaced from state mental institutions when they were<br>  closed down.<br>- Drugs: We\'re seeing the effects of the legalization of marijuana most<br>  notably in our homeless population. [[Legal marijuana drawing homeless<br>  to<br>  Colorado.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6f1547&url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/legal-marijuana-drawing-homeless-to-colorado/){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="cbsnews.com"}]{.qlink_container} We\'re seeing huge spikes<br>  in the 18-25 year old homeless population, who come to Colorado with<br>  big ambitions of \"smoke pot. And probaly need to find some work to<br>  pay for the pot,\" but minimum-wage jobs are not plentiful, and with<br>  the new influx of people into the state, the ones that do appear are<br>  quickly filled.<br>- Rising home prices: Normally, you would think that a rising economy<br>  and rising housing prices would be a good thing. That is, until you<br>  can\'t afford to live in your home any longer. While the economy of<br>  the state is doing well, the number of affordable homes in the state<br>  is dwindling.<br><br>\<br>I\'m sure there are many more reasons, but these are just a few off the<br>top of my head.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
