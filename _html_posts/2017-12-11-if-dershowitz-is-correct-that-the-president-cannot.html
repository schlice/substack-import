<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If Dershowitz is correct that the president cannot be criminally<br>prosecuted for obstructing justice by firing Comey, couldn't it<br>nevertheless be grounds for impeachment?**<br><br>Dershowitz is talking about *criminal* charges, since Congressional<br>members were calling this "obstruction of justice," which is a crime. He<br>was saying that the President can't be charged with a crime when he is<br>discharging his lawful, specified duties under the Constitution.<br><br>*Could this still, though, be impeachable?* The short answer is<br>yes it can. Why? Impeachment is a *political* process, not a<br>*criminal* one.<br><br>If the Congress can see fit to find something that the president did<br>that was, perhaps, an abuse of his power, or intended specifically to<br>"derail" the investigation, then perhaps they could make the case that<br>impeachment is warranted.<br><br>But I don't see how. President George H. W. Bush did something very<br>similar: he pardoned Casper Weinberger specifically to forestall the<br>investigation which would have eventually implicated him, and he was not<br>impeached for abusing his pardon power. So I can't see how Trump,<br>***assuming he fired Comey specifically to derail the investigation into<br>him (which he did not)*** would be impeached for doing the same thing<br>that previous presidents have done without being impeached themselves.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
