<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I see the logical fallacy.<br><br>In one respect, we treat the fetus as a person, with rights against<br>being harmed or killed. In the other, we treat the fetus as a collection<br>of cells, the fate of which can be arbitrarily determined by the mother.<br>So in one sense, the fetus has rights, and in another sense, the fetus<br>does not.<br><br>The question is not about the rights of the mother. Those rights never<br>change. *Roe* supporters, please stop now, save your digital breath.<br>This has nothing to do with the ability of a woman to determine what<br>happens with her body. The question is about legitimizing the fetus as a<br>person simply because it is "wanted" or it is "not wanted." If it is<br>"not wanted," it is a collection of cells. If it is "wanted," it is a<br>person with rights which need to be protected. You can't have it both<br>ways. The fetus is either a person or it is not. We need to have an<br>objective standard to determine that the fetus is or is not a person in<br>order to create law which can be equally applied. The feelings of the<br>mother cannot change the personhood status of the fetus.<br><br>Eventually, this will be challenged when someone is charged under this<br>statute, and they will say that the personhood clause is<br>unconstitutional because of *Roe*. If the mother can destroy the fetus<br>at will, it does not have any rights, and therefore cannot be protected<br>under the law. Indeed, scholars have wondered if the definition of a<br>person in section (d) of the Unborn Victims of Violence Act will trigger<br>the "collapse clause" in *Roe* by establishing what the decision said<br>must be established in order for legal abortion to end. (For those who<br>don't know, section (d) defines all unborn babies as "members of the<br>species homo sapiens").<br><br>The "collapse clause" in *Roe* reads (emphasis mine):<br><br>> The appellee and certain amici argue that the fetus is a \'person\'<br>> within the language and meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. In<br>> support of this, they outline at length and in detail the well-known<br>> facts of fetal development. **If this suggestion of personhood is<br>> established, the appellant\'s case, of course, collapses, \[410 U.S.<br>> 113, 157\] for the fetus\' right to life would then be guaranteed<br>> specifically by the Amendment.** The appellant conceded as much on<br>> reargument\.\<br><br>I think the Unborn Victims of Violence Act tipifies why *Roe* is bad<br>law.<br><br>Again, *Roe* supporters, this doesn't mean that I believe a woman<br>shouldn't have the right to choose what happens to her body. I simply<br>assert that the legal basis on which *Roe* was decided was terrible.<br>They could have done much better by defining an objective standard at<br>which a fetus becomes a person (i.e. brain activity, heartbeat, etc) and<br>make that the "cut-off" point after which abortion can only be performed<br>if it is deemed to be medically necessary to preserve the life of the<br>mother. Before that point, elective abortions and abortion-on-demand is<br>legal. Defining a point at which "life" begins separates when the fetus<br>is a fetus and when it is a person. Then, both decisions can live<br>together.<br><br>You actually don't need to re-argue *Roe* for that to happen. Just pass<br>a "smart" personhood amendment which says that life begins at the first<br>sign of brain activity, or at the point at which the fetus can survive<br>outside the womb, or whatever they decide. It would also supply a legal<br>definition to state that the phrase "the unborn" used anywhere does not<br>apply to a fetus. Then *Roe* would collapse when the fetus becomes a<br>person, and the Unborn Victims of Violence Act would attach at that<br>point as well, but not before, as it only attaches to the unborn, and a<br>fetus is specifically excluded from the category of "unborn."<br><br>Now all we have to do is define when a fetus becomes a person. Yeah,<br>simple...<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
