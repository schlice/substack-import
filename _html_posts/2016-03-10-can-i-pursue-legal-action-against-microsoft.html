<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In addition to the other good answers here, the TOS likely also says<br>that Microsoft can change your gamer tag at their sole discretion at any<br>time.<br><br>Secondly, you would have to show some harm was caused by Microsoft<br>changing your gamer tag. For example, if you\'re losing money because<br>your gamer tag was changed, you can challenge their ruling. The TOS<br>probably specifies that you must use binding arbitration, not the<br>courts, for such actions (most TOS\'s do; I don\'t know for Microsoft\'s<br>TOS, you will have to research it).<br><br>Good luck.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
