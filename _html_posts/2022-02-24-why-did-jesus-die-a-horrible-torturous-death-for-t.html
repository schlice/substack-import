<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The purpose of Jesus' death and resurrection wasn't to *eliminate sin*.<br>Man has a sinful nature; Jesus didn't come to correct that, or to change<br>the nature of man. Man is still sinful by his very nature.<br><br>Jesus came to *atone for* that sin. Jesus died and was resurrected<br>so that our sin no longer separates us from the love of God and eternal<br>life. Jesus conquered death and gave us the pathway to eternal life.<br><br>But we are still sinful, and we can still freely choose to reject the<br>gift of salvation offered by Jesus' death and resurrection. For love<br>must be given freely, not coerced, or forced through some abolition of<br>sin.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why did Jesus die a horrible torturous death for the sin of man for man<br>to continue sinning ? The Holocaust happened to Jews that devoted their<br>lives to God. Doesn\'t make sense?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
