<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can a citizen shoot a policeman that has trespassed a private<br>property?**<br><br>So are you asking when the trial is over and the officer has been found<br>guilty of trespassing can you take out a gun and shoot them?<br><br>No? You mean when the officer is on the property? Can you shoot them for<br>trespassing while they are on your property?<br><br>So clearly you can't, for multiple reasons:<br><br>1.  Trespassing isn't a situation in which you are in fear for your<br>    life. No one has made an overt threat on your life. Therefore, you<br>    can't really be defending your life or the life of your family from<br>    someone who hasn't threatened them. The presence of a police officer<br>    on your property does not, by itself, constitute a threat on your<br>    life.<br>2.  Police officers may actually have a legal right to be on your<br>    property that you are unaware of, which is where my humorous first<br>    line in my answer came from. Trespassing is a matter of law to be<br>    determined by a judge, not something you can determine while it is<br>    happening.<br>3.  Even if a police officer said he was coming on to your property to<br>    arrest you, you still can't shoot him, because he's acting under<br>    "color or law," which means he's doing his job. When he enters your<br>    property in order to do his job, he is protected from legal action<br>    when it is directed at his actions required by that execution of the<br>    law. In such a situation, he's not even technically trespassing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
