<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**After my tenants left, the house needed some major repairs and<br>painting, was it worth renting if it was left like this?**<br><br>I don't mean to come down on you because you probably didn't know.<br><br>Next time you rent your house, you should collect a security deposit. A<br>security deposit is money that you have the option of refunding when<br>your tenant leaves. The deposit would partially cover the costs to<br>repair any damages done to the unit. If you do your final walkthrough<br>with your tenants and you see significant damage, you may keep their<br>security deposit and use it to offset some of the costs of repairing the<br>unit.<br><br>If they return the unit in the same condition in which you rented it,<br>you can refund their security deposit to them when they leave.<br><br>Additionally, if your rental agreement says that they should have<br>returned the unit to you in the same condition in which they received<br>it, you can sue them in small claims court to try to recoup some of the<br>costs of repair.<br><br>A well-written rental agreement, and a substantial security deposit,<br>would have prevented these kinds of issues. If you're going to rent your<br>unit out again, you might consider having your rental agreement reviewed<br>by a real estate attorney who specializes in owner/tenant law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
