<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are some fairly significant costs, which cannot be overlooked.<br>Additionally, you must view all of these costs as necessary *only*<br>if the cost can be justified against the mission and vision of the US<br>military, which is to be the greatest fighting force on the face of the<br>planet. Therefore, any expenditure must, in some way, further that goal.<br>In other words, it must increase troop readiness, efficiency, or<br>provide/enhance the tools or training they need to do their jobs.<br><br>Also, I can provide the source for all of these numbers, but to see how<br>they were determined would require a post of its own. The numbers used<br>were all from pro-LGBT sources. And while some estimates for the amount<br>of people who might seek surgery are lower, those estimates are based on<br>covering the cost individually; it is assumed that if the military<br>covered the cost, more eligible people would seek that surgery.<br><br>First, the military would be on the hook for gender reassignment<br>surgery, if a trans person chose to receive such surgery. They would<br>then be required to pay for hormone replacement therapy, as well as lost<br>time for recovery. Finally, there is the "real life experience" cost to<br>the military, which many dollar estimates fail to account for:<br><br>> *Standards of care established by the World Professional Association<br>> for Transgender Health (WPATH) require a year of "living in a gender<br>> role that is congruent with their gender identity" before surgery<br>> (what is known as "Real Life Experience," or RLE); the military did<br>> not wish to allow a change in the service member's "gender marker"<br>> until after any planned surgery is completed, yet military dress codes<br>> do not allow a service member to live in the target gender until after<br>> the gender marker has been changed. The DoD Instruction issued June<br>> 30, 2016 said that therefore, "consistent application of military<br>> standards will normally require that RLE occur in an off-duty status<br>> and away from the Service member's place of<br>> duty."*\[1\](#NMGQp){#cite-NMGQp .citation_link}<br><br>In short, this means that a trans person will have to spend a minimum of<br>one year in an off-duty status, away from the duty station, which also<br>means you have a military member in a non-deployable, non-functional<br>status for a year. Next to the actual surgery, this is a huge cost to<br>our military readiness.<br><br>It is estimated that such surgeries and all associated costs, for every<br>trans military troop that wanted them, incoming or existing, would use<br>\$3.7 billion over 10 years from the military's already tight<br>budget. In context, that money could buy a Navy destroyer, 22 F-35 Joint<br>Strike Fighter aircraft, 3,700 Tomahawk missiles, or 116 Chinook<br>helicopters.<br><br>In the latest round of defense funding requests, Congress requested an<br>extra \$80 billion. Shouldn't we at least question whether or not we<br>spend almost 5% of that money on gender reassignment surgeries and all<br>associated personnel and medical costs, when they do not further the<br>mission of the military?<br><br>And I forgot to add (and I'd better, before the trolls show up): I don't<br>care if you're trans. I don't care if you have gender reassignment<br>surgery. What you do in your own life is your own business. The<br>*ONLY* thing I care about is whether or not I think the US military<br>should *pay* for your gender reassignment surgery, and whether or not<br>the cost of having a military member sidelined for a year while they<br>participate in their 12-month real-life experience leave is a benefit to<br>the US military; in other words, does it benefit troop readiness, does<br>it make for a stronger fighting force, does it make us fight better?<br><br>And here's another thing to consider (and again, I mean no offense<br>against trans people, but since the point was made while these numbers<br>were being computed, it's worth addressing): Since there is a portion of<br>the trans population who has not undergone gender reassignment surgery<br>because of the cost, is there then a non-significant number of trans<br>people who would join the military simply to have them pay for surgery?<br>To be fair, there are people who join the military without having<br>"serving their country" as their primary objective. Some join because<br>they want the education benefits. Some join because they think it will<br>"give" them discipline, when they have none in their life already. These<br>people are indeed the exception rather than the rule. It's not<br>insensitive to ask the question if it's right to add yet another<br>exception to that rule.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-NMGQp){.citation_index}<br>[http://downloads.frc.org/EF/EF17\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=11ad2e&url=http://downloads.frc.org/EF/EF17F52.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="frc.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
