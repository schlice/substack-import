<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>***TRIGGER WARNING: Unpopular opinions ahead. Don't read if you can't<br>handle unpopular opinions!***<br><br>\<br><br>The biggest "health risk" a woman may face is that she'd have to travel<br>to a different state to get a legal abortion. And if she chose to get an<br>abortion where abortions were illegal, she'd be voluntarily incurring a<br>health risk. But you take on that risk when you do illegal things<br>anyway.<br><br>But if she's following the law, then there's really no "health risk"<br>here, is there.<br><br>Because abortion is not health care.<br><br>Abortion is an elective procedure. So you can *elect* not to do it, and<br>you'll not die. Therefore, it's not health care. Are tattoos health<br>care? Are piercings health care? Is LASIK health care? Those are all<br>elective procedures. You can *not* do those things and you'll not die<br>(in most cases). That means they're not health care.<br><br>And if you don't get an abortion, but your pregnancy DOES threaten your<br>life or your health, doctors can legally abort your baby *even if<br>abortion is 100% illegal.* **Medical intervention to save your life was<br>never in question, and still wouldn't be in question, even if**<br>*Roe* and *Casey* are overturned.<br><br>The only thing that overturning *Roe* and *Casey* does is return control<br>of the issue to the states, and allows them to decide for themselves<br>whether or not to allow that elective procedure in their state. Elected<br>representatives become responsible for enacting those policies, not<br>unelected Justices-for-life at the Supreme Court. The people have direct<br>control, by electing representatives who will set state policy as the<br>majority of voters see fit.<br><br>\<br><br>*Comments are getting stupid again.*<br><br>*The only thing we are discussing here is* ***whether, and when, it is<br>morally acceptable to terminate the life of a human being for the sake<br>of convenience.***<br><br>*If you start muddling the discussion with "what about IVF, what about<br>rape, what about the life of the mother..." then I'll politely guide you<br>back to this discussion. If you continue, your crap will be deleted.<br>Focus on the issue at hand, or don't waste our time.*<br><br>*Let me repeat what I said in my answer:* ***Medical intervention to<br>save your life was never in question, and still wouldn't be in question,<br>even if Roe and Casey are overturned.***<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What are the biggest health risks women would face if Roe v.
