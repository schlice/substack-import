<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In order to understand the alleged paradox between omniscience and free<br>will, we first must understand how God is able to be omniscient. God<br>created the universe and everything in it. This includes time as we know<br>it. We therefore live within the confines of time, while God does not.<br>God exists *outside of time,* and therefore does not experience time in<br>the same way we do.<br><br>For God, everything is *now*. The past is now. The present is now. The<br>future is now.<br><br>Therefore, God's omniscience extends to not only what we do when we bump<br>up against a choice, but it extends to the choices we make and what we<br>do with those choices. In other words, at the moment He created the<br>universe and everything in it, God knew, for all time, that you would<br>face the choice that you faced. He knew, for all time, what choice you<br>would make. And He knew, for all time, the outcome of that choice.<br><br>However, *at the moment of choice*, you still have absolute free will to<br>choose any choice you have available. This does not apply to God, since<br>the ability to choose at all implies being subject to time. For example,<br>there is a moment in time *before* your choice, then there is a moment<br>in time when you *make* a choice, and then there is a moment in time<br>*after* your choice, where you take the path chosen by your choice.<br>God's ability to see your choice, for all time, doesn't mean that you<br>had to choose that path. It simply means that He knows what choice you<br>freely made.<br><br>If God predestined all of our choices, then how could He hold us<br>responsible for anything we do? How could we hold one another<br>responsible for anything we do? We could all just say, "Hey, I didn't<br>want to kill that person, but God made me do it" and they'd be right. No<br>one could personally be held accountable for anything that they ever<br>did. The simple fact that we hold each other accountable for our choices<br>implies that we know that we have the free will to make choices.<br><br>But with that in mind, we need to ask this question: *are any of our<br>choices ever free?* What makes us choose one option over the other?<br>Ultimately, we choose the choice which will benefit us, and we desire<br>what will benefit us to the greatest degree. Therefore, *we choose the<br>choice which correlates with our greatest desire at that very moment of<br>choice.* So it stands to reason that our choices are *never* truly free,<br>because we are deciding based on our desires, not necessarily our free<br>will. Some might argue, however, that even that choice is free, because<br>it is *our* desires and *our* free will which allows us to choose, not<br>some external influence impacting our free will. But does it really<br>matter where the influence comes from, either God or your desires? One<br>way or another, *something* influences your free will.<br><br>So does free will exist? Of course it does. You are free to make the<br>choices you want to make. But you are *compelled* to choose the choice<br>you most desire at the moment of choice. "Free but compelled."<br><br>And does God have any influence over your desires? You bet He does! But<br>only if *you let Him.*<br><br>Before we are saved, we follow the desires of the flesh, which are<br>always sinful. We choose according to our desires which are only wicked<br>continuously the Bible tells us. And that we are, as it were, dead in<br>sin and trespasses, even though biologically we're very much alive. And<br>we're walking according to the course of this world, according to the<br>prince of the power of air, fulfilling the lusts of the flesh is what<br>the Bible tells us. And so, the Bible makes it very clear that we are<br>actively involved in making choices for which we are responsible, and<br>which expose us to the judgment of God.<br><br>But once we submit to the will of God, He tailors our desires so that we<br>desire what is in keeping with His plan for our lives. So God does not<br>interfere with our choices. He shapes our desires so that for those who<br>love Him and hear His voice, our desires match His will for us, so that<br>we will choose the path which most closely aligns with the good works He<br>has planned for us (see Jeremiah 29:11).<br><br>God does not want us to adopt a fear-driven mindset about our future<br>(see Romans 8:15). His sovereign power over our lives is meant to<br>inspire us to hope, not worry. Our desires are not necessarily bad<br>desires, but God ultimately knows what is best for us, and therefore He<br>shapes our desires to determine where we go and how our lives unfold<br>(Proverbs 16:9).<br><br>He desires that we surrender our own plans to Him so that we can be<br>ready, willing, and available to go wherever He leads, regardless of<br>whether it's what we pictured or planned for ourselves. It is never easy<br>to loosen our grip on our own desires, but it is the first step to<br>experiencing the joy of embracing God's will for us.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
