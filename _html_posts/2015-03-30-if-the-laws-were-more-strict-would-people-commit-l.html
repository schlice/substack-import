<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Limiting the discussion to capital offenses as you asked,<br>I would say that the strictness of the law has little to do with whether<br>or not people will actually commit the crime. In some states, capital<br>offenses are punishable by death, and I\'m not sure we can get much<br>stricter than that. Yet, people still commit murder in those states.\<br>\<br>What tends to be the aggravating factor is the fact that people can get<br>away with it so easily. It\'s a known fact that most criminals do not<br>get caught. So if I\'m a \"smart criminal\" (an oxymoron if I ever heard<br>one), I\'d do the crime and NOT get caught. Yeah, I\'ll be a smart<br>criminal\...]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
