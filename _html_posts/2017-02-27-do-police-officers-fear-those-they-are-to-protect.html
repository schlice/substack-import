<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Fear is the wrong word to use. As Mark Twain said, "Courage is<br>resistance to fear, mastery of fear, not absence of fear." Fear is a<br>useful emotion if it is used to heighten your senses, and make you more<br>acutely aware of your surroundings, and able to react to situations as<br>they unfold. Every cop feels that little twinge before they open that<br>door and step into that situation. You'd be a fool if you didn't.<br><br>But the situation of today is a different kind of fear. It's not fear of<br>the criminal. It's fear of the *prosecutor*. In high-crime areas like<br>Chicago, you also have highly litigious, sometimes anti-cop city<br>administrations. They are easily willing to indict a cop on a trumped-up<br>charge simply to assuage the public. Example: Baltimore. Marilyn Moseby.<br>Indicted six police officers on depraved-heart murder in the Freddy Gray<br>case just to stop a crowd from rioting. This story ended with all six<br>officers acquitted of murder charges (IIRC, one officer was charged with<br>a lesser offense), and Moseby facing the loss of her law license and<br>disbarment over what she did.<br><br>But this illustrates the true fear that officers face today.<br><br>From simply doing what they are charged with doing, they face riots,<br>mobs, and increased danger at the scene. Mobile phones are shoved in<br>their faces as people record the scene, hoping for *one little slip-up*<br>so they can get their 15 minutes of fame on YouTube. Officers are<br>harassed while they exercise their authority, because people have bought<br>the whole "all police officers are racist" lie.<br><br>What is the net from all of this? Officers are simply not initiating<br>discretionary stops anymore. They will still respond to victims who call<br>911, but discretionary stops are *way* down in many big cities. This has<br>led to the first significant spike in crime in over two decades.<br><br>All the worse for everyone.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
