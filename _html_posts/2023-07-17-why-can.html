That's it. Their job is<br>not to determine that the people who wrote the rules in the Constitution<br>were *wrong* when they did it. And it's certainly not their job to<br>decide cases accordingly.<br><br>The Court decides cases based on how the Constitution is written, based<br>on what the people who wrote it believed at the time they wrote it.<br><br>If there is anyone who must accept the fallibility of the Founding<br>Fathers, it is the American people. When they find that fallibility, it<br>is up to the American people to amend the Constitution to correct any<br>failings that they find.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
