title: '"What would a gun owner do if I set up a HOA in his neighborhood, and made
  it a rule that no guns are allowed anymore? I would make him personally deliver
  all his guns to me, along with a hand-written apology for owning them. Is this legal?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I love how gun control advocates bend themselves into pretzels to try to<br>legally force law abiding citizens to be "forced" to give up their<br>legally owned firearms.<br><br>So here's the problems with your "plan":<br><br>1.  If I already own my house, you can't set up a HOA that he *must* be<br>    a part of. You can only set up a *voluntary* HOA, not a *mandatory*<br>    HOA. Mandatory HOAs can only be created when the builder is<br>    developing the neighborhood, and the HOA is put in place before any<br>    homes are purchased. So your gun owner homeowner has no legal<br>    obligation to join the HOA.<br>2.  The HOA would not have a valid reason to restrict firearms inside of<br>    residents' homes. Despite what the screaming trolls on the Internet<br>    say, the HOA doesn't control your life. The HOA maintains home<br>    values by controlling the appearance of the outside of your home and<br>    managing the common areas, not by managing what goes on inside.<br>3.  Transfers of firearms as you are describing are regulated by law,<br>    and may be illegal where you live. Universal background checks would<br>    mean that *you* would have to have a background check performed<br>    against you before you could receive the firearms. Other states<br>    require a FFL to perform the transfer (including background checks),<br>    and that's not free. The HOA would have to pay for that.<br>4.  And why are *you* a better handler of the firearms than *he*? What<br>    makes *you* better qualified to handle a firearm than *he*?<br>5.  Why does someone need to apologize for exercising a Constitutional<br>    right? This part makes absolutely no sense to me. And why must it be<br>    hand-written? No one writes letters by hand anymore.<br>6.  And last (but certainly not least), it's a Constitutional right.<br>    Your HOA rule would violate the Constitution, so it's pretty much<br>    DOA anyway. The HOA doesn't have a compelling interest which would<br>    be greater than the rights granted by the Constitution.<br><br>It sounds like you just want to make life difficult for the gun owner,<br>with no real logic behind why you're doing it. It's almost like you want<br>to exact some form of revenge against a person who is merely exercising<br>his Constitutional rights.<br><br>In other words, *you don't like guns and you want to find a legal way to<br>make gun owners suffer.*<br><br>I'll just leave that right where it is.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
