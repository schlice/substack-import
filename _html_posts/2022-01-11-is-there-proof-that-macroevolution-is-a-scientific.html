<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We're looking at the wrong question. And in doing so, we may be<br>overlooking the real problem with asking this question.<br><br>Whether or not microevolution or macroevolution are real or are even<br>scientific fact are not necessarily in question. Scientists make the<br>assertion that if you believe that microevolution is a thing (it is),<br>therefore macroevolution must be a thing as well. Let's leave this<br>assertion alone for now. I'd even be willing to accept this as a given.<br>I'd even go so far, right now, as to say that yes, macroevolution is<br>scientific fact.<br><br>However, there is a really big problem that macroevolution now<br>illuminates, and it is a problem which cannot be ignored if you are to<br>ask the question about macroevolution. If scientists can make the<br>inference between microevolution and macroevolution, it is only fair<br>that we make a similar inference between macroevolution and the first<br>life: **For unguided, naturalistic macroevolution to be true, the first<br>life must have generated spontaneously from nonliving chemicals.**<br>Evolutionists have failed to show where this first life came from,<br>especially given DNA present in even the earliest single-cell organisms.<br><br>The Principle of Uniformity says that only an intelligent cause could<br>assemble an intelligent message such as what is found in DNA, because we<br>have never observed mindless chemical interactions produce any messages,<br>let alone at the quantities and specified complexity of DNA. And<br>spontaneous generation of life has never been observed. From the<br>very earliest scientific observation, we know that life only arises from<br>similar existing life. **Scientists have never been able to combine<br>chemicals in a test tube and arrive at DNA, let alone life.** All<br>experiments *designed* to spontaneously generate life not only have<br>failed, but have all suffered from the illegitimate application of<br>intelligence. Scientists *intelligently designed* experiments to<br>simulate spontaneous generation, and yet cannot do it. Why should we<br>believe that mindless natural processes can do what brilliant scientists<br>cannot?<br><br>And *even if* scientists could create life spontaneously in the lab,<br>it would prove creation, because it would prove that it takes a lot<br>of intelligence to create life.<br><br>On top of that, DNA presents the evolutionist with an even bigger<br>challenge. It's a chicken-and-egg dilemma. DNA is built with proteins,<br>but proteins rely on DNA for *their* production. So which came first,<br>proteins or DNA?<br><br>Evolutionists see the evidence for intelligent design, but then ignore<br>intelligent design as a possibility. Dawkins even admits it. On the very<br>first page of his book *The Blind Watchmaker*, Dawkins says, "Biology is<br>the study of complicated things that give the appearance of having been<br>designed for a purpose." Then, two pages later, despite the "intricate<br>architecture and precision-engineering" found in human life, Dawkins<br>flatly denies that human life was designed. Apparently, Dawkins won't<br>let observation get in the way of his preconceptions. This is odd,<br>especially given the supremacy that Dawkins gives to the scientific<br>method, which is predicated on observation.<br><br>Evolutionists believe that spontaneous generation of life *must* be the<br>cause of life *because they refuse to admit that there may be another<br>cause*. Spontaneous generation is what we call a "just-so" story.<br>Evolutionists cannot provide any evidence to support spontaneous<br>generation. It certainly isn't supported by empirical evidence or<br>forensic scientific inquiry. It's "just-so" because life exists, and<br>*since intelligent design is summarily dismissed*, it must be the<br>answer, as there is no other answer available to choose.<br><br>TL;DR: Macroevolution may exist. Macroevolution may have even<br>occurred at some point in the long history of the world. But<br>macroevolution alone is insufficient to explain how we were created,<br>especially given the problem of explaining DNA.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is there proof that macroevolution is a scientific fact and not just a<br>theoretical model?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
