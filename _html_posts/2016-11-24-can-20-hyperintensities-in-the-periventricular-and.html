<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Can* it be nothing to worry about? Yes, it can.<br><br>*Is* it nothing to worry about? Once you find out the cause of such<br>hyperintensities, you won't have to worry about it.<br><br>But I presume that you got an MRI in the first place because you had a<br>symptom of something.<br><br>Like me.<br><br>I got an MRI when I had a bout of *Optic Neuritis*, which is a condition<br>where the optic nerve behind the ocular orbit swells, causing decreased<br>signal intensity through the area of swelling. The condition itself is<br>not much to worry about, some discomfort when looking around, and some<br>vision change during the period that ON is busy doing its thing. The<br>condition resolves itself in the "few weeks to a few months" timeframe.<br>*What causes it* is the more nefarious question. In half of the people<br>who presented with ON at my age, there was no underlying cause. In the<br>other half of the people, the cause was multiple sclerosis. I needed an<br>MRI to confirm.<br><br>My MRI showed all the signs of someone with MS. And by the way, I also<br>had about 20 hyperintensities in my MRI. The majority of them caused no<br>symptoms; what we call "silent" lesions.<br><br>I still needed a neurologist to do a full neuro workup on me, including<br>blood tests to rule out the most easily identified causes of<br>hyperintensities on MRIs (what they referred to as the "little white<br>spot" series). I did not need a lumbar puncture (also known as a spinal<br>tap) since my symptoms along with the MRI were enough to confirm MS.<br><br>So my suggestion to you: if you haven't seen a neurologist yet, now is<br>the time. Make an appointment (or get a referral, depending on your<br>insurance) and go see a neurologist. If you have an MS Center in your<br>area, try to get in with one of the docs in there. They are specialists<br>in neurological conditions, and you will be best served by the resources<br>they can offer.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
