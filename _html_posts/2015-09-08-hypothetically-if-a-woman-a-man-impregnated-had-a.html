<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It sounds like they\'re just looking for money to help her<br>cover her medical expenses and they\'re looking to you to try to get<br>some.\<br>\<br>However, since you have \"from her lawyer\" in your answer, you do<br>realize that Quora is not where you should be asking this question, but<br>you should be asking it of your own lawyer. If you don\'t have a lawyer<br>yet, you need to get one. Yesterday.\<br>\<br>I\'m not sure why they are seeking redress from you. You didn\'t cause<br>the miscarriage, nor did you contribute to the condition which caused<br>the miscarriage. You contributed to the condition which would have<br>produced a healthy child, had it not been for the mother\'s underlying<br>reason for which she miscarried. Unless you were systematically beating<br>her or attempting to induce her pregnancy, how can you be held<br>responsible for the miscarriage?\<br>\<br>And if you can\'t be held responsible for the miscarriage, you can\'t be<br>held responsible for the medical costs surrounding the miscarriage.\<br>\<br>I suspect they want you to help contribute to her medical costs, which<br>should be reasonable. But the costs need to be reasonable<br>too.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
