<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will the Biden ban get rid of all semi-automatic firearms or just<br>ARs?**<br><br>Since there has not been a concrete piece of legislation to consider,<br>just Biden's words, we really don't know. There are some older pieces of<br>failed legislation that the House hopes to revive, but nothing has come<br>out of committee yet.<br><br>On 14 Feb 2021 (the third anniversary of the Parkland shooting), Biden<br>took the opportunity to call for Congress to pass reforms to gun laws:<br><br>> Today, I am calling on Congress to enact commonsense gun law reforms,<br>> including requiring background checks on all gun sales, banning<br>> assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and eliminating immunity<br>> for gun manufacturers who knowingly put weapons of war on our streets.<br><br>So let's review the three points in his statement:<br><br>Universal background checks: We can examine this one fairly clearly<br>as we know why they were never implemented in the first place: cost.<br>A National Instant Criminal Background Check system, open to anyone who<br>wants it, would be prohibitively costly and rife with abuse.<br><br>The system would be far too expensive to build out now, and you can't<br>expand our current NICS system and allow unfettered access; you would<br>have to build a new one from scratch. The cost was too much then, and it<br>would be even more now.<br><br>Additionally, despite rules prohibiting it, it would be used for more<br>than just gun transfers. Employers would use it when hiring people. Dads<br>would use it before their daughters went on dates. People in the dating<br>scene would use it to screen potential dates. And anyone could use it on<br>anyone for whom Social Security numbers are accessible. While those all<br>sound very enticing, and some maybe even desirable, the privacy<br>implications are really scary, and not something that the general public<br>is really interested in.<br><br>Finally, universal background checks for every gun transfer are<br>unworkable. For example, if I want to gift a rifle to my 18 year old<br>son, I need to run a background check on my son. If I want to get that<br>cute little pink Ruger LCP (look it up) for my wife, I need to run a<br>background check on my wife. If I need to store my firearms safely at my<br>friend's house because I'm being evacuated from mine (true story), I<br>would need a background check on my friend. And what would that hope to<br>accomplish? Would we be safer because of it? Is there a rash of<br>transfers from father to son or husband to wife that is leading directly<br>to lawless action? It's really just a hindrance to lawful gun owners.<br><br>It's probably also telling that in the four states which have enacted<br>universal background checks by law, compliance has hovered around 5%.<br>It's really an unworkable system.<br><br>Banning assault weapons and high capacity magazines: How onerous or<br>useless this is really depends on the definition of "assault weapons"<br>and "high-capacity magazines."<br><br>If "assault weapons" are defined as flimsily as they were in the past,<br>with only cosmetic features making up the lion's share of restrictions<br>(collapsible stocks, pistol grips, barrel shrouds, mounting lugs, etc),<br>then they will only spawn a rash of accessories which function the same,<br>but "look" less scary, and are narrowly legal. It won't stop anything at<br>all. Same with "high-capacity magazines." Does that mean a standard<br>30-round mag like my M4 takes, or does that mean the 100-round drum mag<br>piece of crap? Because if you limit magazines to 10 rounds, all it does<br>is make me reload more; it does literally nothing to slow me down. I can<br>switch mags in a little more than a second, and I'm right back to<br>firing. With practice, I could do it faster.<br><br>Besides, we already tried it, and it did nothing. The Assault Weapons<br>Ban put in place during Clinton's administration was proven to have ZERO<br>effect on gun violence. None. It did not accomplish anything that it set<br>out to do, so it was allowed to expire.<br><br>**Eliminating immunity for gun manufacturers who knowingly put weapons<br>of war on our streets.** Wow. The President of the United States<br>actually mis-characterized what an existing law does, just so he can<br>score political brownie points. Oh yeah, just another day in Washington.<br><br>The PLCAA (Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act), which Biden is<br>calling on to be repealed, prevents people from suing gun manufacturers<br>when people use their products illegally. The Act was passed after a<br>spate of lawsuits against gun manufacturers to try to hold them<br>accountable when people misused their firearms. They were also designed<br>to make participation in the marketplace too costly for gun<br>manufacturers to continue their business. However, today, just as then,<br>you can't hold a company liable if someone misuses your product. Even if<br>the bill is repealed, and someone tries to sue a gun manufacturer when a<br>crazed gunman misuses their product, the gun manufacturer will prevail,<br>because they cannot prevent anyone from misusing their product and<br>harming people. What's next, suing Ford when I get hit by a drunk<br>driver? The only person responsible for a criminal's bad actions is that<br>criminal. Searching for deeper pockets to assuage your grief or to try<br>to disrupt lawful commerce because you personally find a product<br>distasteful is repugnant to free enterprise. Yes life is precious. No,<br>you don't have the right to disrupt lawful commerce because you disagree<br>with a company's product.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
