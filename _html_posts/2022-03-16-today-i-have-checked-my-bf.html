<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's see if we can help you find the problem.<br><br>I highlighted the most significant part of your question:<br><br>*Today I have checked my bf\'s phone by chance and saw he liked some<br>girl\'s video on TikTok. He asked sorry many times and deleted the app,<br>he promised not to see these type of videos.* ***But I have trust<br>issues.*** *What should I do?*<br><br>So have you found the issue yet? You have trust issues.<br><br>The issue is you.<br><br>Usually, "liking a video" does not automatically equate to "I want to<br>leave you for another woman." You are being overly sensitive. You're<br>dating, you're not married. I could see him needing to be more sensitive<br>to his timeline once he's married (as that type of behavior could be<br>really disrespectful to his wife), but again, you're *dating*. He's<br>looking at TikTok, not Bumble. He's watching videos; he's likely not<br>searching for another girlfriend.<br><br>And even if he *was*, what would the appropriate response be? Would it<br>be to scan his phone for all signs of that sort of activity and to make<br>him delete the apps? That seems a bit extreme, don't you think? Perhaps<br>you should *talk* to him about what in your relationship he finds so<br>distasteful that he should be hunting for a new girlfriend. You could<br>achieve the same thing by doing it your way, but not without generating<br>even more distrust between the two of you.<br><br>Talk it out with him. Communication is one of the most important things<br>you can have in a relationship. Start building the foundation of trust<br>and mutual respect *now*.<br><br>Because doing what you are doing now only encourages distrust, which is<br>exactly what you are afraid of. *You are actually encouraging the very<br>behavior you are trying to avoid.*<br><br>Don't do that.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Today I have checked my bf\'s phone by chance and saw he liked some<br>girl\'s video on TikTok. He asked sorry many times and deleted the app,<br>he promised not to see these type of videos. But I have trust issues.<br>What should I do?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
