<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [So your thought here is that if we ban open carry, then<br>the police would have responded to a MWG call (man with a gun) and they<br>would have stopped him.\<br>\<br>I agree with you on principle. In the city, there is really no reason<br>you need to be carrying a rifle. In my humble opinion, anyone carrying a<br>rifle is fishing for attention.\<br>\<br>But what about someone safely carrying a pistol in a holster on his/her<br>belt? (Yes, in Costco, I saw a woman with a shopping cart, three kids in<br>her cart, and a pistol on her hip). Clearly, they\'re not aiming to hurt<br>anyone, they are just carrying for self-defense. Should we disarm them<br>as well? Or should we simply get rid of open carry altogether and make<br>everyone carry concealed?\<br>\<br>The issue the Colorado legislature was attacking by allowing open carry<br>is twofold.\<br>]<br><br>1.  The state is very large, and not every portion of the state is<br>    covered by a city. Cities are blotches on the state map. The rest of<br>    the area is covered by farms and ranches. Should we force ranchers<br>    and farmers to leave their rifles and pistols at home, which they<br>    rightly use for protection while out on their acerage?<br>2.  The state is a \"shall issue\" state when it comes to concealed<br>    weapons. While it may not be terribly expensive (all things<br>    considered) to get a concealed weapons permit, you do have to attend<br>    (and pay for) your own training classes, you have to pay for<br>    background checks, and you have to pay adminisrtative costs.<br>    Altogether, starting from scratch, assuming you get good training<br>    and not just \"hunter safety\" (which still qualifies in El Paso<br>    County), we\'re talking over \$300 to get your permit, which is, in<br>    many cases, more expensive than the actual gun itself. Plus, there<br>    are annual administrative fees to keep your permit. You\'ve now<br>    limited concealed carry to the \"rich.\" Whether or not you believe<br>    that people who can afford a permit are \"rich,\" you\'ve<br>    essentially ostracized an entire class of citizens: people who<br>    can\'t afford a permit. What if they received a gun as a gift? Or as<br>    a family heirloom? If they can\'t afford the training and licensing<br>    fees, they can\'t conceal a firearm.<br><br>Denver successfully fought and won the right to override the state<br>open-carry ruling; in the city of Denver, you cannot open-carry, even<br>though the state allows it. Colorado Springs could easily do the same<br>thing, if they choose. The question remains: does the Mayor and City<br>Council believe that there is enough support for such a measure? If they<br>do, perhaps they will propose it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
