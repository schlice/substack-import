<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can someone with Constitutional Law knowledge explain how the 5th<br>amendment doesn\'t apply to police officers killing unarmed suspects?**<br><br>Everyone's done a great job here explaining why the 5th Amendment<br>doesn't apply in situations of deadly force application. [[Miles<br>Eastman](https://www.quora.com/profile/Miles-Eastman-1)]{.qlink_container}'s<br>answer is particularly astute at unpacking the issue, so read through<br>that a few times.<br><br>But you also brought up another canard that I want to address: "**police<br>officers killing unarmed suspects**" as if "unarmed" equates to "not<br>dangerous."<br><br>This issue of shooting people who are "unarmed" has been literally<br>beaten to death on Quora for several years now. Check out some of the<br>answers we've already given to those questions for more background<br>information.<br><br>But in short, police officers are as free as any other citizen to<br>protect themselves against death or grave bodily harm. You probably know<br>what death is, but what's grave bodily harm? The definition varies from<br>state to state, but in most states, grave bodily injury (GBI) or grave<br>bodily harm can cause temporary or permanent disfigurement or loss of<br>one or more major bodily functions, or protracted impairment of<br>functioning of any body part or organ or limb, or any similar injury.<br>For example, if you punch someone in the head and you break the orbital<br>cavity which holds the eyeball, you can cause permanent blindness in<br>that eye. This would be an example of grave bodily injury. But in case<br>you missed the upshot of this: **you can cause grave bodily injury<br>without being armed.**<br><br>Any citizen can protect themselves with deadly force against the threat<br>of death or grave bodily injury. Police officers are included in that<br>"any citizen" mix.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
