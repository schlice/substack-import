<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Calmly. Understand that the initial approach to the<br>vehicle is the most tense for an officer. Here\'s a few good ideas for<br>you to follow:\<br>\<br>1. If it\'s not cold or raining outside, try to roll your window down.<br>If it\'s nighttime, try to turn on your interior lights.\<br>\<br>2. Put your car in park. When an automatic transmission is moved from D<br>to P, it has to go through R. This makes your reverse lights blink. This<br>is an indication to the officer that you\'ve placed your car into park.<br>Not seeing this and continually seeing brake lights usually indicates<br>that the car is still in D, and causes the officer to suspect you are<br>going to try a \"drive-off\". Don\'t do this, because it just puts the<br>officer(s) on edge.\<br>\<br>3. Be respectful. Being rude can only help to exacerbate the situation,<br>and can only make things go worse for you.\<br>\<br>4. Be honest. If you know you were speeding, say so. If you lie, or if<br>you say \"There is no way I was speeding,\" they\'ll simply give you the<br>ticket anyway because their RADAR/LIDAR unit clearly captured your<br>speed. If you fess up, some cops would be less likely to give you a<br>ticket. If you have a clean driving record, you may end up with a<br>warning.\<br>\<br>5. Try to keep your hands on your steering wheel. If the cop asks you to<br>get your registration, you should say, \"It\'s in the glove box, can I<br>get it now?\" rather than just reaching for it.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
