<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It is not illegal to transfer the title and then resell the car. Once<br>you transfer the title, you own the car and can do what you like with<br>it, including throwing it off of a cliff if you choose, although that<br>would be a terrible waste of money.<br><br>I would absolutely question the morality of such a transaction. You have<br>to consider that a \"friend\" who buys you something as expensive as a<br>car does not want to be a friend any more. He has to want something,<br>whether he is saying as much or not. It is said that there is no such<br>thing as a free lunch. It is exceedingly rare for something so<br>valuable to be given with no expectation of any sort of reciprocity.<br><br>In short, the most likely scenario is that he\'s fishing for something.<br><br>I would politely refuse the car. Tell him that 1. it\'s too much, and 2.<br>you already bought a car.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
