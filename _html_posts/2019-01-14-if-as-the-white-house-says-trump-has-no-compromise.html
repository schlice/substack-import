<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If, as the White House says, Trump has no compromised relationship<br>with Russia, why does he go out of his way to hide his interactions with<br>Putin?**<br><br>There could be several reasons for this.<br><br>First, Trump is a businessman, not a politician. As a businessman and<br>CEO, he routinely does things "on his own," without the assistance of<br>aides and assistants. This may be one of his negotiating tactics which<br>he uses to ensure that the person with whom he is negotiating feels open<br>to interaction, because only Trump is the keeper of that information.<br><br>Secondly, Trump's organization leaks like a sieve. Trump can never be<br>sure that any of his aides or assistants can keep a secret. No amount of<br>military-level classification of information will stop today's leakers<br>from leaking. So he may be holding this information close to his vest<br>specifically to keep it from leaking.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
