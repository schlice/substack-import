<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If religious people keep offering thoughts and prayers after school<br>shootings, will the continuation of school shootings eventually lead<br>them to believe there is no god?**<br><br>So it sounds to me like you're asking whether or not unanswered prayers<br>means there is no God.<br><br>When you were a kid, and you asked your parents for that one piece of<br>candy that you really really wanted, and you didn't get it, did you tell<br>yourself that there are no parents?<br><br>Or did you instead come to the realization that parents are not a<br>vending machine? You can't put in a good word and get out a piece of<br>candy. From your parents, you get what you need, when you need it, and<br>you don't get what you don't need. And they don't always tell you why.<br>Sometimes, they just give you what you need, when you need it, and don't<br>give you things you don't need, without explanation.<br><br>Do you feel like God is a vending machine? Do you pray to him, and when<br>you don't get what you want, do you feel like the vending machine is<br>broken? Or that it doesn't exist at all?<br><br>Isn't it possible that God, instead of simply "not giving you what you<br>want," has told you no?<br><br>*But why would He want school shootings to continue? That doesn't make<br>sense!*<br><br>In truth, it doesn't make sense *to us.*<br><br>> "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my<br>> ways," declares the Lord. "As the heavens are higher than the earth,<br>> so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your<br>> thoughts" (Isaiah 55:8--9).<br><br>Do you think you're smart enough to understand God's plan in all of<br>this? I know I'm certainly not, and not because I'm not a smart person,<br>but because I'm a *person*. God's thoughts are so far above mine that I<br>simply wouldn't be able to comprehend why He is doing what He is. And I<br>know that there is a plan in what he's doing. "'For I know the plans I<br>have for you,' declares the Lord, 'plans to prosper you and not to harm<br>you, plans to give you hope and a future.'" (Jeremiah 29:11).<br><br>He has a plan, even though He chooses not to tell us. Solomon wrote in<br>Proverbs 25:2, "It is the glory of God to conceal a matter..." Isaiah<br>45:15 says, "Truly, you are a God who hides himself." Ecclesiastes 11:5<br>proclaims, "As you do not know the path of the wind, or how the body is<br>formed in a mother's womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the<br>Maker of all things."<br><br>To be fair, it's not my place to understand, either. I let God handle<br>God's business, while I handle mine. I don't look at God and say, "Why<br>aren't you doing what *I* want?" How impetuous of us if we think<br>like this!<br><br>In fact, I'm certain that God is very sad when he sees a school<br>shooting. But I do know that everything He allows to happen is part of<br>His plan. And don't think for a second that He didn't allow this stuff<br>to happen. So therefore, it must be part of His plan.<br><br>Where did you get this idea that God would "skip along in front of us<br>with His great cosmic broom, sweeping aside each trial and every<br>troubling uncertainty? To the contrary, Jesus told His disciples that<br>they should anticipate suffering. He said, "I have told you these<br>things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have<br>trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world" (John 16:33)."<br>[\[1\](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6ede2d&url=https://books.google.com/books?id%3DuWqQ8myx5MoC){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Where did this idea come from that if God isn't acting the way we expect<br>Him to, that we can safely ignore Him? It's almost blasphemous to think<br>such a thing!<br><br>Dr. Dobson goes on to say, "My concern is that many believers apparently<br>feel God owes them smooth sailing or at least a full explanation (and<br>perhaps an apology) for the hardships they encounter. We must never<br>forget that He, after all, is God. He is majestic and holy and<br>sovereign. He is accountable to no one. He is not an errand boy who<br>chases the assignments we dole out. He is not a genie who pops out of<br>the bottle to satisfy our whims. He is not our servant---we are His."<br>[\[2\](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6ede2d&url=https://books.google.com/books?id%3DuWqQ8myx5MoC){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>So instead of praying for fewer trials, perhaps we should pray to be<br>stronger in the face of them, knowing that He has a plan for us, and<br>while we may not understand it, we know He keeps his promises.<br><br>> Do not pray for easy lives. Pray to be stronger men. Do not pray for<br>> tasks equal to your powers. Pray for powers equal to your tasks. Then<br>> the doing of your work shall be no miracle, but you shall be the<br>> miracle. --- Phillips Brooks<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
