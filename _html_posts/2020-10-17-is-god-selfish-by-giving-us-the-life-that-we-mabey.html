<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When do we ever ask whether or not we are going to receive a gift?<br><br>Which one of us ever asks to be born? That\'s not even a thing. Whether<br>God exists or not, we don\'t have a choice whether or not we are<br>created.<br><br>Were our parents selfish by creating us? I mean, they certainly didn\'t<br>ask us before they made us.<br><br>Yet we have the audacity to call God *selfish*?<br><br>God created you because he loves you. God created you because he wants<br>you to be in communion with him.<br><br>You\'re welcome to reject that gift. You\'re welcome to not believe that<br>God exists. You\'re welcome to not accept that Jesus is your savior.<br><br>Because one of the greatest gifts that God gave us was *free will.* You<br>get to look at the totality of the evidence, and decide for yourself<br>whether or not you want to accept Jesus\' gift.<br><br>It\'s your call. God\'s not going to stop pursuing you simply because<br>you said no.<br><br>There\'s a line in a worship song that says, "Your goodness is running<br>after me." Think about that. God\'s goodness, God\'s love, is *running<br>after you*. He wants so badly to be in relationship with you that he<br>*runs* after you. But he will never *force* you. He will always leave<br>the choice up to you.<br><br>So are you going to look askance at the gift you were given because you<br>didn\'t have a choice in its original giving, or are you going to use<br>the gift that you were given to do something good in this world?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
