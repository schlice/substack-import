There is usually a<br>medical team which has all of its required lifesaving equipment<br>stationed within the sterile area (the "sterile area" is the area inside<br>of security). They have ambulances on the "pad" (the level of ground<br>where the airplanes are, called the "restricted area") and can drive on<br>the ramps and pads to reach any of the terminals or concourses within<br>minutes. They can enter and exit, with card access, through the secure<br>doors which lead directly from the sterile area out to the restricted<br>area and the pad.<br><br>In the event of a medical emergency within the sterile area, the medical<br>team would respond, stabilize the patient, and transport either to a<br>waiting team outside the sterile area, or directly to a local medical<br>facility.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
