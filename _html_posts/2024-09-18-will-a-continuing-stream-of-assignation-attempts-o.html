<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Unquestionably, this hurts the anti-Trump agenda. To see this lopsided<br>stream of assassination attempts (your guys' spell checkers are failing,<br>you btw) while both sides are engaged in inflammatory rhetoric is<br>indicative.<br><br>But Democrats don't seem to care, *because deep down, they truly believe<br>that Trump is an existential threat to democracy.*<br><br>*So deep down, they truly believe that assassination is a valid<br>response.*<br><br>You see it from the few who say the quiet things out loud, like [[Jack<br>Black's partner in "Tenacious D", Kyle<br>Gass](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2f13fe&url=https://fox4kc.com/news/entertainment/jack-black-taking-break-from-tenacious-d-after-bandmates-trump-shooting-remark-i-was-blindsided/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="fox4kc.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>Remember this: if democracy is *truly* **on the line, then<br>assassination is *truly* a valid option.**<br><br>So if you're going to come out and say that you truly believe that Trump<br>is an existential threat to democracy, you cannot separate yourself from<br>the opinion that you are in favor of his assassination.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
