<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Unlike my other answering colleagues, in the United States, PA is<br>*usually* at fault. This is because PA has a responsibility to<br>exercise care when driving. When PA is *tailgating*, this generally<br>alleviates PB of any negligence claims.<br><br>There are some scenarios in which PB would share some of the<br>responsibility for the accident:<br><br>- "Brake checks," which are scenarios where PB's car stops suddenly for<br>  no apparent reason<br>- Stopping to make a turn but then failing to make the turn<br>- Non-functioning warning lights (i.e. brake lights, tail lights) in<br>  PB's vehicle<br><br>If both PA and PB are found to share negligence, then the concept of<br>contributory negligence versus comparative negligence comes into<br>play. From<br>[nolo.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6d4040&url=http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/is-fault-automatic-rear-end-car-accident-case.html%23){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nolo.com"}]{.qlink_container}:<br><br>> Contributory Negligence. Only a handful of states still subscribe<br>> to this system. Essentially, under the law of contributory negligence,<br>> if Driver A can show that Driver B\'s negligence contributed to the<br>> accident *to any degree*, Driver B is barred from recovering anything<br>> at all in a lawsuit against Driver A.<br>><br>> Comparative Negligence. Comparative negligence allocates fault<br>> between drivers. A driver's liability may be reduced, but not<br>> necessarily eliminated, if the other driver is partly at fault for the<br>> accident. There are two variations of the comparative negligence<br>> system:<br>><br>> - Pure comparative negligence: Liability is split according to the<br>>   percentage of each driver\'s fault. So, if Driver A is 30% to blame<br>>   for a car accident, and she has \$10,000 in damages, she can only<br>>   collect \$7,000 from Driver B (who was 70% to blame for the<br>>   accident.)<br>> - Modified comparative negligence: Liability is split according to<br>>   the percentage of fault \-- to a certain level. Once a plaintiff<br>>   meets, or exceeds that level, the plaintiff is barred from recovery.<br>>   That limit is typically 50%. In other words, if a plaintiff is more<br>>   than 50% at fault for the accident, the plaintiff is barred from<br>>   recovering anything at all from other at-fault drivers.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
