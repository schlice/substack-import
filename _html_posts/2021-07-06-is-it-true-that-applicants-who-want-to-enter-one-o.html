<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes.<br><br>In addition to being accepted by the academy's Admissions Board, each<br>candidate must be *nominated*. Nominations come from members of<br>Congress, and the Vice President. This is done to give candidates from<br>around the country a fair shot, and to ensure that there is not one area<br>of the country which provides all the candidates.<br><br>Each member of Congress, and the VP, can have up to five active<br>cadets in each of the service academies, with the exception of the VP,<br>who cannot nominate for the Merchant Marine Academy. Nominating<br>authorities usually nominate more than one candidate for each available<br>academy slot they have, and then the academy determines which candidate<br>will be accepted. I have seen Congressional representatives nominate up<br>to ten candidates per slot.<br><br>To get a nomination, you talk to the Congressperson's office and apply<br>directly to them. They will have a window of time that they accept<br>applications, and they will usually convene a selection panel to present<br>the nominees to the Congressperson.<br><br>*(NOTE: This does not apply to the US Coast Guard Academy, which does<br>not require nominations)*<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it true that applicants who want to enter one of the United States<br>military academies need to have the support of a congressman? Can<br>someone explain to me how that works?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
