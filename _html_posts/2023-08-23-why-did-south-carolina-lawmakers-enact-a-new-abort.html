<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Interesting, sounds like a law school question, but whatever, I'll bite.<br><br>Basically, SC took the objections to the first law raised by Justice Few<br>the first time around and wrote them into the new law.<br><br>**Essentially, this all is occurring because South Carolina has a right<br>to privacy in its state constitution.** However, that right can have<br>reasonable restrictions placed on it if the state can show that the<br>compelling state interest being advocated for outweighs the state<br>constitution's right to privacy and right to bodily autonomy.<br><br>So when the updated law was passed a second time, the Legislature openly<br>acknowledged that restricting abortion infringes on South Carolina's<br>constitutional right to privacy and bodily autonomy, but they reasonably<br>determined this time around that those interests don\'t outweigh "the<br>interest of the unborn child to live."<br><br>As expected, Planned Parenthood South Atlantic (among other abortion<br>providers) sued again.<br><br>This time, however, the SC Supreme Court said that the Legislature's<br>determination that the right of the child to live overrode the woman's<br>right to privacy and the woman's right to bodily autonomy was<br>reasonable. Therefore, they allowed the new law to stand. Writing for<br>the new majority, Justice John Kittredge wrote, "As a Court, unless we<br>can say that the balance struck by the legislature was unreasonable as a<br>matter of law, we must uphold the Act."<br><br>The fact that the SC Supreme Court is the only all-male Supreme Court in<br>the nation is a red herring. The previous ruling was objected to by more<br>than the lone woman (who reached mandatory retirement age in SC),<br>including the aforementioned Justice John Few.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
