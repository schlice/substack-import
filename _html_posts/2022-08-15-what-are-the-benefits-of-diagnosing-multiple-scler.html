<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>My neurologist used to tell me that the most "conservative" approach to<br>treating MS is to "conserve" as much brain tissue as possible.<br>Therefore, starting one of the approved MS therapy drugs as soon as<br>possible will help to slow down the disease progression and delay the<br>onset of the more serious effects of the disease.<br><br>It is also true in the MS world that *the longer you go between<br>relapses, the longer you will go until your next relapse.* In other<br>words, current disease activity is the best predictor of future disease<br>activity.<br><br>When I was initially in treatment, it was still a debated topic whether<br>or not early intervention could stave off more serious disability more<br>effectively than waiting for a second symptom disseminated by space and<br>time. But my neurologist was ahead of his time, and he advised me to<br>start treatment as soon as possible, even with only one visible symptom.<br>And I'm glad he did.<br><br>Nowadays, it's a given that the sooner you start MS treatment once<br>you're diagnosed, the more likely you will be to stave off the worst<br>effects of the disease for longer, and the better chance you'll have for<br>a long life without the worst effects of the disease.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What are the benefits of diagnosing multiple sclerosis early?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
