Ideally, this<br>is the safest thing to do for an infant. If your child is over 22<br>pounds, they should be traveling in their own seat. Car seats will work,<br>or you can purchase a [[CARES<br>harness](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=25a66d&url=http://kidsflysafe.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="kidsflysafe.com"}]{.qlink_container}. Be aware that not all<br>airlines allow you to use child restraints or car seats in their cabins;<br>you will need to check with your carrier before you buy that extra seat.<br><br>I will assume instead that you are discussing a lap-held infant. This is<br>the way infants travel most of the time.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-0e716b648193b1ba228505a66211ccfd){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-0e716b648193b1ba228505a66211ccfd" master_w="400"<br>master_h="237"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>This is a supplemental loop belt. It can be used as a belt extender for<br>plus-sized passengers, or it can be looped in with the passenger belt to<br>form a supplemental belt for a lap-held infant. Infants should wear one<br>of these during takeoff and landing. In the US and Canada, there is no<br>mandate for the airline to provide a loop belt for lap-held children. If<br>the aircraft has one on board, you can always ask for<br>one.\[1\](#PzmGx){#cite-PzmGx .citation_link}<br><br>The safest way to hold your infant in a brace position is this:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-b08f2a2d2be905e90ef867c82cbb65d4){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-b08f2a2d2be905e90ef867c82cbb65d4" master_w="330"<br>master_h="390"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>When you get on board, check the safety information card in the seat<br>back pocket in front of you.
