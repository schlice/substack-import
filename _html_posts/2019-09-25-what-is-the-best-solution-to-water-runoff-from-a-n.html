In Texas, is it allowed for me to put a barrier<br>on my side in my property to stop the water runoff?**<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends." And in this<br>case, what it depends on is where the water is supposed to go between<br>the two lots.<br><br>Now clearly, there is some water that will naturally end up on your<br>property depending on the *over-land grading* that was done when the<br>development was put in. So you'll have to investigate this by pulling<br>the grading specs for your neighborhood, showing the water flow as it<br>was designed, and as the lots were graded.<br><br>Once the construction grading is done, however, *finish grading* then<br>takes place, which includes what happens when landscapers come in and<br>plant trees and grass, and add other features like retaining walls. The<br>grading *changes* when this happens, even though it is supposed to<br>follow the same grading pattern as the over-land grading originally laid<br>out. This is where that homeowner runs into trouble: if they changed the<br>grading so significantly that water runoff now comes into your yard<br>where it was supposed to go somewhere else, then you have a case.<br><br>If the homeowner is intentionally directing runoff into your yard where<br>it was never supposed to be, you also have a case.<br><br>I put all of that in here before answering your question, because it<br>impacts what you can legally do about it.<br><br>You cannot put a barrier to stop water flow if the original overland<br>grading plan shows water coming from his lot and draining into yours. In<br>other words, if it was originally designed to flow into your yard, you<br>cannot block that water. What you *can* do instead, in that case, is<br>*re-direct* the water once it enters your yard. For example, you can<br>install french drains at your property line to catch all of that water<br>and redirect it somewhere else. Once it comes on to your property in<br>accordance with the overland grading plan, you can then move it<br>somewhere else if you choose. You can do whatever you want with it at<br>that point, but you have to allow it to come into your yard.<br><br>Now, if the water *was never intended to flow into your yard in the<br>first place*, not only do you have a case for tort trespass, you can<br>then install water mitigation systems along your property line (i.e.<br>barriers) and include that cost in your lawsuit.<br><br>Additionally, if there are ordinances in your city describing what must<br>be done with pool waste water and he is violating that, you can also<br>go the Code Enforcement route with your local police department.<br><br>\<br><br>Hi readers!
