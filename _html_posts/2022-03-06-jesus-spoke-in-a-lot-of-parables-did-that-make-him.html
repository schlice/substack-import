<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Jesus was a teacher. Trying to teach difficult concepts, or concepts<br>which went against the accepted cultural norms, would have been<br>difficult if he had just spoken the concepts. It was much easier to<br>explain difficult concepts using parables. But they weren't just<br>parables. They were stories about situations that would have been<br>*deeply personal* to the people to whom he was speaking, which drove the<br>message home even more.<br><br>For example, look at the story of the Good Samaritan. Samaritans, to the<br>Jews he was addressing, were veritable *pariahs*. The Jews hated the<br>Samaritans, so much so that the Jews destroyed the Samaritans\' temple<br>on [[Mount<br>Gerizim](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=823ae0&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Gerizim){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. The Samaritans<br>reciprocally hated the Jews as well. When he told the story of the<br>person who was mugged, beaten, and left by the side of the road to die,<br>a Jewish priest and a Levite both walked past the man. But the Samaritan<br>was the only one to show kindness.<br><br>Jesus specifically picking a Samaritan man was intentional, based on his<br>target audience. The point Jesus was trying to get across was that an<br>individual of a social group his listeners disapprove of can exhibit<br>moral behavior that is superior to individuals of the groups they<br>approve. There really isn't a better example of ignoring prejudice as<br>when you challenge a listener's own belief system.<br><br>Another example would be the parable of the Prodigal Son. We all know<br>the story: the prodigal son wastes his inheritance and then comes<br>crawling home and the father throws a banquet for him, because the son<br>was lost, but now he's found. However, the simple fact that the children<br>asked the father for their inheritance *before he died* would have been<br>highly insulting and an incredible affront during that time. The idea<br>that these children would even be welcome *at all* would have been seen<br>as highly offensive. In the culture of the time, no one would ever think<br>to ask for their inheritance before the father died. So not only did the<br>father act mercifully, he did so *when he was so totally insulted by the<br>children in the first place*. The story takes on a whole new meaning<br>when you understand that their initial act was so culturally unheard of<br>in the first place.<br><br>You can see that the parable is an excellent vehicle to tell a story<br>about a complex topic, and it really hit home with the people Jesus was<br>teaching.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Jesus spoke in a lot of parables. Did that make him seem like a<br>sarcastic jerk/smart-ass, or was he actually trying to help a person to<br>think deeper (looking at different perspectives)?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
