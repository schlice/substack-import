<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the United States, the "American Rule" says that each side pays their<br>own attorney's fees.<br><br>As always, there may be exceptions to that rule. These exceptions may<br>include:<br><br>- where state law requires that the losing side pay the attorney's fees<br>- where a contract specified that the losing side pay the attorney's<br>  fees.<br><br>Judges can also award "equitable remedies" which would require the<br>losing side to pay attorney's fees if they determine that it would be<br>unfair to not do so. For example, if the claimant brought a frivolous or<br>bad faith lawsuit, or if the claimant brought the lawsuit to be<br>oppressive against the respondent, and the respondent won. In the past,<br>judges have awarded equitable remedies when attorneys have exercised<br>extreme misconduct, to send a message to that attorney.<br><br>So check your state law and check your Declaration of Covenants. They<br>may require that the losing side pay attorney's fees.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
