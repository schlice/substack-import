<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The mark of the beast will be very clear, whatever the mark actually is.<br>It hasn't been offered yet.<br><br>We know that the mark of the beast hasn't been offered yet because the<br>events recorded in Revelation have not taken place yet. Revelation<br>discusses how this will all happen in detail:<br><br>There will literally be 3.5 years of famine, world wars, earthquakes,<br>plagues, and false Christs. Then, the Antichrist will be enthroned over<br>the whole earth. He will demand fealty, and you will pledge your fealty<br>through the mark of the beast, either on the head or the hand. This<br>begins the period of time known as the Great Tribulation, where<br>Christians who refuse the mark of the beast are rounded up, tortured and<br>killed. Sometime during this second 3.5 year period, Christ will return<br>and the rapture will take place. This will signify the beginning of the<br>time period known as the Day of the Lord. Once the rapture is complete<br>and the elect are raised and ascend into heaven, God's wrath will be<br>unleashed onto the rest of the world. He will send Satan and his demons<br>to hell, once and for all.<br><br>In short, when the mark of the beast is presented to you to take, you'll<br>know it. You'll be ordered to take it or suffer the consequences.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
