<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Interestingly, there was another article which denoted the defense<br>attorney's claim that Mandalay Bay's injunctive lawsuit in Federal court<br>was "outrageous:"<br><br>[[Bill Stein\'s answer to Is it outrageous that MGM Resorts<br>International has filed federal lawsuits against more than 1,000 victims<br>of last October's mass shooting in Las Vegas in an apparent attempt to<br>avoid<br>liability?](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-outrageous-that-MGM-Resorts-International-has-filed-federal-lawsuits-against-more-than-1-000-victims-of-last-October-s-mass-shooting-in-Las-Vegas-in-an-apparent-attempt-to-avoid-liability/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Why not sue Mandalay Bay? If I was there, and they were responsible for<br>providing for my safety, and they didn't, so they're the ones I'm suing,<br>right? More often, a lawyer will name several defendants in his lawsuit,<br>Mandalay Bay and its parent company MGM as one of them.<br><br>However, there is a Federal statute called the [[SAFETY<br>Act](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ead50f&url=https://www.safetyact.gov/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="safetyact.gov"}]{.qlink_container} which limits liability of<br>an organization when it uses security services which have been approved<br>by the government and a mass casualty event happens.<br><br>Therefore, the plaintiffs who sued Mandalay Bay and its parent company<br>MGM simply don't have standing, since the SAFETY Act says that you<br>cannot sue the venue, only the provider of the approved security.<br><br>With so many lawsuits being filed by so many victims (and so many other<br>lawsuits announced and not yet filed), rather than sink all the money<br>into getting standing rulings on all of them, and in an effort to<br>streamline the relief process for the victims, MGM preemptively filed a<br>lawsuit against all of them in Federal court (since the SAFETY Act also<br>says that original jurisdiction is Federal) and seeks injunctive relief<br>to dismiss those suits under the same act.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
