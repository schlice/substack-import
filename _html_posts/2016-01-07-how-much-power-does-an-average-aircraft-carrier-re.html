<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>An aircraft carrier requires very large amounts of power. Specifically,<br>they require enough power to drive the steam catapults to launch the<br>aircraft, drive the steam turbines which drive the propellers, and to<br>drive the steam-powered generators to produce all of the electricity for<br>the entire vessel. Since the US Navy has the lion\'s share of the<br>world\'s aircraft carriers, we\'ll use US aircraft carriers as the<br>example.<br><br>All currently-operating US aircraft carriers have PWR (pressurized water<br>reactor) nuclear power plants as the source of all of their power. In<br>the larger submarines and surface ships, the reactors produce in excess<br>of 500 MWt (thermal megawatts), and most US surface ships are powered by<br>two or more of these reactors. US submarines are usually powered by one.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
