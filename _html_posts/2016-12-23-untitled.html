<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Reading intent into the 240 year old words of slaveowners concerning<br>equality and applying your interpretation of them to governing today is<br>I don't know, a touch presumptuous?*<br><br>Interesting, because this is exactly what the Supreme Court does every<br>single day: reading intent into the Constitution. That's why we have<br>them: interpreting the Constitution and applying it to today's laws.<br><br>Also interesting is your attempt to defame the character of the framers<br>by referring to them by the politically-abhorrent moniker of<br>"slaveowners." Yes, they all owned slaves. Our first President owned<br>slaves, and few question his virtues or his leadership capabilities. It<br>was only in later times that owning slaves fell out of fashion, so<br>during the founding, slave ownership was not as politically incorrect<br>(or illegal) as it is today. It's interesting because it sets the tone<br>for your answer. Some of us see it for what it is.<br><br>Finally, how do you ensure equality of opportunity? You ensure that<br>everyone has the same access to educational and vocational opportunities<br>through as many methods as you possibly can: government grants, industry<br>partnering, education system improvements, family unit strengthening,<br>etc. The Declaration of Independence says that people have the right to<br>*pursue* happiness, which implies that there is no guarantee, from the<br>government or otherwise. Writings from the founders (and writings they<br>drew upon to write the Declaration) also display this thought about the<br>pursuit of happiness.<br><br>So how does the Supreme Court do it? Thankfully, we don't have to<br>presume any of the framers' intentions, because we have a wealth of<br>volumes of their writings to draw from to understand exactly what they<br>meant by liberty, and that it actually meant freedom of opportunity, not<br>equality of outcome. There are far too many of their writings to add<br>here, so I will leave it to you and your fantastic Google skills to find<br>them. The Supreme Court does it every day. You can do some, too.<br><br>You don't need evidence that people believe all outcomes should be<br>equal. You can see it in the functioning of the last eight years of<br>progressive government. Candidate Obama said as much to Joe the Plumber<br>before he was elected in 2008. He said, not implied, said, we need to<br>redistribute wealth. That means that people who make too much money need<br>to give it to others who don't make as much. This implies a fundamental<br>philosophy of "equality of outcome" which characterizes Progressive<br>character and thought on governance.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Was-the-American-Constitution-more-about-liberty-or-equality-as-originally-framed/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
