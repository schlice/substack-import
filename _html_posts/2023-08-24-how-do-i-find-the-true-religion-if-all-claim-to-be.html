<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>An excellent question!<br><br>So first of all, with the sheer number of different religions and sects<br>around the world, it makes it very difficult to know which one is right.<br><br>It's just so strange that so many people say, "All religions are right,<br>they're just different ways of looking at the same thing." At this<br>point, these relativists often pull out the example of the elephant and<br>the six blind men. They say that if you point the blind men at an<br>elephant and you ask them to identify what they "see" (feel), you'll get<br>six different answers. One man feeling the leg will identify that it is<br>a tree, another feeling the body would say it's a wall, the one holding<br>the tail would say it's a rope, while the one feeling the trunk would<br>say it's a snake. The man feeling the ear might say it's a fan, and the<br>one feeling the tusk would say it is a spear. The relativist will then<br>explain that the elephant is like God and the blind men are like world<br>religions: they are all experiencing God differently, but they come to<br>different conclusions about what they experience. Religious truth, we<br>are told, is relative to the individual. It's subjective, not objective.<br><br>At first, the fact that there are so many contradictory religions in the<br>world might reinforce the elephant parable, and lead to the notion that<br>truth in religion can't be known.<br><br>But this is far from accurate.<br><br>The rebuttal to the elephant parable is this: *what is the perspective<br>of the one telling the story: the narrator?* That person has an<br>*objective* view of the scene and can tell that the blind men are all<br>wrong. The narrator would not know that the blind men were wrong unless<br>he had an objective perspective of what is right.<br><br>So if the person telling the story can see that it's an elephant, can't<br>the blind men see it too? Of course! If they suddenly could see, they<br>would realize that they too were wrong, and it's actually an elephant in<br>front of them, and not a rope, a snake, or a spear.<br><br>So that leads us to a number of questions:<br><br>- Is there absolute truth?<br>- Can truth be known?<br>- Is it true that God exists? Can the truth about God be known?<br><br>We know that absolute truth exists. And we can prove that it does.<br>The relativist says, "All truth is relative," but isn't that an absolute<br>statement? If the relativist declares that all truth is relative, he's<br>making an absolute statement, is he not? Therefore, his very belief is<br>self-defeating. The postmodernist says that there is no truth at all,<br>but he actually holds that one truth exists: postmodernism is correct.<br>Therefore, postmodernism too is self-defeating by its own nature. The<br>skeptic says, "We can't know what the truth is." But *are you sure* that<br>you can't know? And the more certain you become that you can't know, you<br>actually defeat your own position, because you become more absolute<br>instead of more skeptical. Therefore, skepticism is also self-defeating.<br><br>So if absolute truth exists, we know right off the bat that agnosticism,<br>postmodernism, relativism, and skepticism are all false positions.<br><br>Next, the Law of Noncontradiction says that a thing can not be "X" and<br>"not-X" at the same time. So while Islam and Judaism teach that Jesus is<br>not God, Christianity teaches that He is. One of these has to be right,<br>and the other has to be wrong. So there is truth, and it can be known.<br>This means that pluralists are clearly not right when they say that all<br>religions are true, or they say "I'm speaking my truth" as if it is<br>"true for me but not for you." Contrary *beliefs* may exists, but<br>contrary *truths* do not.<br><br>Finally, can we know that God exists, and can the truth about God be<br>known?<br><br>The answer is yes, we can, and we can use logic to do it. In order to<br>answer the question, you have to ask the correct question first. And<br>that question is: *why am I here?* *Why is there something, rather than<br>nothing at all?* The search for the truth about why something exists<br>rather than nothing at all leads us to understand the truth about God.<br>The argument for God can be expressed very simply:<br><br>1.  Something exists<br>2.  You don't get something from nothing<br>3.  Therefore, something necessary and eternal exists<br><br>Even atheists do not deny this logic. They simply claim that the<br>universe is that eternal entity. However, to date, all scientific and<br>philosophical inquiry has proven and re-proven that the universe had a<br>beginning, and the body of evidence proving this fact is continually<br>growing. If something had a beginning, it is not eternal. Therefore,<br>being that the only two sources of eternality are an eternal universe or<br>an eternal Creator, and we have proven that the universe is not eternal,<br>an eternal Creator must exist.<br><br>To extend the logic from above, we can say:<br><br>1.  We know the universe exists.<br>    1.  The universe is not an illusion.<br>    2.  The universe was not self-created.<br>2.  The only two options for eternality, therefore, are an eternal<br>    universe, or an eternal creator who created the universe.<br>3.  To date, all scientific and philosophical investigation have shown<br>    that the universe is not eternal.<br>4.  Therefore, an eternal creator exists.<br><br>*Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that a creator God exists.*<br><br>Now, this conclusion says nothing about what kind of God exists, but it<br>does rule out all pantheistic religions. All pantheistic worldviews say<br>that the universe is God and is eternal. And this assertion is false.<br>So, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and all other pantheistic religions are<br>ruled out as valid belief systems.<br><br>\<br><br>So in just a few paragraphs, we have discovered that atheism,<br>agnosticism, postmodernism, relativism, pluralism and skepticism are all<br>false. We have also discovered that all pantheistic religions such as<br>Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, etc, which believe that the universe is God<br>and is eternal, are also false.<br><br>So we're left with just monotheistic religions. But can we tell which<br>one of the monotheistic religions is right?<br><br>Well, we can use another scientific principle: the Law of Causality.<br>This law says, in part, that *an effect must resemble its cause*.<br>Therefore, can we use forensic analysis to work backwards from the<br>effect (us) and learn anything about the cause (God)? The answer,<br>unsurprisingly, is yes. From creation, we can tell the following about<br>God. He is:<br><br>- Supernatural in nature (as He exists outside of His creation)<br>- Incredibly powerful (to have created all that is known)<br>- Eternal (self-existent, as He exists outside of time and space)<br>- Omnipresent (He created space and is not limited by it)<br>- Timeless and changeless (He created time)<br>- Immaterial (because He transcends space)<br>- Personal (the impersonal can't create personality)<br>- Necessary (as everything else depends on Him)<br>- Infinite and singular (as you cannot have two infinites)<br>- Diverse yet has unity (as all multiplicity implies a prior<br>  singularity)<br>- Intelligent (supremely, to create everything)<br>- Purposeful (as He deliberately created everything)<br>- Moral (no moral law can exist without a lawgiver)<br>- Caring (or no moral laws would have been given)<br><br>Now that we have determined the characteristics of the God who created<br>the universe and everything in it, *is there any remaining monotheistic<br>world religion which describes this God?*<br><br>In fact there is: Christianity describes this God perfectly.<br>Christianity says that God is:<br><br>- supernatural (Genesis 1:1),<br>- powerful (Jeremiah 32:17),<br>- eternal (Psalm 90:2),<br>- necessary (Exodus 3:14, Colossians 1:17)<br>- omnipresent (Psalm 139:7),<br>- timeless/changeless (Malachi 3:6),<br>- immaterial (John 5:24),<br>- personal (Genesis 3:9),<br>- infinite/singular (Jeremiah 23:24, Deuteronomy 6:4),<br>- diverse yet with unity (Matthew 28:19),<br>- intelligent (Psalm 147:4-5),<br>- purposeful (Jeremiah 29:11, Psalm 19:1-4),<br>- moral (Daniel 9:14),<br>- caring (1 Peter 5:6-7).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
