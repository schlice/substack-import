<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Whether or not a consumer actually read the TOS before<br>checking the box \"I have read the TOS\" is irrelevant. If you check the<br>box but you actually didn\'t read the TOS, it doesn\'t make the TOS any<br>less enforceable. You positively affirmed that you read it, and by<br>continuing to use the service/website/app, you agree to be bound by the<br>terms in the TOS. So legally speaking, whether or not you actually read<br>it is entirely irrelevant.\<br>\<br>This is why the creators of Snapchat carefully crafted their TOS to<br>allow them to use each and every picture you send through the service<br>and sell them, if they so choose. While their marketing collateral says<br>the pictures are deleted, they actually are just renamed with an unused<br>file extension, plus the TOS also says that they can reuse the data and<br>sell it. Tell that to the girl whose photo is widely being used as<br>advertisement for porn sites, which she sent over<br>Snapchat.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
