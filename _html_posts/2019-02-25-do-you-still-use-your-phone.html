<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you still use your phone\'s mobile data even when you are in a<br>public place with Wi-Fi and you have an unlimited data plan?**<br><br>Yes. Absolutely. 100%.<br><br>Why, you ask?<br><br>Wi-Fi, unless you're using a VPN along with it, is too insecure.<br><br>If you have no idea what I just said, then you should not be using a<br>public Wi-Fi hotspot.<br><br>To translate my bolded sentence: if you want to use public Wi-Fi<br>hotspots, please, please, invest in VPN software. If you trust CNET for<br>your technology news (they're relatively fair), then please check out<br>this article:<br><br>[[Best mobile VPN services for<br>2019](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4f5a24&url=https://www.cnet.com/news/best-mobile-vpn-services/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cnet.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>I actually endorse NordVPN myself (and coincidentally, it's number one<br>on the list). A YouTuber I watch, Company Man, has a 75% off of a 3 year<br>subscription if you use his affiliate link. If you're interested: [[Grab<br>The Exclusive NordVPN 3-Year Deal! (75%<br>Discount)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3d8416&url=https://nordvpn.com/youtube/?coupon%3Dcompanyman%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_term%26utm_content%26utm_campaign%3Doff292%26utm_source%3Daff8358){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nordvpn.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>It's actually very cheap, there are discount codes all over the Internet<br>(YouTubers advertise discount codes all the time, and you'll get several<br>years' worth of service at a substantial discount), and it will<br>literally save you from becoming the next victim.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
