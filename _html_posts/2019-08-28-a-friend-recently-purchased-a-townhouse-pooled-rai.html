<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**A friend recently purchased a townhouse. Pooled rainwater in the<br>common walkway has caused a crack in the foundation. The estimate is<br>\$800 to fix the crack, another \$1,200 for the landscaping that caused<br>it. Under an HOA, who is responsible for what?**<br><br>In most townhome communities, the owner owns both the interior and the<br>exterior of the building, including driveways, roofs, and lawns. They do<br>not own common areas.<br><br>If this is the same as the townhome in question, the owner (or more<br>likely, the owner's homeowner's insurance company) is responsible for<br>fixing the damage, and then they will sue the Association because the<br>damage was caused by their negligence in ensuring proper drainage.<br><br>This may not be the case in this particular townhome. Most townhomes are<br>set up in this way, but not all. You will have to check the Association<br>documents to find out who owns what.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
