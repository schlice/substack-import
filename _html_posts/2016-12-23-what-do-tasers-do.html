<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A Taser is a "conducted energy weapon" (CEW), the most common version in<br>law enforcement and civilian use manufactured by TASER International.<br>Taser began its development in 1969 by Jack Cover, a NASA engineer. It<br>is named after Jack's favorite childhood hero, Tom Swift. The TASER is<br>an acronym which stands for "Thomas A. Swift's Electronic Rifle." The<br>original Taser (called the Taser Public Defender), released in 1974,<br>used gunpowder as its propellant, leading the BATF to classify it as a<br>firearm. In 1993, Rick and Thomas Smith began working with Cover to<br>create a non-firearm conducted energy weapon, the first non-firearm<br>Taser being released in 1994.<br><br>The Taser works by delivering electrical current across conductors to<br>induce "involuntary neuromuscular incapacitation." The result of this is<br>loss of muscle control, involuntary muscle movement (twitching), and<br>pain. The sensory and motor nerves quickly get overloaded by the<br>electricity.<br><br>The Taser can operate in one of two modes: normal barb discharge mode,<br>and "Drive Stun" mode. In normal mode, the unit deploys two darts<br>propelled using compressed nitrogen and connected back to the unit using<br>electrical filament wire. The upper dart deploys straight out from the<br>unit, while the lower dart is slightly canted downward, to achieve a<br>degree of spread between the darts. The darts and nitrogen charge are<br>contained in a replaceable cartridge. The standard Taser unit in use<br>today, the X26, loads a single cartridge at a time. Also deployed from<br>the Taser cartridge are an "anti-felon identification" (AFID) system,<br>many small confetti-sized paper circles with the serial number of the<br>cartridge printed on them.<br><br>The second mode of operation on law enforcement units is a "Drive Stun"<br>mode. This mode operates much in the same way as a traditional "stun<br>gun". Drive stun mode works with no cartridge installed, or with a<br>deployed cartridge in place. It produces pain only, none of the<br>neuromuscular effects. After being found to be largely ineffective, most<br>departments no longer use Tasers in drive stun mode.<br><br>Taser has developed an X3 model, which uses much thinner cartridges and<br>holds three of them, allowing three shots before needing to be reloaded.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
