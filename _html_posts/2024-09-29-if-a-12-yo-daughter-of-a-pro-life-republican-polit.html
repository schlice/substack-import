<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You tried to malign too many groups all at once. You're bashing on<br>Republicans, pro-lifers, and whites (with your "brown baby" comment).<br>Honestly, if you wanted to craft a question hating on one group or the<br>other, you should have picked one.<br><br>For now, I'm going to ignore the "brown baby" comment and stick with<br>Republicans and pro-life people. These two groups are not the same. One<br>position is political, and the other is philosophical. Most Republicans<br>believe that abortion should be permitted up until about 15 to 20 weeks,<br>which would actually permit more than 90% of all abortions. Pro-life<br>people value all human life equally, and that value doesn't change based<br>on the circumstances of that child's conception.<br><br>So for Republican pro-life politicians, the view they hold should mirror<br>the majority of people in the district they represent. So if the<br>majority say that sensible limits on abortion (i.e. the aforementioned<br>15--20 weeks) are acceptable, then that's what they should support<br>legislatively.<br><br>But what they do *in their own homes*, with their own family, may be<br>different. And that's by design. Legislatively, they should support<br>whatever their constituents support; they may legislate in opposition to<br>their values because they are *representatives*. As such, they<br>*represent* the people who elected them. Good legislators set aside<br>their personal feelings and beliefs, and write laws that their people<br>want.<br><br>So a Republican who is also pro-life will probably live his pro-life<br>values in his *personal* life, not so much in his *legislative* life.<br>What that means is that he will ensure that his 12-year-old daughter<br>gets the best medical care available, and when the baby is born, he will<br>likely help her put it up for adoption.<br><br>You then asked another question:<br><br>> What kind of a parent would let her die in childbirth?<br><br>None. No parent would let their child die in childbirth. Neither will<br>any hospital in the United States. Every state in the United States<br>permits doctors to save the lives of mothers, regardless of any abortion<br>laws. The cases you hear in the news are actually examples of **medical<br>malpractice**. They are unrelated to abortion laws. No doctor would ever<br>fail to save the life of a mother because he can't perform an abortion.<br>Such a doctor would be sued for malpractice and would likely lose their<br>license.<br><br>You think that because the girl is 12 that childbirth will kill her?<br>Hardly. What kills pregnant women is a lack of competent prenatal care,<br>not the fact that she is pregnant. If her body allows her to carry a<br>child, her body will allow her to birth that child as well. So long as<br>she has good medical care (which a Congresscritter can likely afford),<br>she should be just fine.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
