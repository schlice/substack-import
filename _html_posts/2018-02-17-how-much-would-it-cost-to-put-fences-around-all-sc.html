<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How much would it cost to put fences around all schools in America? We<br>have this here in Israel, and there are virtually no school shootings<br>here even though terrorism is a major problem.**<br><br>Apples and oranges. Cultures are different in Israel, and clearly<br>terrorists do not consider schools to be high-value targets. Schools are<br>a big deal in America because of the nature of the shooter, not<br>because of the softness of the target.<br><br>In schools which have implemented security plans, you can only access<br>the school through one access-controlled choke point, and there is<br>security at that choke point. All other entrances to the school are<br>locked down. A fence just moves the perimeter further away from the<br>building.<br><br>Clearly though, some schools have yet to meet that standard. Only 30% of<br>schools in America have some form of armed security at the school, up<br>from 10% just a few years ago (but even then, as was the case in<br>Florida, the lone security guard never encountered the shooter).<br><br>Why don't 100% of schools in America have armed security guards? Why<br>aren't proper security measures being taken at schools? Does every<br>school district have a Chief Security Officer? Why not? Because clearly,<br>nearly three quarters of American schools are not taking security<br>seriously, even after Columbine, and even after Sandy Hook.<br><br>When, as parents, do we start demanding that our schools increase<br>security? Start getting yourselves onto School Boards, and start<br>becoming active in your school community, and start demanding your<br>schools implement some common-sense security.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
