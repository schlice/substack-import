<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What do you do? Nothing.<br><br>When you need to do something is when you get a real violation letter<br>from the real HOA, who you can actually contact and actually talk to<br>about whatever rule they are accusing you of violating.<br><br>Which, by the way, is how you determine whether or not a letter from the<br>HOA is real. Contact them. If they sent it, they'll have record of it,<br>and they will be able to discuss it with you.<br><br>Remember, HOAs aren't about punishing past deeds. They're simply about<br>*compliance*. So if you come into compliance, you're good. So if it's a<br>real letter, find out what behavior is violative, and stop it. If it's<br>vague accusations about some nuisance behavior, ignore it. They would<br>never be so bold as to try to fine you for behavior that they did not<br>have photographic evidence of you committing, because it would be too<br>easy for you to defend against in court, and they don't want to spend<br>any money on their lawyers.<br><br>And just as a piece of general life advice, if your roommates have<br>stooped to creating fake HOA letters about you, maybe it's time to find<br>better roommates.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
