<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If I feel instant resentment because of a phrase, that's my problem, and<br>no one else's.<br><br>Thankfully I don't have that problem. I don't feel anything when someone<br>describes themselves.<br><br>I do have that "association" problem where someone says something about<br>themselves, and I think other things about them, through association.<br>For example, someone tells me they are "anti-gun" or "pro gun control"<br>and I usually think that they are liberal, or Democratic, or<br>progressive. And usually I'm right, but the association is my problem.<br><br>But none of that is relevant. I don't care that you're anti-gun. Feel<br>free to be anti-gun all day. Don't ever buy one. Don't ever own one. You<br>are absolutely free to do whatever you choose.<br><br>**The minute I have an issue is where you start to tell me what I can do<br>and what I can't do**.<br><br>Be anti-gun. Enjoy that. That's your business. *But don't tell me what I<br>can do.* If I want to be "pro gun" or "pro gun rights" or whatever,<br>that's my business. If I want to own a gun, if I want to take the time<br>and invest the money to get a concealed weapons permit, that's also my<br>business. If I want to go out in public with my concealed weapon, again,<br>my business, not yours.<br><br>My concealed weapon doesn't impact you. My lifestyle choice doesn't<br>impact you. Don't take it upon yourself to insert yourself into my<br>business.<br><br>Anti-gunners choose to not own guns, and that's fine. But then they<br>attempt to tell me that I can't own guns either, and that's where I have<br>an issue. I don't tell anti-gunners that they *must* own guns. I don't<br>understand why they deign to tell me that I can't, or shouldn't.<br><br>(EDIT) I want to answer the new question.<br><br>> *Gun owners, do you have any hope for a satisfactory resolution to the<br>> gun rights issue?*<br><br>I have little hope, because I know that gun control advocates want<br>nothing short of the banning of all legal gun ownership in America.<br>Nothing less will do.<br><br>While we have already addressed this issue here on Quora, there are lots<br>of things that we can do which might actually make some difference.<br><br>- While some major work would have to be done, I believe some form of<br>  safe storage should be mandated in households where small children are<br>  reasonably expected to be present. I know, lots of pro-gun folks don't<br>  like this, but I believe technology has come far enough that gun safes<br>  are both quickly accessible (i.e. within seconds) and make guns safe<br>  from children. If we say we're protecting children, this should only<br>  be applicable for households in which children under 16 are reasonably<br>  expected to be. If it is a household of all adults, or where children<br>  are not routinely present, it shouldn't be mandated. We should also<br>  not mandate safe storage to prevent gun theft. It's not incumbent on<br>  the law-abiding to correct the misdeeds of the criminal, and if gun<br>  owners don't take reasonable steps to prevent any theft in their house<br>  (let alone gun theft), it's not a punishment we lay on the victim.<br>- We should get tough on the gun laws we already have. I know people<br>  have vapidly parroted this line in the past, but to me, this means<br>  forcing prosecutors to levy this charge any time a gun is involved in<br>  a crime, and making it so that this charge cannot be plea bargained<br>  away. Too many times, prosecutors have told defendants that they would<br>  waive the gun charges if they plead guilty to<br>  \<insert_other_crime_here\> and it makes the commission of a crime<br>  with a gun moot. Criminals will continue to commit crimes with guns<br>  because they know they can get the gun charges dropped if they plead<br>  to something else. Criminals will think twice about using a gun if<br>  they know that if caught, they will be charged with a gun crime, and<br>  it will stick.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
