<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What do I do when I ask my boyfriend not to use certain belongings for<br>a particular reason, and he blatantly defies my request right in front<br>of me and still does what I asked him not to do?**<br><br>Clearly, this is a power struggle. You'd like him to do something, and<br>he's blatantly, right in front of you, defying your request.<br><br>Perhaps he's not understanding just how important it is that he do what<br>you ask. You might consider sitting down with him and discussing why you<br>want what you want, why it is important to you, and how it makes you<br>feel when he blatantly ignores what you're asking. I'd bet that it<br>probably makes you feel like your requests hold no meaning for him. Does<br>he really value your relationship that little?<br><br>If the behavior continues, maybe this isn't the guy you thought he was,<br>and maybe it's time to re-think your relationship and where it might be<br>going.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
