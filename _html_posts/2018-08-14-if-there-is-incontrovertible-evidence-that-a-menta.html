<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *If there is incontrovertible evidence that a mentally unfit<br>> individual raped and murdered a seven-year-old girl, should his<br>> illness protect him from being executed by the state?*<br><br>The short answer is no, unless the defendant pleads ***not guilty by<br>reason of insanity.***<br><br>Until we're able to read minds, I don't think there will ever be<br>incontrovertible evidence that anyone did anything. The legal standard<br>in this country is "beyond a reasonable doubt."<br><br>If the defendant wants to avoid the death penalty, he must plead not<br>guilty by reason of insanity. Tennessee allows this defense, but Billy<br>Ray Irick did not plead not guilty by reason of insanity.<br><br>In his trial, the defense called no witnesses and Billy did not testify.<br>The only person to testify to his significant mental issues was a<br>clinical social worker.<br><br>> Because none of the information about Billy's psychotic symptoms just<br>> prior to the murder was ever investigated or presented at trial, the<br>> state's psychiatric expert, Dr. Clifton Tennison, who spent one hour<br>> evaluating Billy, testified at his trial that there was no evidence of<br>> mental illness that would have prevented Billy from knowing the<br>> wrongfulness of his conduct. Instead, Dr. Tennison concluded Billy had<br>> an anti-social personality disorder. The doctor testified that "many<br>> people with anti-social personality are in jail -- or in prison right<br>> now..." However, according to the state's pre-sentence report, Billy<br>> had only a few misdemeanors on his record.\[1\](#scGMC){#cite-scGMC<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>Tennessee uses the Model Penal Code test to determine whether or not<br>someone can be held criminally liable with diminished mental capacity.<br>The MPC test says that in order to be held responsible, the defendant<br>needed to be unable to either:<br><br>1.  Appreciate the criminality of his conduct; or<br>2.  Conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.<br><br>Since Dr. Tennison testified that there was no evidence of mental<br>illness that would have prevented Billy from knowing the wrongfulness of<br>his conduct, *even if* he pled not guilty by reason of insanity, he<br>would not have prevailed.<br><br>During his many appeals, questions were raised regarding his mental<br>state at the time of the killing. These appeals were rejected.<br><br>There was ample opportunity to stop the execution if the state felt that<br>Billy's diminished mental capacity due to mental illness had<br>significantly impaired his ability to appreciate that what he was doing<br>was wrong. The state did not feel that this was the case.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-scGMC){.citation_index} [[Murderpedia, the encyclopedia of<br>murderers](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a5b232&url=http://murderpedia.org/male.I/i/irick-billy-ray.htm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="murderpedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
