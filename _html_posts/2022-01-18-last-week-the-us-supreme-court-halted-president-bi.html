<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes they can. Private companies can put whatever rules they want in<br>place for their workers. Private companies can even force all of their<br>employees to get mandatory vaccinations or be fired. Some companies have<br>already done this, like Disney (yes, Disney [[suspended its mandatory<br>vaccination<br>program](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4eb6cc&url=https://www.reuters.com/business/disney-world-puts-covid-19-vaccination-mandate-policy-hold-local-tv-2021-11-21/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="reuters.com"}]{.qlink_container} as it would have run afoul<br>of Florida state law). But outside of Florida at least, an employer can<br>force all their employees to either "get the jab or lose the job."<br><br>The ruling simply said that OSHA cannot *mandate* vaccinations or<br>testing for all businesses, because that is outside the scope of OSHA's<br>authority.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court halted President Biden\'s vaccine and<br>testing mandate for employers. Can workplaces still mandate vaccines<br>anyway?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
