<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>They don't, and honestly, they don't really care.<br><br>If you show up in court for your arraignment and the judge asks you if<br>you can afford an attorney and you say "no," the court will go through a<br>process which has different names in different states, but are broadly<br>referred to as "indigency investigations" or "indigency hearings."<br><br>An indigency hearing, sometimes called an indigence determination or<br>indigence evaluation, is a process where a court assesses a defendant\'s<br>financial situation to see if they qualify for state-funded legal aid.<br>While commonly associated with criminal cases, indigency hearings can<br>also be relevant in civil matters, such as family law cases or when<br>seeking to appeal a court decision.<br><br>The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to counsel for those charged<br>with a crime, but this right is often extended to civil cases as well.<br>If a defendant cannot afford an attorney, the court must provide one.<br>However, before the court will give out state-funded legal aid, the<br>defendant typically needs to demonstrate to the court that they lack the<br>financial resources to hire a private attorney. This may involve<br>completing a form detailing their income, assets, and expenses.<br><br>If the court finds the defendant "indigent," they will appoint a public<br>defender or other court-appointed attorney to represent them in the<br>legal case. The defendant may also be excused from paying certain court<br>fees.<br><br>Courts may consider various factors when determining indigency,<br>including income, assets (like savings, property, or other valuables),<br>outstanding debts, and the number of dependents.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
