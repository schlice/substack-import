<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What more can Londoners do to prevent knife crime? Are there solutions<br>that the government and citizens have left unexplored?**<br><br>There are two issues in your question. The first issue is the reduction<br>of knife crime in general, and the second issue is your personal safety.<br>I'm not sure which question you're asking: whether you're asking how you<br>reduce crime, or how you prevent yourself from becoming a victim. I will<br>only address the first question: how to reduce knife crime in general.<br>If you want an answer to the second, please ask another question, but<br>more succinctly.<br><br>The implement used is solely related to your society and its norms. To<br>that end, the fact that criminals use knives instead of guns or cricket<br>bats or bags of rocks is irrelevant. Therefore, in order to prevent<br>knife crime, you have to ignore the tool, and focus on the act. I know<br>it's hard to do, because a knife is a tangible thing, and crime and its<br>causes are so nebulous, but you must focus on the crime and not the<br>implement of the crime.<br><br>Therefore, in order to prevent knife crime, you have to prevent *crime*.<br>To do that, you have to find the reasons why people commit crime in the<br>first place. It may be wealth inequality. It may be hunger. It may be<br>anger. Until you get to the root cause of *crime*, you're not going to<br>be able to stop any crime, let alone knife crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
