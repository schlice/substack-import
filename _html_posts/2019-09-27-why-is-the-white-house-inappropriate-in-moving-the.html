<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is the White House inappropriate in moving the president's calls<br>and transcripts with foreign officials to a highly sensitive and<br>protected computer system? Are they afraid of hacking or not normal<br>procedures for handling such information?**<br><br>Transcripts of phone calls with foreign officials are classified<br>because of what happened with Trump's call with Ukraine.<br><br>The White House isn't afraid of revealing any alleged misdeeds; there<br>are far too many people listening to those high-level phone calls for<br>any illegal stuff to ever dream of being discussed, and it surprises me<br>that people think that any world leader would blatantly call out illegal<br>behavior on a phone line with so many people listening in.<br><br>The White House routinely classifies these conversations for two<br>reasons:<br><br>1.  They are more afraid of leaks than they are of admissions of<br>    misdeeds.<br>2.  They want to assure *the other guy* that the United States will<br>    protect their conversation. They want to assure the other world<br>    leaders that they may speak to our president in confidence and not<br>    have their conversation plastered all over every Internet web site<br>    in existence. This is why Trump had to get permission from the<br>    President of Ukraine to release the transcript of their call.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
