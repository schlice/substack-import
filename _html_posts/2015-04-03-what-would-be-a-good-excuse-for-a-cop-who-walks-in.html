<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The question is whether or not the victim posed a threat.<br>If the victim wasn\'t a threat to anyone, there\'s nothing that will<br>prevent the officer from being charged with murder. No different than<br>anyone else who walks into a shopping mall and shoots someone to death<br>in front of everyone. The officer would have to show that the person was<br>an imminent threat to the people around him.\<br>\<br>There may be a defense to that charge, such as temporary insanity. In<br>the absence of a threat to the officer\'s life, or the lives of others,<br>the officer simply lost touch with reality and saw the victim as a<br>three-headed space monster. The officer would be committed to a<br>psychiatric hospital and would lose his job.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
