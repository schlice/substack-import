If so, what type of lawyer should I contact on this<br>matter?**<br><br>You can sue anyone for anything in the United States.<br><br>The question remains: will you prevail?<br><br>Historical precedent says you will not prevail.<br><br>> An adult\'s consent may be expressed in writing or declared verbally.<br>> Consent may also be implied by the actions of the adult in response to<br>> a request from the health professional. In *O\'Brien v Cunard SS Co*<br>> (1891) a woman failed in her claim for trespass against a doctor who<br>> injected her with smallpox vaccine on a ship bound for Boston. The<br>> court held that the woman had stood in line for the vaccination,<br>> offered her arm to the doctor and made no complaint when he injected<br>> her. Her behaviour indicated consent and the doctor was right to<br>> proceed.\[1\](#macSt){#cite-macSt .citation_link}<br><br>So, to that end:<br><br>- Did you present yourself to the doctor who gave you the shot?<br>- Did you know what you were being injected with? If not, what did you<br>  think it was?<br>- Did you complain at the time of injection?<br><br>Your behavior indicated consent, and the doctor was right to proceed.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-macSt){.citation_index} [[Obtaining consent for the<br>immunization of<br>adults](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=25c517&url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4962744/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nih.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
