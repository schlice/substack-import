<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(US Answer Only. Outside of the US, your mileage may vary)*<br><br>Only if it is contract employment and you both signed the contract, and<br>there is no unique termination procedure in the contract.<br><br>If it is at-will employment, **your employer can fire you at any time<br>for any reason, and you can quit at any time for any reason** (except<br>for legally protected reasons).<br><br>So if you accepted the position, you agreed on all the details, *and you<br>even showed up for the first day of work,* the employer could say, "Oh<br>we're so sorry, but we're not going to fill this position any longer,<br>we're going to take this business unit in a different direction. But<br>please keep an eye on our job board, as we'll be creating new positions<br>in the near future, and if you made it this far in the employment<br>process, you'll be a shoo-in for the new position," and that would be<br>perfectly legal.<br><br>That said, you could make a case that you bought a bunch of stuff on the<br>expectations of the accepted job, considering you may have had to buy a<br>new wardrobe, or a new computer or something. You may request that the<br>employer reimburse you for those, and if they do not, you may have to<br>sue them in small claims court to get your money back. You likely won't<br>get all of it back, but if you had to foot a significant outlay to get<br>yourself started in this position, you may be able to recoup some of it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
