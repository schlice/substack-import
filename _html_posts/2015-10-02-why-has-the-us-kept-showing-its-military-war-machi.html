<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I added \"Questions That Contain Assumptions\" because you<br>(wrongly) assume that US troops amassing along the border of another<br>country is a maveuver designed to deter them from economic expansion.\<br>\<br>The only borders that the US can amass troops against are its own.<br>Therefore, unless we\'re hell-bent on ruining Canada\'s or Mexico\'s<br>economies (we\'re not), we certainly would not do this.\<br>\<br>Any US troops in another country aren\'t massing along a border. Unless<br>you have some valid sources to show that this is happening, I\'m going<br>to believe that it\'s not.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
