<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Would it make a difference? Would an oppressive regime<br/>think twice about the losses \*they\* would suffer if they tried to make<br/>armed impositions against their own people? With respect to the US it<br/>makes no sense, but thinking outside the box, would an oppressive regime<br/>be more apt to commit crimes against its own people if it knew they were<br/>(mostly) unarmed, the law-abiding citizens anyway.\<br/>\<br/>As Matt Pickering also mentioned, every despot and dictator who came to<br/>power made sure that anyone who wished to oppose them didn\'t have the<br/>power and/or ability to do so. In the vast majority of cases, this was<br/>by first disarming the populace.\<br/>\<br/>The US was formed with the idea that we should always be able to<br/>overthrow the government (although that would be tenable these days at<br/>best), so the ability of the people to keep and bear arms was codified<br/>in our laws at the founding.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
