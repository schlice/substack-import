People can be arrested without probable cause, and held<br>without trial for extended periods. This is normally done to quell<br>uprisings and restore order.<br><br>There is no provision which can be implemented by the President to allow<br>him to stay in office beyond the natural conclusion of his term.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
