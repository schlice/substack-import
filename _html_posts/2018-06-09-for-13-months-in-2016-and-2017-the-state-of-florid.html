<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**For 13 months in 2016 and 2017 the State of Florida neglected to do<br>Federal background checks on concealed carry applicants. Shouldn\'t<br>Florida be heavily fined and the permits, all 275,000+ of them, be<br>voided?**<br><br>You slightly misread the story.<br><br>Not all employees failed to do background checks. Only one employee<br>failed to do 365 background checks because he couldn't log in. He simply<br>approved the applications without doing the NICS check.<br><br>Once this was discovered, the employee was fired, full background checks<br>were initiated against the 365 applicants, and this resulted in 291<br>revocations. There is no evidence to show that crimes were committed<br>using these concealed weapons because of these erroneous approvals.<br><br>So the problem was corrected, the suspect employee was terminated, and<br>those who were erroneously issued permits (less than 300 people, not<br>275,000) had their permits revoked. The office has also implemented new<br>safeguards to ensure that NICS checks are actually performed before the<br>state issues a CCW permit.<br><br>Any time you have a system which involves people, people can fail. This<br>isn't a failure of the system, it's a failure of people. You simply<br>can't prevent that. All you can do is root out the bad people and<br>improve your processes.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
