<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you are against abortion, would you use the Regeneron treatment for<br>COVID-19 that Trump is touting? Aborted fetal cells were used in its<br>development. Trump even banned Federal funding for fetal cell research**<br><br>Oh yes, in a hot second, and without any cognitive dissonance either.<br><br>The cells used in Regeneron's testing are cells from an abortion which<br>took place in the Netherlands in the 1970s. The cells have been<br>"immortalized," set to continuously regenerate in the lab (like a<br>cancer) and have now been doing so for so many years that they have<br>essentially transcended the abortion debate and are essentially<br>considered by scientists to be *outside of abortion politics.*<br><br>Trump's administration has worked against funding programs which use<br>*recently aborted fetal tissue* in an effort to prevent the<br>abortion-for-profit schemes we see with organizations like Planned<br>Parenthood (even though abortion supporters will deny that this ever<br>happened). The videos of PP employees bargaining over the prices of<br>aborted fetal body parts is...interesting to watch.<br><br>The fact that aborted cells were used to create virus-like structures on<br>which to test the treatment does not change my opinion about abortion,<br>or the treatment, or Trump, or funding for research which uses aborted<br>tissue.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
