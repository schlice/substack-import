<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the United States, broadly, we are covered by Federal, state, and<br>local laws called the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It states that in<br>all places of \"public accommodation,\" discrimination on the basis of<br>race, color, creed (religion), sex, or national origin is illegal. Note<br>that at the Federal level, there is no protection for sexual<br>orientation.<br><br>While all states have a version of the Civil Rights Act that matches the<br>Federal statute, only about 20 states have included protection for<br>sexual orientation. And for those that do not have such protection, some<br>cities within those states have included sexual orientation for<br>protection.<br><br>So if a lesbian owned a pub and wanted to accept just lesbian customers,<br>she would have to do so in a city and state which does not have<br>protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.<br>Then, she could exclude everyone who is not a lesbian. However, this<br>would run afoul of the law banning discrimination on the basis of sex,<br>so she could still be sued for discrimination for failing to allow a man<br>into the pub (gay or straight). She likely couldn\'t be sued for denying<br>entrance to a straight woman, but denying entrance to any man would be<br>grounds for a discrimination lawsuit under both Federal and state law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
