<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the legal definitions or standards of the Constitution's ban<br>on \"foreign emoluments\"?**<br><br>Most folks are getting really close to the correct answer but missing<br>the most important mark.<br><br>The whole purpose of the emoluments clause is to prevent *divided<br>loyalty.*<br><br>The actual clause reads as follows: "no person holding any office of<br>profit or trust...shall, without the consent of Congress, accept...any<br>present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any<br>king, prince, or foreign state." We want our governmental officials to<br>be 100% loyal to the United States. We don't want them even partially<br>loyal (or beholden) to any foreign government.<br><br>Foreign emoluments, therefore, would mean receiving any form of<br>compensation in exchange for any form of loyalty or fealty to another<br>sovereign.<br><br>So let's put this into context.<br><br>- Is it a foreign emolument for President Trump to have a foreign<br>  official stay in Trump Tower? NO, by itself, it is not an<br>  emolument. Trump's family name is on a business, which he no longer<br>  personally owns (but his family still does). This is also why a blind<br>  trust would be pointless for Trump, but that's another answer to<br>  another question. Trump is still allowed to have the business bear his<br>  family name, even though the rest of his family runs that business.<br>- Is it a foreign emolument if, say, Trump allows a foreign official to<br>  stay at Trump Tower for a reduced rate? NO, again this alone does<br>  not constitute a foreign emolument. Trump (or his family) is allowed<br>  to set the prices that they charge as part of his business.<br>- Is it a foreign emolument if, say, Trump alters a policy decision<br>  based on the fact that a foreign official stayed or did not stay at<br>  his hotel? YES, this would clearly be a violation of the clause.<br><br>We want anyone to be able to be president. Business leaders should be as<br>qualified as career politicians who don't own hotels and can easily<br>dispose of any stocks/bonds/other instruments and place the assets into<br>blind trusts. Trump can continue to conduct business while President.<br>But the moment he makes a governmental decision *with respect to who<br>does business with him*, he's violated the Constitution.<br><br>Ultimately, it's up to Congress to monitor the relationship between<br>Trump's family, Trump's businesses, and Trump's executive actions.<br>Presumably, this is why people had the foresight to turn control of the<br>House over to Democrats, who are presumably more likely to scrutinize<br>the President more closely.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
