<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The two parts of the question are incongruous.<br><br>What are some examples of an unlawful order from a police officer?<br><br>My esteemed colleagues have already provided information about what is a<br>lawful and unlawful order, I don\'t think I need to re-hash it.<br><br>Or do the police have the right to make you do what they want?<br><br>The two parts of your question are not related. If the order is lawful,<br>it\'s likely that he wants you to obey it.<br><br>It sounds like you\'re asking if the police have the right to tell you<br>to do anything that they please at any time, and you simply have to<br>follow it because it\'s an order from a police officer.<br><br>So if a police officer said to you \"strip naked right here right now,\"<br>do you think that order would be enforceable? If you had just been<br>exposed to a deadly neurotoxin that was seeping through your clothes and<br>if it made contact with your skin it would instantly kill you, it\'s<br>possible that such an order would be lawful. But an officer doesn\'t<br>have to tell you at that moment what the source for his order is. So how<br>are you to know? You might ask, \"Why, was I exposed to a deadly<br>neurotoxin that is now seeping its way through my clothes and if it<br>touches my ski\.....\" and then you die because you took too long trying<br>to figure out why a police officer would order you to do such a thing.<br><br>If you do follow an order and it causes you to do something that makes<br>you uncomfortable or you think that might be unlawful, make sure to<br>follow up with the officer\'s chain of command by filing a police<br>report, or retaining an attorney to assist you in filing charges against<br>the department.<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being<br>isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I<br>wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is<br>un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m<br>wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,<br>not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,<br>you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.<br>Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be<br>followed by a block and a mute. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
