The United States has this same problem as<br>well. The problem is *rights*. There are as many tenant rights to not be<br>involuntarily made homeless as there are landlord rights to earn money<br>on their property.<br><br>I will explain how this happens in the United States. I'm not sure if<br>the laws in Spain are similar, but I imagine they are, with some<br>procedural differences.<br><br>In the United States, having a problem with a rental agreement is not a<br>criminal offense, it is a civil matter, so the police really can't help.<br>If the landlord calls the police, the police arrive and say, "What are<br>you doing here?" and the "tenants" say, "I live here," and the police<br>don't know any different. So it comes down to the landlord filing suit<br>against the tenant claiming that they violated their rental agreement or<br>that they don't have a rental agreement in the first place, and once all<br>of the legal avenues have been followed, a judge can declare the person<br>to be in violation.<br><br>Then, the landlord can go through the process of eviction, which is also<br>not a fast process. It is a full legal process which must be followed,<br>depending on the type of eviction being sought. The landlord must first<br>*serve* notice to the tenant, which usually means handing them a letter<br>in person, but if a letter is sent in the mail, the eviction notice can<br>be posted.<br><br>If the tenant does not respond, or does not meet the demand in the<br>notice, within the specified number of days (each type of eviction has a<br>set number of days), and is still occupying the unit, then the landlord<br>can return to the court to get a summons and complaint to evict the<br>tenant. If the tenant still does not respond to that notice, when its<br>timeframe expires, the sheriff can forcibly enter the premise and evict<br>the tenant.<br><br>It's not a quick process, but the purpose of the process is to ensure<br>that the tenant's rights are not violated simply because they had a<br>contract dispute with the landlord.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
