<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should I demand to be let out of my Brooklyn, NY lease because my<br>roommate is getting a gun without my consent?**<br><br>Sure. But remember, as soon as you let the landlord know that you want<br>out because your roommate brought a gun into Brooklyn from out of state,<br>get out of the way because your roommate is about to be arrested. That<br>landlord won't want that kind of trouble in his building, and you can be<br>sure he's going to call the police so he stays on the right side of the<br>law himself.<br><br>New York gun laws are some of the strictest in the country. You need<br>individual licenses to purchase and licenses to carry, and they are "may<br>issue" licenses, which means that whether or not they are actually<br>issued is up to the issuing officer.<br><br>New York doesn't recognize permits from anywhere else, so if you don't<br>have a New York gun permit, you can't bring a gun into New<br>York.\[1\](#tpSnJ){#cite-tpSnJ .citation_link}<br><br>So in my opinion, trying to get your landlord to let you out of your<br>lease because your roommate illegally brought a gun into the city is a<br>good way to get your roommate arrested. I'm not sure if it's a good way<br>to get out of your lease, but it will do something.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-tpSnJ){.citation_index} [[New York Gun<br>Laws](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=10a8d8&url=https://www.gunstocarry.com/gun-laws-state/new-york-gun-laws/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gunstocarry.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
