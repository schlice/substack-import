<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When studying the Bible, it is important to determine whether the verse<br>or passage at hand is descriptive or prescriptive. The difference is<br>this: a passage is *descriptive* if it is simply describing something<br>that happened, while a passage is *prescriptive* if it is specifically<br>teaching that something should happen. Simply put, is it a description<br>or a command? Is the passage *describing* something (it happened) or is<br>it *prescribing* something (it should happen)? The difference is<br>important. When a biblical passage is only describing something but is<br>interpreted as prescribing something, it can lead to errant thinking and<br>behavior.<br><br>And if we have difficulty determining whether a particular passage is<br>prescriptive or descriptive, it often helps us to look at the larger<br>context.<br><br>So let's zoom out to 2 Corinthians 11:16--33. In this section of the<br>chapter, Paul details the physical hardships he endured while serving<br>Christ. He describes sleepless nights, hunger, thirst, cold, and<br>exposure (nakedness), all of which were a direct result of his ministry.<br>Some of these struggles came from lack of resources, while others were<br>due to imprisonment or difficult travels. His suffering, though seen as<br>failure by some, was actually a testament to his dedication and service.<br>Paul\'s discussion of his weakness in this chapter will lead to his<br>conclusion in the next chapter that Christ is strongest in him when he<br>is weak.<br><br>> *So to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing<br>> greatness of the revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a<br>> messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited.<br>> Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave<br>> me. But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power<br>> is made perfect in weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more<br>> gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.<br>> For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults,<br>> hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am<br>> strong. \-- 2 Cor 12:7--10 ESV*<br><br>In other words, just because Paul describe it happening to him doesn't<br>make it *prescriptive* on us. That said, we can still learn from the<br>larger context of Paul's experience. We can learn that Christ is<br>strongest when we are weak.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
