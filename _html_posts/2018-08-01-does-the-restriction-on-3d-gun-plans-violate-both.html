<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What justification are these state AGs using to block Defense<br>Distributed from publishing information in opposition to the 1st and 2nd<br>Amendment combined with the Supremacy clause via the settlement with the<br>Federal Government?**<br><br>The State AGs filed injunctions against the settlement that allowed<br>Defense Distributed to publish its plans for 3-D renderings of guns<br>online because they claim it violates their 10th Amendment rights to<br>make their own laws, specifically laws which allow them to regulate<br>certain firearms for which Defense Distributed is providing plans.<br><br>This doesn't stop the plans that are already out there for which anyone<br>with basic metalworking knowledge can use, but presumably this is more<br>of an existential threat because "anyone with a 3-D printer and an<br>Internet connection" can now print their own guns. Apparently, the fear<br>here is that anyone can buy a cheap (?) 3-D printer and start pumping<br>out untraceable guns, and "the streets will be awash in blood."<br><br>As you can imagine, that statement is only slightly hyperbolic.<br><br>You can't 3-D print an AR-15.<br><br>You might be able to 3-D print the AR-15 *lower* out of sufficiently<br>strong plastic, but there's no guarantee that it will be able to handle<br>the stress of firing a bullet for more than a few shots. And only the<br>lower is regulated. The rest of the parts can be ordered online because<br>they're not considered *guns*. Only the lower is regulated and<br>serialized.<br><br>You can legally buy an "80% lower," which is basically a big block of<br>metal that requires millwork before it becomes an AR-15 lower, and that<br>has existed forever.<br><br>Plans for plastic 3-D printed guns have been around for ages, and even<br>older plans for fashioning homemade guns are still in print today. In<br>those ancient things called *books*, I'm told.<br><br>You can make a zip gun that fires 12 gauge rounds for about \$7 in parts<br>from the hardware store (by the way, if the zombie apocalypse ever<br>comes, I'll make you a zip gun in exchange for whatever the new currency<br>becomes after world governments are eaten by zombies).<br><br>But anyway, I'm pretty sure that this injunction against the<br>distribution of the plans by this company will fall on the 1st Amendment<br>side, since there is ample evidence that plans for plastic guns have<br>existed on the Internet for ages, and the streets are not similarly<br>awash in blood.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
