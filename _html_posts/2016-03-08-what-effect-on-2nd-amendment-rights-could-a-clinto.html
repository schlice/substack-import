<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do you remember the \"Assault Weapons\" ban from the *last* Clinton<br>presidency? Was that an infringement on any 2nd Amendment rights?<br>Congress seemed to think so, as they thought enough of the ban to allow<br>it to expire without renewing it.<br><br>Clinton also wants to repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms<br>Act so that victims of gun violence can attempt to file lawsuits against<br>gun manufacturers because their guns killed someone. It is unprecedented<br>to file a lawsuit against a product manufacturer when their product<br>works as designed, but you don\'t like what it does. You don\'t see<br>people suing Ford when a drunk driver kills someone. You don\'t hear<br>calls for Ford to build a \"safer\" car.<br><br>Clinton claims that PLCAA gives \"blanket immunity\" to gun<br>manufacturers, failing to force them to make their products \"safer.\"<br>First of all, safer for whom? Guns are designed to kill. If a gun is<br>used to kill someone, it is working as designed. If the operator of the<br>gun is uninjured after using it, it is working safely. It\'s not the<br>gun\'s fault that someone died. It\'s not the gun manufacturer\'s fault<br>that someone died, either. There are copious warnings about what a gun<br>does printed all over the box, sometimes right on the gun itself.<br>Frankly, I find it hard to imagine that someone holding a gun doesn\'t<br>know what it does. \"Wait, I though this was a blender! I never wanted<br>to kill anyone!\" Yeah, not likely.<br><br>Secondly, if a gun is indeed unsafe to use, you can sue the manufacturer<br>under PLCAA. The law does not protect manufacturers from suits when<br>their product does not work as designed. If, instead of killing the<br>target in front of it, it injures the operator, the manufacturer can<br>definitely face liability for that. The law simply protects<br>manufacturers from frivolous lawsuits attempting to transfer liability<br>from the operator to the manufacturer. In fact, other companies are<br>provided equal, if not greater, protection against liability in the<br>United States. [[PolitiFact already rated Clinton\'s statements<br>\"False.\"](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0bfa4b&url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/16/hillary-clinton/clinton-gun-industry-wholly-protected-all-lawsuits/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="politifact.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>She wants to close the \"gun show loophole,\" which we already know<br>doesn\'t exist. It is true that some people can buy guns without a<br>background check, but they don\'t do it at a gun show. In many states,<br>private sellers (such as someone selling a gun from a collection to a<br>friend or relative) do not need to obtain background checks first. Some<br>states have already instituted laws requiring all firearms transactions<br>to first have a background check performed by a dealer with a Federal<br>Firearms License. Clinton would seek to make it a Federal requirement<br>that any transfer of firearms between any two people would require a<br>background check. So if I wanted to gift a firearm to my son, he would<br>need a background check before I could legally do it.<br><br>She also wants to close the \"Charleston loophole\" which states that<br>the government has three days to complete its background check on<br>someone when buying a gun. The shooter in the Charleston church<br>shootings, Dylan Roof, was able to buy a gun when the background<br>investigation period expired. This was caused by a clerical error when<br>the FBI requested information from the wrong agency. Had they requested<br>information from the correct agency, they would have discovered that<br>Roof was arrested on a drug charge a month before he tried to purchase a<br>gun. Because the records didn\'t show a conviction, the investigator<br>could not stop the purchase, but they kept investigating anyway. Because<br>his records showed the wrong agency as the one who placed the arrest,<br>the FBI was unable to find the information in time, and the purchase<br>defaulted to proceed.<br><br>What is in question is not necessarily what happened in Roof\'s case \--<br>he likely wouldn\'t have been prevented from buying a gun even if the<br>correct agency was listed, because while he was arrested on a drug<br>charge, he was never convicted, so he was not a \"convicted felon\" who<br>is in an exempted class from purchasing firearms \-- but the three day<br>\"default to proceed\" legislation in the background check process.<br>Clinton seeks to change that, either to elongate the time before a<br>purchase can proceed, perhaps up to ten days, or perhaps change the law<br>from \"default to proceed\" to \"default to deny,\" meaning that if a<br>background check fails because of clerical issues, the sale cannot go<br>through. In the vast majority of cases, the instant background check<br>process works correctly. In my last gun purchase, it took less than five<br>minutes to return a \"proceed.\" Granted, the Federal government has *a<br>lot* of background information on me, as I have held a DoD Top Secret<br>security clearance for the better part of 20 years. They probably know<br>more about me than I do. Nevertheless, it\'s not likely that any change<br>to the background check system will do anything more than to<br>inconvenience legitimate buyers; you don\'t see a lot of criminals<br>purchasing guns just because the background check system failed to<br>produce results in the requisite three days. And criminals aren\'t<br>relying on the background check system failing in order to get a gun \--<br>they make their purchases from places which don\'t provide background<br>checks, otherwise known as the *black market*. The tightening of these<br>so-called \"loopholes\" will really have a negligent impact on crime,<br>but a very big impact on legitimate purchasers, but will have the<br>biggest impact on dealers.<br><br>The point here is that the Second Amendment was put in place to<br>safeguard these rights against exactly this kind of Federal overreach.<br>While a Clinton presidency would not pose a serious threat of anything<br>meaningful happening to the Second Amendment (you still need a<br>Constitutional Amendment to change it, or an Article V convention),<br>these laws are a slow but continuous *erosion* of our rights. If you<br>can\'t change the Constitution wholesale, you chip away at it piece by<br>piece, until eventually you have legislated those rights, legally, into<br>oblivion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
