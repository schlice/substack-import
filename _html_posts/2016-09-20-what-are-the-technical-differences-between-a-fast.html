<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is no difference in the cables. Period. A cable is a wire which<br>creates a connection between two points. Cables do not have logic in<br>them. There is nothing which makes a cable a "fast charging cable"<br>except for marketing.<br><br>The fast charging part comes from a communication between the charging<br>"brick" or Qi-compatible wireless charger and the device being charged.<br>The device will ask the charger if it supports fast charging, the<br>charger will respond that it does, and the amperage delivered by the<br>charger will change. It's really that simple.<br><br>If the cable doesn't allow the communication between the device and the<br>brick to happen correctly (perhaps because some of the pins in the cable<br>have broken), it won't fast charge. If the cable is not allowing the<br>proper amperage to flow between the two devices (again, because of<br>weakening of the connectors on the cable, or broken connections), the<br>charging speed will not be maintained.<br><br>Use a new cable, keep your cables in good condition, and fast charging<br>will continue to work.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
