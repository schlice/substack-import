And if you<br>> see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store,<br>> at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. And you<br>> push back on them. And you tell them they\'re not welcome anymore,<br>> anywhere. We\'ve got to get the children connected to their parents.*<br><br>Does Barack Obama bear any responsibility for his comments?<br><br>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ce6aa2&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DZCMDur9CDZ4){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="youtube.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>> *I need you to go out and talk to your friends and talk to your<br>> neighbors.

The only people who bear any<br>responsibility for the attacks are the attackers. No one else.<br><br>We hold our 1st Amendment rights dear in this country. You can speak<br>out. You can tell people to get angry.
