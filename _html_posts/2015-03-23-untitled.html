<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [*Yes I do have a right to be safe from other people. What<br>are you crazy? It not a matter of being offended, I have a right to know<br>who is packing and who isn\'t.*\<br>I was unaware that concealed carry records were public knowledge. How<br>exactly do you expect to know who is carrying a weapon? That\'s exactly<br>the point of concealed carry: no one knows! You\'ll never know if<br>someone is conceealing a weapon; chances are, many people you pass every<br>day are carrying, and you just don\'t know it. Chew on THAT for a<br>while.\<br>\<br>*I have a right to have a reasonable expectation of being safe in the<br>public square and just because you pass a background check doesn\'t mean<br>you could hit water if you fell out of a boat.*\<br>You have no such right. Please show me where in the Bill of Rights you<br>have a right to be safe in the public square. Who exactly is going to<br>guarantee your right? The police? If you get shot in public, are you<br>going to sue the government for not keeping you safe? The police don\'t<br>even have to keep you safe! Were you aware that the police are charged<br>with enforcing laws, which means that people have to violate the law<br>first before it can be enforced? We don\'t have the *Minority Report*<br>machine yet, so we can\'t know whether or not someone is going to break<br>the law before they do it, so police only enforce the law *after*<br>someone violates it. They are not mandated to protect you (unless you<br>are in their custody). The police are there to make sure that those who<br>break the law are brought to justice. It would be nice if they could<br>actually prevent crime from happening, but that\'s a pipe dream. And<br>with the miniscule number of police officers to citizens, good luck<br>getting one to help you within a reasonable amount of time after a crime<br>has been committed, anyway. Ultimately, in a free society, you are<br>responsible for your own safety.. The police are unable to stop crime<br>before it happens, so it\'s up to you to protect yourself.\<br>\<br>*You can keep you gun on you property, the second you go out in public<br>your ability to make decisions about how you use a gun is my business as<br>well as everyone elses and you you can\'t understand that then we simply<br>disagree.*\<br>If you live in a state which has open carry, this is mostly not true, as<br>there are no licensing requirements for open carry. For concealed carry,<br>of course you have to be permitted, but it\'s usually nothing more than<br>a half-day class that teaches you how to properly hold a gun, and even<br>still, that doesn\'t make their licensing \"your business.\" You have no<br>right to know that information about someone else. There is no state in<br>which the concealed carry permit records of the local police or the<br>sheriff are public record. And how I use my gun is my business, not<br>yours. If I choose to kill you with it, that\'s my business. I will<br>likely face consequences, but that\'s my choice. The government already<br>ran a background check on me, and that ensures that I\'m not a felon. If<br>that background check is not sufficient for you, you will need to lobby<br>to improve the background checks we already have. But to be honest, the<br>problem is not the background check, it\'s with the state of mental<br>health treatment in this counrtry, and deinstitutionalization was not<br>the correct answer.\<br>\<br>*So please go argue with someone else because frankly current law is on<br>my side on this issue. Most states require you a permit have you get a<br>permit to carry in public and those that don\'t are just foolish.*\<br>I\'m sorry, you have a poor grasp of current law. As I said, you only<br>need a permit if you wish to conceal a weapon. If you want to open<br>carry, normally no permits are required, and that\'s in nearly every<br>state where open carry is allowed. You don\'t need a permit to buy a<br>gun. In almost all states, you don\'t need a permit to own a gun (which<br>*Heller* found was unconstitutional anyway, so these ownership permit<br>states are slowly going away as their ownership permit laws are being<br>challenged). You need a permit to conceal a weapon, but that\'s about<br>it.\<br>\<br>I\'m not sure where you get this idea that what people do with their own<br>lives is somehow your business. If you feel threatened by someone else,<br>it\'s your responsibility to protect yourself and your family; it\'s not<br>their responsibility to assuage your fears. Time to grow up and learn to<br>defend yourself instead of waiting and hoping someone else will do it<br>for you.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-not-treat-guns-like-cars-i-e-why-not-license-gun-owners-register-the-guns-and-require-gun-owners-to-carry-insurance/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
