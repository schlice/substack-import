<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sure, sometimes this happens to me. It happened to me when I was much<br>younger, because I prayed for laser-beam eyes and I didn't get them. And<br>then it happened again when I was older, because I prayed for something<br>that I wanted, and I didn't get it.<br><br>Then I realized that both instances were the same. And the reason<br>was because I was praying for something that *I* wanted, not<br>necessarily praying for what God wanted for me.<br><br>You see, when you pray, God will respond with one of four possible<br>answers: No, Slow, Grow, or Go:<br><br>- No: What you're asking for isn't part of God's plan for your life.<br>- Slow: What you're asking for is part of God's plan for your life,<br>  but the time isn't right yet. Slow down, be patient. The time will<br>  come.<br>- Grow: What you're asking for is part of God's plan for your life,<br>  but you aren't ready yet. You need to grow more as a<br>  Christ-follower. Once you mature as a believer, you will be in a<br>  better position to get what you're asking for.<br>- Go: What you're asking for is part of God's plan for your life,<br>  and you are ready and the time is right. So go, you've got what<br>  you are asking for.<br><br>So I know that when I don't get what I want from a prayer, it must be<br>because:<br><br>1.  it's not part of God's plan for my life,<br>2.  it is part of His plan, but the timing isn't right, or<br>3.  it is part of His plan, but I'm not ready for it yet.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
