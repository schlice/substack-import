You are required to wear<br>seat belts when you drive a car; therefore (with a few limited<br>exceptions), you cannot drive a car with no seat belts.<br><br>However, as long as your car has seat belts, you can drive a car with no<br>airbags.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
