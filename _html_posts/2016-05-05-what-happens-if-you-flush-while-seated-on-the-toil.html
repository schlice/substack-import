<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Correct answer: nothing.<br><br>- The seat does not make a perfect seal. Even when you remove the shroud<br>  around the seat, you still can\'t get it to make a perfect seal.<br>- A properly working vacuum toilet only creates suction for a few<br>  seconds.<br>- The amount of suction it produces, 21 kPa or 3 psi, is not at all<br>  difficult for the human body to overcome.<br><br>So in an extraordinary and implausible set of circumstances (the seat<br>somehow makes a perfect seal with your butt, the vacuum pump fails and<br>produces 30 psi instead of 3, and the vacuum pump somehow gets stuck in<br>the on position), it is conceivable that you could be stuck to the seat.<br>But with modern vacuum toilets in good working order, nothing at all<br>will happen.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
