<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are many groups which oversee the police.<br><br>- To start with, a local police department works for the city. This<br>  oversight is generally accomplished by civilian oversight boards or<br>  committees appointed by City Council, or the Mayor. These boards will<br>  either review police internal investigation findings or will "sit in"<br>  on police review boards while they take place. Similarly, a local<br>  Sheriff's Department works for a county Board of Commissioners and is<br>  subject to similar civilian oversight<br>- The District Attorney is charged with investigating police conduct<br>  when allegations of criminal behavior are made. The DA is a lawyer who<br>  works for the state, not the police department. To be fair, the DA<br>  works closely with the police all the time, so he/she may be somewhat<br>  partial when doing investigations. They aren't supposed to be, but it<br>  happens.<br>- The public is constantly watching the police. As an officer, every<br>  time you step out of your car, you can rest assured that there is at<br>  least one camera phone videoing your every move, just hoping to catch<br>  you doing something illegal so they get their 15 minutes. Video is<br>  ubiquitous these days, so you must assume that your every move is<br>  being recorded by someone, and unless you want to become the subject<br>  of the next "viral video," you ought to check your actions.<br>- And while you may not think it to be right, the chain of command<br>  within the police department would like nothing better than to never<br>  see a reporter in front of their desk. To ensure this, they constantly<br>  review the actions of their officers to ensure compliance with<br>  department policy. Note that this is not technically violation of the<br>  law, but violating department policy can cost you your job.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
