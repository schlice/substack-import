<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**USA is a nation of laws, not a nation of men which meaning laws, not<br>people, rule. Everyone is to be governed by the same laws. If this is<br>true, why a pardon to convicted felons is consistent with a \'nation of<br>laws\'? Are we a nation of laws or men?**<br><br>> *\T\he pardon power, properly understood, is one of the great<br>> bulwarks of individual liberty. It is, in effect, the personification<br>> of the government acting as a check on the institutions of the<br>> government.*\[1\](#NbSgo){#cite-NbSgo .citation_link}<br><br>The pardon power, which is part of the Constitution, was instituted to<br>provide a final protection of individual liberty against an overzealous<br>government. It was borne out of the great fear and distrust the founders<br>had of organized government becoming too powerful.<br><br>Presidential pardons are primarily designed to "temper justice with<br>mercy." They are designed, and have historically been used, to right<br>perceived injustice and to provide mercy in the face of uncaring<br>justice.<br><br>However, the idea that we are no longer a nation of laws because we have<br>a safety valve against overzealous prosecution is untrue. Today, even<br>though the President has the final say, pardons are reviewed by the<br>Office of Pardons, an office in the Department of Justice. In most<br>cases, before a pardon would be considered, you must be convicted or<br>released for at least five years.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-NbSgo){.citation_index} [[A Federalist Conception of the<br>Pardon<br>Power](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0275ae&url=https://www.heritage.org/the-constitution/report/federalist-conception-the-pardon-power){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="heritage.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
