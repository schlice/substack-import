<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can an HOA require homeowners insurance?<br><br>There is a major difference here between homeowner's associations (HOA)<br>and Condominium Associations.<br><br>In HOAs, [[Mark<br>Stinson](https://www.quora.com/profile/Mark-Stinson-15)]{.qlink_container}<br>is spot on with his answer. HOAs can only do what is listed for them to<br>do in their governing documents. If their bylaws say that they will<br>monitor all homes and ensure that they all carry some form of<br>homeowner's insurance, then they will do just that.<br><br>So can they? If it's in their governing documents, sure they can.<br><br>But routinely, they do not. HOAs have two primary missions: keeping home<br>values as high as possible by maintaining the look-and-feel of the<br>neighborhood, and managing community property (clubhouses, swimming<br>pools, playgrounds, etc). That's it. Everything they do can (or should)<br>be traced back to one of these missions.<br><br>And in general, homeowner's insurance is between you and your lender.<br>There is little benefit to the neighborhood to you having homeowner's<br>insurance other than timeliness of home replacement.<br><br>But for condos, it's a whole other ballgame. Condos are heavily impacted<br>if you don't have homeowner's insurance and damage happens within your<br>condo which causes damages to your neighbors. You will need to be able<br>to pay for that damage that you cause to other property, and the Condo<br>Association can require you carry homeowner's insurance on your condo.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
