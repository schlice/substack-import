<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**When someone pulls a gun on a officer does the officer have to shoot<br>the suspect?**<br><br>The question has nothing to do with whether or not the victim of the<br>assault is a police officer.<br><br>Every American has the right to self-defense.<br><br>So the question is more appropriately written:<br><br>**When someone pulls a gun on an American citizen, does the American<br>citizen have to shoot the aggressor?**<br><br>So let's examine the situation.<br><br>You are faced with a life-and-death scenario. Someone has employed<br>lethal force against you. Your question: do you have to use lethal force<br>against them?<br><br>The answer: how badly do you want to live, and how assured do you want<br>to be that your actions will ensure your continued survival?<br><br>It sounds as though you are unconvinced that you are in an actual<br>life-and-death situation. You must be clear on this. This is one of<br>those "it's him or me" situations that you never hope to be a part of.<br><br>But if you are, you want to be assured that the method you employ will<br>bring you home alive.<br><br>The tool that provides you with the best possibility that you will make<br>it home alive is the firearm. No other tool provides you with the<br>immediate, pinpoint stopping power that a firearm does.<br><br>So to answer your question, in this scenario, when someone pulls a gun<br>on a officer does the officer have to shoot the suspect?<br><br>Given what we have discussed, yes. Not by law, or by department<br>policy, but *by right as an American citizen to self-defense.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
