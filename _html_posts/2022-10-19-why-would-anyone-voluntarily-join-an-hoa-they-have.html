<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do you always do or not do things based on their reputation alone? Sure,<br>there are indeed some problem HOAs out there. They've been thoroughly<br>mocked and derided sufficiently in the movies and on TV that people<br>recognize them and largely have corrected them.<br><br>Primarily, people don't like HOAs because 1. they don't like to be told<br>what to do and not do with their own homes, and 2. the HOA is empowered,<br>by you, to provide consequences for your actions, and people don't like<br>consequences for their actions.<br><br>Secondarily, the HOA is run by *people*. People are fallible. People<br>sometimes have different ideas about how to address issues. Some people<br>are just so weird when it comes to whether or not the HOA should issue a<br>fine. Some people never want to levy fines, and others are all too quick<br>to jump right to fines. Having smart leadership, and a good property<br>manager, are essential, and it is a rare combination when an HOA has<br>both.<br><br>In general, HOAs are beneficial, and help to keep neighborhoods looking<br>good. They also maintain the common areas that all homeowners in the<br>neighborhood enjoy.<br><br>\<br><br>Some HOAs are, indeed, voluntary, and you only join them if you want the<br>benefits they are offering (like club membership, etc). Other HOAs are<br>mandatory, and you automatically join them when you buy a house in a<br>particular neighborhood, as the HOA is attached to the house.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
