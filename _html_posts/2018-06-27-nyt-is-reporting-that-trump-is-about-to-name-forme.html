<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**NYT is reporting that Trump is about to name former Fox News executive<br>Bill Shine as his communications director. What changes do you see in<br>communications from the White House if he is named?**<br><br>What I would *like* to see is consistency in messaging.<br><br>I am hoping that a new communications director will set communications<br>policy and be consistent with it. If anyone goes on the air, they better<br>know what the actual policy is, and they better stick to it. The fact<br>that senior WH officials are going on air and inserting their size 12's<br>directly into their oral food cavity is disheartening at best, and is an<br>utter failure at worst. The way that the child separation issue was<br>handled was an unmitigated disaster, and a good part of that was a lack<br>of consistency in communications out of this White House.<br><br>I hope they can get their collective acts together.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
