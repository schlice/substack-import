The laws do not<br>*compel* you to help.<br><br>In fact, there are very few "duty to assist" laws in the United States<br>at all, and if they do exist, they are for very specific groups of<br>people, like doctors.<br><br>There are three other conditions, in common law, under which you have a<br>duty to help:<br><br>- You caused the peril<br>- You started assisting<br>- You have a special relationship with the person needing assistance<br>  (i.e. parent/child)<br><br>Beyond these three, generally speaking, there is no duty to assist.<br><br>There are a few state exceptions:<br><br>> 1.  *Wisconsin* \-- In Wisconsin, if you<br>>     [*know*(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=494971&url=https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/940/II/34){.external_link<br>>     rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>     onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>     qt-tooltip="wisconsin.gov"}]{.qlink_container}[ [that a crime is<br>>     being<br>>     committed](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=494971&url=https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/940/II/34){.external_link<br>>     rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>     onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>     qt-tooltip="wisconsin.gov"}]{.qlink_container}, and that a victim<br>>     has suffered or may suffer bodily harm, you have a duty to call<br>>     police or provide assistance<br>> 2.  *Minnesota \--* If you are at the scene of an emergency and you<br>>     know that someone has suffered grave physical harm, or could be<br>>     hurt, you have a duty to give \"reasonable assistance.\"<br>>     Reasonable assistance can mean [[calling or attempting to call<br>>     police](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=461dab&url=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id%3D604a.01){.external_link<br>>     rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>     onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>     qt-tooltip="mn.gov"}]{.qlink_container} or medical personnel.<br>> 3.  *Rhode Island \--* If you [[know that person is a victim of sexual<br>>     assault](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5ac9fe&url=http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/Statutes/title11/11-1/11-1-5.1.HTM){.external_link<br>>     rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>     onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>     qt-tooltip="state.ri.us"}]{.qlink_container}, murder,<br>>     manslaughter, or armed robbery and you were at the scene of the<br>>     crime, then you need to report the crime to law enforcement.<br>>     Failure to do so is punishable by up to six months in jail or a<br>>     fine of \$500 to \$1,000.<br>> 4.  *California -*- When you reasonably know or [[believe that a child<br>>     under 14 years of age has been a<br>>     victim](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d44810&url=https://codes.lp.findlaw.com/cacode/PEN/3/1/7/7/s152){.external_link<br>>     rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>     onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>     qt-tooltip="findlaw.com"}]{.qlink_container} of murder, rape, or<br>>     lewd and lascivious acts, you must notify law enforcement.
