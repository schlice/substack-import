And in a criminal case,<br>who is the "plaintiff?"<br><br>The answer: the state. The crime victim is not the plaintiff. So the<br>state does not become the victim's "public prosecutor" because the<br>victim is not the plaintiff. The people as a whole are the plaintiff.<br>The people are represented by the District Attorney's office.<br><br>In a civil matter, each party represents themselves, or has an attorney<br>to represent them (depending on the size of the claim). Under a certain<br>dollar amount, parties represent themselves in *small claims* court.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
