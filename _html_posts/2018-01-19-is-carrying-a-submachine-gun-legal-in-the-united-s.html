<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's look at the issues separately:<br><br>- Owning a machine gun<br>- Carrying a machine gun<br><br>Owning a machine gun. While automatic weapons are legal to own,<br>there are some strict rules regarding their purchase.<br><br>At the Federal level, no new automatic weapons can be registered to<br>civilians that have been manufactured since 1986. Only the military and<br>the police generally can possess new automatic weapons, which means they<br>are *insanely* expensive. For example, a new full-auto M-16 costs around<br>\$1100, while a full-auto *transferrable* M-16 costs anywhere from<br>\$11,000 to \$15,000. All of the automatic weapons which you can have<br>are already owned by someone. Therefore, in order to buy one, you need<br>to do a Federal automatic weapons transfer, which requires a full<br>background check (with fingerprinting), and a \$200 transfer fee. When<br>this fee is paid, you receive a "tax stamp" which must be affixed to the<br>Federal transfer paperwork and kept with the automatic weapon at all<br>times. BATFE rules require safe storage of the automatic weapon, and can<br>inspect your safe storage setup at any time.<br><br>In addition to the Federal transfer rules, every state is different when<br>it comes to ownership of automatic weapons. Generally, states follow the<br>Federal purchase rules, since they are already so strict, but states are<br>all different when it comes to whether or not you can even possess a<br>weapon that you may be legally allowed to purchase. Some states do not<br>allow their citizens to possess automatic weapons. Some states strictly<br>regulate private ownership, with chiefs of police or county sheriffs<br>being required to sign off on ownership paperwork, and each municipality<br>can have different ownership, transfer, and use rules. Still other<br>states leave the entire mess to the Feds (i.e. if you meet all of the<br>purchase requirements, you can own an automatic weapon).<br><br>Carrying a machine gun is also strictly regulated, assuming you have<br>legally acquired your automatic weapon. Most states do not allow open<br>carry of automatic weapons, especially the ones which strictly regulate<br>possession. Each state is different; however, so the answer about your<br>particular municipality is going to be specific to that area.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
