<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How was Lincoln able to suspend 'habeas corpus' if a right to trial is<br>guaranteed by the US Constitution?**<br><br>Article 1, Section 9 of the US Constitution states, \"The Privilege of<br>the Writ of *Habeas Corpus* shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases<br>of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\"<br><br>The incident in Baltimore, Marylad in 1861, at the start of the Civil<br>War, was the first time it was really used. At the beginning of the<br>Civil War, Washington DC was largely undefended. Rioters in Baltimore<br>were threatening to hold up the reinforcements to the capital by<br>disrupting rail service, and Congress was not in session.<br><br>Lincoln made the command decision to suspend habeas corpus between<br>Washington DC and Philadelphia.<br><br>Since the suspension generated a massive amount of controversy because<br>they believed that the Constitution was misapplied by Lincoln, Congress<br>passed the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act of 1863, fully authorizing the<br>president, "whenever in his judgment the public safety may require it,<br>\...\ to suspend the privilege of the writ of *habeas corpus* in any<br>case throughout the United States or any part thereof."<br><br>The declaration of martial law is generally recognized as a means by<br>which the president can suspend habeas corpus when necessary.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
