These records must be<br>maintained by the HOA and must be produced to an owner for review upon<br>demand. They can either be maintained in paper form within the community<br>where an owner may view and photocopy or photograph them, or they may be<br>supplied to parcel owners on a website where they can be viewed and<br>downloaded.<br><br>We are required to keep the following financial information:<br><br>> \(j\) The financial and accounting records of the association, kept<br>> according to good accounting practices. All financial and accounting<br>> records must be maintained for a period of at least 7 years.
