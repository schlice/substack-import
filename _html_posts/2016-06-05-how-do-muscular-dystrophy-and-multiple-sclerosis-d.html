<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Muscular dystrophy is a group of diseases that cause progressive<br>weakness and loss of muscle mass. In muscular dystrophy, abnormal genes<br>(mutations) interfere with the production of proteins needed to form<br>healthy muscle.<br><br>Certain genes are involved in making proteins that protect muscle fibers<br>from damage. Muscular dystrophy occurs when one of these genes is<br>defective. Each form of muscular dystrophy (there are several) is caused<br>by a *genetic mutation* particular to that type of the disease. Many of<br>these mutations are inherited. But some occur spontaneously in the<br>mother\'s egg or the developing embryo and can be passed on to the next<br>generation.\[1\](#rKeKZ){#cite-rKeKZ .citation_link}<br><br>Multiple Sclerosis is an autoimmune disease in which the body's<br>immune system attacks the myelin sheath surrounding nerve fibers within<br>the Central Nervous System (CNS). These areas of *demyelination* cause<br>decreased nerve signal transmission and thus cause the various symptoms<br>of MS. The most common symptoms are fatigue, visual issues, cognitive<br>issues, some movement disorder, and some bowel/bladder disorders.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-rKeKZ){.citation_index} [[Muscular<br>dystrophy](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=dc5d9e&url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/muscular-dystrophy/basics/definition/con-20021240){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="mayoclinic.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
