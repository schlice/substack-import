<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What happens to Trump if Roy Moore loses today's (December 12, 2017)<br>election?**<br><br>Absolutely nothing. The Alabama special election holds absolutely no<br>significance for Trump other than a purely psychological one. It's a<br>historically Republican seat; it would be tough to lose it to a<br>Democrat. Other than that, it holds no significance at all.<br><br>Would it change *anything* in Washington to have that seat flip to<br>Democrat? Nope. Doesn't change any balances of power. Doesn't derail any<br>plans that Congress had. Other than bolstering the Democrat playbook of<br>"impugn the character of your opponent rather than addressing actual<br>*issues,*" it has no effect at all.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
