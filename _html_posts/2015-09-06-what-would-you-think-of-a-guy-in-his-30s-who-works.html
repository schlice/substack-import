<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If he\'s caught sleeping in the closet during work,<br>I\'d say he either has a medical condition which prevents him from<br>sleeping soundly at night, or he\'s doing something at night which is<br>keeping him from sleeping. Perhaps he stays up late playing video games.<br>Perhaps he\'s a serial rapist. We\'ll never know until we see him on the<br>6 o\'clock news. But his employer might have a problem with him sleeping<br>on the job, and it might affect his potential for future employment at<br>that establishment.\<br>\<br>If he\'s caught sleeping in the closet before or after work,<br>there may be a situation that is preventing him from going home, or<br>preventing him from sleeping at home. It might be something that the<br>employer might have a problem with, or it might not. If no one is using<br>the closet after or before work, there may not be enough harm done to<br>pursue the matter.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
