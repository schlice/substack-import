<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is the law that<br>covers discrimination against people with disabilities in the United<br>States.\<br>\<br>In order to qualify as someone with a \"disability,\" you have to have a<br>disease or medical condition, or a physical or mental impairment, which<br>\"substantially limits one or more major life activities, has a record<br>of such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment.\"\<br>\<br>Any disease or condition which meets that standard is considered a<br>\"disability\" under ADA. There isn\'t a specific list of diseases or<br>conditions that are called out as \"covered\" or \"not covered.\"\<br>\<br>Under ADA, you cannot be questioned to determine if you actually have a<br>disability. For example, if Multiple Sclerosis causes muscle weakness,<br>and you claim muscle weakness because you have Multiple Sclerosis, you<br>cannot be tested to determine whether or not you have muscle weakness<br>before receiving benefits under ADA.\<br>\<br>In employment, an employer is allowed to ask you whether or not you can<br>perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable<br>accommodations. An employer is not allowed to discriminate against you<br>simply because you have a specific disease or condition. An employer is<br>allowed to test you to ensure you can perform the essential functions of<br>a job before you get the job, but if testing is done, then all new<br>applicants should be tested.\<br>\<br>You are also not required to disclose your disease or condition to your<br>employer if you do not need an accommodation. Your medical history and<br>current treatments are protected health information (PHI) and are only<br>allowed to be disclosed between you, your doctor, and your insurance<br>company.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
