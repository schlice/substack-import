<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The short answer is that it is illegal to point a gun at someone who you<br>do not intend to shoot. There are two crimes here: the criminal law at<br>question is called brandishing a weapon, and it attaches any time<br>you hold a weapon in a threatening manner, such that it can be brought<br>to bear against another person. The tort crime is assault, which is<br>differentiated from the crime of assault in that the tort assault can be<br>verbal or non-physical (or in this case, a simple assault with a<br>weapon), and in tort law, a battery is the physical execution of that<br>assault. A criminal assault involves physical attack.<br><br>To be legally compliant, you can answer the door with a holstered<br>pistol. You can answer the door with a slung shotgun or rifle (assuming<br>it is not slung across the chest and your hand is not resting near the<br>trigger). Anything else could be considered brandishing and is a crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
