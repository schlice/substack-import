<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My 13 year old is in the hospital after almost attempting suicide. He<br>didn't want me to tell his siblings (10,7) why he's in the hospital.<br>Should I tell them why?**<br><br>Perhaps you can use this opportunity to make a deal with him. You'll<br>promise to not tell his younger siblings why he's in the hospital if he<br>agrees to go to therapy with you.<br><br>You can simply tell the younger ones that he got hurt but he's going to<br>be okay. He's going to have to go visit the doctor for a while<br>afterwards, but it will all be fine. That's not technically a lie, but<br>it's also not the whole truth either. At this stage in their young<br>lives, their brains are not yet developed enough to understand the<br>nuances of what is happening, so I would consider it parental<br>prerogative to keep the details away from them. Save the whole truth for<br>later, but you will have to tell them at some point. Just not yet.<br><br>You probably should realize that kids, especially at this age, don't<br>just decide one day to commit suicide. You're going to need to prepare<br>yourself for a look in the mirror that I can guarantee you will at the<br>very least be uncomfortable, and at worst, will be quite disturbing. But<br>if you love your child (which I'm certain you do), you'll do the hard<br>work needed to remedy the underlying causes that are driving your<br>son to this line of action. There are underlying causes, and someone<br>other than him is part of the problem.<br><br>I know that's a lot to take in, especially while you have a child<br>recovering from an apparent suicide attempt. But think about it: he'd<br>rather end his life than reveal what is really going on. He must be so<br>scared inside. This revelation should steel you to resolve that issue,<br>sooner rather than later.<br><br>Love him, *forgive him,* and get him help.<br><br>I wish you all the best.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
