<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Clearly, an employee in one of the Justice's offices was the leaker.<br><br>I can't imagine that it would be one of the clerks, because clerking for<br>a SCOTUS Justice is a major feather in your cap; only the best of the<br>best can clerk for a SCOTUS Justice. This description of a SCOTUS<br>Justice clerk says it all:<br><br>> CLERKING at the Supreme Court of the United States is the holy grail,<br>> the most prestigious gig any law grad can get. Only 36 SCOTUS<br>> clerkships come up for grabs each year. Only the brightest and very,<br>> very best need apply. Over a thousand who consider themselves in this<br>> category (and have letters of introduction from distinguished law<br>> professors and others to back them up) do so every year. And you<br>> don\'t go to the Supreme Court straight from law school -- usually all<br>> successful candidates have previously clerked at federal appellate<br>> level, and wowed their judges there.<br>><br>> *"Nothing else short of being a judge will replicate this<br>> experience,"* one former SCOTUS clerk tells us of their year with a<br>> Justice. *"You see directly how things work, which completely changes<br>> the way you see cases."* \[1\](#oDEIO){#cite-oDEIO .citation_link}<br><br>Whoever this employee was, it's just odd that they allowed their<br>personal biases to overcome their respect for the institution, which<br>SCOTUS takes very seriously. Chief Justice Roberts discussed the loyalty<br>and respect for the institution shown by his permanent party staff:<br><br>> We at the court are blessed to have a workforce---permanent employees<br>> and law clerks who are intensely loyal to the institution and<br>> dedicated to the rule of law. Court employees have an exemplary and<br>> important tradition of respecting the confidentiality of the judicial<br>> process and upholding the trust of the<br>> Court.\[2\](#OFMgI){#cite-OFMgI .citation_link}<br><br>The Chief Justice announced that he has tasked the Marshal of the<br>Supreme Court to investigate the leak and find the leaker. It is unclear<br>what will happen to the leaker when they are found. Will they just be<br>fired? Will there be criminal charges? If they are an attorney, will<br>they be disbarred?
