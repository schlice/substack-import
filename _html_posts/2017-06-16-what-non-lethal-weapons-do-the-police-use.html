It is in a class of devices known as a<br>"pain compliance device" even though beyond the initial pain, it really<br>functions by disrupting nerve signals between the spinal cord and the<br>muscles, essentially "overloading" the nerves with electrical impulses,<br>and rendering the person incapable of moving. TASER is an acronym<br>invented by the device's inventor and his favorite comic book character,<br>Tom Swift. TASER stands for "Thomas A.
