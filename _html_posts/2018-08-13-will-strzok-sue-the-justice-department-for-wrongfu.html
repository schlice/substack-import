<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will Strzok sue the justice department for wrongful termination? Will<br>he win or lose if he does?**<br><br>He can try. But his *conduct*, as is clearly spelled out in the<br>Department of Justice's Inspector General report, does not present him<br>in the best light.<br><br>We knew since the DOJ filed its IG report on the Hillary investigation<br>that Strzok had some problems, saying that his text messages between<br>himself and his mistress, Lisa Page, "potentially indicated or created<br>the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or<br>improper considerations," and added that Strzok's behavior was "not only<br>indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a<br>willingness to take official action to impact the presidential<br>candidate's electoral prospects." The report found that Strzok's<br>decision to put the Russia probe ahead of the Hillary investigation<br>could have been tainted by the same bias. The report said, "Under these<br>circumstances, we did not have confidence that Strzok's decision to<br>prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the<br>Midyear-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was<br>free from bias." Finally, the investigation determined that **Strzok's<br>activities were "antithetical to the core values of the FBI and the<br>Department of Justice."**<br><br>It is statements like these which would lead any reasonable person to<br>believe that a termination was not only not wrongful, but nearly<br>required, especially from an agency which is supposed to engender public<br>trust.<br><br>The only thing that could work against the FBI is what is known as<br>"implied promises." According to the Washington Compost, the FBI's<br>disciplinary office had stated that Strzok was to receive a demotion and<br>a 60-day suspension. This could be perceived as an "implied promise"<br>that he was not to be terminated because of this incident. Following<br>this determination, the Deputy Director terminated him anyway.<br><br>Additionally, Strzok had been a longtime agent and did not have many<br>disciplinary actions against him, which could also have produced what is<br>known as an "implied employment contract."<br><br>Therefore, there may be a case for a wrongful termination suit, but that<br>IG report is so damning and speaks volumes against what a seasoned agent<br>*should be* doing, that it appears that Strzok violated any implied<br>employment contracts that may have been present, and because of this,<br>it's unlikely that a wrongful termination suit would be successful.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
