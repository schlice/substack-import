<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, the lawsuit against Remington brought by the Sandy Hook<br>parents was thrown out of court. Remington is in no way responsible for<br>what an insane person does with their firearms.<br><br>But that's not the same for cigarette manufacturers.<br><br>Those wonderful societal specimens not only *knew* that cigarette smoke<br>was toxic and dangerous, they *suppressed* that information, and they<br>actively marketed their death sticks to people, knowing full well that<br>cigarette smoke contained hundreds of known airborne toxins, and caused<br>all manner of illnesses, including cancer.<br><br>You can contact an attorney if you or a loved one suffered harm as a<br>result of exposure to cigarette smoke and you can individually file a<br>lawsuit against the tobacco company for compensation. Compensation may<br>be granted for any of the following types of losses:<br><br>- Emergency medical treatment;<br>- Other health care bills and expenses;<br>- Required medication or medical devices;<br>- Loss of current and future income;<br>- Pain and suffering;<br>- Permanent disability or disfigurement; and<br>- Wrongful death.<br><br>Contact an attorney in your jurisdiction who specializes in<br>tobacco-related claims to help you.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
