<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, the answer to all legal questions is "it depends," and in<br>this case, it depends on the age of the recipient and the jurisdictions<br>of the sender and the receiver. For this example, let's assume that the<br>participants are all adults over the age of consent and they are all<br>within the United States.<br><br>In most cases in most states, "sexting," or the act of sending explicit<br>text or photos between adults, is not illegal. However, if the recipient<br>is not willing to receive such photos, this could constitute harassment.<br>The sender could also be sued for causing emotional distress to another.<br>This is also commonly known as "revenge porn," especially if the subject<br>of the photos had no knowledge that the photos were being distributed.<br><br>Your future MIL can not only take him to court for causing emotional<br>distress, she could involve the police and pursue harassment charges. A<br>protective order is another route that can be taken to stop the<br>behavior, and violating the order is a crime in and of itself.<br><br>In any case, my best advice is to contact a qualified criminal defense<br>lawyer in your area. Your lawyer can help you file for a protective<br>order, and can help represent your interests to the police and in court<br>in support of a criminal case.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it illegal to send another person\'s nudes to your ex? Context: My<br>future mother-in-law has been receiving another woman\'s nudes from her<br>ex husband. She did NOT consent to receiving these pictures. Can she<br>take him to court?<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice. This answer is for GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.<br>Seek the advice of a licensed attorney in the appropriate jurisdiction<br>before taking any action that may affect your rights. If you believe you<br>have a claim against someone, consult an attorney immediately, otherwise<br>there is a risk that the time allotted to bring your claim may expire.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to legal questions are intended<br>third-party beneficiaries with certain rights under Quora's* [[*Terms of<br>Service*](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
