<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, fasting is a great way to focus our prayer life and to get closer<br>to God, but it does not necessarily get rid of Satan's attacks. That may<br>be a result of fasting, but it is not the only way to achieve freedom<br>from Satan's attacks.<br><br>Let's talk about Satan and how we can defend ourselves against his<br>attacks.<br><br>> and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who<br>> believe, according to the working of his great might that he worked in<br>> Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right<br>> hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and<br>> power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in<br>> this age but also in the one to come. And he put all things under his<br>> feet and gave him as head over all things to the church, \-- Ephesians<br>> 1:19--22 ESV<br><br>Paul says here that Jesus is seated at the right hand of God, the<br>ultimate seat of power and authority. Christ has dominion over<br>everything.<br><br>But check this out:<br><br>> and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly<br>> places in Christ Jesus, \-- Ephesians 2:6 ESV<br><br>*We* are seated *with Him in the heavenly places!* We are seated **far<br>above** Satan and the demons.<br><br>What does this mean? In short, we have power over the demons. As<br>adopted children of God, seated far above Satan in the heavenly places,<br>we have authority over the demons.<br><br>So how do we use this authority?<br><br>> Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee<br>> from you. \-- James 4:7 ESV<br><br>Submit to God and resist the devil. When you do this, he will flee from<br>you. As long as you are submitting to God when you resist Satan and his<br>minions, they have no choice but to flee from you.<br><br>Second, do not be afraid! In actuality, *it is Satan who is afraid!*<br>Satan and the demons are scared to death of Christians who understand<br>the magnitude of power and authority they have in Christ. In short,<br>Satan and the demons have no power over Christians except **what we give<br>them**. So don't give them any! Guard your mind, take every thought<br>captive, and focus on the truth.<br><br>How often do we have to do this? Do you have to keep checking every<br>thought and rebuking the enemy every minute of every day? Well, when you<br>walk in to a dark room, do you have to command the darkness to flee in<br>order to be able to see? No, you just turn on the light! So **don't<br>focus on the enemy; focus on the truth.** If you're a bank teller, you<br>don't recognize fake money by examining every example of fake money. You<br>recognize fake money because you have studied *the real thing*. Because<br>they know what the real thing looks like, they can spot the fake ones.<br>In the same way, our defense against Satan's attacks and false guidance<br>is *to know the truth*. Paul instructs us to focus on the truth:<br><br>> Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever<br>> is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is<br>> commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy<br>> of praise, think about these things. \-- Philippians 4:8 ESV<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
