<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Why bother with self-driving cars? Why not use satellites?<br>If we buy the correct time on a satellite, we can use the data real-time<br>as well. Add in some simple drones over a city (which can loiter for<br>days) and you have all the makings of an Orwellian police state.\<br>\<br>Besides the technical problems in a self-driving automobile, I think the<br>problem with this is that it would seem too Orwellian at some point. And<br>what infractions would you catch with this setup? You can\'t catch most<br>driving infractions because in most cases (except for speed), driving<br>infractions have to be seen by a law enforcement officer before a ticket<br>can be issued.\<br>\<br>And as [[Jacob<br>Thompson](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jacob-Thompson-9)]{.qlink_container}<br>said, part of the process of a police officer stopping you involves<br>education; learning the proper way to drive to keep everyone safe rather<br>than issuing a fine for the sake of collecting revenue with no real<br>lesson learned. It\'s best to catch and stop the illegal activity as<br>soon as it happens so that you can teach that lesson, provide that<br>education to the driver, not just issue a fine. If that\'s all we wanted<br>to do, we\'d have speed cameras and traffic enforcement cameras<br>everywhere, and you\'d never know you broke a law until you got a bill<br>in the mail. The \"man-in-the-middle\" should always be<br>there.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
