<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You've made an incredible amount of assumptions, including the fact that<br>the car "senses" that a "fatal" crash is about to occur.<br><br>This assumes:<br><br>1.  The vehicle is aware that it is about to be in a crash, which means<br>    that its driving algorithms which are designed to prevent crashes<br>    (by keeping appropriate speed and distances) has failed, or<br>2.  The vehicle is about to be struck in an unavoidable way by another<br>    vehicle and this was not caused by any fault in its programming.<br><br>The problem here is that you assume that **the vehicle is aware that it<br>is about to be involved in an accident, and the vehicle can do<br>something about that knowledge.**<br><br>I submit that vehicles will never evolve (in our lifetime) to the point<br>where they know that they are about to be in an accident. I would also<br>submit that a vehicle will never be able to determine whether or not a<br>crash is about to be a "fatal" one.<br><br>But even if they do, I think their default mode of operation will be<br>emergency braking. If they are hit at that point, they will simply<br>protect their occupants as best as possible, which is also how they were<br>designed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
