<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [No, that\'s an *expression*, not a statement of fact, and<br>certainly not a predictor of the future.\<br>\<br>And it\'s not even the right expression. The original expression is<br>\"Live by the sword, die by the sword.\" It came from the Bible (Matthew<br>26:52 - \"Put your sword back in its place,\" Jesus said to him, \"for<br>all who draw the sword will die by the sword.\"). It basically is a<br>teaching which says that if you seek to use violence against people, you<br>can expect that the same methods will be used against you.\<br>\<br>But if you\'re going to use Biblical references, then understand that<br>the Bible teaches that there are appropriate times and places to use<br>force. Defending your family and defending your home, for example, are<br>called out specifically as areas in which it is acceptable to use<br>force.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
