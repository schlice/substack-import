<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Relativism is the belief that all of our beliefs are relative to<br>ourselves (or provisional). But Relativism suffers from one fatal flaw,<br>which can be defeated using a technique Geisler and Turek call the *Road<br>Runner Tactic*.<br><br>Do you remember watching the old Road Runner cartoons where Wile E.<br>Coyote would be tricked into running off of a cliff? He kinda hung there<br>in mid-air until he realized that he was not, in fact, standing on solid<br>ground. And then he broke the fourth wall, looking at the viewer in<br>sudden recognition of his predicament, and sometimes holding up a little<br>sign that said something pithy like "oops" or "bye-bye" and *then* he<br>fell down, crashing in a heap to the ground.<br><br>Similar to Wile E. Coyote, relativism's arguments can't sustain their<br>own weight, and when they realize the flaw in their arguments, they too<br>crash into the ground in a heap.<br><br>In this case, you made the statement that "all our beliefs are<br>ultimately provisional," or said another way, "all our beliefs are<br>relative."<br><br>To this, I ask you the one question that the Road Runner would ask to<br>show Wile E. Coyote that he was actually hanging in mid-air:<br><br>***"Is that statement, that all our beliefs are relative, a relative<br>statement?"***<br><br>Said another way, is that statement, that all truth is relative, a<br>statement of absolute truth? Aren't you saying that "It is absolutely<br>true that all truth is relative?" Because if all truth is relative, then<br>the statement that "all truth is relative" *is also relative*. Which<br>means that all truth *might* be relative, or all truth *might* be true.<br>By that definition alone, you can see that the statement that "all truth<br>is relative" is a false statement.<br><br>This statement is what we call self-defeating because by its own<br>definition, it causes itself to be untrue.<br><br>But if you still believe that all truth is relative, I have a few<br>additional questions for you. Why should we learn anything at all? Why<br>should any student listen to any teacher, much less pay to go to college<br>to do so? If every professor teaches things that are only relative<br>truths, why should we listen? In fact, why should we listen to the<br>professor at all when he or she doesn't have the truth? And what's the<br>point of obeying the professor's moral rules about cheating on tests or<br>plagiarizing term papers? It's all relative!<br><br>C. S. Lewis talked about what it means to expect virtue from people who<br>are taught that no virtue exists:<br><br>> *In a sort of ghastly simplicity we remove the organ and demand the<br>> function. We make men without chests and expect of them virtue and<br>> enterprise. We laugh at honor and are shocked to find traitors in our<br>> midst. We castrate and bid the geldings to be<br>> fruitful.*\[1\](#qfuFU){#cite-qfuFU .citation_link}<br><br>The truth is that truth exists, and it can be known. False ideas about<br>truth lead to false ideas about life. And if you can kill the concept of<br>truth, you can kill the concept of any true morality. Our society has<br>been trending in this direction for many years, and the fruits of their<br>efforts are not just true for them, but for all of us.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-qfuFU){.citation_index} [[Why Should Anyone Believe<br>Anything at All?: Sire, James W.: 9780830813971: Amazon.com:<br>Books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=abb77d&url=https://www.amazon.com/Why-Should-Anyone-Believe-Anything/dp/0830813977){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
