<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It depends on the benefit they are getting, and the particular felony<br>for which the Veteran is incarcerated.<br><br>> Disability Compensation<br>><br>> VA disability compensation payments are reduced if a Veteran is<br>> convicted of a felony and imprisoned for more than 60 days. Veterans<br>> rated 20 percent or more are limited to the 10 percent disability<br>> rate. For a Veteran whose disability rating is 10 percent, the payment<br>> is reduced by one-half. Once a Veteran is released from prison,<br>> compensation payments may be reinstated based upon the severity of the<br>> service connected disability(ies) at that time. Payments are not<br>> reduced for recipients participating in work release programs,<br>> residing in halfway houses (also known as \"residential re-entry<br>> centers\"), or under community control. The amount of any increased<br>> compensation awarded to an incarcerated Veteran that results from<br>> other than a statutory rate increase may be subject to reduction due<br>> to incarceration.<br>><br>> Pension<br>><br>> Veterans in receipt of VA pension will have payments terminated<br>> effective the 61st day after imprisonment in a Federal, State, or<br>> local penal institution for conviction of a felony or misdemeanor.<br>> Payments may be resumed upon release from prison if the Veteran meets<br>> VA eligibility requirements. Failure to notify VA of a Veteran\'s<br>> incarceration could result in the loss of all financial benefits until<br>> the overpayment is recovered.<br>><br>> Apportionment to Spouse or Children<br>><br>> All or part of the compensation not paid to an incarcerated Veteran<br>> may be apportioned to the Veteran\'s spouse, child or children, and<br>> dependent parents on the basis of individual need. In determining<br>> individual need, consideration shall be given to such factors as the<br>> claimant\'s income and living expenses, the amount of compensation<br>> available to be apportioned, the needs and living expenses of other<br>> claimants as well as any special needs, if any, of all claimants.<br>><br>> Additional Information:<br>><br>> - VA will inform a Veteran whose benefits are subject to reduction of<br>>   the right of the Veteran\'s dependents to an apportionment while the<br>>   Veteran is incarcerated, and the conditions under which payments to<br>>   the Veteran may be resumed upon release from incarceration.<br>> - VA will also notify the dependents of their right to an<br>>   apportionment if the VA is aware of their existence and can obtain<br>>   their addresses.<br>> - No apportionment may be made to or on behalf of any person who is<br>>   incarcerated in a Federal, State, or local penal institution for<br>>   conviction of a felony.<br>> - An apportionment of an incarcerated Veteran\'s VA benefits is not<br>>   granted automatically to the Veteran\'s dependents. The dependent(s)<br>>   must file a claim for an apportionment.<br>><br>> Education Benefits<br>><br>> Beneficiaries incarcerated for other than a felony can receive full<br>> monthly benefits, if otherwise entitled. Convicted felons residing in<br>> halfway houses (also known as \"residential re-entry centers\"), or<br>> participating in work-release programs also can receive full monthly<br>> benefits.<br>><br>> Claimants incarcerated for a felony conviction can be paid only the<br>> costs of tuition, fees, and necessary books, equipment, and supplies.<br>> VA cannot make payments for tuition, fees, books, equipment, or<br>> supplies if another Federal State or local program pays these costs in<br>> full.<br>><br>> If another government program pays only a part of the cost of tuition,<br>> fees, books, equipment, or supplies, VA can authorize the incarcerated<br>> claimant payment for the remaining part of the<br>> costs.\[1\](#cFehU){#cite-cFehU .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-cFehU){.citation_index} [[Incarcerated<br>Veterans](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fa1490&url=http://www.benefits.va.gov/persona/veteran-incarcerated.asp){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="va.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
