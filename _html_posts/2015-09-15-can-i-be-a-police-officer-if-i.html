<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In most departments, this is allowed. However, if you are<br>looking at joining a police department while taking antidepressants,<br>make sure you are *completely honest* with the department about all<br>medications you are taking. Make sure that when you do your psych eval,<br>you talk to the doctor *at length* about why you\'re on<br>antidepressants, what led you to using them, and if your condition is<br>well-controlled on those medications.\<br>\<br>I can tell you from personal experience with this process that it is<br>permitted as long as the condition is well managed by a doctor and the<br>condition is well controlled while using the medication. The department<br>will want proof of this, of course, but it is allowed.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
