<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why is background check not effective to gun control in the US?<br><br>Because they are not gun control. They were never intended as gun<br>control. They were intended to prevent known felons and mental<br>defectives from buying firearms. That's it. That's literally all they<br>do. They check to see if you are a known felon, or if you have ever been<br>adjudicated as a mental defective by a competent court of law.<br><br>Background checks are not a "predictor" of potential future bad<br>behavior. They keep legal guns out of the hands of known criminals, but<br>they do nothing to stop someone who has never previously committed a<br>crime (or more accurately, previously been caught committing a crime)<br>from using that newly-purchased firearm to commit a crime.<br><br>Also, when the NICS system was built out, in order to allow it to be<br>accessible to every American transferring a firearm from one person to<br>another, the price to size the system that large would have been<br>astronomical at the time. So a compromise was reached. NICS would only<br>be used by people "engaged in the business" of buying and selling<br>firearms; private sales between individuals would be exempted from the<br>background check requirement. While some states have since mandated that<br>all firearms transfers have a background check be performed by a<br>licensed FFL prior to the sale/transfer (and those states have found<br>that system to be mostly unworkable from both a legal perspective and an<br>enforcement perspective), at the federal level, private sales do not<br>require background checks.<br><br>So background checks, in their current form, only prevent sales of<br>firearms *from a dealer* to *prohibited persons*. They do nothing to<br>deter future crime. They do not prevent a person who was previously not<br>a felon from becoming a felon. And they do nothing when it comes to<br>private sales, because in most cases, they are not required for private<br>sales.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
