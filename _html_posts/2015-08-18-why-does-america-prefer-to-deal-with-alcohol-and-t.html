<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There is no logic or reason to it. There is no argument<br>that can be made that shows that alcohol somehow has some social benefit<br>that guns don\'t have. It doesn\'t. My right to own a gun allows me to<br>protect myself from other people with guns. My right to own a beer<br>doesn\'t protect me from drunk drivers.\<br>\<br>Therefore, any logical thought would lead you to the truth that before<br>any serious discussion of any partial or full ban on guns, you should<br>first completely ban alcohol. Critics will point to Prohibition, citing<br>exactly how poorly it worked, increasing black markets and enabling<br>crime, ***but they ignore the fact that a ban on guns will do exactly<br>the same thing.*** See, guns will never ever go away. And there are 300<br>million of them in the United States.\<br>\<br>What\'s that? Buyback, you say? Even if you gave me WAY under market<br>value for my gun (i.e. a \$50 gift card for every gun I turn in), with<br>300 million guns in circulation, that\'s \$15 Billion. Where exactly do<br>you think we\'re going to come up with \$15 Billion? Once you repeal the<br>monstrosity that is Obamacare, we might have enough money to buy back<br>all the guns.\<br>\<br>Logically, if you\'re going to trust Americans with the responsibility<br>to purchase and use a dangerous item, it stands to reason that you<br>should also trust them enough to purchase a *less* dangerous item,<br>especially when the right to own the less dangerous item is protected by<br>the Constitution.\<br>\<br>If you\'re going to remove one of two dangerous items from the American<br>people, it only stands to reason that you would remove the one that is,<br>far and away, more dangerous and destructive than one that is less<br>dangerous and destructive.\<br>\<br>We all logically know that alcohol is far more dangerous than guns will<br>ever be, and no amount of statistical wrangling will ever make it seem<br>any less so. So why then do we insist on this silliness of trying to<br>implement a partial or a complete ban on guns? It simply comes down to<br>this: \"I like alcohol, but I don\'t like guns.\" There is no argument<br>that you can make for banning guns that isn\'t equally or better applied<br>to banning alcohol.\<br>\<br>Don\'t get me wrong, I don\'t think there should be a return to<br>Prohibition. I just want people to see that some of their political<br>views may be quite contradictory.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
