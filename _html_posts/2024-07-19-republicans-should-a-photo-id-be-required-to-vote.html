<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Unless there is another way to *conveniently* prove that you are a<br>citizen of the United States AND you are registered to vote in that<br>precinct, then government-issued photo ID is usually the most convenient<br>way to do so.<br><br>Remember the goal here: we want to ensure that elections remain free and<br>fair, but we also want to ensure that *only* the people who are<br>registered in that precinct, and who are actual citizens of the United<br>States, may vote in that election.<br><br>I think calls for allowing anyone, even those without photo ID, are<br>mostly an affront to women.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Women fought for a very long time in a movement called the *suffrage<br>movement.* This was a decades-long movement in the United States to give<br>women the right to vote. According to the National Archives, "several<br>generations of woman suffrage supporters lectured, wrote, marched,<br>lobbied, and practiced civil disobedience to achieve what many Americans<br>considered a radical change in the Constitution -- guaranteeing women<br>the right to vote."\[1\](#suwQR){#cite-suwQR .citation_link}<br><br>And today, modern-day Democrats want to *cheapen* that effort by<br>allowing *anyone* to vote, without even proving that they are a citizen<br>of the United States? Women should be insulted by such calls. They<br>fought *hard* to earn the right to vote, and for what? For Democrats to<br>summarily declare that the fight was for naught, because now you don't<br>even have to prove you are a citizen to vote in our elections?<br><br>We are watching Democrats attempt to radically re-make this country into<br>something it was never intended to be. And if we do not push back, we<br>will lose whatever gains have been made over the last hundred years or<br>so.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-suwQR){.citation_index} [[Woman Suffrage and the 19th<br>Amendment](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6c6836&url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/woman-suffrage){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="archives.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
