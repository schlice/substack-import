<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm a conservative.<br><br>There are indeed bad cops. I have admitted this many times in this<br>platform. Cops come from society, and society has all kinds. They try to<br>weed out the bad ones, but sometimes they slip through.

I hope this answers your question.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
