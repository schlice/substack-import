One is a citizens arrest, and the other<br>is unlawful detention.<br><br>Can you detain a most wanted fugitive and hold them for the police?<br><br>No. Citizens arrest is a very specific function which varies by<br>state. Almost universally though, you can only effect it when someone<br>perpetrates a crime in your presence.<br><br>Detaining anyone without special provision to do so in the law is a<br>crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
