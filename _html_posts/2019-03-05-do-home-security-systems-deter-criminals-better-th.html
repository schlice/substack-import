<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do home security systems deter criminals better than firearms? Or are<br>they different solutions to different problems?**<br><br>Different solutions to different problems.<br><br>Home security systems make your home less attractive to burglars. If a<br>burglar is comparing two houses, and one has a security system, he'll<br>choose to break into the house without the security system. It simply is<br>one of several steps you can take to make your house less attractive to<br>burglars than your neighbor's house. As we've said before, you don't<br>have to make your house a fortress; you only have to make your house<br>less attractive to attack than your neighbor's house.<br><br>Firearms are not a deterrent to criminals, so they definitely are<br>addressing a different problem. The problem that firearms addresses is<br>the one that causes you to die as a victim inside your home from home<br>invaders who seek to kill you. Firearms do not make your home less<br>attractive to criminals who wish to break into a home (there's nothing<br>on the outside of your home that advertises that you're armed). Firearms<br>are your last line of defense when someone breaks into your home and<br>intends to harm you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
