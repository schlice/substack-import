<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can crimes you commit as a minor affect you being able to purchase a<br>gun?**<br><br>The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends."<br><br>Each state is different when it comes to the handling of juvenile court<br>records. Some states automatically seal juvenile records when the<br>juvenile reaches a certain age, and other states require the juvenile to<br>petition the court to seal the records.<br><br>Some states will not seal records of juveniles who have committed<br>certain crimes, such as anything which would be a felony in the adult<br>justice system, and still other states will not seal former juvenile<br>records if the now-adult has a history of continued criminal activity.<br>Finally, not all states consider "juvenile felonies" a thing, as not all<br>states consider crimes which *could have been* prosecuted as felonies as<br>an adult as a crime for a juvenile.<br><br>So, to summarize all the possibilities:<br><br>- *If* you committed a crime as a juvenile, and<br>- *if* that crime would have been prosecuted as a felony in adult<br>  courts, and<br>- *if* the state in which you committed the crime judges "juvenile<br>  felonies" to be a prohibited category, and<br>- *if* your records could not be sealed because of state law, or your<br>  records were not sealed before you attempted to purchase a gun,<br>- ...*then* it is possible that your juvenile crime could generate a<br>  "deny" on a NICS check.<br><br>Off the top of my head, the only state I know of which even looks at<br>"juvenile felonies" is Virginia\[1\](#ZKJcB){#cite-ZKJcB<br>.citation_link}, but I could be mistaken about that.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ZKJcB){.citation_index}<br>[https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/6\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=817f4e&url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/694290.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gao.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
