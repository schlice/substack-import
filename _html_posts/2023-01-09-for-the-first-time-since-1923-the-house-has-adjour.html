<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, everyone has been in full-on panic mode because the House adjourned<br>without a speaker. But finally though, Kevin McCarthy was elected<br>Speaker of the House.<br><br>No, the process to elect a new Speaker was not easy. But nothing<br>worthwhile ever is.<br><br>Some people are saying that this weakened the Republican party, or that<br>this weakened the Speaker. I disagree. McCarthy proved that he is<br>strong. He proved that he is capable of listening and compromise, and<br>capable of the change that America deserves. Ultimately, the House<br>Freedom Caucus, and McCarthy himself, emerge strong.<br><br>This process may have been strange, and perhaps a bit worrying, for<br>some. But I submit to you that this is ***exactly what good government<br>looks like***. It's *open debate* and *working towards compromise*. That<br>sort of debate has been absent from the floor of the House for the past<br>six years. Former Rep. Jodi Hice said in an interview that most of his<br>colleagues have never seen Congress "operate the way it was intended to<br>operate." "People need to be aware," he said, "it's been over six years<br>since members of Congress have been allowed to offer an amendment to the<br>bill on the floor of the House of Representatives. And many who are<br>serving in Congress right now have never known any other system than<br>that which currently exists, where deals are made in backrooms and then<br>bills just dropped on the floor, and you're expected to vote on it right<br>away."<br><br>Tony Perkins, head of the Family Research Council, summed it up this<br>way: "The reality is, the transference of power, like every issue<br>confronting Congress, was never meant to be predetermined by a powerful<br>few. It was meant to be --- as all governing was meant to be --- a<br>dynamic process where everyone has a voice. And yet Americans have grown<br>so accustomed to things being forced upon us that when we actually see<br>the process functioning as it should, we<br>panic."\[1\](#uzSAR){#cite-uzSAR .citation_link}<br><br>Ultimately, if anyone lost in all of this, it's the Left. The days of<br>backroom deals and snap votes on the House floor are all but over. Let's<br>get back to open debate. Let's get back to giving Representatives a<br>chance to read bills before they must vote on them. Let's get back to<br>some form of good governance, something we haven't seen in years.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-uzSAR){.citation_index} [[PERKINS: In McCarthy Victory,<br>Everyone's a Winner - Except the<br>Left](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=414131&url=https://washingtonstand.com/commentary/perkins-in-mccarthy-victory-everyones-a-winner--except-the-left-){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="washingtonstand.com"}<br>]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
