<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What will the (legal) impact on Trump be, should it be found that his<br>Stormy Daniels payments are in contravention of campaign financing laws<br>and that the payments were made under his direction? Other than<br>impeachment, what is the penalty?**<br><br>*If* they find that the payments violated campaign finance law, the<br>campaign gets fined.<br><br>However, campaign finance law is tricky. *Even if* he did make the<br>payment to her, the courts would have to determine whether or not there<br>was any non-political reason for him to make that payment. In other<br>words, would he have made the payment if he was not a candidate?<br><br>Trump's history of paying off the women with whom he's had affairs<br>should speak volumes about the fact that he most definitely would have<br>made the payment even if he was not a candidate.<br><br>Trump can even go so far as to claim that he had *both* reasons in mind:<br>personal and political. Trump does not have to deny that politics played<br>some part in the decision to pay. Clearly, if he had not paid, the press<br>would have been all over it, and it would have compounded the personal<br>and business issues that the revelation would have brought. So having<br>both interests in mind when he made the payment is enough to make the<br>payment not a campaign finance violation.<br><br>As far as I know, campaign finance laws are not criminal charges; no one<br>gets arrested for violating them. Obama's campaign was found to have<br>violated campaign finance laws and they were fined.<br><br>In and of itself, violating a campaign finance law doesn't rise to the<br>level of "high crimes and misdemeanors," but we know that this is all up<br>to Congress. If the Democrats win the House back in November, violating<br>campaign finance laws *will* rise to that level, and they will impeach<br>him for it. The Senate will not vote to remove him from office, and life<br>will go on. The only thing that this will do will be to weaken the power<br>of the impeachment, making it little more than a glorified censure. It's<br>odd: Democrats know that impeachment would be a Pyrrhic victory, yet<br>they doggedly pursue it anyway.<br><br>Oh, and I hate to mention the elephant in the room: *none of this has<br>anything whatsoever to do with Russian collusion, which is what Mueller<br>was supposedly investigating in the first place.*<br><br>We can only hope that impeachment and non-removal will be the end of<br>this circus, but I suspect that even that won't end the controversy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
