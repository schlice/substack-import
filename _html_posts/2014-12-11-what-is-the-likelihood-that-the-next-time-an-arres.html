<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Not very likely. Because logically it makes no sense.\<br>\<br>Being a parent, have you ever seen your children choking on something?<br>It can go one of two ways:\<br>\<br>- COUGH, COUGH, COUGH, \<raspy breath\>, COUGH, COUGH, COUGH, \<raspy<br>breath\> COUGH\<br>\<br>or\<br>\<br>- silence.\<br>\<br>Which one is more troublesome? The silence is far more troublesome than<br>the loud coughing. Coughing means that they are breathing. Little<br>intervention is necessary. Silence means they are getting no air. Swift<br>intervention is necessary to preserve life.\<br>\<br>Same holds true for someone who says \"I can\'t breathe.\" Somehow,<br>they are getting air to make words. The simple fact that they are<br>speaking belies their actual words. In order to speak, you need to<br>breathe. They may not be able to breathe *well*, but they can, in<br>fact, breathe.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
