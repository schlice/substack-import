<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it possible to hack an iPhone to make some minor changes for<br>personal use?**<br><br>Yes, it's called "jailbreaking" your iPhone. There is at least one<br>jailbreak that I know of that works on current iPhones:<br><br>[unc0ver(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=214447&url=https://unc0ver.dev/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="unc0ver.dev"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Do keep in mind: **jailbreaking your iPhone, while not illegal, will<br>void your warranty.** So if you are still within your one-year warranty<br>period, don't do this. Also, loading Apple-unapproved software opens you<br>up to the possibility of<br><br>- damaged hardware<br>- security holes which could expose your personal data<br>- data unavailable or data loss<br><br>Don't jailbreak your phone unless you know what you're doing. You risk<br>"bricking" your phone (i.e. turning it from a phone to a "brick").<br><br>OK, now with the official warnings out of the way, there's your answer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
