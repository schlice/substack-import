<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Which laws are being violated by the current House impeachment<br>proceedings? Can you cite them?**<br><br>No laws are being violated. The House is free to conduct investigations<br>as it sees fit. They don't need any investigations *at all*; they can<br>simply bring Articles of Impeachment to the floor and vote on them and<br>pass them on a party-line vote. The Constitution imposes no restrictions<br>on how the House conducts impeachment inquiries, or even whether or not<br>an inquiry needs to take place *at all*.<br><br>That said, actions have consequences.<br><br>If we were to compare how this House is conducing this impeachment<br>inquiry as opposed to how other Houses have conducted impeachment<br>inquiries, we would find some interesting contrasts. The investigation<br>prior to Nixon's investigation was undertaken by the Senate Watergate<br>Committee, which was bipartisan, and all members had equal authority.<br>The Clinton impeachment was undertaken after Independent Counsel Ken<br>Starr released his report which was originally surrounding the<br>Whitewater scandal.<br><br>In this case, there was no special investigative committee formed. There<br>was no Independent Counsel (unless you count Special Counsel Robert<br>Mueller's investigation into the Russia collusion hoax). In this case,<br>House subcommittes are using their oversight power to attempt to run an<br>impeachment inquiry, which is of questionable legal status anyway,<br>despite the fact that a lower court has upheld some of the subpoenas<br>already (currently subject to appeal). The functioning of a subcommittee<br>investigation is not the same as a special committee investigation. It<br>does not allow bipartisan participation in the investigative process,<br>even though members from both parties are seated on the committee. In<br>this way, Speaker Pelosi can claim that the investigation was<br>"bipartisan" without stating the full truth that the investigation was<br>actually quite partisan in its function.<br><br>The rules for which the House voted last week are surprisingly different<br>than any other impeachment inquiry that has ever been undertaken by a<br>House. Among other procedural irregularities, they allow evidence to be<br>suppressed by the Committee chair. Republicans wanted to see some<br>semblance of a "fair and equitable process" laid out, and they believe<br>there wasn't one. Besides, since only a simple majority is needed to<br>pass both the procedural vote and Articles of Impeachment, Republicans<br>instead used the occasion to vote *en masse* and signal their<br>disapproval of impeachment in general, and this motion in specific.<br><br>The only consequence to impeachment: each Member must go on record as to<br>whether or not they approve of Articles of Impeachment and they will be<br>judged by that vote. And there are several Democrats who won in 2018 in<br>districts carried by the President during the general election in 2016.<br>These Democrats are going to have to do some soul searching before they<br>vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry, and they're going to have to<br>think how that vote will play in a majority Trump voting district back<br>home. Voters have shown that they will hold Members accountable for<br>their actions while in Congress, and many Americans are upset that other<br>legislative priorities are being ignored, such as voting on the<br>replacement for NAFTA (yet another one that those same Democrats are<br>going to pay for if they vote against).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
