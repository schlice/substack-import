<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can I convince my HOA to allow me to make an extension to my<br>residence driveway to accommodate for a wheelchair for my wife? They<br>denied my request.**<br><br>Let them know that Federal law already allows you to extend your<br>driveway to make it accessible for a wheelchair and an HOA rule<br>preventing this is in violation of Federal law. You were simply advising<br>the HOA that you were making these changes, not seeking their approval.<br><br>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Title II of the Americans<br>with Disabilities Act, and the Architectural Barriers Act all mandate<br>accessibility standards for those in wheelchairs. Local ordinances<br>(including HOA architectural rules) cannot limit what Federal law<br>allows. They can make it *more* accessible, not *less.*<br><br>That said, there are some changes they *can* mandate. For example, they<br>can tell you that if you have two entrances to your house (a garage<br>entrance and a front entrance) you have to put the ramp on the garage<br>entrance. That would be a restriction they can make since you have two<br>front-of-house entrances.<br><br>Unless they can show that your driveway is already accessible enough for<br>a wheelchair, they can't deny your change. If your driveway, for<br>example, is wide enough for two cars, they can deny your request and say<br>that your driveway is already wide enough to accommodate one car and a<br>wheelchair load/unload zone; you don't have to be accommodated in order<br>to fit two cars side by side as well as loading/unloading space for a<br>chair.<br><br>However if you only have a single-car driveway, you can extend it to add<br>a loading/unloading pad for the wheelchair.<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice.
