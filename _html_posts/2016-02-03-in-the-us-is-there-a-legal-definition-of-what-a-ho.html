<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Federal law defines animals broadly, such as defining what an \"exotic\"<br>animal is, what a \"domesticated\" animal is, etc. It provides import<br>restrictions on certain exotic animals, but other than that, there is no<br>broad set of restrictions on any animal in the United States, it is left<br>to the states and to cities.<br><br>States and cities define what animals can be licensed in those<br>jurisdictions as household pets. This varies between jurisdictions, but<br>all states allow the most common household pets: dogs, cats, birds, and<br>small mammals (guinea pigs, hamsters, etc). Other less-common pets are<br>less well standardized between states.<br><br>Often, homeowner\'s associations (HOAs) define further what types and<br>quantities of domesticated animals may reside within their<br>jurisdictions. This sometimes poses conflicts when less-common pets<br>become more common or more acceptable as pets (for example, pot-bellied<br>pigs).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
