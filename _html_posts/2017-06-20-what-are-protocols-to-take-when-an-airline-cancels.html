<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There aren't any protocols to follow. There are simply a few things to<br>know.<br><br>The most important thing to find out is *why* the flight was<br>cancelled. There is only one distinction you need to worry about:<br>whether or not the cancellation was within the control of the airline.<br><br>If your flight was cancelled because of weather, natural disaster,<br>unnatural disaster, crew delayed because of weather, or *any other<br>reason outside of the control of the airline*, you're at the mercy of<br>the airline when it comes to getting to your destination. They will get<br>you there, but it will be on their terms, on their schedule. And in such<br>a case, if the next available flight is the next day, don't expect the<br>airline to put you up in a hotel or pay for your meals.<br><br>If your flight was cancelled because a scheduled crew didn't show up, or<br>because of a crew mix-up, or because of a mechanical failure, or *any<br>other reason within the control of the airline*, you are covered. The<br>airline will try to get you on the next available flight which still has<br>seats available. If the next available flight is the next day, they will<br>pay for a hotel room and pay for your meals while you wait.<br>Alternatively, under "Rule 240," you can have your ticket switched to an<br>airline which *does* have flights with available seats which will reach<br>your destination before your carrier can get you there.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
