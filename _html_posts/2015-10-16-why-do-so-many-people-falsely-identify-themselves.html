<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Because so many people *want* to be N, whether or not they<br>actually are. It\'s because they believe ***one is better than the<br>other***, which is simply not true.\<br>\<br>Your personality type is what it is. I\'m an S. It doesn\'t make me an<br>ignoramous. It makes me an engineer. And a good one.\<br>\<br>My spouse is an N. A solid N.\<br>\<br>We work well together because her strengths are my weaknesses, and vice<br>versa. She relies on me for certain things (mostly technical), and I<br>rely on her for many others (like being able to \"read\" people, which<br>she absolutely excels at). I think I\'m getting the better end of the<br>deal. And I will spend the rest of my life thanking her for<br>that.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
