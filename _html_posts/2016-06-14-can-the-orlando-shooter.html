<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is nothing more than fluff news and sensationalist, sloppy<br>reporting.<br><br>> \"It is a possibility that the wife of Orlando shooter, Noor Salman,<br>> could be charged in connection with the attack at Pulse nightclub\"<br>> because she failed to tell police about her husband\'s plans, NBC<br>> investigative reporter Tom Winter said.<br><br>This statement is patently false.<br><br>There is no affirmative duty to report in the United States. You can<br>know of a crime and do nothing about it, and you are not in violation of<br>the law. As distasteful as that sounds, this is how law in nearly every<br>state is written.<br><br>Some professions do have a duty to report, based on the profession<br>itself. But the average citizen is under no legal obligation to report a<br>crime.<br><br>If, instead of doing nothing before the crime, you assisted the criminal<br>in any way in the furtherance of the crime, you could be charged as an<br>*accessory to the original crime.*<br><br>Additionally, you cannot interfere with the investigation of a<br>crime. If you attempt to cover up or conceal a crime, or to aid the<br>criminal in his flight from justice, this is a separate crime called<br>*aiding and abetting*.<br><br>According to the article, she drove with him to the club, and she went<br>with him to buy ammunition and a holster. All of these activities are<br>perfectly legal. However, simply failing to report the crime is not<br>illegal.<br><br>Simply sloppy reporting.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
