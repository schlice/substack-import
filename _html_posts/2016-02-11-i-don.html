<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First things first. I want you to take note of the box at the top of<br>this page, in which the text begins \"Need Help?\" You don\'t need to<br>read it now, and you said you don\'t want to hurt yourself, but you do<br>want to die. When you feel up to it, please go to that box and click the<br>\"(more)\" link. Call the appropriate number based on where in the world<br>you are. There are people you can talk to, any time, 24x7.<br><br>It also sounds like you may be suffering from some depression. After<br>you\'ve spoken to the folks at that resource, please talk to your doctor<br>about this. Your depression can be managed fairly easily, and you\'d be<br>surprised how it changes your outlook on life.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
