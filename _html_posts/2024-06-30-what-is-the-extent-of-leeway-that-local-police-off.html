<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Zero leeway.<br><br>If it is discovered that a police officer violated the law while<br>effecting an arrest, anything that happens after that violation of law<br>is considered "fruit of the poisonous tree" and is inadmissible.<br><br>Here's an example.<br><br>A police officer stops a motorist and advises him that he was stopped<br>because he was using his high beams to signal oncoming drivers that<br>there was a speed trap ahead. Upon reviewing the motorist's<br>documentation, he finds that the insurance card is unsigned (a crime in<br>some states) and arrests the driver.<br><br>Except, the Supreme Court ruled in *Spence v. Washington* that<br>flashing your brights at oncoming drivers to alert them of police<br>activity ahead is considered First-Amendment protected free speech.<br>Therefore, everything that happened after it (including the discovery of<br>the unsigned insurance card) was "fruit of the poisonous tree" and never<br>would have happened had the officer not broken the law in the first<br>place.<br><br>As you can imagine, the man was released and the arrest was thrown out,<br>and the officer was assigned to mandatory retraining.<br><br>\<br><br>Of course, this only applies if the officer's lawbreaking is<br>*discovered*. If it is never discovered that the officer broke the law,<br>then the extent of leeway is *exactly what he can get away with.*<br><br>These days, with the advent of mobile phones and cameras everywhere,<br>it's much harder for officers to get away with stuff. Besides, with the<br>tide of public opinion souring against officer abuse, it's not really<br>worth it for an officer to break the law to make an arrest.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
