<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Some officers do struggle with this. Can you blame them?<br>They deal with the worst of the worst in society, every single day,<br>*so you don\'t have to.* They do this willingly. Most of these<br>people are harmless, but some are hardened criminals who would just as<br>soon kill a cop than go back to jail (again). Statistics vary as to just<br>how many officers are affected in this way, as medical records are<br>confidential, and most offers are less-than-willing to talk about such<br>shortcomings with anyone, much less statistic-takers.\<br>\<br>There are programs that officers can avail themselves of to assist them<br>with dealing with these types of emotional issues. Our department has an<br>on-staff psychiatrist (who is an awesome lady, by the way) who handles<br>all the \"required\" interactions, such as use of force incidents where<br>a suspect dies, and the \"non-required\" interactions, where officers<br>can talk to her when they start feeling the stress and strain of the<br>job. There are other work/life programs that are also offered by the<br>department.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
