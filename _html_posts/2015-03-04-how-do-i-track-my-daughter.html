<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There are many apps that do this, but the sending phone<br>has to have a data connection to transmit its information. There<br>arent\'t any tracking apps that I know of that currently use SMS to send<br>the location data of the phone, so that might be something useful. It<br>would be a true emergency phone locator when the phone doesn\'t have<br>data coverage but does have a cellular signal (and presumably a GPS<br>signal).\<br>\<br>Here\'s the basic idea: you pre-install the app on both the tracker and<br>the tracked phones. The app has to have SMS privileges on the phone, so<br>it may be a little tricky to do on iPhone without jailbreaking, but<br>Android is absolutely possible. The trick is hooking the app into SMS so<br>that the tracked phone can monitor SMS for a specially-coded message<br>that says \"activate.\"\<br>\<br>The app on the tracked phone intercepts the SMS \"activate\" message and<br>its tracking portion activates. It will then send an SMS to the tracker<br>every minute with its GPS coordinates until the battery dies or the app<br>receives a \"deactivate\" message over SMS.\<br>\<br>The app on the tracker phone will intercept the SMS and use the GPS<br>coordinates to plot the location on a map.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
