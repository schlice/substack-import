<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I don\'t know why Americans would be opposed to<br>immigrants. My grandparents were immigrants.\<br>\<br>I, however, as an American, am opposed to *ILLEGAL{.underline}*<br>immigrants. Notice that I bolded, italicized, and underlined a missing<br>word from the question.\<br>\<br>Millions of Americans have come to this country and been naturalized<br>(i.e. made a citizen through a process overseen by the USCIS (US Customs<br>and Immigration Service). It is a long process, sometimes taking years<br>to complete. This is an issue. The administration needs to fix this. It<br>is fixable. We can improve the immigration system.\<br>\<br>However, millions of immigrants have chosen{.underline} to<br>*violate the law* and come into this country *ILLEGALLY*,<br>bypassing the immigration process and remaining in this country as<br>\"undocumented aliens.\" Notice that there are also \"documented<br>aliens,\" such as people who came into this country on a temporary visa<br>and then simply decided to stay beyond the length of their visa. THESE<br>are the immigrants I have a problem with.\<br>\<br>If your first act as a \"citizen\" of a new country is to ***VIOLATE THE<br>LAWS OF THAT COUNTRY***, I have a problem with your continued residence<br>in this country.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
