<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why are some U.S. law enforcement agencies still not required to wear<br>body cameras?**<br><br>Cameras are cheap, and there are even Federal grant programs to buy<br>cameras.<br><br>But video storage is expensive. Video storage administrators to manage<br>all of the video and all of the storage systems to house all the video<br>are expensive.<br><br>Amid calls to "defund the police," which we are told really means<br>*severely cut their funding*, many departments simply don't have the<br>money to buy storage systems and hire new video storage administrators.<br><br>You can't just dump a requirement on the police because you want to. You<br>have to consider how much it will cost the department to implement your<br>requirement. This happened to the military all the time; we call it an<br>"unfunded mandate." It is very difficult for any non-profit government<br>agency to deal with unfunded mandates.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
