<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Jesus did tell a few people to quit their jobs and follow Him. He needed<br>disciples, and they couldn't rightly keep their jobs and follow Him at<br>the same time, so that kinda makes sense.<br><br>But He also told at least one guy that he needed to sell all his worldly<br>goods. Here's the passage:<br><br>> Just then a man came up to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing<br>> must I do to get eternal life?"<br>><br>> "Why do you ask me about what is good?" Jesus replied. "There is only<br>> One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments."<br>><br>> "Which ones?" he inquired.<br>><br>> Jesus replied, "'You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery,<br>> you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your<br>> father and mother,' and 'love your neighbor as yourself.'"<br>><br>> "All these I have kept," the young man said. "What do I still lack?"<br>><br>> Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions<br>> and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come,<br>> follow me."<br>><br>> When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great<br>> wealth.<br>><br>> Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for<br>> someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you,<br>> it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for<br>> someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God." --- Matthew<br>> 19:16--24â€²<br><br>*See?* you're saying right now. *It says right there! You have to sell<br>all your possessions and you will have treasure in heaven!*<br><br>While I don't doubt that you will indeed have treasure in heaven if you<br>sell all your possessions, this was not a command from Jesus to us. We<br>already have the Great Commandments: Love the Lord your God, and love<br>your neighbor. Then what's the story with this whole "sell all your<br>possessions" thing?<br><br>See, *Jesus knew the rich man's heart before he spoke a word.* Jesus<br>knew the rich man loved his money more than Him. So Jesus told him to do<br>the one thing that He knew the man would not do: part with the one true<br>love of his life; his money. The rich man went away sad, because he<br>realized that in order to gain heaven, he would have to give up the love<br>of money.<br><br>We are told in the Bible that the love of money is the root of all evil.<br>And this rich man loved money, so he was ill-equipped to enter heaven.<br>Jesus knew that this rich man would not "come and follow me" while he<br>still had his money, because he loved it too much.<br><br>Can you *have* money and not *love* money? Certainly. You can know that<br>money makes life easier, but it doesn't solve problems, and it doesn't<br>take away sin. Only Jesus can do that. Only Jesus is the way to heaven,<br>not money. Money doesn't get you to heaven. That's why Jesus turns to<br>the disciples and tells them that the rich person (one obsessed with the<br>love of money) will never make it to heaven. It would be easier for a<br>camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to go to<br>heaven, Jesus said.<br><br>While it is possible for rich people to go to heaven, it is not easy.<br>Jesus basically says that *all* of his followers must abandon the<br>various forms of wealth in order to follow Him: money, property,<br>security, family, prestige, or popularity. But Jesus also assures them<br>that *"The things that are impossible with people are possible with<br>God"* (Luke 18:27 ESV).<br><br>But what we gain far outpaces anything we lose.<br><br>And that's the point. Everything in this life is fleeting, but what we<br>gain in exchange is *far greater* than anything we give up here.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
