<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How many miles can I go over the posted speed limit before the police<br>can stop me?**<br><br>(USA specific answer)<br><br>Your question seems to imply that there is a set amount of miles above<br>the speed limit within which the police cannot stop you.<br><br>This is untrue.<br><br>If the speed limit is 55 and you are clocked at 56, you can be stopped<br>and ticketed, however unlikely that scenario is.<br><br>It's unlikely because your speedometer in your car could potentially be<br>off by a few miles, and the speed measuring equipment could similarly be<br>off by a few miles. So realistically, combining those two "fudge<br>factors" we could have a difference of up to 5 miles an hour.<br><br>Therefore, it's *unlikely* that the police would stop you if you were<br>within 5 miles an hour of the posted speed limit.<br><br>It's not *impossible*, however. For example, school zones are<br>tightly controlled. Any speed over the speed limit in a school zone<br>can be stopped. Yes, doing 25 in a 20 mile an hour school zone can, and<br>is routinely, stopped, especially because fines in school zones are<br>double the standard fine for that speed. This is also true for<br>construction zones.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
