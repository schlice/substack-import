<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>According to [[Johns Hopkins<br>Medicine](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=739495&url=http://hopkinsmedicine.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="hopkinsmedicine.org"}]{.qlink_container}, the permanent<br>treatment for venous malformation is embolization*.* Embolization is<br>a procedure whereby alcohol is injected into the venous blood sac or<br>lymph sac until the sacs collapse and no longer fill.<br><br>The treatment can be performed in one day, but normally requires several<br>treatments about six weeks apart to block all of the abnormal blood<br>vessels. It is quite effective, but needs to be monitored as changes in<br>the body can cause new arterial branches to form, which might require<br>re-treatment.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
