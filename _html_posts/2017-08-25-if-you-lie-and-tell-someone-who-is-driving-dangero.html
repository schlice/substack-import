<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br>you are a cop in order to protect the public or perform a<br>civil arrest, will you be charged with a felony?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You're treading on thin ice.<br><br>There is no law against lying. You can tell someone you're a cop if<br>you're not.<br><br>Where you start to run afoul of the law is if you attempt to perform<br>police duties while not actually being a police officer. This is called<br>"impersonating a peace officer" or "impersonating a law enforcement<br>officer" (depending on jurisdiction, your law may have a different name,<br>but every jurisdiction has one) and it is most generally a felony.<br><br>So if you lie to someone and tell them you're a cop (not a crime), but<br>then you tell them to do something under your "authority" as a peace<br>officer, you have just performed a duty reserved to police officers, and<br>you have crossed from lying into impersonating a police officer.<br><br>If you see something dangerous happening, be a good witness while you<br>call the police. Don't lie, and don't try to be a cop when you're not.<br>If you find that you really want to be able to exercise police powers,<br>join the police department.<br><br>(EDIT) The OP edited his question, I guess because he wasn\'t getting<br>his point across. New question:<br><br>> *\I\f you honk at someone driving irradically (sic) to get them to<br>> pull over and then you lie and say you are a cop to keep him from<br>> speeding off again, could you get charged with a felony? Would it even<br>> hold up in court with video proof*<br><br>Ah, I get it now. Except now it\'s *worse.*<br><br>So you stopped someone driving on the road (not a crime) and you lied to<br>them (not a crime) and you told them not to leave (oops! Crime!)<br><br>What you have done is committed two crimes. First, you assumed the<br>duties of a police officer, so you can be charged with impersonating a<br>police officer. Then, without authority, you detained a person\'s free<br>movement. This is called unlawful detention, or false arrest. Since you<br>have no authority to detain someone, doing so is a crime. Loss<br>prevention sometimes runs afoul of this one, depending on circumstances.<br><br>Next, you asked about video proof. I assume you recorded the erratic<br>behavior and want to show it as proof that waiting for police to arrive<br>would have been more dangerous than stopping the driver and lying to him<br>and detaining him without authority. *Can* you do that? Of course you<br>can. You can mount whatever defense you want to the charges. *Will you<br>be successful?* Perhaps, perhaps not. You would have to convince a judge<br>that the driving was so dangerous (we\'re talking reckless endangerment<br>dangerous) that there was no time to call police, you had to act to save<br>lives which were in imminent danger. To be honest, I don\'t know if this<br>has ever happened, or ever worked. But hey, you do you. There are no<br>guarantees in life, and certainly none here. You have the choice to take<br>the riskier road (to you). I wouldn\'t, but you certainly can. And in<br>case you're thinking of doing this, remember that this is an<br>*affirmative defense*, which means you are admitting that you committed<br>the crime in question, presenting your mitigating evidence, and hope<br>that the judge (or jury) believes that a reasonable man in your<br>situation would have done the same thing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
