<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In San Francisco, California, when you are an hourly employee and you<br>are off work, is it legal for your employer to send you text messages<br>and ask you work related questions? If not, how do you report them?**<br><br>In any state in the country, the Fair Labor Standards Act prevents<br>employees from working off the clock. It is illegal for your employer to<br>make you work (and work is anything you do for the company, including<br>text messages) when you're not on the clock.<br><br>Some of the suggestions mentioned here are good ones, such as when your<br>employer sends you a text message, responding immediately back to your<br>employer with, "I'm on the clock, right?" If it's email, set an OOO<br>every time you clock out that says that you are off work and you will<br>respond once you're back on work.<br><br>Remember that you can file with the US Department of Labor to recoup all<br>the back pay for all of the hours your employer made you work off the<br>clock. If it is significant, I would definitely file to get that money<br>back.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
