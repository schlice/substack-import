<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it rape if you didn\'t understand it? I\'m a girl and I was 9 and<br>my 14 year old female cousin made me preform inappropriate activities<br>with her. Is this rape? Does it count?**<br><br>Statutory rape laws are designed to protect children from adult<br>predators who wish to take advantage of their lack of understanding<br>about what they're doing.<br><br>While what you went through may have been inappropriate, in most states,<br>it is not rape, as both children were underage. Some states (such as<br>Utah) would prosecute *both* children for statutory rape. Most states,<br>however, consider it a juvenile offense and refer the matter to the<br>juvenile justice system.<br><br>Why do we have a separate legal system for juveniles instead of just<br>using the adult legal system?<br><br>It's well understood that the mind of a child is not fully developed.<br>The ability to perform higher reasoning functions isn't even fully<br>developed until age 25. In fact, recent research has even found that<br>adult and child brains work differently. Adults use the prefrontal<br>cortex for higher thinking. This is the rational part of the brain.<br>Because this is not fully developed in children, they use the amygdala,<br>which is not appropriate for higher thinking.<br><br>Crimes require two elements to be crimes: the *actus reus* (the guilty<br>act) and the *mens rea* (the guilty mind). Children cannot form *mens<br>rea* because they lack those critical thinking skills that adults have.<br><br>To this end, we have a separate justice system focused on rehabilitation<br>rather than punishment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
