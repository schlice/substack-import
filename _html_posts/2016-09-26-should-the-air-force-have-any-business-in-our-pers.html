<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*The military mindset is starting to conflict with my Libertarian<br>worldview.*<br><br>There is nothing wrong with this! Patton said, "If everyone is thinking<br>alike, then someone isn't thinking." We *need* differing opinions on<br>everything (when presented correctly and respectfully, of course). I<br>always told my enlisted troops that my door was always open. That meant<br>that if they needed to question something, needed to talk about<br>something, needed advice about something, I was always willing to<br>listen. If I'm wrong, I'd rather know up front than when senior<br>leadership is shitting down on me because I screwed the pooch.<br><br>*Is it the AF's business how clean I keep my room?*<br><br>Assuming you live in the dorms, it is absolutely the Air Force's<br>business how clean you keep your room. Keeping a clean room means that<br>you do not attract vermin which can affect the quality of life and<br>sanitary living conditions of your space, and your neighbor's spaces as<br>well. Additionally, you are a tenant in your room, you do not own it.<br>The property manager (i.e. the Air Force) has every right to ensure you<br>are providing basic upkeep so that he does not have to endure costly<br>repairs when you leave. Additionally, since you did actually "sign up<br>for it," the Air Force can do MWH (Morale, Welfare, and Health)<br>inspections to ensure you are mentally okay. This is more than what<br>might happen in an off-base apartment, but you're living in the dorms,<br>so "their house, their rules."<br><br>*Who cares if I'm a shut-in?*<br><br>The aforementioned MWH inspections ensure that your mental health is<br>stable. Being a shut-in may simply be your nature, or it may be the<br>early signs of depression, perhaps caused by PTSD, and you may be headed<br>down a bad path which can be corrected with early intervention. It may<br>be nothing, or it may be something. Expect the Air Force to follow up to<br>ensure it is nothing.<br><br>*Why can't I question authority when Science tells me to question<br>everything?*<br><br>As I previously mentioned, in general your commanders want you to<br>question almost everything. **There is always an appropriate time and<br>place for appropriate questions**. Every good commander knows this. And<br>dare I say, if your commander tells you they accept no questions, then<br>my previous sentence stands, and I would challenge any commander who<br>accepted no feedback. However, remember there is an *appropriate*<br>time and place for appropriate questions. On the battlefield, when lives<br>are on the line, is not the time to be questioning orders. Unless you<br>know that an order is illegal, your only question should be to<br>request an altitude vector when your commander tells you to engage in<br>vertical ascent (in other words, when I say "jump", you say "how high").<br>Now later on, pull me aside and say, "Captain, can I have a word in<br>private?" and then we discuss what your concerns are. And since I am one<br>of the aforementioned "good" commanders, I will listen thoughtfully to<br>your concerns. I've had folks question me on all sorts of things, an<br>usually explaining things to them helped. I could explain things when I<br>had the opportunity to do so. I did not always have that opportunity. In<br>those cases, I appreciate when my orders are followed without question.<br>Remember the old saying, "Ours is not to question why, ours is just to<br>do or die." It also reminds me of the poem, "The Train":<br><br>> It's not my place to drive the train,\<br>> The whistle I can't blow.\<br>> It's not my place to say how far\<br>> The train's supposed to go.<br>><br>> It's not my place to shoot off steam,\<br>> Or even clang the bell.\<br>> But let the damn thing jump the track,\<br>> And see who catches hell.<br><br>*And saying that, "I signed up for this," doesn't answer the question.*<br><br>In most cases in the military, it does. Like I said, every good<br>commander knows that they have to accept feedback in order to grow.<br>Emphasis is on "good." Not all commanders are good. I know, I've worked<br>for plenty of less-than-good commanders. I've also worked with some<br>amazing, stellar commanders who I'd follow to the gates of Hell if I was<br>asked.<br><br>That said, if I was your commander, I would expect you to ask for a<br>conference where I could address your concerns. ***You must be prepared<br>to be told no.*** Will you be satisfied if you are merely heard? Or must<br>your changes be implemented? This is up to you to decide, and you will<br>have to decide how you will proceed beyond that. Remember, you have a<br>term of enlistment. You are under no obligation to sign up for an<br>additional term of enlistment once your current one is complete.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
