<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not at all. *Baptism is what saved people do.*<br><br>- Baptism doesn't save you. You're baptized because you're already<br>  saved. Salvation comes from personal faith in what Christ has<br>  *already* done for you. Baptism is just the outward expression of that<br>  faith.<br>- Baptism doesn't gain you extra favor with God. God already loves you<br>  completely.<br>- Baptism is a step of obedience. Jesus made it clear that his followers<br>  demonstrate that fact through baptism by immersion. Obedience to his<br>  commands is one way in which we demonstrate our love for him.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is baptism, in fact, the only way to salvation?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
