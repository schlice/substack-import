<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are two laws in Arizona that might apply to your situation:<br><br>13-1402 Indecent exposure: Class 1 misdemeanor\<br>13-1403 Public sexual indecency: Class 1 misdemeanor<br><br>- Indecent exposure (Arizona Revised Statutes section<br>  [13-1402(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a130c6&url=http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ars/13/01402.htm){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="state.az.us"}]{.qlink_container}): When a person exposes<br>  his or her genitals while another person is present, and the person<br>  exposing himself or herself is reckless as to whether the witness<br>  would be offended or alarmed.<br>- Public sexual indecency (Arizona Revised Statutes section<br>  [13-1403(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=99a107&url=http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ars/13/01403.htm){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="state.az.us"}]{.qlink_container}): When a person performs<br>  one or more sexual behaviors while another person is present, and the<br>  person performing the sex act is reckless as to whether the witness<br>  would be offended or alarmed. The sex acts listed in the statue are:<br>  - Sexual contact;<br>  - Oral sexual contact;<br>  - Sexual intercourse; and<br>  - Bestiality.<br><br>So the keys here in order to make either of these charges stick are (and<br>you need all of them):<br><br>1.  You do the thing<br>2.  You are reckless as to whether or not someone else might see you do<br>    the thing<br>3.  Someone else sees you do the thing and is offended or alarmed.<br><br>As you can see, both of the listed offenses are Class 1 misdemeanors.<br>This means that you would either be arrested and charged with these<br>offenses, or you would be *released on your own recognizance* (ROR'd)<br>with a summons in hand requiring you to make yourself present in court<br>on X day at X time to answer these charges. Multiple charges for the<br>same violation (at different times) may require the person be added to<br>the sex offender registry.<br><br>If nether of these has happened, it's most likely that you were simply<br>released without being charged. This means that either you were seen by<br>someone and they chose not to press charges, or you weren't seen by<br>anyone, and were not reckless as to whether or not someone else might<br>see you. This is most likely the case, as the essential elements of the<br>crime were probably not met. If you were released without paperwork in<br>hand, this is the most likely reason why.<br><br>Of course, none of us can tell you specifically because we weren't<br>there. However, in looking at state law, it's likely that they simply<br>told you to get dressed and get lost because it would have been a<br>stretch to make any charges stick without a complaining witness.<br><br>If you are still worried that there might be outstanding charges against<br>you, you can always contact the police department with which you had the<br>confrontation, or you can engage a lawyer who can check for you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
