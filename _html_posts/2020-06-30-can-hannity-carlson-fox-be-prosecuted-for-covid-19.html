If Someone<br>can be prosecuted for yelling fire in a crowded theater, can Fox and<br>Company be prosecuted for minimizing, trivializing, calling the<br>coronavirus a hoax?**<br><br>Shouting fire in a crowded theater actually creates a danger where no<br>danger previously existed. This is illegal.<br><br>Minimizing coronavirus is an opinion. So is trivializing and calling the<br>virus a hoax (to the extent that this was actually done). These guys are<br>opinion hosts. Stating your opinion is not illegal. There may be<br>consequences, but none of them are legal consequences.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
