<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Depends on how you get the screen repaired and what "trade-in" you're<br>talking about.<br><br>If you are talking about simply trading in your old device for a credit<br>towards a new one, the calculation is simple math: how much does it cost<br>to repair the screen vs. how much extra you'll get for a device with an<br>unbroken vs broken screen.<br><br>If you are talking about a program like T-Mobile's JUMP program, where<br>you trade in your old phone for a new one, you must have a phone<br>with an unbroken screen before you can turn it in. And you must have<br>your screen repaired by insurance, not the Fix-y guy in the mall. Check<br>with your carrier to validate this part.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
