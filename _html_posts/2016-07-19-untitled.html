<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You said "I say X, and all they hear is Y." It sounds like there is<br>either a problem with the translation, or if it happens to be in the<br>same language, the interpretation. X is always X. If the other person<br>interprets it as Y, either you're not being clear enough, or they have a<br>particular "filter" in place that converts X into Y.<br><br>I'll leave it at that. I won't blame any particular party for placing<br>filters, because they both do it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-it-sad-that-any-criticism-of-illegal-immigration-has-to-be-prefaced-with-the-phrase-Im-not-a-racist-but/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
