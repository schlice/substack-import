<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are the legal laws in Oklahoma about my boyfriend having cameras<br>in our house but I don\'t know about them nor do my children?**<br><br>You said "he has cameras in the house" but "you don't know about them."<br>Are you saying that he told you that he has "hidden cameras" around the<br>home?<br><br>In general, the owner of the home can place security cameras in common<br>areas such as living rooms and hallways. Cameras (hidden or open) cannot<br>be placed in areas in which there is an expectation of privacy, such as<br>bedrooms and bathrooms. Cameras must be video-only, since recording<br>audio falls under separate Federal law. As long as the cameras are not<br>in areas in which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, he<br>should be legally okay.<br><br>You asked about laws, but I think we'd be remiss if we didn't tackle the<br>camera question as a whole. If you believe that there are hidden cameras<br>in bedrooms or bathrooms, I'd confront him on it. Make him take them<br>out, or I'd extricate myself and my kids from that house. You and your<br>kids don't need that kind of boyfriend. He's not worth it. Leave him and<br>his cameras to himself.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
