<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [A couple of the other commenters mentioned that you talked<br>about the cost of your car, but you failed to mention other expenses,<br>namely your medical care. Even if you have health insurance, you\'re<br>going to have to pay things like copays and coinsurance, and as you<br>alluded to, this is a lot of hassle, a pain in the butt, lots of time<br>and effort. Not to mention, you probably will have to take time off of<br>work to go to all of the doctor appointments, which is time you\'re not<br>being paid for. This was not your fault! It\'s extremely inconvenient<br>that you now have to go through all of this medical nonsense when this<br>was not your fault at all.\<br>\<br>You deserve to recoup some of those expenses.\<br>\<br>If you accept the insurance company\'s offer (which is pretty fair for<br>your car), you also give up the right to fight for other expenses, which<br>could end up being far more than your car. Plus, there\'s all this time<br>and effort that you\'re not being compensated for. It\'s a category of<br>award called \"pain and suffering.\" If you take the offer, ***you waive<br>the right to recoup any other costs***, which could be substantial.\<br>\<br>What your attorneys are asking for is reasonable and is in line with<br>what most personal injury firms charge: they take 1/3, you keep 2/3.<br>Remember again, they won\'t take your case unless they can make some<br>money off of it.\<br>\<br>Yes, I have had to deal with this once before. My attorney walked me<br>through the entire process, and while the award wasn\'t what I would<br>have liked (i.e. it wasn\'t fair), it was *just.* So it all worked out<br>in the end.\<br>\<br>In my opinion, you should do what your attorney is asking of you, let<br>them walk you through the process. Good luck.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Do-I-need-an-attorney-for-my-auto-accident-I-suffered-a-mild-concussion/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
