<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It is not in direct conflict with the First Amendment; in fact, it is<br>the First Amendment that allows Trump to make such a comment.<br><br>Whether or not it is *true* is another thing altogether.<br><br>Whether or not Trump can be held *liable* for the untruth is covered<br>by laws against *slander*. In order to prove slander, you have to show<br><br>- The statement is false<br>- The slanderer knew it was false<br>- The statement caused demonstrable harm, either monetarily or to a<br>  person's reputation where that person relies on their reputation for<br>  their livelihood.<br><br>So:<br><br>*Is the statement false?* The statement says, "It's frankly<br>disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to<br>write, and people should look into it." This is clearly a statement of<br>*opinion*, not a statement alleging some fact. And indeed, the press is<br>allowed to write whatever they want to write, also because of the same<br>aforementioned First Amendment. The press is subject to laws surrounding<br>*libel*, which is the same thing as slander, but for printed words.<br><br>*Did it cause harm?* People have been saying that the press writes<br>whatever they want for a very long time, and it does not appear to have<br>caused them any harm, or at least not any harm they can demonstrate came<br>from this opinion.<br><br>Finally, the First Amendment only protects the right of the people to<br>speak out against the government.<br><br>So no, there are no First Amendment violations here.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
