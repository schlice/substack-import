<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [You do see this happen occasionally, but it is policy in<br/>our department to not accept free items from anyone, public or business<br/>owner.\<br/>\<br/>That said, while I can\'t take something for free, I also can\'t control<br/>what you, as the business owner, charge me for it. So if you want to<br/>give me a discount cup of coffee, I\'m okay with that, but please let me<br/>pay.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
