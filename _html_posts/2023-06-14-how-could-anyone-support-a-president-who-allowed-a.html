<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because some people who haven't passed high school civics think that<br>laws actually prevent people from doing bad things.<br><br>That's not what laws do.<br><br>Laws provide penalties when people do bad things. They don't actually<br>prevent people from doing bad things.<br><br>Because if they did, I could pick up the gun, point it at the person,<br>and try to pull the trigger, but it would simply not work because it's<br>illegal to kill people. That's not how laws work.<br><br>In order for the law to kick in, *you actually have to violate the law<br>first.*<br><br>So for all of you who think that laws prevent people from doing bad<br>things, here's actually how the process works:<br><br>- Law is passed saying you can't do bad thing X or you get consequence<br>  Y.<br>- Person does bad thing X.<br>- Person receives consequence Y.<br><br>That's it. The law doesn't stop the person from doing bad thing X. They<br>always have the choice to be bad. The law simply provides the framework<br>to allow them to get consequence Y.<br><br>\<br><br>Therefore, no one *allowed* a transgender influencer to flash her<br>breasts on the White House lawn. There are rules against that. She broke<br>those rules. She has received the consequences of breaking those rules.<br><br>End of story.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
