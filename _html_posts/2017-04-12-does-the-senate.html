<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>In order to accurately answer this question, you have to understand the<br>purpose of the House and the Senate and what the framers intended for<br>them to do.<br><br>The House, composed of Congressmen who have smaller districts and<br>shorter terms, are representative of the "hot passions" of the people;<br>the feelings "at the time." The Senate, with longer terms and larger<br>constituencies, is supposed to be the "thoughtful, deliberate" body.<br>While the House limits debate, the Senate is adamant about allowing any<br>Senator the time he needs to debate the bill. Truly, the Senate is the<br>greatest deliberative body in the world.<br><br>Or, at least, it used to be.<br><br>Not soon after the Senate was founded, the Senators re-discovered the<br>old Greek and Roman practices of killing bills by killing time: the<br>filibuster. The filibuster was actually a fairly useful tool because it<br>*encouraged* healthy, productive debate. In order to move on from a<br>filibustered bill, it had to be resolved. This encouraged Senators to<br>engage in useful debate in order to move a bill forward, and then to<br>move on to other Senate business. Additionally, when a filibuster was<br>taking place, the Senator, for the most part, had to stay at his desk,<br>on his feet. The filibuster, then, was naturally self-limiting.<br><br>Two Senate rule changes changed this, and essentially and fundamentally<br>changed the Senate. In 1917, the Senate added a cloture rule which<br>allowed two thirds of the Senate present and voting to close debate;<br>later, this was changed to three fifths of the whole Senate. This rule,<br>in and of itself, was not a bad thing, as it still was in keeping with<br>the parliamentary procedures in the Senate. The Senate still encouraged<br>healthy debate, and still allowed Senators to speak, and if enough of<br>the body agreed, they could stop a filibuster. The filibuster was still<br>naturally self-limiting, so it was still seldom used. For 52 years after<br>the cloture rule was implemented, there were only 58 filibusters.<br><br>But in 1970, the number of filibusters *skyrocketed*, with a 36-fold<br>increase in the number of filibusters. Between 1970 and 2016, there have<br>been 1700 filibusters. This was caused by the implementation of the<br>two track system. Under this system, with the consent of the entire<br>Senate, or with approval of the minority leader, a filibustered bill<br>could be "tabled" (or set on a separate track) so that the Senate could<br>resume normal business. Now, the actual filibuster isn't even needed.<br>Just the *threat* of a filibuster could cause a bill to be tabled and<br>would effectively end debate on the bill. The House sends hundreds of<br>bills to the Senate, and the Senate is paralyzed. Any threats of<br>filibuster will cause debate on a bill (and ultimately votes on a bill)<br>to be ended.<br><br>This effectively turned the party of the opposition into the party of<br>the roadblock. It has also effectively turned the greatest<br>deliberative body in the world into an ineffective collection of<br>legislators, not because of a lack of desire to get bills passed, but<br>because of an unrepentant minority and the post-1970 filibuster.<br><br>I give this picture of the current state of the Senate because it frames<br>our discussion about the lowering of the needed vote count for cloture.<br>Debate is supposed to be a *means to an end,* not an end unto itself.<br>The Senate is chartered with making laws. Debate, therefore, should work<br>towards that end. Debate which ends in a vote is therefore good.<br>Debate which is designed not to end in a vote but to permanently prevent<br>a vote, or force the Senate to not fulfill its charter, is<br>counterproductive and instead of fostering debate, obstructs it.<br><br>The Senate must do its job. Using debate to prevent the Senate from<br>doing its job (*healthy, productive* debate and voting) is not in<br>keeping with what the founders designed the Senate to do: engage in<br>healthy debate, and vote on legislation (or Supreme Court nominees).<br>Lowering the threshold for cloture allows the Senate to move forward and<br>do their job, forestalling the effectiveness of the filibuster and<br>preventing it from being used as a hammer by the opposition in<br>preventing debate from even occurring in the first place.<br><br>Therefore, lowering the threshold for cloture is in keeping with what<br>the founders had in mind for the Senate.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
