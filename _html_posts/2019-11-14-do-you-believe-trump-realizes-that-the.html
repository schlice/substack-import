<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you believe Trump realizes that the "transcript" he sanitized,<br>wrote & released will be the basis for his impeachment?**<br><br>Your thinly-velied condemnation of the President has not gone unnoticed.<br><br>Your poorly-worded question gave it away.<br><br>1.  The President did not write the call summary. It was written by a<br>    CIA operative who works in the White House. He listens to the calls<br>    and he records the main ideas of what was said. He's actually very<br>    good at this.<br>2.  The call summary was not changed from what the CIA agent wrote.<br>3.  All the parties on the call agree that the call summary accurately<br>    reflects the contents of the call.<br><br>If you truly believe that this call summary should be the basis to<br>impeach a President, then not only do you not understand what<br>impeachment is for, but you have truly lost the narrative. No crimes<br>have taken place. Nothing on the order of a "high crime or misdemeanor"<br>has transpired. Remember that in the Constitution, Article II Section 4<br>reads: \"The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the<br>United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and<br>Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and<br>Misdemeanors.\" So the intent of high crimes and misdemeanors was actual<br>lawlessness.<br><br>Indeed, throughout our history, impeachment was only ever proffered when<br>a President has violated a law. This is the first time in history that a<br>President will be impeached because the House of Representatives doesn't<br>like how he governs.<br><br>We have truly jumped the shark.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
