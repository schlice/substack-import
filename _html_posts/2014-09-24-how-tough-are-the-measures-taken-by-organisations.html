<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'m not sure what you mean by \"misuse\" but if you\'re<br>talking about discharging those weapons and not telling anyone, in the<br>US the military is much tougher on that than the police. I speak from a<br>US military police standpoint.\<br>\<br>The civilian police are required to follow department policy and the law<br>regarding carrying and use of firearms, both on and off duty.\<br>\<br>Military police is a little different. On a random basis, security<br>forces personnel are asked to \"block\" their ammo at the end of a shift<br>when they turn their weapons back into the armory. \"Blocking\" ammo is<br>a process by which personnel empty their magazines and place them<br>slug-down in a \"peg board\" which has enough room to hold their<br>standard issue ammunition (personnel with pistols have 30-round blocks,<br>personnel with rifles have 120-round blocks). This allows the serial<br>number of all the rounds to be examined by the armorer to ensure that<br>all rounds are present and all are from the same lot. Once all the ammo<br>was checked, the personnel had to reload the mags. This was a big pain<br>especially if you were carrying a rifle, but it is what it is.\<br>\<br>That didn\'t stop someone from removing the military ammo and firing<br>their own ammo through the weapon and then replacing the military ammo,<br>but that\'s a lot of work, and usually you\'re too busy to have time to<br>do something like that.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
