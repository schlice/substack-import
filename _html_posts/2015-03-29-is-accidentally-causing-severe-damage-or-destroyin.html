<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There are a few possibilities here that you haven\'t<br>elucidated. The first is that the person causing the damage would do it<br>again, and so you are restraining that person from further action. The<br>key in that case is \"accidentally.\" If the destruction was definitely<br>not willful, but was unintentional, accidental, or involuntary, then<br>there is no fear that it would happen again in any intentional capacity.<br>So a restraining order is unwarranted.\<br>\<br>The second is that the victim of the accident would attempt to harm the<br>accidental aggressor because he felt \"wronged\" by the accident. In<br>order to get such an order, you would have to show some actual or<br>reasonable threat of harm. Verbal abuse is generally not<br>enough.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
