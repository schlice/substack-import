<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Obama did not change how an existing law is being executed<br>as there is no current law that allows for what he has done.\<br>\<br>Presidents can change how an existing law is executed. They can even<br>invoke *prosecutorial discretion* in how we prosecute violators of the<br>law. He did not do this. Every other decision that other presidents have<br>made were in the spirit of, in keeping with, the spirit of an existing<br>law.\<br>\<br>In contrast, what he has done is in direct contradiction with existing<br>law. He made new law. no existing law allows for what he did. Making new<br>law is clearly unconstitutional.\<br>\<br>Also, to answer the original question, the Constitution does not<br>authorize the president to make law if Congress does<br>not.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
