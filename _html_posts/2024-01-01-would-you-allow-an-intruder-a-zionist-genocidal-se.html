<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Of course not.<br><br>But if you will allow me, let me re-write your question to ***actually<br>fit reality:***<br><br>**Would you allow an intruder (Arabs) to register their claim on your<br>property (the ancestral homeland of the Jews) simply because they<br>conquered the land once?**<br><br>There. Fixed it for you.<br><br>So let's break down your characterizations and see where they are<br>flawed:<br><br>1.  You characterized Israel as "a Zionist genocidal settler-colonial<br>    state." This characterization is wrong on multiple levels.<br>    1.  While some Israelis may be "Zionists," not everyone in or out of<br>        Israel is.<br>    2.  Israelis are definitely not "genocidal." The population of Gaza<br>        *grew tenfold* over the time that they had a separate<br>        Palestinian state. If they are genocidal, they're absolutely<br>        terrible at it. Plus, they have the technology to turn Palestine<br>        into the world's largest parking lot, and they haven't done it<br>        yet. So I really dispute the characterization of Israel as<br>        "genocidal."<br>    3.  It's difficult to characterize Israel as a "settler-colonial<br>        state" as the first recorded people in that region were Jews in<br>        2000 BC. So seeing as "they were there first," it's really hard<br>        to call them "colonialists."<br>2.  You claimed Palestinians have a right to the property. That's only<br>    partially true. Arabs once conquered the land now known as Palestine<br>    (note that they conquered the Jews and took the land, as any<br>    invading nation would do), *but then the Jews took it back* (also by<br>    conquering). But the difference: the Jews allowed the Arabs to stay.<br>    So by the rules of war, the nation conquering the land has the<br>    "right" to the property.<br>3.  You claimed that the only reason Israel exists is because of the<br>    Jewish Scriptures. But as I already noted in 1c above, the Jews were<br>    actually there first, despite what they have written in their Torah.<br>    So their claim is actually supported by history, not just a book.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
