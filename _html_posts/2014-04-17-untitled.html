<br/><br/>Answer Comment<br/><br/><br/>Content: [I am not assuming this; if anyone would be assuming this,<br/>it would be the state, since they are the ones that make the rules<br/>regarding to whom they will issue marriage licenses, and to whom<br/>benefits will be assigned.\<br/>\<br/>I am fully aware that most gays raise beautiful, healthy families. Some<br/>do not. This is exactly the same case as straights. The state seems to<br/>believe, through whatever evidence they have at their disposal, that the<br/>best (not only) chance for a child to be successful is to be<br/>raised by his biological mom and dad in a common home. So they<br/>incentivize that relationship by offering state-sponsored benefits tied<br/>to a moniker: *married.* Problem is, other organizations have latched on<br/>to that moniker and also tie their own benefits to that same moniker,<br/>not realizing that those benefits are not the subject of the state\'s<br/>social engineering project and shouldn\'t be assigned based on that<br/>particular moniker. It will be a long and slow process to<br/>reverse-engineer the structure that has built up around the assignment<br/>of benefits based on a state-supplied title, but the prevailing theme in<br/>this country, and in others, is that it is happening, and will continue<br/>to happen.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Answer:<br/>https://www.quora.com/What-am-I-missing-out-on-if-I-am-not-gay/answer/Brittany-Vaughn<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
