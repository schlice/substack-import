<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do you think Trump will try to get out of this Manafort and Cohen<br>situation?**<br><br>There's nothing to "get out of."<br><br>At worst, if you squint hard and look sideways at it, Trump may have<br>violated campaign finance laws by paying off Stormy Daniels to keep her<br>quiet. However, that's unlikely because there are substantial<br>non-political reasons why he would have wanted to pay off Stormy<br>Daniels, which makes the payments permissible.<br><br>Nevertheless, the worst possible outcome for Trump is that his campaign<br>is found to have violated campaign finance laws, and he pays a fine.<br><br>Just like Obama's campaign. They paid a fine. Life went on.<br><br>I hate to bring up the elephant in the room, but someone has to:<br>*literally none of this has anything whatsoever to do with Russian<br>collusion in the 2016 election.* Sure, a couple of guys may have broken<br>Federal law. Manafort didn't pay his taxes correctly. Cohen also had tax<br>issues. Cohen paid hush money to a porn star.<br><br>But none of this has anything to do with Russia, or collusion, or using<br>Russia to rig an election. None of it.<br><br>So again, there's nothing to "get out of." This situation will resolve<br>itself. Two guys go to jail for their own crimes. Life goes on.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
