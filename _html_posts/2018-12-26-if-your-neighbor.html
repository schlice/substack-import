<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If your neighbor\'s tree is overhanging into your backyard and you<br>have asked him on numerous occasion to trim it back and he hasn\'t, what<br>would you do?**<br><br>1.  Check with your city ordinances. They may be different in your area.<br>    In most areas, the area within your fence (and immediately over your<br>    fence) is your area to maintain. The tree overhanging your fence is<br>    technically trespassing (in tort) into your property.<br>2.  If your city allows it, trim the tree. Yes, you'll have to pay to<br>    trim the tree. But pay an arborist to trim it so that if there is<br>    damage to the tree, it's on the arborist, not on you.<br>3.  Talk to your neighbor about it. Not just with letters, but with<br>    words. Face to face. Maybe your neighbor will chip in to help pay<br>    for the trimming, maybe not. But ultimately, it's your yard, so it's<br>    your responsibility.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
