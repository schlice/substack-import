<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Who is Cesar Sayoc Jr. the arrested mail bomber and what can he tell<br>us about this case?**<br><br>According to [[Fox<br>News](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d419cb&url=https://www.foxnews.com/us/cesar-sayoc-mail-bombing-suspect-arrested-florida-everything-we-know-so-far){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="foxnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}:<br><br>> Sayoc, a former New Yorker who now resides in Aventura, Florida, is a<br>> \"promoter\" and \"booking agent\" for male stripper and burlesque<br>> shows, including touring dance troupe Chippendales, according to his<br>> LinkedIn profile. Ohio event promoter Tony Valentine [[told The<br>> Washington<br>> Examiner](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f2d7c6&url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/pipe-bomb-suspect-big-muscle-head-stripper-former-boss){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="washingtonexaminer.com"}]{.qlink_container} Sayoc was also<br>> periodically hired to strip in the 90s.<br>><br>> \"He really couldn\'t find his niche in life, and I guess he found it<br>> now,\" Valentine told the newspaper. \"Back in the \'90s, he was<br>> running around from Minnesota to the Carolinas to Florida. He was like<br>> a gypsy.\"<br>><br>> He\'s also an amateur body builder, [[according to the Miami<br>> Herald](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=50b360&url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article220680075.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="miamiherald.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br>><br>> Photos and videos posted on what is believed to be Sayoc\'s social<br>> media accounts in 2016 show the Florida man attending pro-Trump<br>> rallies, where he often sported a red Make America Great Again hat and<br>> --- at times --- posed with Trump-Pence campaign signs. Sayoc is a<br>> registered Republican in Miami-Dade County and listed as an \"active\"<br>> voter, [[according to Florida voting<br>> records](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4d44ac&url=https://registration.elections.myflorida.com/en/CheckVoterStatus/Index){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="myflorida.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>Is it true that he supports GOP and Donald Trump?<br><br>Yep. He's a far-right whack-a-doodle.<br><br>He's not an indication of all people who support Trump. He's not even an<br>indication of *most* people who support Trump.<br><br>In exactly the same way that some people blamed the Democrat Party or<br>Bernie Sanders when James Hodgkinson shot up a Congressional baseball<br>practice, some people are going to blame Trump or Republicans in general<br>because of Cesar Sayoc.<br><br>Let's be clear: the only person responsible for shooting Congressmen or<br>Congressional staffers was James Hodgkinson.<br><br>The only person responsible for sending what appear to be pipe bombs<br>through the mail is Cesar Sayoc.<br><br>This just goes to prove that whackadoodle status is not limited to any<br>one political party.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
