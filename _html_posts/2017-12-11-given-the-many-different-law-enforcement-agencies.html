<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Given the many different law enforcement agencies in the US, does LEO<br>get training on how to recognize all the different badges/IDs?**<br><br>No. If a law enforcement officer questions an ID card presented to him,<br>he contacts his dispatcher and has them contact the agency in question<br>and verify that the person is a law enforcement officer in good<br>standing.<br><br>This is the only method by which a law enforcement officer can be<br>successfully verified. With over 18,000 law enforcement agencies in the<br>United States, there is no way that anyone could be well-versed in every<br>badge and ID card. Locally, you may know the agencies nearby, but you<br>probably wouldn't be able to easily recognize any from outside your<br>local area, let alone outside your state.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
