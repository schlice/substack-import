The rules are<br>designed to prevent non flight crew personnel from unlawfully entering<br>the cockpit. Anything designed to allow persons to forcibly enter the<br>cockpit can/will be used against the flight crew.\<br>\<br>In this case, the rules didn\'t account for *the flight crew* actually<br>crashing the plane.\<br>\<br>You can\'t account for all things that human beings will<br>do.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
