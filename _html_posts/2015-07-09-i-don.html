Make today the best day you<br>can, because you never know what may happen tomorrow. Be the best you<br>that you can be. And then, if you are blessed enough to get another day<br>to do it all over again, do it!\<br>\<br>Live for today. Don\'t put off until tomorrow. Tomorrow never comes.<br>There will always be another tomorrow (until there\'s not, of course,<br>and then you\'ve missed your chance). You only get one go in this life;<br>make it count!]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
