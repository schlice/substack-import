<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You don\'t believe that the *fully-constituted* militias of all 50<br>states can quickly and easily overrun the US military?<br><br>The US military would be insane to try to take on the fully-constituted<br>force of all 48 contiguous states\' militias.<br><br>Besides, in a nation of laws, the military force that is created and<br>authorized only through the force of law will have a very difficult time<br>following an order that is, by its very nature, antithetical to that<br>law: attack US citizens. Most military members will not comply with such<br>an unlawful order; as the Nazi war crimes trials showed, \"I was just<br>following orders\" is not a defense. Military officers have the<br>authority, and the responsibility, to ignore unlawful orders.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
