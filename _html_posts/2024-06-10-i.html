<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>"Take every thought captive."<br><br>Have you heard that phrase before? It comes from 2 Corinthians 10:5.<br><br>> We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the<br>> knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ (ESV)<br><br>Paul is offering us a way to keep our minds focused on the things of<br>heaven rather than the distractions of the world. But how do we "take<br>every thought captive?" It is a three-pronged effort:<br><br>1.  Ask for God's guidance<br>2.  Repent (turn away) from sin<br>3.  Maintain a continuous relationship with God's Word.<br><br>Author Christina Patterson says, "Our thoughts lead to our beliefs,<br>which lead to our actions, which lead to the quality of our lives. Our<br>thoughts have too great of an impact for us not to guard them and keep<br>our mind on God\'s will."<br><br>So what about the question, when you say that you sometimes think that<br>your good deed saved you? Well, "take that thought captive." What does<br>that look like? When you think the thought:<br><br>1.  Stop and ask the Holy Spirit to guide you.<br>2.  Release the thought through confession. You could even explore<br>    writing it down, or journaling.<br>3.  Compare what you think to what you *know*, and that is the truth<br>    of the Bible. We know that the Bible tells us that our faith saves<br>    us, not our works. Recall James 2:24:<br><br>> "You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not<br>> by faith alone." (ESV)<br><br>James isn't saying that works saves you. James is saying that you *see*<br>a person is righteous by what they do. In other words, *if you don't see<br>the works, you can probably guess that there's no faith.* **Their faith<br>will produce fruit (works).** And Matthew 7:16--20 tells us that you can<br>tell a tree by its fruit:<br><br>> You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from<br>> thornbushes, or figs from thistles? So, every healthy tree bears good<br>> fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit. A healthy tree cannot<br>> bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit. Every tree<br>> that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.<br>> Thus you will recognize them by their fruits. (ESV)<br><br>And, of course, the ultimate and unequivocal passage in Ephesians 2:8--9<br>tells us that it is faith alone that saves us:<br><br>> "It is by grace you have been saved, through faith---and this is not<br>> from yourselves, it is the gift of God---not by works, so that no one<br>> can boast." (ESV)<br><br>So you remind yourself that *it is faith which begets good works;*<br>*not the other way around.* Works do not save you. Only faith saves you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
