<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it illegal to screenshot someone in a group when they\'re being<br>racist? Can you use that as evidence or is it considered illegally<br>obtained? These aren\'t private conservations but declarations a person<br>made in a closed FB group.**<br><br>Evidence of what? What crime has been committed?<br><br>I do hate to break it to you, but it's not illegal to be racist. It may<br>be terribly misguided, but it's not illegal.<br><br>The First Amendment protects your right to say racist things.<br><br>That doesn't mean that there shouldn't be backlash. Remember, Facebook<br>is run by liberal Silicon Valley executives. I would report the entire<br>conversation to Facebook and have that person banned.<br><br>That's what we do with dissenting voices, right? We ban them! Only<br>people we like to hear in our safe spaces! You only have freedom of<br>speech when you say *nice* things!<br><br>Despite my First Amendment sarcasm and ranting, the person did this on<br>Facebook, which does have policies against racism, so your best bet<br>would simply be to report the conversation to Facebook.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
