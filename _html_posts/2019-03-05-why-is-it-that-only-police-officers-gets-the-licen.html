<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is it that only police officers gets the license to kill anyone<br>they choose as long as they say \"I was afraid for my life?\" which is a<br>statement that cannot be disproven by anyone else?**<br><br>It is true that being in fear for one\'s life is a subjective<br>assessment.<br><br>However, being in fear for one\'s life must also have a reasonable<br>basis. It would be hard for anyone, police officers included, to see a<br>12 year old boy holding a lollipop, and claim that they were in fear for<br>their life. Therefore, the claim that being in fear for one\'s life can<br>be used as a universal defense and can never be refuted is simply<br>incorrect.<br><br>Additionally, being in fear for one\'s life is not unique to police<br>officers. Anyone can be in fear for their life. However, police officers<br>are definitely in that position more frequently than anyone else, so it<br>does appear to the outsider that police officers use that defense more<br>often than others.<br><br>And with the rise of individuals who are mentally unstable and seek to<br>kill police officers for the simple fact that they are police officers,<br>that defense seems to be used a lot more frequently than it used to be.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
