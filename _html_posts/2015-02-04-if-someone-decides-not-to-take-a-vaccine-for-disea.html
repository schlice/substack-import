<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Whether or not someone chooses to do something is not<br>necessarily something with which you should be concerned. If they choose<br>the disease and its potential side effects over the vaccine for the<br>disease, so be it. I would think about child endangerment charges, but<br>IANAL (I am not a lawmaker). Many of these diseases can cause permanent<br>disability, or even death, so in my humble opinion, the cure is not<br>worse than the disease, and the risk of the vaccine is much lower than<br>the risk of the actual disease itself.\<br>\<br>That said, however, the recent measles outbreak has shown us that our<br>vaccines are not 100% effective. In other words, a person who chooses to<br>not be vaccinated and contracts the disease can actually infect people<br>who have already been vaccinated because the vaccine was not 100%<br>effective. In the most recent outbreak of measles, we have seen this<br>happen: people who have been vaccinated have contracted the disease<br>anyway.\<br>\<br>We know that vaccines are not 100% effective, so the way to eradicate a<br>disease is to vaccinate the entire population to limit the spread of the<br>disease, and any exposures of the disease will eventually burn out with<br>limited casualties\<br>\<br>When people choose to not vaccinate, they not only endanger the person<br>who is not vaccinated (usually a child), but they also risk a virus<br>outbreak, since these diseases are highly contagious and vaccines are<br>not ever 100% effective.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
