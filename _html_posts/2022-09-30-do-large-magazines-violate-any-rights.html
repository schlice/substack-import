<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, large magazines do not violate any rights.<br><br>But the question becomes, what is "large?"<br><br>To a gun owner, "large" means "anything which greatly exceeds the<br>standard magazine designed for the firearm"<br><br>To a gun control advocate, "large" means "whatever I think is too many."<br><br>So a 100-round magazine is probably too large for an M-4, but not too<br>large for a SAW. But a 30-round magazine is just right for an M-4,<br>because that's the standard magazine for that firearm.<br><br>However, if we're talking about my Springfield XD-S compact .45 EDC<br>pistol, the "standard" magazine doesn't allow me to grip with my full<br>hand; my pinky barely catches the bottom of the grip. However, I can<br>replace the standard mag with the "extended" mag, get one extra round,<br>and have a place to rest my pinky, thus providing me with a better grip.<br>So does that make the "extended" magazine "large?"<br><br>Ultimately, I go back to my original point, the large magazine doesn't<br>violate anyone's rights. I'd argue that in some cases, the standard<br>magazine violates my right to grip my firearm firmly.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Do large magazines violate any rights?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
