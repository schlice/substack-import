<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you think that pharmaceuticals have contributed to school shootings<br>or mass shootings in the US?**<br><br>Only in a roundabout way.<br><br>Pharmaceuticals were one of the major drivers of<br>*deinstitutionalization*, or a de-emphasis on institutionalizing those<br>with mental issues, in favor of community clinics which could dispense<br>drugs to those who needed them.<br><br>Deinstitutionalization led to a whole host of issues, but primary is a<br>de-emphasis of mental illness in the United States, and the relegation<br>of treatment for even the most severely ill to community providers.<br><br>The remaining doctors who can prescribe drugs do not do any counseling,<br>and the counselors who help the mentally ill process their feelings and<br>emotions can't prescribe medications to help them do that. And ne'er the<br>twain shall meet, except in unusual circumstances (I know some doctors<br>who work very well with some counselors, and when the counselor<br>recommends a drug, the doctor writes the prescription, acting as the<br>"prescribing psychiatrist"). Otherwise, this schism prevents the<br>mentally ill from getting the treatment they so desperately need: a<br>combination of pharmaceuticals and therapy, which isn't provided in a<br>single location. There was a push during the Kennedy administration to<br>give some of those counseling providers "prescriptive authority," but<br>for any of them who are still alive, they're either retiring or no<br>longer practicing.<br><br>At any rate, this systemic de-emphasis on mental illness has made it<br>next to impossible to actually identify and treat the truly mentally<br>ill. Especially in our most vulnerable population: youth.<br><br>So while pharmaceuticals didn't cause the problem, it was the<br>over-reliance on pharmaceuticals, to the exclusion of inpatient care,<br>which shifted the overall focus of practice of mental illness, and the<br>subsequent de-emphasis on mental illness in America, relegating it to<br>the practice of supplementation and holistic medicine. Basically, any<br>treatment of anyone except for the truly schizoid insane is seen as<br>pseudoscience.<br><br>This entire system needs to be re-worked from the ground up.<br><br>Yes, there were problems with the mental institution system in the<br>United States, but dismantling it wholesale was not the answer. It was<br>that decision which has led to the inevitable buildup of those with<br>*treatable* mental conditions going untreated.<br><br>And solving their perceived problems with a gun.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
