<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Are we morally accountable for potential humans?<br><br>It depends on your moral code. As you may know, morality is individual.<br>There is no "collective morality" that the world ascribes to. I'd be<br>interested to hear someone's argument claiming that there is without<br>grounding that belief in something.<br><br>Anyway, since morals are not universal (each person could conceivably<br>have their own moral code), the answer is that you may or may not be<br>morally accountable for potential humans (fetuses).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
