You are required to present it to<br>law enforcement upon demand. It doesn't matter what that officer is<br>doing, or where he is. If you are the operator of a vehicle, and an<br>officer demands to see your license, you are required by law to present<br>it. Period, full stop.<br><br>If it's a walking checkpoint, you are not driving a car, so you are not<br>required to possess or show any identification. We don't have "papers"<br>that can be demanded at any time anywhere.<br><br>The only documentation required of you is your license *when you are<br>driving a car.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
