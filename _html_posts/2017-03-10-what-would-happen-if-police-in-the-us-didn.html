<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>- Crime in general would skyrocket, especially violent crimes with guns,<br>  since only criminals would have guns. Citizens who choose to remain<br>  unarmed would be completely defenseless.<br>- Self-defense shootings would skyrocket, as the only people able to<br>  defend themselves would be armed citizens.<br>- Police officers would become targets of every lawless criminal and<br>  crazed half-baked nutjob who believes that police are all racist and<br>  gets a wild hair and decides to go kill some cops. This will lead to<br>  many officers quitting, as they would rather take off the uniform so<br>  they can be an armed civilian than wear the uniform and become an<br>  unarmed walking target.<br><br>In short, states would become ineffective at enforcing their laws, and<br>would eventually have to call *someone* with guns (i.e. the National<br>Guard) to restore order.<br><br>So the short answer is that only people with guns can maintain order<br>amongst other people with guns.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
