<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Trump is pushing to reopen schools in the US in the fall. The only<br>known way to ensure an area is free of covid-19, given asymptomatic<br>carriers, is testing. How will Trump provide the 100 million tests per<br>day required to reopen schools safely?**<br><br>You're absolutely correct. We're doing hundreds of thousands of tests in<br>a single day, but that's nowhere near the millions of tests per day we<br>would need to rapidly test everyone. But it's not 100 million, because<br>if we had the capacity to test 100 million people in a single day, we'd<br>have testing of the entire population of the United States completed in<br>one week. There's only 340 million people in the country. So we<br>definitely need to be able to test millions in a day, but maybe not 100<br>million.<br><br>Regardless, we can't test that many yet, because of a severe shortage of<br>testing kits, because of an unprecedented shortage of testing chemicals<br>and supplies. Guess Trump was right and we should have returned<br>manufacturing to the United States so we didn't have to rely on China<br>for all of these supplies, eh?<br><br>Facing this shortage, scientists are coming up with new ways to test.<br>One novel approach being looked at is group tests. By pooling<br>samples from many people into a few groups and then evaluating the<br>groups, scientists think they can test more people with fewer tests. The<br>strategy has been used in the past to successfully detect cases of HIV,<br>chlamydia, malaria and influenza, and was originally conceived during<br>World War II to test thousands of military personnel for syphilis.<br><br>If the group tests negative, you can safely move on. If the group tests<br>positive, you can focus on that group and do contact tracing to find the<br>actual infections.<br><br>Here's an example of how that works:<br><br>> Let's say you are examining 100 people, and one of them is positive.<br>> Normally you would do 100 diagnostic tests, searching for genetic<br>> material from the virus in each individual. But with group testing,<br>> you can divide those 100 people into five groups of 20. That gives you<br>> five pools with 20 samples, and you use one test per pool. If the<br>> first four sample pools test negative, you have eliminated 80 people<br>> with four tests. If the last pool tests positive, you retest each<br>> sample in that last pool individually to identify the one with the<br>> disease. In the end, you did 25 tests instead of<br>> 100.\[1\](#DnbIj){#cite-DnbIj .citation_link}<br><br>This is an attractive option for scientists trying to do more with less.<br><br>But there's a catch. Group testing is only effective if the prevalence<br>of the disease is low. As the prevalence of the disease increases, the<br>effectiveness of group testing decreases. So in the above example, if<br>four of the groups show positive, you're still doing 85 tests instead of<br>25. It's a savings, but as you can see, the more groups that test<br>positive, the more individual tests you must do.<br><br>Scientists believe that testing a relatively asymptomatic population in<br>this way is a great method to monitor for a second wave, find out what<br>groups to focus on, and clear groups of people to return to work and<br>school.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-DnbIj){.citation_index} [[Coronavirus Test Shortages<br>Trigger a New Strategy: Group<br>Screening](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=95f403&url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coronavirus-test-shortages-trigger-a-new-strategy-group-screening2/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="scientificamerican.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
