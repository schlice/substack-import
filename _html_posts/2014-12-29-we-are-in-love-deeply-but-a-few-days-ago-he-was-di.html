<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [First of all, if you are truly in love, then nothing<br>should stand in your way, not even MS.\<br>\<br>Your doctor told you how it \"could\" be, but in fact, no one knows how<br>it will be. MS is a very individual disease, and everyone who gets it<br>will experience it differently. They will have different symptoms (out<br>of a range of symptoms), different rates of relapse, and different<br>levels of disability. Some of us have been blessed with this disease and<br>have little disease activity, some of us get this disease and it runs<br>rampant.\<br>\<br>What I can tell you is that the vast majority of people with MS will go<br>on to have normal lifespans and (mostly) normal lives. We do have to<br>manage our disease, actively. You have to make sure you continue to<br>exercise, you have to make sure to keep your muscles strong, and you<br>have to keep your mind active. You have to take one of the approved MS<br>therapy drugs, because that is the only proven way to slow the course of<br>the disease and to limit its effects. Doing these two things gives you<br>the best chance of living a full life with MS.\<br>\<br>Your doctor told you how it \"could\" be, which I\'m certain was pretty<br>scary. He probably said that your boyfriend/fiance√© could end up walking<br>with a cane, be confined to a wheelchair, or end up completely bedridden<br>because of MS. This is true, but it is a small percentage of people. As<br>I mentioned, the vast majority of people will go on to live mostly<br>normal lives, having to make some lifestyle changes, and taking<br>medications.\<br>\<br>Don\'t let the fact that he has MS ruin your life together. He\'s still<br>the same person you fell in love with. He just has a few new struggles<br>to deal with. You can help him through those struggles. If you\'re not<br>prepared to do that for someone, then maybe you\'re not ready to be<br>married yet. But if you are, he will need someone to lean on, to share<br>his struggles with, and to reassure him and encourage him in his MS<br>journey. It\'s not a hard job, but his disease could get worse down the<br>road, and you\'d have to be a caregiver as well as a wife. You have to<br>be prepared to do that, but in marriage, we pledge ourselves \"for<br>better or worse, in sickness and in health\" so this is part of the<br>marriage vow.\<br>\<br>I hope this helps.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
