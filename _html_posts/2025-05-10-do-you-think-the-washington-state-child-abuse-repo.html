<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I highly doubt it.<br><br>The court has a mixed history with religious freedom, but what it does<br>not have mixed opinions on is whether or not a law which violates a<br>deeply-held religious belief is constitutional. The court recently ruled<br>in the Hobby Lobby case that Obamacare's birth control mandate was<br>unconstitutional because it violated the owner's deeply-held religious<br>belief. The Court also ruled in the Masterpiece cake shop case that a<br>state's non-discrimination law violated the owner's deeply-held<br>religious beliefs. So it's pretty clear that when the court finds a law<br>violates a deeply-held religious belief, the law is unconstitutional.<br>And even if the law does require priests to testify about communications<br>during confession when they are subpoenaed to do so, those same laws do<br>not require priests to be "mandatory reporters" of what they heard in<br>confession.<br><br>I am almost certain that the court will similarly find that Washington's<br>mandatory reporting law will also be found to violate the First<br>Amendment, as it demands that Catholic priests violate their deeply-held<br>religious beliefs in order to obey the law. For the Catholic, the seal<br>of Confession is inviolate. A priest can be excommunicated for doing so.<br>I highly doubt that any priest would ever do so.<br><br>While I am unaware of any cases where a priest has been charged for<br>failing to report a crime in violation of a law, the priest also has to<br>contend with the fact that they would face excommunication and would be<br>committing what Catholics refer to as a "mortal sin" by doing so. The<br>Louisiana Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that while a priest doesn\'t have<br>a duty to report confidential information learned during confession, he<br>can be compelled to testify about communications during confession, or<br>face jail time for contempt if he does not. As far as I can see, this<br>law has never been tested.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
