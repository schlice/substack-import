<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I don't think so.<br><br>First, let's clarify something. *Biden* didn't destroy our chemical<br>weapons stockpile. This is a process which has been going on for<br>decades, and it just happened to *complete* under Biden's term. The US<br>and the Soviet Union agreed in principle to destroy their stockpiles of<br>chemical weapons in 1989, and they signed the Chemical Weapons<br>Convention Agreement in 1997, which is when large-scale chemical weapons<br>destruction began.<br><br>For decades, the United States has only vowed to use chemical weapons in<br>response to use by another nation against us, and then proceeded to<br>build a stockpile of chemical weapons so large that no other nation<br>would ever dare do so.<br><br>But now, we have completely destroyed our *declared* stockpile of<br>chemical weapons (which, of course, begs the question of whether or not<br>we have any *undeclared* chemical weapons, but that's another question<br>for another day). This concludes our responsibilities under the<br>multinational Chemical Weapons Convention Agreement, ratified by<br>Congress in 1997.<br><br>So the question remains: does this make us less safe as a nation?<br><br>The answer is mostly no. Most other major nations have also destroyed<br>their stockpiles of chemical weapons: Britain in 2007, India in 2009,<br>Russia in 2017. But according to the Pentagon, chemical weapons have not<br>been eradicated entirely. A few nations never signed the treaty, and<br>some that did, notably Russia, appear to have retained undeclared<br>stocks, which definitely increases the likelihood that we, too, retained<br>some undeclared stocks.<br><br>Also, the treaty did not end the use of chemical weapons by rogue states<br>and terrorist groups. Forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria<br>used chemical weapons there numerous times between 2013 and 2019.<br>According to the IHS Conflict Monitor, a London-based intelligence<br>collection and analysis service, fighters from the Islamic State used<br>chemical weapons at least 52 times in Iraq and Syria from 2014 to 2016.<br>We know that Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons against the Kurds in<br>the 1980s. But they were doing that even while we still retained a<br>massive stockpile of chemical weapons. Their use of the weapons weren't<br>altered by the fact that we had them.<br><br>But does our destruction of our stockpile of chemical weapons make the<br>United States any less safe? It would only be true if the destruction of<br>our stockpile would make a rogue state or terrorist group more likely to<br>use chemical weapons against us. The original thought was that doing so<br>would cause us to use our chemical weapons against them, but the United<br>States has not used chemical weapons in warfare since 1918 (note we did<br>use herbicides like Agent Orange in Vietnam which were harmful to<br>humans, but not as a chemical weapon against humans). So if it's<br>unlikely that we would have used them anyway, then their presence or<br>absence will not change our security status.<br><br>And even when we do not use the identical tactics against our enemies<br>that they use against us (we never hijacked any Middle Eastern airliners<br>and flew them into Osama Bin Laden's major cities), we still bring<br>massive force to bear against them, and we still prevail. Any nation<br>using any weapon of war against our people will incur swift and decisive<br>retaliatory action. We have never wavered in this commitment.<br><br>It is for these reasons that I do not believe that we have become less<br>safe because of the destruction of our chemical weapons stockpile.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
