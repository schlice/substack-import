<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is yes.<br><br>God gives you free will. He allows you to accept or reject him freely.<br>He does not demand that you believe in him.<br><br>He has given us ample evidence in this world of his existence, but he<br>has avoided giving us his *direct presence*, which would be so powerful<br>and overwhelming that we would be unable to doubt his existence, and<br>thus would be unable to reject him. God has provided enough evidence to<br>convince anyone who chooses to believe, but has left enough doubt so as<br>to not compel the unwilling.<br><br>So if you *choose*, you have the right to be the god of your own life.<br>You have the ability to determine whether or not this is the correct<br>choice, however.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Does a human have the right to be the god of their own life?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
