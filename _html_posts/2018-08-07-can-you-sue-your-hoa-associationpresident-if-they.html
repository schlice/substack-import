<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you sue your HOA association/president if they caused a potential<br>buyer to back out of their contract on your home? The HOA president<br>confronted the new buyer for going over our 15 mph speed limit, and it<br>escalated to the point of no return.**<br><br>As we've often said here on Quora, you can sue anyone for anything.<br><br>The real kicker is whether or not you have a chance of winning.<br><br>In this case, you have little chance of prevailing.<br><br>First of all, there is no affirmative obligation for anyone to buy your<br>house. Even if there is an agreement to sign a contract, each individual<br>is free to choose, for whatever reason they want, to not enter into that<br>agreement. You may not be happy with the HOA president, but he incurs no<br>liability for causing someone to change their attitude about the<br>neighborhood and choose not to buy a home.<br><br>Secondly, if the HOA owns the roads (i.e. it's a gated community), then<br>the HOA is responsible for ensuring that the speed limit is enforced,<br>regardless of whether or not the person is a resident, a guest, or a<br>potential owner. The speed limits are presumably in place to keep people<br>safe, so if people are so flippant with them, perhaps they weren't the<br>right fit for the neighborhood anyway. The HOA president is completely<br>within his rights to confront speeders.<br><br>I'm sorry the contract fell through, and you might want to blame that<br>loss on the HOA president, and you might even be right to do so. But in<br>terms of liability, there isn't really any here that I can see.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not legal advice**, nor is it intended to be used as<br>a substitute for legal advice.
