<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Most departments use the \"safest stop location\" rule<br>when directing their officers on how to make a traffic stop. Officers<br>will direct you to the safest location in which to stop your vehicle,<br>either by waiting until you have passed the bridge, or directing you via<br>the overhead PA system in the patrol car where to stop your vehicle.\<br>\<br>Regardless, if the officer initiates the stop on the bridge, by all<br>means, stop on the bridge. If he wants you to continue past the bridge,<br>he will indicate this using the PA system.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
