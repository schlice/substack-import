<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a really significant question. Most people, including many of<br>the people who have answered this question, say that the Sabbath day is<br>a day of "rest." They frequently say God "rested" on the Sabbath.<br><br>But stop and think for a second. *Does the Almighty God of the Universeâ„¢<br>need to rest?*<br><br>No. He does not. He is *all* powerful. He needs *nothing*, not the<br>least of which is *rest*.<br><br>So calling the Sabbath day a "day of rest" is actually not an accurate<br>translation.<br><br>The Hebrew word translated as "rest" in Genesis 2:2 actually also means<br>"to cease or stop."<br><br>To that end, God "rested" on the seventh day because He was done. He<br>didn't need to create anything else. It was a purposeful stop.<br>Everything He desired to create had been made. He looked at His<br>creation, declared it "very good" (Genesis 1:31), and ceased from His<br>activity.<br><br>Six days of creation, and one day of ceasing from work. This actually is<br>what formed our modern seven-day week. We work for six days, and we<br>cease work on the seventh. God provided us the model for how to<br>structure our own lives, and it led to our current seven-day week,<br>although many today also cease work on the day before the Sabbath.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
