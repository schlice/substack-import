<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Thanks for the A2A.\<br>\<br>Before I get into my answer, I want to comment on the video clip you<br>posted, which is not necessarily the question I answered. The people<br>rioting in Baltimore are not \"peaceful protesters\" unjustly abused by<br>police. They are criminals and everyone from the President on down<br>has said so. They attack the police, and if you attack a cop, you<br>deserve what you get. Don\'t want to be abused by the police? Start by<br>not attacking them.\<br>\<br>There is not a single incidence of true police brutality that doesn\'t<br>break my heart. When you see a cop dishonor his oath, it literally,<br>physically hurts to watch.\<br>\<br>But lately, *every* use of force has been splayed across your electronic<br>screens, and not all of them should have. Especially in our current<br>cameras-everywhere-instant-news-hyperaware culture, any incident which<br>someone deems to be even the slightest bit violent ends up \"going<br>viral\" and contributes to the ongoing narrative of \"See, there\'s<br>those brutal cops again.\"\<br>\<br>If there are true bad cops out there (and there are some), I\'d like to<br>personally throw them a blanket party. If you don\'t know what that is,<br>ask one of your military (or former military) friends.\<br>\<br>But we also need to be honest with ourselves. What you see in a<br>10-second video clip is not \"the whole story.\" It never is. There is<br>always something else that contributes to why what you are seeing in the<br>clip is happening. And it is all the things that you *don\'t* see that<br>go towards justification. The court uses the entirety of the<br>circumstances to determine if there was justification in what the<br>officer did. Did he fear for his life? Did he have to protect the safety<br>of the general public? What happened before the clip that led to the<br>officer\'s decisions?\<br>\<br>Now please don\'t respond to me with a clip and incredulously ask me if<br>I think it\'s justified. I\'m not on the grand jury. I\'m not in the<br>officer\'s chain of command. I\'m not doing the UOF (use of force)<br>review. But you must understand that *every time* a police officer<br>uses *ANY* level of force in any situation, he must complete a Use<br>Of Force form which is reviewed along with the incident reports from<br>every officer on the scene. Every reported injury to a suspect is<br>documented and is tied back to the UOF form and the incident reports.<br>Any bump or bruise that is missing is questioned. Any video surveillance<br>is added to the body of evidence used during a UOF review. If charges<br>need to be brought, the case is turned over to the District Attorney. If<br>administrative punishments need to be handed out, they are, as the<br>officer\'s chain of command is involved in the UOF review. There are<br>also representatives from the Training division of the department, so<br>that if a training deficiency is seen, training can be developed or<br>augmented to train (or re-train) officers.\<br>\<br>The police take this stuff seriously. The legal system takes this stuff<br>seriously. The fact that you don\'t see the behind-the-scenes reviews<br>that police do EVERY. TIME. force is used doesn\'t mean it doesn\'t<br>exist, or that police don\'t care. Perhaps we should pressure Dateline<br>or 20/20 to do an expos√© on police department administration. But they<br>won\'t, because it\'s boring. It\'s administrative. Everyone wants to<br>know about it, but no one wants to see it.\<br>\<br>And please don\'t respond to me that the police can\'t police<br>themselves. Everyone has heard of \"Internal Affairs.\" Those are the<br>cops that police the cops. TV likes to portray IA as the cops that no<br>one likes, because they come down on cops who are just trying to do<br>their jobs. There may be some truth to that sentiment, but for the most<br>part, IA is doing the internal investigations into police officer<br>misconduct that finds the bad cops and directs re-training, reprimands<br>them or recommends their discharge. For that, we are grateful. It\'s one<br>less blanket party I have to throw.\<br>\<br>If there are true instances of police brutality out there, it truly<br>sickens me. Those officers \"tarnish the badge\" and make an already<br>uncomfortable situation worse. However, in truth, those incidents are<br>few and far between when compared with the number of times officers have<br>to use force. They do happen, but they are very closely monitored, and<br>if action is needed to be taken, it is.\<br>\<br>I think officers tend to get defensive about this because people tend to<br>*generalize*. They see one incident of an officer\'s poor behavior and<br>generalize that behavior across every officer who has ever worn, or who<br>will ever wear, a badge. They see one officer behave inappropriately and<br>they say, \"all officers behave badly; I\'m going to disobey officers<br>from now on, for my own safety\" instead of saying, \"wow, glad we found<br>that one bad apple and sent him to jail.\" Should I look at students who<br>shoot up high schools and say, \"all high school students behave badly,<br>we need to have full body searches of all students who walk into high<br>schools because they all are about to shoot up their schools\"? Of<br>course you wouldn\'t think that. But people make that generalization<br>about police officers every day, and the media is their willing<br>accomplice. More and more people are routinely disobeying police<br>officers\' directives because they are foolish enough to believe that if<br>they comply, something bad will happen. In actuality, it is exactly the<br>opposite: failure to comply will lead to bad stuff happening, so it is<br>their misguided beliefs that end up getting them in trouble. Just look<br>at this question:\<br>\<br>[[Get on the ground! Do it now! Why should I comply with<br>this?](https://www.quora.com/Why-should-I-comply-when-a-police-officer-says-Get-on-the-ground-Do-it-now/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}\<br>\<br>I would never stop to think \"Hmm, an officer is telling me to get on<br>the ground in a very loud voice. I\'m unsure if I should comply with<br>this directive.\" But this, clearly, (even by this very question), is<br>where people\'s minds are going. This makes for a very dangerous and<br>volatile situation for police officers. Not only do we have to deal with<br>the nutjobs and fruit-loops of society who won\'t follow directions<br>because their \"alien overlords in the mothership\" are directing them<br>to, and I should just look them up in the \"universal computer\" (btw:<br>real statements from real fruit-loops), but now we have to deal with<br>regular (non-crazy) citizens who believe with all their heart that<br>following the law will get you hurt. Thanks, mass media.\<br>\<br>I predict that you will see an uptick in the use of non-lethal force,<br>like the TASER. Sadly, officers will spend brain cycles questioning<br>their decision to use deadly force in situations requiring the use of<br>force. It\'s sad because more officers will be killed because of their<br>indecision. Fewer citizens will die, but more officers will. Is that an<br>acceptable trade-off for you?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
