<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The problem here is that mandating something, *either way* (either<br>mandating that all customers in all state businesses be vaccinated,<br>OR mandating that no businesses can use vaccination status as a<br>means of discrimination of patrons), infringes on the rights of<br>businesses to decide whether or not they choose to allow only vaccinated<br>people to patronize their stores. If the state *didn't* push back on the<br>Federal government, they would have come in and demanded vaccination for<br>everyone.<br><br>Florida has decided, as a state government, that they do not want<br>vaccination status to be a discriminating factor anywhere in the state.<br>For one, it's unfair to people who had COVID and recovered (who also<br>have immunity). I won't go into all of Florida's justifications for<br>their law. Suffice it to say that to accomplish this, they banned any<br>business from asking for vaccination passports, or from using<br>vaccination status to discriminate against patrons.<br><br>If a business wants to protect itself, they can buy COVID tests for<br>everyone who walks in the door. Rapid tests do exist, they can provide<br>results in 15--30 minutes. They can also enforce social distancing and<br>mask wearing in the store. The CDC says these measures work, so<br>businesses can do this if they choose.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>The national Review reports that Florida businesses that require proof<br>of vaccination can be fined up to 5,000 dollars. Why can't customers go<br>to restaurants or stores that don't require vaccinations and honor the<br>ones who do?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
