<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No.<br><br>God will accept you right now, as you are. Broken, battered, and at<br>the end of our rope, not perfect and shiny.<br><br>> But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still<br>> sinners, Christ died for us.\<br>> --- Romans 5:8 NIV<br><br>Jesus didn't come to heal the *well*, he came to heal the *sick*. And<br>all you have to do is repent and believe.<br><br>It's as simple as ABC:<br><br>- Admit to God (and to yourself) that you are a sinner and without<br>  him you are lost.<br>- Believe that Christ died as a penal substitute for your sins<br>- Confess that Jesus Christ is your Lord and savior, and Commit<br>  to turn away from your old life of sin.<br><br>AFTER you are saved, God will begin the long work of helping you<br>clean up your act. It's a lifelong process called *sanctification*. With<br>each passing day, the old ways will fade away, and you'll learn a new<br>way to live. It takes effort, but keep it up, because God will never,<br>ever give up on you.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Do I have to clean up my act before God can forgive me?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
