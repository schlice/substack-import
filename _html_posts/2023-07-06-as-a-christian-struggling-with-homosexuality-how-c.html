<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, thank you for asking the question. I am thankful that you are<br>embracing the truth of the Bible and that you understand that acting out<br>your attraction through homosexual acts would be sinful. Therefore, you<br>say you are struggling to be faithful to that conviction. That's good,<br>and noble, and the struggle is pleasing to God.<br><br>The struggle helps us realize that we cannot overcome any of our sin<br>alone. It is only through His power that we can.<br><br>Paul addressed exactly this problem in the early church in Corinth.<br>There were people then (over 2000 years ago) struggling with exactly the<br>same thing. So it's important to understand that not only are you not<br>alone, but you're not the first to ever have to deal with this.<br><br>Paul wrote the following to them:<br><br>> Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of<br>> God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters<br>> nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the<br>> greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the<br>> kingdom of God. --- 1 Corinthians 6:9--10 NIV<br><br>So this is where most people get the information that the Bible<br>prohibits homosexuality. But in case you glossed over it,<br>homosexuality is not the only sin addressed here. Paul also<br>addresses the sexually immoral, idolaters, adulterers, thieves, those<br>who are greedy, drunkards, slanderers and swindlers. That's not to<br>compare you to them, but it is to show that your particular sin is not<br>being picked on here. ALL of these sins---if you love them, embrace<br>them, pursue them, live in them---will ultimately destroy you. Not just<br>homosexuality.<br><br>But Paul goes on and gives some information that is *absolutely crucial*<br>in the struggle against sin:<br><br>> And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were<br>> sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ<br>> and by the Spirit of our God. --- 1 Corinthians 6:11 NIV<br><br>These words are *massively* important to someone who struggles with<br>same-sex attraction and hopes to be pure and holy in their life. The<br>first sentence there says "And that is what some of you were." You<br>were that. You practiced homosexuality in the past. You are **no<br>longer that. Why? What happened? How were** you that, and now are<br>no longer that? The answer is in the next sentence: you were<br>*washed*, you were *sanctified*, you were *justified*. You were *washed*<br>in the blood of Christ when you accepted Him as your Savior and you put<br>your faith in Him. You were *sanctified* when that happened; you were<br>declared righteous. And you were *justified* in those things. How? In<br>the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.<br><br>There it is. It is the power of the Holy Spirit that is the key to<br>overcoming this daily struggle.<br><br>Have you ever heard the phrase, "God doesn't give you more than you can<br>handle"? Well, that's untrue. God always gives you more than you can<br>handle, because He wants you to lean on Him for strength in overcoming<br>those challenges. Paul talks about it later in the same letter to the<br>people of Corinth:<br><br>> No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And<br>> God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can<br>> bear.<br><br>This first part of the verse is where people get the idea that "God<br>won't give you what you can't handle." But they miss the second part,<br>which must be examined in context:<br><br>> But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you<br>> can endure it. --- 1 Corinthians 10:13 NIV<br><br>God does give you what you cannot handle, because He gives you **a way<br>out so that you can endure** it. And what is it that He gives you?<br>Paul mentioned it in Chapter 6 verse 11: *the spirit of our God*. The<br>Holy Spirit.<br><br>The takeaway here is that **God gives you the Holy Spirit to help you<br>through your struggles.** What this means on a day to day basis is that<br>first, you must know that when you put your true faith in Christ as your<br>savior, you are accepted, forgiven, washed clean, declared righteous,<br>sanctified, and justified. Then, you trust that God gives you the Holy<br>Spirit to come in power and help you resist temptation. You "put to<br>death" the desires of the flesh (cf Romans 8:13) and you rely on the<br>Spirit. You call upon the Spirit. You live in the Spirit.<br><br>It is not by your efforts, but by His grace. He graciously gives you the<br>Spirit to help you with your struggles.<br><br>When you hear the promise, you believe in it, you rely on it, you live<br>in it, and you put your faith and trust in it, you can be sure that God<br>will send the Spirit to help you. When He does, He makes the promise of<br>God's reward more precious to you than the power of the temptation you<br>are facing, and then you are able to overcome it.<br><br>It's the easiest thing to do, and yet it's the hardest thing to do. It's<br>a free gift that will cost you your life. You have turned your life over<br>to Christ. Now rely on that faith and God's promise to send His Spirit<br>to help you live a pure and useful life without sexual sin.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
