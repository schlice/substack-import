<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I was waiting for [[Rick<br>Bruno](https://www.quora.com/profile/Rick-Bruno-1)]{.qlink_container} to<br>answer this, but I will answer from what I know.<br><br>I was not a K9 handler, but I often participated as a \"chew toy\" for<br>the K9s. I\'m a dog person; I love dogs, so when they asked the other<br>guys on the shift if anyone wanted to \"play\" with the dog, I totally<br>volunteered.<br><br>From my experience, the dog bites hard, but the thing that really<br>\"strikes\" you is the force with which the dog hits. Doesn\'t<br>matter how fast you can run, the dog is faster. Doesn\'t matter how big<br>you are, the force of that initial hit will knock you off your feet.<br>I\'ve tried it both ways: running, and feet firmly planted. Dog kicked<br>my butt.<br><br>And most importantly (and answering your question), the dog will<br>continue to attack until the officer gives the command to stop, and the<br>dog will stop instantly. Dogs do not understand the nuances of<br>\"surrender,\" nor should they have to. It\'s up to the K9 officer to<br>control the dog and \"release\" the dog when the suspect is no longer<br>deemed a threat.<br><br>So to answer your question, the dog will attack when it receives its<br>attack command, and it will continue attacking until it gets its release<br>command. The dog doesn\'t take cues from the suspect, it takes cues from<br>its handler.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
