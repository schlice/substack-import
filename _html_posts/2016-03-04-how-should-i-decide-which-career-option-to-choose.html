<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You\'re already in AFJROTC; have you thought about joining the Air<br>Force?<br><br>You could check off lots of the items on your list:<br><br>- Creating solutions to problems<br>- Getting stuff done<br>- Working with other people<br>- Helping / training others<br>- Creating / implementing plans<br>- Being a role model<br>- Being organized<br><br>If you\'re still in high school (which I assume from the fact that you<br>list AFJROTC), going to college and doing actual ROTC would make you an<br>officer in the military, which would check off the following extra<br>items:<br><br>- Leading / being a role model<br>- Managing<br><br>Even if you don\'t go the college route, coming out of AFJROTC, you\'ll<br>start higher in rank if you enlist, which means extra money.<br><br>My advice (which you can do with what you wish) is to take this list to<br>your local Air Force recruiter. Even if there isn\'t an available career<br>field that lets you do CAD/CAM, there are plenty of fields that allow<br>you to work with some of the highest tech stuff we have available today.<br><br>But whatever you do, I wish you well. Good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
