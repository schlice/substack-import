<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, it is not possible to "change another person's mind." You do not<br>have any mystical mind-altering kinesis ability to modify someone's<br>mind.<br><br>At best, what you can do, *for someone who is open to re-examining their<br>beliefs*, is to get them to do just that: re-examine their beliefs.<br><br>It is important for you to understand that this only apply to those who<br>are willing to re-examine what they believe, in light of new evidence<br>that they may not have known before. If someone is unwilling to modify<br>their core beliefs, there is no amount of talking that will "change<br>their minds."<br><br>But if they are willing to re-examine their beliefs, presentation of<br>adequate evidence may induce them into taking the time to re-examine<br>whether or not their belief holds up to scrutiny and is still logical<br>and rational given the new facts you provided.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it possible to change another person\'s mind when they zealously hold<br>on to their viewpoint, for example, the pro life/pro choice debate,<br>their anti vaccination stance or loyal support for Donald Trump?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
