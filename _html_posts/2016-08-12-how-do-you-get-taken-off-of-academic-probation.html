<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is only one way to get off of AcPro.<br><br>IMPROVE YOUR GRADES.<br><br>You usually get yourself on AcPro when your GPA drops below 2.0. When<br>you're on AcPro, (depending on institution), you are either required to<br>have a tutor or required to attend mandatory study time (usually both).<br>Take advantage of those. Improve your grades. That's the only fix for<br>AcPro.<br><br>Oh. and the two letters that will help you more than anything else: E I.<br>Extra Instruction. I have it on good authority that teachers won't fail<br>students who come in regularly for EI. It's not a sign of weakness to<br>get help, and most teachers I know will go out of their way to help<br>students who ask (i.e. come in early, stay late, etc).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
