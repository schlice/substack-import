<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Relationships are far more complicated than you are making<br>them out to be in your question. You can\'t reliably predict what will<br>happen to two people simply because you have classified their mental<br>disorders.\<br>\<br>The scenario you laid out is one possibility. There are plenty of other<br>possibilities as well. They may get together and find such happiness<br>that it overcomes the tendencies of their personality disorders and they<br>stay together. They may get together and it becomes abusive.\<br>\<br>There are as many possibilities as there are people to live them<br>out.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
