<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes. If you believe in things that can't be substantiated by evidence,<br>or if you believe in things that conflict with reason, you believe in<br>fairy tales. It may not be an illness per se, but it certainly is not a<br>substantiated belief.<br><br>Religion is no different. Believing in something with no evidence<br>doesn't really seem like a very valid belief, right?<br><br>Absolutely right.<br><br>But religion in general is not always believing in things that can't be<br>substantiated by evidence. Belief that God exists can absolutely be<br>substantiated by evidence and is perfectly reasonable, so it would<br>certainly not be mental illness to believe it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
