<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What can be done? My apartment building has a constant theft problem.<br>Some lowlife keeps on stealing everyone else\'s packages.**<br><br>1.  If your apartment has peepholes, replace your peephole with a [[Ring<br>    Peephole<br>    Camera](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9d130a&url=https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Peephole-Cam-doorbell-installation/dp/B07WHMQNPC){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}. It doesn't damage the<br>    door, it just replaces your existing peephole with a Ring camera. It<br>    still detects motion and records video. It even detects when someone<br>    knocks on your door and alerts you.<br>2.  If you buy from Amazon, consider having your items shipped to a<br>    nearby [[Amazon<br>    Locker](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f91063&url=https://www.amazon.com/b?ie%3DUTF8%26node%3D6442600011){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br>3.  Get together with your neighbors and agree that if any of you see a<br>    package sitting out that you'll take it in until the recipient gets<br>    home. Neighbors taking care of neighbors.<br>4.  Maybe your complex can help. If they have the space, maybe you can<br>    ship your packages to the front office, and then you can go pick<br>    them up when you get home. Your front office may not consent to<br>    doing this because they don't have the resources or the space to<br>    store packages, but maybe they will.<br>5.  Maybe your complex can invest in some better security, either<br>    increasing their existing security patrols or hallway cameras.<br>6.  You can always try reaching out to the local police department for<br>    tips on what to do and how they may be able to help.<br>7.  If none of this makes any difference, move. You should talk to your<br>    local tenants rights organization about making a claim that the<br>    complex has breached their contract by not providing adequate safety<br>    and security.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
