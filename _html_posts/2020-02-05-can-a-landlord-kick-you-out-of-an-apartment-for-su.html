It's an apartment and there are<br>certain concessions you have to make to live in an apartment. One of<br>those concessions is walking softly and not disturbing your neighbors.<br>Your lease agreement should also say this.<br><br>I know. I'm currently sitting in my 3rd floor apartment. And sometimes<br>my cat is noisy, and I have to get up out of bed and sit with him in the<br>recliner until he falls asleep, so that his meowing won't disturb the<br>neighbors. And I have to take special care to walk softly so as not to<br>disturb the neighbors below me (even though their kids don't offer the<br>same courtesy at 0700 on school days, meh).<br><br>Anyway, if you've received enough noise complaints, and the landlord has<br>followed the rules in the lease about notifying you about your<br>violations of the lease, they can legally begin eviction proceedings for<br>violating the terms of your lease.<br><br>Just be kind to your neighbors. You share walls and floors and ceilings<br>in an apartment. A little kindness goes a long way, even if others don't<br>show it to you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
