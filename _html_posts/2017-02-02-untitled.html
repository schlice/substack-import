<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*I don't consider that an infringement of free speech, but the<br>enforcement of separation of church and state.*<br><br>That's actually the embodiment of the entanglement between church and<br>state! The state is telling churches how and when they can exercise<br>their First Amendment rights, and they are using tax-exempt status to do<br>it!<br><br>What other rights in the Bill of Rights should we hold hostage to that<br>same status? "Hey churches, you can keep the right to be free from<br>unreasonable search and seizure, as long as you pay taxes!" "Hey<br>churches, you can be free from cruel and unusual punishment, as long as<br>you pay taxes!"<br><br>You do not purchase your First Amendment rights with tax-exempt status.<br>Without a compelling state interest, you cannot restrict any right<br>granted by the Constitution. There is no compelling state interest in<br>restricting the speech of the pulpit.<br><br>Yet this law has not been overturned yet. Why? Because the IRS refuses<br>to enforce it. Every year, several thousand pastors give sermons<br>*directly in violation of the Johnson Amendment.* They preach about<br>political candidates, politics in general, and the government in<br>particular. There were over 1,800 pastors last year who did it. And yet,<br>the IRS hasn't removed tax-exempt status from any one. Why do you think<br>that is? Because they don't want the Johnson Amendment to actually go to<br>court. Because they know that if it does, it will be found to be an<br>unconstitutional restriction of free speech, and then it will be gone.<br><br>They'd like to keep it on the books, unconstitutional or otherwise,<br>because sadly many pastors simply abrogate their rights and refuse to<br>stand up for them, and muzzle and censor themselves, to avoid any<br>entanglement with the law. The government is quite happy with this<br>arrangement, despite the pastors who openly violate the law, hoping for<br>a test case.<br><br>The amendment violates multiple tenets of the First Amendment, namely<br>the Free Speech Clause, the Establishment Clause, and the Free Exercise<br>Clause. The government knows this, and so the two thousand or so pastors<br>who blatantly violate the amendment will simply go unpunished. You can<br>only restrict the First Amendment if you can show that there is a<br>*compelling state interest* to do so. There is no compelling state<br>interest in restricting the free speech of a pastor. It also violates<br>the Free Exercise clause because a pastor is not free to exercise the<br>entirety of his religion, and violates the Establishment Clause because<br>it forces the government into determining when speech has crossed some<br>perceived threshold and becomes "too political." It violates the Free<br>Speech clause several times, requiring the government to restrict free<br>speech simply based on the content of that speech (the SCOTUS has ruled<br>against this kind of speech discrimination for decades), and also by<br>conditioning tax exemption on refraining from certain types of speech.<br>In other words, if a church wants their tax exemption, they can't speak<br>on any and all issues addressed by Scripture. This is an<br>unconstitutional restriction on free speech.<br><br>I'm glad you're not confused, because that simply means you're<br>under-informed. Please read through my comments, and perhaps you'll<br>start to see why this is not only unconstitutional, but it violates the<br>very principle of separation of church and state that we try so hard to<br>uphold.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Trump-vows-to-end-prohibition-on-church-political-activity-will-this-decision-change-the-United-States-forever/answer/Cathi-Brunacini<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
