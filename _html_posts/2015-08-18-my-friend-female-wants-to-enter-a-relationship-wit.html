<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You can\'t \"convince\" anyone of anything. She\'s 19, she<br>can do what she chooses with her life.\<br>\<br>Stand in one spot. Draw a circle around your feet. You have control over<br>everything inside the circle. You have no control over anything outside<br>the circle.\<br>\<br>You can tell her why you think that dating someone twice her age is a<br>bad idea. You can tell her that you think dating a married man is like<br>betting on a losing horse. You can tell her whatever you want to tell<br>her. Ultimately, the state considers her an adult, and so she should be<br>afforded the opportunity to make life decisions (even bad ones) on her<br>own.\<br>\<br>Just be there for her when she falls.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
