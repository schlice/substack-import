If they would have let him, he'd have plowed<br>on ahead with the convention. But it would have been terrible optics to<br>hold the convention in a state experiencing a "spike" like Florida is.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
