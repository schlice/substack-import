<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>An excellent question!<br><br>But you realize you asked it in the *Christians & Christianity* space,<br>and here we believe in the Trinity.<br><br>To wit:<br><br>1.  The Father is God.<br>2.  The Son is God.<br>3.  The Spirit is God.<br><br>But:<br><br>1.  The Father is not the Son.<br>2.  The Son is not the Spirit.<br>3.  The Spirit is not the Father.<br><br>So to answer your question, Satan was running the world.<br><br>*Huh?*<br><br>Yes, that's right. Satan was cast out of heaven and became the ruler of<br>the world. Do you not remember this from the Bible? When Jesus was being<br>tempted, Satan offered Him the world:<br><br>> The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all<br>> the kingdoms of the world. And he said to him, "I will give you all<br>> their authority and splendor; it has been given to me, and I can give<br>> it to anyone I want to. If you worship me, it will all be yours." ---<br>> Luke 4:5--7 NIV<br><br>As you can see here, Satan was given authority over all the kingdoms of<br>the world. Until Jesus comes back to destroy Satan once and for all, and<br>send him into the deepest part of Hell for all eternity, of course.<br><br>But at least for now, Satan rules the world.<br><br>Another verse which describe this rulership:<br><br>> Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against<br>> the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. But he was not<br>> strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. The great dragon<br>> was hurled down---that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who<br>> leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his<br>> angels with him. --- Revelation 12:7--9<br><br>Only he who has dominion can "lead the world" even if it is in the wrong<br>direction.<br><br>\<br><br>(EDIT) That answer was mostly tongue-in-cheek.<br><br>I will say that "running the world" is a poor way to describe how either<br>God or Satan interacts with the world. Because neither God nor Satan<br>actually "runs the world." The world runs on its own. God set the world<br>in motion, and it just runs in accordance with the rules of science and<br>physics that He set in place.<br><br>So to what extent do either "run the world?" They really don't; *they<br>interact with people*. We know that Satan intervenes in the lives of<br>people by "leading them astray," and we know that God also intervenes by<br>leading people towards His goals, but as far as "the world" goes, there<br>isn't anything that needs running.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
