<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can tell the DeSantis haters from those of us who simply are<br>watching history play out and accurately documenting it, especially when<br>they use words like "DeathSantis" or "DeSatan" when they try to describe<br>the Governor.<br><br>Anyway, let's set the stage for what happened in Florida. Less than ten<br>years ago, corporations were using their considerable funds and lobbying<br>power to push their woke agendas onto states. Remember the fights over<br>religious freedom which morphed into fights over gay rights?<br>Corporations were pulling out of locations left and right in an effort<br>to exert their will over that of the state. Atlanta lost the All-Star<br>game over the Georgia legislature correcting their voter laws and<br>returning them to pre-pandemic sanity. North Carolina lost NBA and NCAA<br>events because of House Bill 2 defining bathroom usage.<br><br>Republicans would previously cave to such pressure, despite being<br>frustrated about it. And doesn't it strike you as odd that woke<br>corporations only target Republican-led bills, and states led by<br>Republicans? Seems like an oddly politically-polarized climate, don't<br>you think?<br><br>That said, even though Atlanta lost the All-Star Game, Georgia's voting<br>laws still stand. Even though Greensboro lost the NCAA tourney, its<br>bathroom rules still stand. In other words, *in the historical context,<br>states always win against big corporations flexing woke ideology.*<br><br>Republicans these days *must* stand up to woke corporations flexing<br>their muscle against the will of the state (and thus the people in that<br>state).<br><br>DeSantis was reading from the same playbook when handling Disney. The<br>Parental Rights in Education Act didn't affect The Walt Disney<br>Corporation at all (it is about schools, not businesses), but Disney<br>(under pressure from its "not-so-secret gay" employees) still decided to<br>speak out over the state's actions. What frustrated the Governor was not<br>so much that they dared to have an opinion, but that a California<br>corporation was "going to do everything in its power" to prevent the<br>Parental Rights in Education Act from becoming law in Florida. A woke<br>corporation trying to flex its muscle against the state to advance their<br>own queer agenda is bad enough, but a *California* corporation trying to<br>tell *Florida* how to run its state? That was a bridge too far for<br>Florida. DeSantis contends that corporations should not meddle in state<br>politics, and that as a purportedly family-friendly business, Disney (of<br>all corporations) should understand parents not wanting young children<br>taught about gender identity in public schools.<br><br>The state decided that if Disney is allowed to flex its muscle and<br>threaten the state, the state should similarly be allowed to take a<br>fresh look at the special district which allows Disney to operate in<br>complete autonomy, outside of the rules that govern every other<br>corporation in the state. Maybe Disney feels so emboldened because they<br>know that the state has no power over them, because they are not subject<br>to state rules like every other corporation in the state. The<br>Legislature decided to strip Disney of its special district (in fact,<br>what it did was to cause all special districts which were formed before<br>a specific law went into effect were to be dissolved and re-formed in<br>accordance with that law). The law affected nine special districts<br>around the state, including Reedy Creek. The state re-formed Reedy Creek<br>into the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District (CFTOD), which<br>basically has the same authority as Reedy Creek, but under the control<br>of the state instead of under Disney's control.<br><br>But before this law could go into effect and CFTOD could take over,<br>Disney and Reedy Creek entered into a legal agreement called a<br>Developer's Agreement and Protective Covenant which basically gave<br>Disney all of the powers that Reedy Creek had, thereby making the<br>District replacing Reedy Creek useless as all changes that CFTOD would<br>seek to make would have to be approved by Disney.<br><br>When the date came around and Florida realized what Disney had done,<br>they immediately moved to terminate the agreement between Reedy Creek<br>and Disney. Disney sued the state of Florida, claiming that the<br>dissolution of Reedy Creek was unlawful retaliation following the<br>corporation exercising its 1st Amendment right to speak out against the<br>government. \"The government action was patently retaliatory, patently<br>anti-business, and patently unconstitutional,\" Disney said in its<br>lawsuit.<br><br>The CFTOD Board countersued to enforce the dissolution of the protective<br>covenants. "In an effort to stymie Florida's elected representatives,<br>Disney covertly cobbled together a series of eleventh-hour deals with<br>its soon-to-be-replaced puppet government," the lawsuit alleged. "Disney<br>hoped to tie the hands of the new, independent Board and to preserve<br>\...\ its own government in the District for at least the next 30<br>years.\" The Board said the agreements were \"riddled with procedural<br>and substantive defects\" that render them void and unenforceable. The<br>lawsuit argues the prior board failed to provide adequate public notice<br>or follow proper procedures.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Florida Legislature passed a new law which gives CFTOD<br>the authority to nullify developer agreements and protective covenants<br>which were signed within three months of the Board taking control of the<br>district.<br><br>If history shows us anything, the state will indeed ultimately prevail,<br>but the fight being put up by Disney against the state's authority will<br>leave them both bruised.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
