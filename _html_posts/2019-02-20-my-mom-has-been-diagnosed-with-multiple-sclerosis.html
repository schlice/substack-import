<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I wanted to write a big meta-answer that encompassed all kinds of other<br>answers, but instead settled on writing one basic answer and telling you<br>all that you can search Quora for other answers to each one of those<br>questions.<br><br>**My mom has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. What does this<br>mean?**<br><br>Multiple Sclerosis is an autoimmune disease. That means that the body's<br>immune system gets a little fouled up and mistakenly recognizes normal,<br>healthy body tissues as foreign invaders and attacks them.<br><br>In MS, the immune system attacks the myelin sheath surrounding nerve<br>fibers in the Central Nervous System (CNS) and destroys it. It leaves in<br>its wake hard scars of cholesterol called *scleroses*. Nerve signals do<br>not flow well through these areas of *demyelination*. These damaged<br>nerve fibers cause the varied symptoms of MS. This is also where the<br>name comes from: *multiple sclerosis = many scars.*<br><br>What can I expect to happen?<br><br>Your mom already likely has experienced some symptoms of the disease.<br>That's usually how we know that someone has MS: they experience<br>symptoms. The symptoms are caused by areas of nerve which have been<br>damaged. There are *many* symptoms which can be caused by MS, and<br>everyone who gets MS gets different symptoms. Even when two people<br>experience the same symptoms, they may experience those symptoms<br>slightly differently. In other words, everyone who has MS experiences it<br>a little bit differently, and not everyone will experience all symptoms.<br><br>There are two main forms of the disease: a relapsing form, and a<br>progressive form. In the relapsing form (the most common), patients<br>will experience periods of disease activity (relapses or exacerbations)<br>followed by longer periods of symptom inactivity (remission). In the<br>progressive forms of the disease, there may be periods of relapse, but<br>there are fewer periods of remission. In some, the disease symptoms<br>appear and slowly get worse over time.<br><br>The most common symptoms of MS are:<br><br>- Bladder Dysfunction<br>- Bowel Dysfunction<br>- Changes in Cognitive Function, including problems with memory,<br>  attention, and problem-solving<br>- Dizziness and Vertigo<br>- Depression and other Emotional Changes<br>- Fatigue (also called MS lassitude)<br>- Difficulty in Walking and/or Balance or Coordination Problems<br>- Abnormal sensations such as Numbness or "pins and needles"<br>- Sexual Dysfunction<br>- Spasticity<br>- Vision Problems (Optic Neuritis)<br><br>Less common symptoms include:<br><br>- Headache<br>- Hearing Loss<br>- Itching<br>- Seizures<br>- Speech Disorders<br>- Dysphagia (Swallowing Problems)<br>- Tremor<br><br>What causes it?<br><br>We don't know what causes MS. Anyone can get multiple sclerosis, but<br>there are risk factors that place one at higher risk of developing the<br>disease. These risk factors include sex, family history, ethnicity,<br>geography of birth and childhood, and exposure to an as-of-yet<br>unidentified infectious trigger.\<br>\<br>SEX: Females are two to three times more likely to develop MS than<br>males. Scientists believe that one\'s tendency to develop MS therefore<br>has some hormonal connection.\<br>\<br>FAMILY HISTORY: Statistics show that the chance of the average<br>person in the United States developing MS is about 1 in 750. But close<br>(first-degree) relatives of people with MS, such as children, siblings<br>or non-identical twins, have a higher chance, anywhere from one in 100<br>to one in 40. It\'s not all genetic, though, and you can see this<br>through the \"identical twin\" example. If one identical twin has MS,<br>the other twin (who has the identical gene structure as the twin) has<br>only a 1 in 4 chance of developing MS. If it were all genetic, the<br>unaffected twin would have a 100% chance of developing MS instead of the<br>25% chance they exhibit today.\<br>\<br>ETHNICITY: MS is more common among Caucasians (particularly those of<br>northern European ancestry) than other ethnic groups, and is almost<br>unheard of in some populations, such as Inuit, Yakutes, Hutterites,<br>Hungarian Romani, Norwegian Lapps, Australian Aborigines, and New<br>Zealand Maoris.\<br>\<br>GEOGRAPHY: MS occurs with greatest frequency in higher latitudes<br>(above 40Â° latitude) away from the equator, than in lower latitudes,<br>closer to the equator. This may have something to do with vitamin D<br>production in the skin, and the vitamin\'s prophylactic effect on the<br>development of MS. The exact details about vitamin D\'s involvement with<br>the prevention of MS, however, is still unclear. Moving from one<br>geographic area to another seems to alter a person\'s risk of developing<br>MS. Studies show that families and their children will assume the new<br>risk level (higher or lower) of the area to which they move. Those who<br>move before the age of 15 generally take on the new risk themselves.<br>Those who move after the age of 15 may not see the new risk appear until<br>the next generation.\<br>\<br>INFECTIOUS TRIGGER: Scientists have been searching for years for<br>an infectious agent that might trigger MS. While many different viruses<br>have been suggested, including rabies, herpes simplex virus, measles,<br>corona virus, canine distemper virus, HTLV-1, Epstein-Barr virus, among<br>others, none has yet been confirmed. Chlamydia pneumoniae, a bacteria<br>which 90% of the population has been exposed to over their lifetime, has<br>also been suggested but never proven. Although no trigger has yet been<br>identified, most MS experts believe that some infectious agent is<br>involved in initiating the disease process.<br><br>Is it a curable disease?<br><br>As we do not know yet what causes MS, there is no cure. We have<br>medications which slow the disease progress, and reduce the severity and<br>duration of relapses.<br><br>Will she be okay?<br><br>This is the biggie, and the one that will probably take you a while to<br>come to terms with, but it's big:<br><br>YES, SHE WILL BE OKAY.<br><br>She's going to have a few extra little things to deal with, but MS is<br>not fatal. It causes a bunch of symptoms, and they're pretty annoying,<br>and you often have to adjust your lifestyle around them, but they won't<br>kill you. It will be depressing knowing that you have to deal with these<br>symptoms, and for the most part, no one will be able to tell that you<br>have this disease (it's what we call a silent or hidden disability). But<br>you can work around all of the symptoms the disease causes, and along<br>with taking one of the approved MS therapy drugs, people with MS have<br>nearly the same lifespans as those without the disease. So yes, she's<br>going to be okay. And so will you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
