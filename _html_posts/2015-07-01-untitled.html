<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [\"Making\" new jobs is never a problem. I can make new<br>jobs all day long. However, this new job is a government job, and that<br>means the money for the salary comes from the taxpayers. Since that<br>money is severely limited, both by law and by necessity, the city<br>council has to increase the amount of money they give to the police in<br>their budget. When the police ask for a budget increase, how we\'ll do<br>you think that\'s going to go over in city council? Right, not so well.\<br>\<br>I\'m all for creating new highly paid technical jobs. But it\'s up to<br>taxpayers to foot the bill, and if taxpayers say no to the increase, you<br>don\'t get your cops into cameras.\<br>\<br>And then people will say, \"But Obama *gave* you the cameras. Why are<br>you asking for tax increases to pay for them? Stupid greedy<br>police.\"]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-do-law-enforcement-officers-think-about-President-Obamas-decision-to-federally-fund-50-000-body-cameras-for-police-officers/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
