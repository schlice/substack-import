<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it against the law to resist being handcuffed by a police<br>officer?**<br><br>Yes, it is a crime. In most jurisdictions it is called "resisting<br>arrest." It can be added to the list of crimes for which you were being<br>arrested in the first place.<br><br>It also raises the level of force authorized to the officer to bring you<br>into compliance (in other words, you get hurt more).<br><br>As we've said many times on Quora, if you don't feel that the arrest is<br>legal, or if you feel that the officer has done something wrong, the<br>time to argue this is when you're standing in front of the judge, not<br>when the officer is applying handcuffs.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
