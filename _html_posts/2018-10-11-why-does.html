<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why does \"scam likely\" keep coming up on my phone\'s caller ID for<br>certain numbers?**<br><br>I am a big fan of this one. It's actually the carrier trying their<br>hardest to stop fraud.<br><br>There has been a rash of scam calls lately, and people are rightly upset<br>about them. There's not much that anyone can do. It's challenging to<br>even get the government involved, as sometimes these companies operate<br>from out of the country. People have fallen prey to these scammers and<br>have lost millions.<br><br>So the carriers have decided to step in. On numbers known to be used by<br>scammers, *the carrier* is intercepting the Caller ID, before it comes<br>to you, and changing it to "SCAM LIKELY" or some other warning for you.<br><br>When you see that caller ID, it's because your carrier is trying to help<br>you avoid being scammed.<br><br>You can assist too. There are services you can use to help stop the<br>calls. For your landline, I suggest you take a look at<br>[Nomorobo(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=df0749&url=http://nomorobo.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nomorobo.com"}]{.qlink_container}. It's free for your<br>landline. For your mobile device, I strongly recommend<br>[Hiya(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e67c36&url=https://hiya.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="hiya.com"}]{.qlink_container}. Not only does it provide<br>Caller ID for your phone where caller ID is not provided, but it also<br>integrates with community blacklists to block known telemarketers and<br>scammers.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
