This happened 40 days after He was<br>resurrected.<br><br>> Now when he had spoken these things, while they watched, he was taken<br>> up, and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they looked<br>> steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold two men stood by them<br>> in white apparel, who also said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand<br>> gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, who was taken up from you into<br>> heaven, will so come in like manner as you saw him go into heaven" ---<br>> Acts 1: 9--11<br><br>The Assumption is one of the most significant events in the life of<br>Christ.<br><br>A number of other New Testament writers also testified that Jesus' body<br>was assumed into Heaven.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
