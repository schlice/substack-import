<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do you have to time to go to the gym at USAFA,<br><br>Yes. While your time is limited and you are indeed very busy, there is<br>some time in your schedule that you can go to the gym. Generally, that's<br>going to be in the afternoon, after classes and after any participatory<br>sports (intramurals or intercollegiate, you'll do one or the other) you<br>may have on that day, until you either go to dinner, or between dinner<br>and Academic Call to Quarters (ACQ). ACQ (or Ac Call) is at 2000, or<br>8:00 pm. It lasts for three hours every night, and should be used for<br>study time. If you are on Academic Probation, you *must* use that time<br>for academics. If you are not on Academic Probation, the time is,<br>somewhat, more flexible, although you get to structure that time as you<br>see fit. You must be in the Cadet Area, but you can be down at the gym<br>(or in my case sometimes, the ice arena).<br><br>Summer hours are more limited, but cadets still have eight hours a day<br>(from roughly 11:00 am until 7:00 pm six days a week) to use the gym.<br><br>and is it as good as a commercial gym?<br><br>It's not as good as a commercial gym. It's way better. The gym<br>facilities at the Air Force Academy are *world-class.*<br><br>In fact, beginning in 2012, the cadet gym got a 50,000 square foot<br>upgrade.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-b854fdd588f52ba053563a0bbd35156e){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-b854fdd588f52ba053563a0bbd35156e"<br>master_w="3600" master_h="2400"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>The gym now boasts some of the finest workout equipment available,<br>including a cybex room, climbing walls, cardio equipment, physical<br>fitness testing room, and a brand-new weight room. The Air Force spent<br>\$9.5 million on the upgrade, which was desperately needed, as the<br>facility hadn't been upgraded since it was installed in the late 50s to<br>service no more than 2,200 male cadets.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-47f2a6fcf5de854e81e9306ff167abce){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-47f2a6fcf5de854e81e9306ff167abce"<br>master_w="3600" master_h="2400"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>The new facilities include upgraded locker room facilities, and a new<br>swimming pool area and fencing area improvements.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-044b46ba6e60343a7c5d06413e832a67){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-044b46ba6e60343a7c5d06413e832a67"<br>master_w="3600" master_h="2400"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-9fd3914cb014b823d13f48fbcf43c545){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-9fd3914cb014b823d13f48fbcf43c545"<br>master_w="1000" master_h="638"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>The upgrades to the gym included donations from commercial corporations<br>(along with the Academy's traditional food budget) to include a wellness<br>area which includes snacks and sports and nutrition drinks,<br>appropriately dubbed "Falcon Fuel." In mid-2014, the NCAA ruled that<br>student athletes may consume "unlimited" snacks and meals in conjunction<br>with their athletic participation. To that end, cadets have full access<br>to these stations, to provide appropriate nutrition during and after<br>their workouts.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-6030d85cde82bf8d532de300fe16e4f8){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-6030d85cde82bf8d532de300fe16e4f8"<br>master_w="1250" master_h="600"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>(Images courtesy [[USAFA Public<br>Affairs](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3dc48e&url=https://www.usafa.af.mil/USAFANews/Article/428549/cadet-fitness-center/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="af.mil"}]{.qlink_container})<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
