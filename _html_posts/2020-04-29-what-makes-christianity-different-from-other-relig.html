<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What makes Christianity different from other religions, what makes it<br>so believable?**<br><br>Christianity is the only major world religion in which its believers are<br>saved by *grace alone.* In this respect, there are only two major world<br>religions: Christianity, and "everyone else," as all other major world<br>religions require some form of action (i.e. "human achievement") in<br>order to attain their salvation. Even some subsets of religions which<br>call themselves Christian or retain some Christian theology or belief<br>still require human achievement in order to achieve Heaven or Nirvana or<br>Valhalla or Paradise or whatever they believe is the final end-state of<br>mankind. Certain denominations or cults, such as Jehovah's Witnesses,<br>Seventh-Day Adventists, Church of Christ, Roman Catholics, Russian and<br>Eastern Orthodox, and others still require something that needs to be<br>accomplished or is necessary for you to do in order to achieve<br>salvation.<br><br>Christianity is the only religion which states that there is absolutely<br>nothing you can do to earn your way into Heaven (i.e. "divine<br>accomplishment"); your salvation has already been bought and paid for.<br><br>What makes it so believable?<br><br>It's actually quite believable. What's fascinating is how unbelievable<br>all other world religions are in this respect.<br><br>When Mormons come to my house, I'll often ask them questions about what<br>gets them to heaven, and we'll usually have a discussion about just how<br>much they've done to merit that reward. I'll ask where, on a scale of 0<br>to 100, they think they fall, in terms of just how good they've been. No<br>one has yet told me 100, as everyone acknowledges some failings. Why<br>wouldn't they? It's only human. Then I ask them what they believe God<br>expects, based on what they have read in the Scriptures, and each says<br>100. It's true, God expects perfection. Jesus even expands on this,<br>making the Ten Commandments even more stringent. "You have heard that it<br>was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But I tell you that anyone<br>who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her<br>in his heart." (Matthew 5:27--28 NIV) Of course, based on that standard,<br>who among us is *not* guilty of at least some sin? No one. We are all<br>sinful, and we have all fallen short of God's standards.<br><br>Therefore, it is impossible for anyone to do enough to get themselves<br>into Heaven. It is *only* possible with God. Only God can save you<br>through his grace.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
