<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's not difficult to drive a truck into a crowd of people. In fact,<br>it's so easy that ISIS is using that tactic (i.e. Nice and Berlin) to<br>carry out their terror attacks.<br><br>Clearly, removing guns from society makes it more difficult to commit a<br>killing with a gun. If that's all you're trying to do, then removing<br>guns from all law-abiding citizens will reduce the ability for a<br>deranged killer to get a gun and kill people with it.<br><br>But it does not stop crime, and it does not treat the cause of people<br>committing crime. It's hardly disingenuous to treat the problem rather<br>than the symptom. It's pure iceberg theory.<br><br>The gun makes it just as easy to murder a 5-year old as it makes it for<br>an octogenarian to defend himself against a 220 pound assailant, or a<br>woman to defend herself from a knife-wielding rapist, or a homosexual to<br>defend himself against a whole truckload of drunken homophobes. The ease<br>of use is what contributes to the beauty of the weapon. It is exactly<br>that simplicity which allows anyone to use it so effectively. Because a<br>person chooses to use it in a way which is wholly unacceptable in<br>society doesn't make the tool completely ineffective. Because ISIS used<br>a truck to kill 89 people in Nice shouldn't be a reason to ban trucks.<br>Their usefulness is well-established. Because you don't see the<br>usefulness in a gun doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. Thankfully, the<br>framers saw the usefulness, and protected them in the Constitution.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Adam-Lanza-murdered-for-and-stole-guns-that-were-legally-bought-and-owned-to-kill-children-Do-you-still-believe-gun-laws-should-not-be-tightened/answer/Matt-P-518<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
