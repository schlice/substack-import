<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Which amendment guarantees the right of healthcare?<br><br>The Constitution does not guarantee the right to healthcare.<br><br>Healthcare is a *service*. Guaranteeing a right to healthcare means that<br>doctors become *indentured servants*. Why? If healthcare is a right,<br>then no one can deny you access to it for any reason, even if you cannot<br>pay. That means you never have to pay for healthcare ever, since you<br>cannot be forced to pay to access a right. Where do you have to pay to<br>get the right to free speech? Where do you have to pay to get the right<br>to keep soldiers from quartering in your home? Where do you have to pay<br>to get the right to not be unreasonably searched?<br><br>Doctors attend years of schooling, at their own expense, and further<br>years of residency in order to become certified to practice healthcare.<br>Doctors deserve to be paid for their work.<br><br>You can try to argue that the Constitution guarantees the right to<br>healthcare, but you would be wrong. Nowhere in the language of the<br>Constitution does it say that you have a right to healthcare. You can<br>try to *infer* a right to healthcare, but you would be wrong.<br><br>Now for the part that confuses everyone:<br><br>The Constitution guarantees a right to *free access* **to<br>healthcare. It does not guarantee a right to *access to free***<br>healthcare.<br><br>Words matter. There is an ocean of difference between the two.<br><br>Yes, the Constitution guarantees that no law can prevent your access to<br>healthcare. The Commerce Clause likely could be argued to protect your<br>right to access whatever healthcare you like. The Fourteenth Amendment,<br>in its equal protection clause, also likely guarantees the same thing.<br><br>But nothing in the Constitution guarantees that you can have healthcare<br>for free. Even if you never have to pay *at the time of service*,<br>you will pay. You may pay through your taxes (as most "free healthcare"<br>countries do), but you do pay for that service. The Constitution does<br>not guarantee your right to free healthcare.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
