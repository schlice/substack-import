<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Logically, in order to create time, God must exist outside of time. In<br>order to create space, God must exist outside of space. In order to<br>create matter and energy, God must exist outside of matter and energy.<br>Because those things cannot exist before they existed.<br><br>These things don't make sense to us, because our brains are incapable of<br>understanding how something can exist outside of matter and energy, time<br>and space. Even when we say that God existed before the universe, the<br>word "before" implies time, when time wasn't created until the Big Bang.<br>It makes no sense to us.<br><br>But logically speaking, it nevertheless must be true. Nothing exists<br>before it existed. Except for God, who is outside of time, and is<br>therefore *eternal*.<br><br>This is where the Christian has *faith*. Faith bridges the gap between<br>the undeniable and the unknowable. We will never be able to<br>understand how God can exist beyond matter and energy, time and space.<br>But faith is the force which allows us to move forward without complete<br>understanding. It's knowable beyond a *reasonable* doubt, not beyond<br>*all* doubt. Faith gets us to the answer, even when some doubt remains.<br><br>And this separates the wheat from the chaff. Only those *willing* to<br>have faith will actually believe. Those who are unwilling will not.<br>*Which is precisely what God wants*. He only wants the willing in His<br>new kingdom. When you have faith, when you believe beyond what you can<br>possibly ever know, it is your willingness to believe which will be<br>rewarded.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
