<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should Trump sue Biden for libel? Biden referenced a sub-report which<br>the President was not brief on, but Biden said he was. That's libel, in<br>spreading lies.**<br><br>Political speech is in a special protected class all by itself. In<br>general, political speech is not subject to the same libel and<br>defamation provisions that other, non-political speech is.<br><br>In 1964, the Supreme Court heard the case of *New York Times v.<br>Sullivan,* which found a very large "Constitutional problem" in<br>subjecting speech about public officials to common law defamation<br>liability. The court held that Alabama common law (and thus all common<br>law in all states) was "constitutionally deficient for failure to<br>provide the safeguards for freedom of speech and of the press that are<br>required by the First and Fourteenth Amendments in a libel action<br>brought by a public official against critics of his official conduct."<br>These safeguards are necessary, the Court said, to protect and advance<br>the "profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public<br>issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may<br>well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks<br>on government and public officials." These safeguards were necessary in<br>order to protect the sometimes factually incorrect political speech<br>about public officials which is "inevitable in free debate." If we<br>don't, then we may find that politicians will self-censor for fear of<br>liability.<br><br>The Court held that "constitutional guarantees require . . . a federal<br>rule that prohibits a public official from recovering damages for a<br>defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves<br>that the statement was made with actual malice," or "with knowledge that<br>it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not."<br><br>The Court, in subsequent years, went on to expand this "actual malice<br>standard" for political speech and included cases brought by public<br>figures themselves.<br><br>**TL;DR: Trump would have to prove that Biden made that statement with<br>"actual malicious intent" or "with no knowledge that it was false or<br>with reckless disregard for the truth" which is a very high bar to clear<br>politically.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
