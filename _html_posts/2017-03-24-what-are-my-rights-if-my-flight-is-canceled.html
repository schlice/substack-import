<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In general, the contract of carriage requires the company get you to<br>where you are going.<br><br>And that's about it.<br><br>They try to get you there at the agreed-upon time, but that's not always<br>feasible because of unforeseen circumstances. Some of these<br>circumstances (i.e. things that are the airline's fault) entitle you to<br>a refund. Some (especially weather-based ones) do not.<br><br>Airlines have different policies depending on what caused the delay.<br><br>But even if the airline puts you on a bus and drives you to your<br>destination, you have completed the contract of carriage.<br><br>I have had this happen to me. I live in Colorado Springs, and on<br>occasion, I will have a connecting flight between Colorado Springs and<br>Denver (about 75 miles between the airports). One time, the Colorado<br>Springs Airport was completely closed due to weather. The airline<br>decided to put us all on a bus and drive us to the Colorado Springs<br>Airport. We actually still ended up in the terminal, still picked up our<br>luggage at baggage claim, but our transport was a bus.<br><br>There is no requirement in the contract of carriage that you will<br>actually be transported by aircraft. The only requirement is that the<br>carrier gets you where they said they were going to take you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
