<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the United States, there are very few professions which are<br>"mandatory reporters." Other than those (and if you are one of them, you<br>know who you are), you are under no obligation to report anything. There<br>are a few states where some reporting of crimes is mandatory, but in<br>most cases, there are no mandatory reporting laws in this country.<br><br>However, in your situation, you are claiming that you have inside<br>knowledge that the police will be called to a wellness check and the<br>person inside wants to die using the "suicide by cop" method of suicide.<br>That method: try to shoot the police, and see who's a better shot.<br>Chances are, it will be the police. But that achieves exactly what they<br>were going for: suicide, but by goading the police into shooting them.<br><br>If you know that this is going to happen, while you're not under any<br>obligation to tell the police about it, and you're not going to get in<br>trouble for not telling them, how would that sit on your conscience if<br>they show up and kill the person and you didn't tell them up front that<br>you knew it was going to be a suicide by cop? Or worse, what if one of<br>the cops gets shot and you could have forewarned them? The old saying: a<br>clear conscience makes for a soft pillow.<br><br>Look, you won't get in trouble. But for your sake, call the police and<br>tell them that this wellness check is actually a suicide by cop. They<br>will know how to handle it from there. Hopefully, the suicidal person<br>gets the help that they so desperately need, and no one has to die.<br><br>TL;DR: **If you could save a life with a simple phone call, wouldn't<br>you?**<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If someone is suicidal and threatens to shoot the police if they are<br>called for a wellness check, could you get in trouble if you didn't<br>report it?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
