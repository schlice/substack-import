<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [*NOTE: Graphic textual content; I\'ll leave the pictures<br>out*\<br>\<br>Really depends on the nature of the crash. Depends on how the aircraft<br>impacted the ground.\<br>\<br>For example, the plane on 9/11 that crashed in Shanksville, PA (or the<br>Germanwings flight) was nearly vertical when it impacted. The sheer<br>momentum of the aircraft, directed nearly vertically to the ground,<br>disintegrated most everything in the aircraft. Most of the airframe was<br>obliterated, along with everything inside of the aircraft. Human remains<br>would be scattered, and would generally be bits of flesh and bits of<br>bone. Very little would remain intact. You may find a finger or a foot<br>that were still intact (if enclosed in a strong enough shoe), but most<br>bodily structures would have been obliterated. You would only be able to<br>identify what parts belonged to whom using DNA analysis, and that would<br>only tell you what parts belonged together. You probably wouldn\'t find<br>enough whole parts to be able to positively identify anyone. Along with<br>obliteration, there would also be fire, since the fuel would most<br>certainly combust during the crash, so combining the obliterative force<br>of the crash along with the explosion and fire, and most physical<br>remains would be completely unidentifiable.\<br>\<br>In a crash where the aircraft impacts the ground at a lower angle, the<br>force of the impact is deflected much more greatly rather than if the<br>aircraft is more vertical. The lower the angle at which the aircraft<br>impacts, the more survivable the crash is. When an aircraft crashes and<br>disintegrates, but at a lower angle of attack, wreckage is far more<br>intact than in a more vertical crash. Airframe components break apart<br>rather than disintegrating, items within the aircraft are broken and<br>tossed, but some can retain their structural integrity. Human remains<br>are damaged and limbs and heads may be dislodged from bodies, but many<br>times corpses can remain mostly intact. Passengers will die mostly from<br>blunt force trauma caused by the impact with the ground, and the impact<br>from flying debris dislodged during the impact.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
