<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The legal restrictions on police officers detaining people without<br>probable cause are the same in California as they are in the rest of the<br>country, because these are Constitutional principles not limited by<br>state law.<br><br>All police officers can detain people without probable cause. No police<br>officer can detain people without reasonable suspicion.<br><br>That standard is lower than probable cause. Probable cause is required<br>for *arrest*, which is different than *detention*. When you are<br>detained, you are not under arrest.<br><br>Investigative detentions were named so after the landmark Supreme Court<br>case *Terry v. Ohio*, which is why they are often called "Terry stops."<br>During an investigative detention, the suspect is not free to leave, may<br>be handcuffed for officer safety, and may be frisked (briefly searched)<br>for weapons.<br><br>An officer may find evidence during the investigative detention which<br>provides him with the requisite *probable cause* to effect an arrest.<br>But an officer cannot *arrest* you without probable cause, and an<br>officer cannot *detain* you without reasonable suspicion.<br><br>Terry stops can last anywhere from a few seconds to a few hours. There<br>really is no absolute limit on how long a Terry stop can take, but the<br>stop "must be temporary and last no longer than is necessary to<br>effectuate the purpose of the stop..." (*US v. Segoviano,* ND III,<br>2019). In other words, the length of the detention must be reasonably<br>related to the reason for the investigation.<br><br>Everyone has a 4th Amendment right against unreasonable searches and<br>seizures. An arrest without probable cause would be a violation of that<br>right. A detention without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity<br>would be a violation of the civil right against unlawful detention. If<br>you feel that your rights have been violated, contact a lawyer in your<br>jurisdiction ASAP.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What are the legal restrictions on police officers detaining people<br>without probable cause in California (USA)?<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
