It says, for<br>the most part, that "{a}n amendment may be proposed by a two-thirds vote<br>of both Houses of Congress, or, if two-thirds of the States request one,<br>by a convention called for that purpose. The amendment must then be<br>ratified by three-fourths of the State legislatures, or three-fourths of<br>conventions called in each State for<br>ratification."\[1\](#lubxd){#cite-lubxd .citation_link}<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Let\'s say that the National Archivist was to sign and add the Equal<br>Rights Amendment to the Constitution, would that render Justice Alito\'s<br>opinion to overturn Roe Vs.
