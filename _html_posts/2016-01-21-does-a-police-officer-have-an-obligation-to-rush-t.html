<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: no.<br><br>Longer answer: Police are required to protect the safety of the general<br>public. However, unless there is a pre-existing agreement (i.e. you are<br>being detained by the police), the police have no obligation to protect<br>you personally.<br><br>Many Supreme Court cases over the years have borne out this principle.<br>In 1989, the Supreme Court said that \"<br>\othing in the language of<br>the Due Process Clause itself requires the State to protect the life,<br>liberty, and property of its citizens against invasion by private<br>actors.\" The Due Process clause of the 14th Amendment forbids the<br>government to deprive citizens of life, liberty, or property without<br>\"due process of law.\" Conversely, the Due Process clause does not<br>provide an affirmative right to government assistance, \"even where such<br>aid may be necessary to secure life, liberty, or property interests of<br>which the government itself may not deprive the individual.\" So while<br>the government is specifically enjoined from depriving any citizen of<br>the rights to life, liberty, and property, this does not create a<br>converse relationship; simply because the government can\'t take it away<br>doesn\'t mean the government must protect it.<br><br>Now, all that said, the police will do their utmost to protect you, as<br>quickly and as safely as they can.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
