<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If God is all knowing, why did he make us sinners?<br><br>What difference does it make that God knows all? You're also presuming<br>that somehow "being a sinner" is something that goes against God's plan.<br>It certainly goes against God's *desire*, but having free will was<br>indeed part of God's plan.<br><br>You're also incorrect that God made us sinners. He made us have the<br>*ability* to sin, and gave us the free will to choose how we live our<br>lives.<br><br>If we didn't have free will, how would God know that we truly *wanted*<br>to live according to His plan? We wouldn't have a choice! The fact that<br>we get to choose signifies that we've seen God's plan, and we've seen<br>Satan's plan, and we've made the conscious decision to follow God.<br><br>Being all-knowing, God *knows* that it is far better that you get to<br>decide for yourself whether or not you will live according to His design<br>and His plan for you. He *wants* you to freely choose Him.<br><br>But making us have the ability to sin was also an important part of His<br>plan.<br><br>Jesus outlined this in the Sermon on the Mount when He basically<br>re-wrote the Ten Commandments. He basically said (paraphrasing) that you<br>know the old laws, but I say that there's a new law. For example, you<br>know in the old law how it says you can't covet your neighbor's wife.<br>But I say that if you even have the lustful thought, you have already<br>committed the sin.<br><br>*What? That's impossible! We can't control what our mind does!* I mean,<br>we can control what actions we take, but controlling the thoughts of our<br>minds? Heck, we'd be sinning every day!<br><br>And that's exactly right.<br><br>When Jesus re-wrote the old laws, He showed us that it is *impossible*<br>for us to do it on our own. There is literally *no way* to be acceptable<br>in the eyes of God under your own power. In other words, *nothing you<br>can do can save you.*<br><br>The *only* way to be acceptable in the eyes of God is through Jesus. "No<br>one comes to the father except through me." (John 14:6). The only way to<br>salvation is through Jesus' sacrifice on the cross, and your acceptance<br>of that gift.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
