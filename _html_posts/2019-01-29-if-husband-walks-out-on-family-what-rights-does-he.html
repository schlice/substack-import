What rights does he have to ask for<br>full time custody of children?**<br><br>The answer is, of course, "it depends," because each state governs its<br>divorce laws individually.<br><br>However, in most states, custody and child support are determined based<br>on the best interests of the child, not based on who initiated the<br>divorce, or even in a fault divorce, who was at fault.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
