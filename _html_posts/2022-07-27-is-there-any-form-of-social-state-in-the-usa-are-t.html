<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Is there any form of social state in the USA?<br><br>Yes, we have a "welfare state" in the US. This is a system whereby the<br>government provides basic care for those who cannot work. It's called<br>Medicaid. We can debate all day how well it works, but the fact is<br>that we've chosen in this country to use tax dollars to fund the basic<br>healthcare of those who cannot support themselves.<br><br>> Are there people dying from cancer because they are blocked from their<br>> right to free health care?<br><br>Your question is flawed. There is no "right to free health care" in the<br>United States. In the US, we have "*free access* to healthcare," but we<br>do not have "*access* to *free* healthcare." There is a big difference.<br><br>Healthcare is not free. Doctors go to school for years (on their own<br>dime) to learn their craft so they can be licensed to practice medicine.<br>They provide a service, for a fee. They are not public servants. They<br>are practitioners selling a service. It just depends on where the money<br>comes from to pay them: a universal tax paid by everyone, or by<br>individuals and employers, along with health insurance companies.<br><br>Therefore, healthcare is neither a *right* nor a *privilege*. It is a<br>financial transaction. You pay for a service, plain and simple.<br>Perhaps there are better ways to pay for that service. Perhaps we should<br>re-make health insurance and make it, you know, *actual insurance*,<br>instead of *prepaid medical care*. Actual insurance would work just like<br>your car insurance does. Your car insurance doesn't pay for gas, or<br>wiper blades, or tires, or brakes, but it pays for accident repair and<br>repairs over a specific dollar amount. If car insurance worked like<br>health insurance currently works in the US, you'd pay a copay at the gas<br>station and get the gas you needed, and the gas station would bill your<br>insurance company a pre-negotiated rate for your gas.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
