<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you think that divorce is always an option, then don't bother<br>getting married.**<br><br>The Bible is abundantly clear about this point.<br><br>> *and said, 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and<br>> hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'? So they<br>> are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined<br>> together, let not man separate." \-- Matthew 19:5--6 ESV*<br><br>This is Jesus, quoting Genesis. Note what it says: the two shall become<br>one flesh. They are no longer two, but one.<br><br>More importantly is the next line: **what God has joined together, let<br>not man separate.**<br><br>There is literally only one scenario in which divorce is even<br>contemplated: marital infidelity. Beyond that, divorce isn't a thing God<br>endorses.<br><br>Everyone, men and women alike, have the choice to marry or remain<br>single. No one is forced to marry. But by the same token, no one should<br>be flippant about marriage. You marry for life. You marry the person who<br>you will work with, because life isn't perfect. Marriage is hard.<br><br>The tenor of your question makes it sound like you believe that only men<br>have the right to seek divorce. That may be the stance of some other<br>religions, but Christianity does not believe this. The words of Jesus<br>were very clear on this point.<br><br>What God has joined, man must not divide.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
