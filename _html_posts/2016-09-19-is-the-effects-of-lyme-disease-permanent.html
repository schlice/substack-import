<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a question that is far more in-depth than a simple yes or no<br>answer could provide.<br><br>There are two competing schools of thought. The first is championed by<br>the 300-pound playground bully, the American Medical Association (AMA).<br>They claim that you can contract Lyme from a tick bite, and you are then<br>treated with antibiotics and are cured. If you don't get treatment, most<br>cases of Lyme resolve themselves with no long-term ill effects. They<br>disregard the possibility that Lyme persists in any form in the body for<br>any length of time beyond about a month or two.<br><br>*Except that's not the whole story.*<br><br>There is another whole category of doctors who are colloquially known as<br>"Lyme-Literate" MDs (LLMDs). These doctors are represented by a<br>(strikingly large) international medical organization known as the<br>[[International Lyme and Associated Disease Society<br>(ILADS)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=55d09b&url=http://www.ilads.org/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ilads.org"}]{.qlink_container}. These doctors know that the<br>disease is caused by a spiral-shaped bacteria (spirochete) called<br>Borrelia Burgdorferi, usually transmitted through a tick bite. The Lyme<br>spirochete can cause infection of multiple organs and produce a wide<br>range of symptoms. Once the disease has progressed beyond its active<br>state, the bacteria can go into a dormant form and remain in the bone<br>marrow for *decades* undetected, and not detectable through ELISA<br>tests. Stress and other factors can cause the bacteria to activate and<br>can wreak havoc on the body, causing varied symptoms such as<br>bladder/bowel symptoms, brain fog, and many other symptoms.<br><br>The Centers For Disease Control And Prevention (CDC) surveillance<br>criteria for Lyme disease were devised to track a narrow band of cases<br>for epidemiologic purposes. As stated on the CDC website, the<br>surveillance criteria were never intended to be used as diagnostic<br>criteria, nor were they meant to define the entire scope of Lyme<br>disease. The ELISA Lyme screening test, which was based on the CDC<br>surveillance criteria, is unreliable. The test misses 35% of culture<br>proven Lyme disease (only 65% sensitivity) and is unacceptable as the<br>first step of a two-step screening protocol (by definition, a screening<br>test should have at least 95% sensitivity). *Yet this is the test that<br>the AMA endorses to determine whether or not someone has Lyme!*<br><br>Interestingly, fewer than 50% of patients with Lyme disease recall a<br>tick bite. In some studies this number is as low as 15% in<br>culture-proven infection with the Lyme spirochete. The same ratio of<br>patients never recall finding a rash on their bodies, either. Although<br>the erythema migrans (EM) or "bull's-eye" rash is considered classic, it<br>is not the most common skin sign of early Lyme infection. Atypical forms<br>of this rash are seen far more commonly. It is important to know that<br>the EM rash is always indicative of Lyme disease and requires no further<br>verification prior to starting an appropriate course of antibiotic<br>therapy.<br><br>Finally, it's important to understand that there is a great deal of<br>controversy between the two groups of physicians. So in many cases,<br>LLMDs keep a low profile because they are afraid of being shunned in the<br>larger AMA, and being labelled as quacks. The 300-pound playground bully<br>says the way it is, and that's that.<br><br>The important thing for you to know, questioner, is that **chronic Lyme<br>can be successfully treated! How do I know? *I'm living proof.***<br><br>I would strongly suggest you find a Lyme-Literate MD in your local area.<br>They understand how to 1. properly search for the bacteria, and if you<br>are positive, 2. properly treat it. The treatment is not easy, and it is<br>not quick. But if you do it, you can get back to a normal life. Use<br>these searches to find a doctor who can help you.<br><br>[[ILADS Physician Referral for Lyme<br>Disease](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4b7875&url=http://ilads.org/ilads_media/physician-referral/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ilads.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>[[Doctors \| Lyme Disease<br>Association](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=64ecc5&url=https://www.lymediseaseassociation.org/doctors){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="lymediseaseassociation.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>There are also lots of sites out there dedicated to helping people with<br>chronic Lyme, who have been ignored by mainstream doctors.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
