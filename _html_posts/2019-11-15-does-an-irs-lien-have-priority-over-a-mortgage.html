<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Does an IRS lien have priority over a mortgage?<br><br>If you have a mortgage at the time the IRS files a blanket lien, the IRS<br>lien would go into second position behind the first mortgage. If you<br>have a second mortgage, the IRS lien would go into third position.<br><br>If you owned the house free and clear at the time the IRS files a<br>blanket lien, the IRS lien would go into first position. Any subsequent<br>mortgages you open would fall behind the IRS lien, unless you used the<br>proceeds of the mortgage to pay off the IRS lien.<br><br>There are a few exceptions, one of which is if the HOA has put a lien on<br>the property for unpaid HOA dues. The HOA will actually slot in behind<br>the mortgage(s), but in front of the IRS.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
