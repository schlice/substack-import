<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a good question, and I don't take any personal offense by you<br>asking it. It's a common misconception, and it has a lot to do with what<br>the name "disabled" means. Disabled, implying the root "disability," is<br>a legal term, not a medical term.<br><br>Legally speaking, a disability is a physical or mental impairment that<br>substantially limits one or more major life activities. By this alone,<br>naming your group after its legal definition isn't probably the most<br>efficacious name.<br><br>However, it goes deeper than that. It strikes at the heart of the issue:<br>how do persons with disabilities define themselves?<br><br>Is a person with a disability *defined by* that disability? In other<br>words, does the disability make the person, or are they simply a person<br>who happens to also have a disability? I probably don't need to answer<br>that question, but I will for clarity: *persons with disabilities are<br>not defined by their disabilities.* They are people. Plain and simple.<br>The fact that they also have a disability is meaningless. People don't<br>want to be artificially sorted into boxes. People want to feel included.<br>People want to feel appreciated for the skills they do bring to the<br>table, they don't want to feel segregated by a disability. A name like<br>the "Disabled Sailing Club" would probably segregate more than it would<br>include.<br><br>Something others fail to recognize as well: naming your group the<br>"Disabled Sailing Club" artificially limits the membership of the group!<br>You probably never intended to *restrict membership to only disabled<br>persons.* You probably thought, "Well, anyone can join, but we cater<br>specifically to the disabled." That said, how does your name tell people<br>that anyone can join? From the looks of your name, only people with<br>disabilities can join. Doesn't make your club sound very inclusive, does<br>it.<br><br>Your club isn't about disabilities. Your club is about sailing.<br>Your name should reflect that reality, not create additional boxes where<br>none are necessary.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
