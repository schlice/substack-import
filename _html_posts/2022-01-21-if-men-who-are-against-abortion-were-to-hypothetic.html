<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You're conflating "giving birth" with "being a parent."<br><br>You don't have to be a parent if you give birth. You can simply give the<br>child up for adoption. You can literally give birth and simply tell the<br>doctor that you don't want the baby and you're gone. It is really that<br>simple.<br><br>The father can do the same. They can give the baby up for adoption.<br><br>They don't have to be parents. But killing the baby is not the only<br>alternative.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If men who are against abortion were to hypothetically get a woman<br>pregnant but didn\'t want to become a father, would they still be<br>against abortion, or would they father the child?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
