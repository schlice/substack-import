<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you're in Texas, you'll need to travel out of Texas to get an<br>abortion unless you qualify for an exception. Exceptions are very<br>limited and include:<br><br>- To save the pregnant person\'s life<br>- To prevent serious risk to the pregnant person\'s physical health.<br><br>It is legal, however, to travel outside of Texas in order to get an<br>abortion. You can visit the following site to find an abortion provider<br>in a nearby state:<br><br>[https://www.abortionfinder.org/(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bd7ae3&url=https://www.abortionfinder.org/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Another option, while less appealing to someone seeking an abortion, is<br>carrying to term and using the Texas Safe Haven law (also known as the<br>Baby Moses law).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
