<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Department policies are all different, but there are several reasons why<br>officers are not legally responsible for providing medical attention:<br><br>1.  If an officer is solo, he has other concerns at that moment<br>    following a shooting, not the least of which is his continuing<br>    safety. He has to secure the scene, control the bystanders, and make<br>    sure none of them want to take immediate revenge for the shooting.<br>    Emotions run high, but the officer cannot focus on anything else<br>    until backup arrives. If an officer has a partner with him who can<br>    assist with securing the scene, and they don\'t have any other<br>    immediate safety or security concerns, the officer can then provide<br>    basic medical attention, but two-officer cars are becoming more and<br>    more rare these days.<br>2.  Once backup arrives, the officer in question is generally taken<br>    aside so that evidence can be preserved (i.e. his duty weapon will<br>    be taken into evidence, GSR tests will be run, etc). The officer\'s<br>    priority is still not the suspect at that point.<br>3.  Officers are generally not trained as EMTs. Officers are usually<br>    only trained as first responders (CPR/FA/AED), but not generally as<br>    EMTs. There is only so much that an officer can do before the EMTs<br>    arrive.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
