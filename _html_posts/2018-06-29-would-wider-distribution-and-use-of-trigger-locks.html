You should<br>only put a trigger lock on a gun that you do not need rapid access to,<br>and such a gun would be unloaded. So you're only really locking unloaded<br>guns, which don't accidentally discharge.<br><br>You'll never stop stupid. You'll never prevent someone leaving a loaded<br>gun unattended somewhere. Even if there are laws against it, it will<br>still happen, so unintended discharges will still, at some point, take<br>place.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
