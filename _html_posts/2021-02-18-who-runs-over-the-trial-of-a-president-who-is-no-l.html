Because the Senate should not try former presidents.<br><br>A "former president" is another word for a "civilian." And the Senate<br>has no jurisdiction to try a civilian, despite their insistence that<br>they do.<br><br>The Constitution is clear about this point in its prohibition against<br>Bills of Attainder. A Bill of Attainder is a law which charges one<br>person or a group of people, and declares them guilty without a judicial<br>trial and the protections of civil rights it affords.<br><br>Only Federal officials are bound to trials in the Senate. Civilians have<br>the right to judicial trial, and all of the civil rights protections it<br>affords.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
