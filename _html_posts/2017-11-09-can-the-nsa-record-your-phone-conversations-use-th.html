<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Assuming you had already been under investigation, it wouldn't be the<br>NSA. It would probably be the police.<br><br>With few exceptions, the only way your phone conversations could be<br>recorded and legally used against you in court is with a warrant.<br><br>We already know that the NSA "listens" with automated systems on all<br>phone calls, but they are looking for "keywords" which might indicate<br>terrorism. They would not be arresting you and using those calls against<br>you in court, though. They'd be calling you a terrorist and sending you<br>to Gitmo.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
