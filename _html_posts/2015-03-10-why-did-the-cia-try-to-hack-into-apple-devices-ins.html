<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>1.  Because passing laws is hard. Hacking software is easier. You\'d<br>    never get such a law passed. No one would go for it.\<br>2.  It lets everyone (even the bad guys) know what you\'re doing.<br>    Consequently, if the bad guys know you can listen in on their<br>    iPhones and iPads, they won\'t use them.<br>3.  If they have evidence that leads them to believe they need<br>    information from an iPhone, they can get a warrant. They don\'t need<br>    a new law.<br>4.  The CIA isn\'t chartered to be an intelligence agency within the US.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
