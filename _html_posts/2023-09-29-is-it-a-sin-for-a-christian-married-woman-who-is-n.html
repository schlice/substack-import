<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Well, I guess it's up to me to take the opposite view today.<br><br>*(NOTE: Throughout this discussion, I refer to "masturbation," by which<br>I mean "solo masturbation." To be clear, what you do together with your<br>spouse, in a loving committed relationship, in the bedroom, is not what<br>we are discussing, as this is not sinful. When we discuss masturbation<br>in this context, it is specifically by yourself).*<br><br>Masturbation, especially for the reasons we claim to do it, **is<br>sinful**. Christians don't like to hear that, because it generally<br>convicts them, and that's uncomfortable for anyone.<br><br>I just want you to know that I write this with great love for all of my<br>Christian brothers and sisters, and believe me, I know your struggle.<br>But struggle alone does not make something biblical. Anyway, let's<br>discuss.<br><br>Though the Bible nowhere explicitly addresses masturbation, it does<br>outline the purpose of sex. According to 1 Corinthians 7:2--5:<br><br>> Each man should have sexual relations with his own wife, and each<br>> woman with her own husband. The husband should fulfill his marital<br>> duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. The wife does<br>> not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband. In<br>> the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body<br>> but yields it to his wife. Do not deprive each other except perhaps by<br>> mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to<br>> prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you<br>> because of your lack of self-control.<br><br>Implicit in this passage are these truths:<br><br>- God's plan for sex requires relationship, namely, that of a husband<br>  and wife (verse 2). Masturbation is sex disconnected from<br>  relationship.<br>- Foundational to God's plan for sex is giving one's body to another<br>  (verse 4). Masturbation is the keeping of one's body to oneself.<br>- The solution to a time of deprivation is to "come together" (verse 5).<br>  Masturbation is done alone, not together.<br><br>So right away, we see that masturbation is not in keeping with God's<br>plan for us, and the answers for married couples are all right there.<br>But there are so many who say that it's good to masturbate to equalize<br>the libidos of two sexual partners. It releases marital tension when one<br>spouse is more sexually active than another, and therefore builds a<br>healthier marriage. The biblical description of sex in marriage,<br>however, doesn't allow for that. It says that the woman yields her body<br>to her husband; it's her responsibility to take care of his needs, just<br>as it's his responsibility to address her needs. Remember, God's plan<br>for sex is that spouses give themselves to each other. Any sexual<br>activity apart from that goal is, therefore, sinful.<br><br>Singles say that it's a *physical need* that they must fulfill or they<br>can't sleep, their work suffers, etc. However, the Bible never presents<br>sexual fulfillment as a need. On the contrary, Paul says to the<br>unmarried, "It's better to stay unmarried" (verse 8). Paul continues in<br>verse 9, where he identifies the proper outlet for single people who<br>struggle with sexual desire: "If they cannot control themselves, they<br>should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion." Paul<br>suggests that self-control (one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit) is the<br>best answer. To singles who lack self-control, Paul does not say, "Let<br>them masturbate;" he says, "Let them marry." Again, marriage is the<br>God-given outlet for sexual tension, not masturbation.<br><br>So, is masturbation a sin? The Bible does not directly answer this<br>question, but there definitely are some biblical principles to apply:<br><br>1.  "So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the<br>    glory of God" (1 Corinthians 10:31). If we cannot give God glory for<br>    something, we should not do it.<br>2.  "Everything that does not come from faith is sin" (Romans 14:23). If<br>    we are not fully convinced that an activity is honoring to God, it<br>    is a sin.<br>3.  "I will not be mastered by anything" (1 Corinthians 6:12).<br>    Christians have a responsibility to avoid anything that might<br>    enslave them.<br>4.  "I discipline my body and keep it under control" (1 Corinthians<br>    9:27). Self-denial is difficult, but self-discipline is worth it.<br>5.  "The fruit of the Spirit is . . . self-control" (Galatians<br>    5:22--23). Masturbation is almost always a sign of a lack of<br>    self-control.<br>6.  Do "not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the flesh desires what<br>    is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the<br>    flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to<br>    do whatever you want" (Galatians 5:16--17). We are called to<br>    self-denial, not to self-gratification.<br><br>These truths should have an impact on what we do with our bodies. In<br>light of the above principles, it is doubtful that masturbation can be a<br>God-honoring activity. If masturbation could be done with<br><br>- no lust in the heart<br>- no immoral thoughts<br>- no pornography<br>- no self-gratification of the flesh<br>- full assurance that it is good and right<br>- thanks given to God<br><br>then perhaps it would be allowable. But those qualifiers seem to negate<br>the very meaning and purpose of masturbation. They also point directly<br>to some reasons Christians claim to need masturbation, such as<br>satisfying a need of the flesh.<br><br>So while I commiserate, I cannot condone, Biblically. For these reasons,<br>I believe masturbation is sinful in the vast majority of cases.<br><br>\<br><br>(EDIT) I've now had multiple commenters talk about "sexless marriage"<br>and "touch deprivation" which cause great concern for believers who feel<br>"stuck" in their marriage. They are isolated and face tremendous<br>psychological pressures.<br><br>So let's address the other side of the equation: sin in marriage.<br><br>Marriage is a sacred covenant, a divine institution established by God.<br>Traditional wedding vows encapsulate the essence of this commitment:<br>\"To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better or for worse,<br>for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to<br>cherish, until death do us part, in obedience to God's holy command.\"<br>These vows signify a lifelong dedication to love and honor one another,<br>reflecting the love of Christ for His church. However, the reality of<br>marriage is that it involves two imperfect, sinful individuals, which<br>can lead to significant challenges and, in some cases, the consideration<br>of divorce.<br><br>Marriage unites two sinners, each with their own selfish desires and<br>individualistic tendencies. This union often reveals the stark<br>differences between spouses, long after the marriage vows have been<br>sealed, leading to conflicts and misunderstandings. The story of a<br>couple who, despite their differences, found themselves unknowingly<br>seeking love online only to discover they were already married to each<br>other, illustrates how easily couples can become blinded by their own<br>selfishness.<br><br>The question arises: Is divorce biblically justified, and if so, under<br>what circumstances? Jesus addresses this issue in Luke 16:14-18, where<br>He confronts the Pharisees\' liberal interpretation of the Law regarding<br>divorce. The Pharisees, who were lovers of money and self-justification,<br>had distorted the Law to allow divorce for trivial reasons, such as a<br>wife burning dinner or speaking too loudly. In Luke 16:18, Jesus states,<br>\"Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery,<br>and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.\"<br>This statement underscores the sanctity of marriage and the seriousness<br>of divorce. Jesus provides a more detailed explanation in Matthew 19:9,<br>where He introduces the \"exception clause\": \"And I say to you;<br>whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries<br>another, commits adultery.\"<br><br>The term \"sexual immorality\" (Greek: porneia) encompasses a broad<br>range of sexual sins, including adultery, incest, homosexuality, and<br>prostitution. Jesus clarifies that while divorce is not required in<br>cases of sexual immorality, it is permitted. This allowance recognizes<br>the severe breach of trust and defilement of the marriage bed caused by<br>such actions.<br><br>The Apostle Paul expands on Jesus\' teaching in 1 Corinthians 7:10-15.<br>He emphasizes that marriage is a lifelong commitment and that divorce<br>should not be pursued without serious consideration. However, Paul<br>introduces another exception: abandonment by an unbelieving spouse. He<br>states, \"But if the unbelieving partner separates, let it be so. In<br>such cases, the brother or sister is not enslaved. God has called you to<br>peace\" (1 Corinthians 7:15).<br><br>So this begs the question: **can one partner in a marriage sin by<br>emotionally "abandoning" their spouse?** If that partner is unrepentant,<br>*can this be Biblical grounds for divorce?* Can refusal to even<br>touch your spouse be considered grounds for divorce?<br><br>There certainly is no requirement to stay in a marriage where the<br>marriage is actually causing emotional *harm*. Paul says very<br>clearly: "the brother or sister is not enslaved. God has called you to<br>peace." God does not desire your marriage to be a *prison*. This is<br>exactly what the Pharisees did: adherence to the Law regardless of the<br>consequences. Clearly, we are not talking about divorce when a spouse<br>burns dinner or talks too loud. But does God call it sin when we divorce<br>an abusive spouse? Certainly not. Paul talks about "abandonment" by an<br>unbelieving spouse. Can touch deprivation in a marriage be considered<br>"abandonment?" Abdication of the marriage vow? Lack of commitment to the<br>marriage, and to God's covenant in it?<br><br>The key when considering divorce is not just the sin, but the **lack of<br>genuine repentance**. Divorce acts as a severe form of discipline, akin<br>to church discipline, which is enacted due to unrepentant sin. The goal<br>is always reconciliation and restoration, but when a spouse remains<br>unrepentant, divorce may become necessary to protect the innocent party.<br><br>Marriage is designed to be a lifelong covenant that reflects the love<br>and commitment of Christ to His church. However, the Bible provides<br>guidelines for when divorce is permissible, emphasizing the importance<br>of repentance and the protection of the innocent spouse. As believers,<br>we are called to uphold the sanctity of marriage, seek reconciliation<br>where possible, and support those who are suffering in unrepentant and<br>abusive relationships.<br><br>In the end, our commitment to our marriage vows should be unwavering,<br>striving to honor God in our relationships and demonstrating to the<br>world the beauty of a Christ-centered marriage.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
