There are narrow exceptions in some<br>states, but under most conditions, the warrant must be presented when<br>the occupant asks to see it.<br><br>Courts generally hold the police to the "reasonableness" standard, since<br>the Fourth Amendment requires them to act in a reasonable manner.<br>Conducting a reasonable search generally involves displaying the warrant<br>upon request. If the court finds that the execution of the warrant was<br>unreasonable, they can throw out the evidence obtained under that<br>warrant.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
