<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>While I don\'t agree with your point about foregoing Miranda, we\'ll<br>just have to agree to disagree on that point.<br><br>We know that the system is adversarial. It was intentionally designed<br>that way, as adversarial legal systems mostly are present in common law<br>countries. Adversarial systems are ones in which counsel represents<br>clients in front of an impartial party. It is different from<br>inquisitorial systems in use by some civil law jurisdictions, where a<br>judge does all the questioning.<br><br>The police, as agents of the state, are part of the prosecution team.<br>The suspect, naturally, is a defendant. Therefore, the system is, in<br>fact, adversarial, and is only non-coersive in the sense that police can<br>lie to a defendant in order to get him to talk, as long as they are<br>non-coercive. For example, I can tell you that I found your fingerprint<br>at the scene of the crime (let\'s presume I did not). It is presumed<br>that the innocent person would dispute the evidence (\"That\'s<br>impossible, I was never in that house!\"), while the guilty person would<br>try to explain it away, or think, \"Crap, they got me\" and try to<br>explain what really happened.<br><br>However, I can\'t tell you that if you don\'t confess, I\'m going to<br>talk to DHS and make it so you never see your children again, so you\'d<br>better confess now. That\'s coercion, and would render that confession<br>useless, since we don\'t know whether or not the coercive interview<br>techniques actually influenced the plea.<br><br>We can overcome some of that bias by asking the defendant to recount<br>specific details of the crime that were never released outside of the<br>police investigators. If the suspect knows these details, it\'s a good<br>bet that he was telling the truth about his involvement.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-it-legal-for-a-police-officer-to-blatantly-lie-to-you-to-coerce-the-information-they-want/answer/Tim-Dees<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
