I want to address this part:<br><br>> I mean there wouldn\'t be any like Atheism if there\'s no religion.<br><br>What an interesting thought. You're completely right, by the way. What<br>would "atheism" be without "theism?" Atheism does not exist without<br>theism, as atheism only makes sense if there is theism.<br><br>What do atheists believe in that is greater than themselves? The answer<br>is nothing. Atheism is only existent as a counterpoint to theism, such<br>that atheists can only point to theists and say, "I'm not that." In<br>other words, ask 10 atheists what an atheist universally believes,<br>without talking about gods or religion, and you'll get 10 different<br>answers. Because there is no universal belief other than a denial of<br>theism.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
