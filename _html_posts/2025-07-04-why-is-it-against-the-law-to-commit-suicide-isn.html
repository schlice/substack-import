<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If it is legal to end your life, then it is legal to help someone end<br>their life. There should be no reason that you can\'t help someone do<br>something perfectly legal, right?<br><br>And unfortunately, **helping someone end their life is only a few forged<br>signatures away from murder.**<br><br>Oh, but you could make the person record their consent on video! That<br>can\'t be faked, right?<br><br>Really? Have you even seen AI these days?<br><br>Even physician assisted suicide can be weaponized against a person.<br>Especially today, money trumps ethics.<br><br>So unfortunately, if it is unlawful for you to take someone else\'s<br>life, it must also be unlawful for you to take your own life.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
