<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should school officials become certified law enforcement officers,<br>just to protect their students? Is this a valid work-around?**<br><br>School officials, as in the Time article, will always have the right to<br>become auxiliary law enforcement officers or Reserve Deputies if they<br>choose, which will then allow them to conceal a firearm on school<br>grounds. The problem here is that usually, when this happens, they have<br>additional auxiliary officer or Reserve Deputy duties they now have to<br>perform. In my county, Reserve Deputies are required to give a minimum<br>of 192 hours annually in volunteer time back to the county (granted,<br>that averages out to only 16 hours a month), and that may be time that<br>an educator did not want to give just for the privilege of carrying a<br>firearm in school.<br><br>Additionally, this educator believes the full law enforcement training<br>was necessary, but others do not. More importantly, I really don't think<br>that putting teachers through law enforcement training is a viable<br>option for all educators, since it really requires a wholly different<br>mindset than the vast majority of educators possess.<br><br>A better option in my opinion would be [[firearms training specifically<br>designed for<br>educators](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=043d97&url=http://cocivilliberties.org/faster/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cocivilliberties.org"}]{.qlink_container} who wish to carry<br>concealed firearms. The program I linked above is called FASTER. FASTER<br>stands for Faculty/Administrator Safety Training and Emergency Response.<br>It is training specifically designed for educators who have the desire<br>to conceal a firearm to protect their students. Please take a few<br>minutes and check it out.<br><br>Here in Colorado, when certified programs like FASTER exist, school<br>districts can authorize graduates who also possess a Concealed Carry<br>permit from the Sheriff to conceal firearms on school property.<br><br>So to answer your question:<br><br>**Should school officials become certified law enforcement officers,<br>just to protect their students? Is this a valid work-around?** I think<br>it will always remain an option for an instructor to go this route **if<br>they choose and if they understand all of the ramifications of that<br>decision**. In fact, it's unlikely that a school district could<br>*prevent* an instructor from doing this if they choose.<br><br>*However, I don't believe it is necessary.* I believe that training<br>options like FASTER are much better since we tailor the training<br>specifically to educators, and they then won't have the requisite<br>additional duty which must be performed as a Reserve Deputy or an<br>auxiliary police officer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
