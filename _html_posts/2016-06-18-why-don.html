They already do, but rather than dropping a massive fuel bomb on<br>    some unsuspecting city population when an airliner has an emergency,<br>    they just drop the fuel, *sans* tank. Aircraft can "dump" their fuel<br>    from the fuel tanks in an emergency. The fuel vaporizes in the<br>    atmosphere and generally is not a factor to anyone or anything<br>    below.<br>2.  Added drag on the outside of the aircraft increases fuel use, and is<br>    generally not advisable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
