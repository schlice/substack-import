<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends." And in this<br>case, it wholly depends on how any one state classifies an "emergency<br>situation."<br><br>In the majority of cases, an emergency situation would be classified<br>as a pregnancy which threatens the life of the mother. At a bare<br>minimum, hospitals should be required to protect the life of the mother.<br>Every state which restricts abortions has exceptions to protect the life<br>of the mother. The fact that doctors are sometimes confused with how to<br>interpret these laws, often delaying critical care, does not negate the<br>fact that hospitals should be required to save the life of the mother,<br>using whatever means necessary to do so, including when doing so may<br>cause the baby to die.<br><br>But we must be very, very careful to define our terms and put sensible<br>guardrails around this, or ERs will become *de facto* abortion clinics<br>when the laws are unclear, undercutting the will of the people in those<br>states.<br><br>\<br><br>(EDIT) On Tuesday (3 May 2025). President Trump reversed the very EMTALA<br>policy we are discussing in this answer.<br><br>Under the Biden administration, EMTALA was reinterpreted in July 2022 to<br>allow taxpayer dollars to fund what were termed "emergency abortions."<br>This guidance not only permitted federal funding for these procedures<br>but also imposed penalties on health care workers and hospitals that<br>refused to carry them out, even when such actions conflicted with their<br>deeply held moral or religious convictions. The policy effectively<br>compelled medical professionals to act against their conscience,<br>creating a moral and legal dilemma for those medical professionals who<br>prioritize the protection of unborn life, in accordance with the<br>Hippocratic Oath.<br><br>After Tuesday's reversal of Biden's policy, the Trump administration<br>affirmed that EMTALA would continue to be utilized, but in a manner<br>consistent with its original intent --- to ensure emergency medical care<br>without mandating procedures that conflict with ethical principles or<br>state laws.<br><br>The policy reversal ends years of pro-abortion lawfare against pro-life<br>states and doctors, as well as renouncing the lie that pro-life states<br>deny emergency care to pregnant women.<br><br>> *Let's be clear, every pro-life state already protects moms in medical<br>> emergencies. This mandate was never about care or saving lives --- it<br>> was about coercion & pushing abortion into every hospital, by force.<br>> --- Kristan Hawkins, President, Students for Life of America*<br><br>Roger Serevino, with the Heritage Foundation, echoed those sentiments.<br>"Wide majorities of Americans oppose forcing doctors and hospitals to<br>take innocent human life," he said, "and this change goes back to<br>respecting conscience and the rule of law." When following its original<br>intent, "EMTALA requires hospitals to treat unborn children and mothers<br>in labor." But as Severino went on to explain, "shamelessly, abortion<br>radicals inverted this clearly pro-life law to unlawfully mandate<br>abortion nationwide, even though every state already has life of the<br>mother exceptions."<br><br>"To add insult to injury," Severino stressed, "the Biden order refused<br>to acknowledge that the law protected mothers, or even women, instead<br>calling them 'pregnant patients.' A stain on America's conscience is now<br>gone, and good riddance."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
