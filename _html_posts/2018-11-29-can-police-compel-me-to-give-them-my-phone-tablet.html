<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can police compel me to give them my phone, tablet or computer<br>passwords?**<br><br>Passwords are considered "testimony," so the police cannot compel you to<br>reveal your password.<br><br>If the court has issued a warrant for something on your computer, you<br>must provide that something, not your password.<br><br>If the court has (somehow) issued a warrant for your password, *then*<br>you must provide it, or you can be held in contempt of court. However,<br>it's unlikely that this would ever happen.<br><br>Interestingly, the law hasn't yet caught up with technology. While your<br>password is considered "testimony," *your face and your fingerprints are<br>not.* If the police hold your iPhone X up to your face and unlock it,<br>they have not elicited testimony from you. It's already happened at<br>least once so far, and the courts did not rule that the unlocking was a<br>5th Amendment violation. In that latest case, they did have a warrant<br>for the contents of the phone, so they held his phone up to his face and<br>unlocked it.<br><br>But it raises the bigger point that your face and your fingerprints are<br>not considered testimonial, and so you can be compelled to use them to<br>unlock devices.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
