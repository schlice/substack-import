<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As a general rule, police officers are pretty good at "guessing" speeds.<br>They spend so much time looking at cars that they can usually reasonably<br>estimate the speed of a car within a 10 mile per hour bracket.<br><br>However, there are several other methods police can employ to obtain<br>your speed:<br><br>1.  If you were on the highway, both vehicle and airborne platforms can<br>    time your vehicle as it crosses visible markers on the road, and<br>    that time can be used to calculate your speed. I know from personal<br>    experience that this system is very accurate, to within the margin<br>    of error for both speedometers and RADAR units.<br>    [VASCAR(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=00bcce&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VASCAR){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} is one such system,<br>    and if used correctly, it can calculate speed to within 2 mph.<br>2.  If the officer was driving a vehicle, he may have *paced* you.<br>    Pacing is a technique where the patrol car matches your speed, and<br>    then the officer simply needs to look at his dashboard to see how<br>    fast you are going, no RADAR needed.<br><br>It's also quite possible that your RADAR/LIDAR detector is simply<br>malfunctioning. You'd never know unless an officer pointed a RADAR unit<br>directly at your detector and turned it on.<br><br>When I was a cadet at the Air Force Academy, my folks used the money<br>they were going to spend on my college costs to buy me a car. My fave at<br>the time was the Ford Thunderbird SC, so they bought me a 1989 model at<br>auction:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-b815a2cef55451365024e82f5f75efcd){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-b815a2cef55451365024e82f5f75efcd" master_w="700"<br>master_h="467"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(This wasn't my car, but it may as well have been.

During that time, we tested out the<br>car and the new radar detector on Ocean Parkway, which is along the<br>barrier beaches on Long Island. Literally deserted highway, so we could<br>really open it up and see what it does.<br><br>When we were stopped, the officer said he clocked us at 148. When we<br>told him the radar detector didn't even blip, he took out his handheld<br>unit and, standing at the hood of the car, blasted it directly at the<br>detector. Nothing.<br><br>The moral of the story is you will probably never know that your radar<br>detector isn't working correctly unless an officer blasts his radar gun<br>at you to test it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
