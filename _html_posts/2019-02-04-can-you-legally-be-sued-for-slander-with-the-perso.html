Slander is a civil wrong (tort) and can be the basis<br>> for a lawsuit. Damages (payoff for worth) for slander may be limited<br>> to actual (special) damages unless there is malicious intent, since<br>> such damages are usually difficult to specify and harder to prove.<br>> Some statements, such as an untrue accusation of having committed a<br>> crime, having a loathsome disease or being unable to perform one\'s<br>> occupation, are treated as slander per se since the harm and malice<br>> are obvious and therefore usually result in general and even punitive<br>> damage recovery by the person harmed. Words spoken over the air on<br>> television or radio are treated as libel (written defamation) and not<br>> slander on the theory that broadcasting reaches a large audience as<br>> much as if not more than printed<br>> publications.\[1\](#OriQI){#cite-OriQI .citation_link}<br><br>Under normal circumstances, slander involves two things:<br><br>- The telling of an untruth<br>- The untruth causing harm to the reputation of the person defamed.<br><br>In general, damages for slander are limited to actual damages unless<br>there is malicious intent.<br><br>That said, there are a few special cases wherein *the harm and malice<br>are obvious,* such as:<br><br>- accusing someone of committing a crime<br>- accusing someone of having a loathsome disease<br>- accusing someone of being unable to perform their occupation<br><br>In these cases, the person harmed can recover general damages, as well<br>as punitive damages (money paid specifically to dissuade other people<br>from doing the same thing and to financially impact the person<br>committing the harm).<br><br>Stating that it is *your opinion* that someone committed a crime is not<br>slander, it is opinion. Clarifying that you have no proof that such a<br>crime was committed simply shows that you have a strange opinion, one<br>you hold even in the face of a lack of evidence, but it is an opinion<br>nonetheless. Stating you have no basis in fact and then making a<br>slanderous statement anyway can be construed as malice.<br><br>In your case, stating that it is your opinion that someone committed a<br>crime is an opinion. Opinions are not slander. Stating that you *know*<br>the person committed the crime even though there is no proof *is*<br>slanderous, and your admittance that there is no proof is enough to show<br>malicious intent in your slander.<br><br>There is a fine line between opinion and fact.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-OriQI){.citation_index} [[Legal Dictionary -<br>Law.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2a4b81&url=https://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected%3D1969){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="law.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
