PPMS can have periods of time that the patient is<br>stable (no active symptoms and no disease progression), the disease is<br>not active (no change in symptoms) and either is or is not experiencing<br>disease progression, and there can be periods of time where the disease<br>is active (in a relapse or active disease process) and either is or is<br>not experiencing disease progression.<br><br>Approximately 15% of people who are diagnosed with MS are diagnosed with<br>PPMS.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional medical advice.
