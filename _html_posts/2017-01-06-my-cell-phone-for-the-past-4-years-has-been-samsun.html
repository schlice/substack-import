<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I actually currently own and have in my possession a functional S4 (my<br>last phone) and a GALAXY S6 edge (my primary daily phone).<br><br>On the upsides:<br><br>- I don't even own the newest S7 devices, and my S6 performs twice as<br>  well as my S4 did. The CPU is simply better.<br>- The screen is sharper and clearer. Less noticeable dithering between<br>  pixels. It's just a sharper screen. And if you get one of the "edge"<br>  devices, the curved screen is a real looker. It's simply gorgeous. Is<br>  it extremely functional? Not really, but the curved screen is more<br>  about form than function. It does have some functionality, but not<br>  much.<br>- The camera is better. It almost snaps better pictures than my DSLR.<br>  Almost.<br>- On the S7, the internal storage space is bigger.<br>- I can't remember whether or not my S4 had LTE capabilities, but I know<br>  the newest GALAXY phones are LTE compatible. My S6 is LTE.<br><br>But, as with anything, there are downsides to every upside:<br><br>- You will sorely miss removable batteries. I think it was worlds easier<br>  to keep a spare charged battery in my pocket than to have to use a<br>  battery case or an external battery. And because it's Android,<br>  processes can go amok and can silently run down your battery. Granted,<br>  the newer internal batteries are higher capacity which kinda makes up<br>  for the fact that you're losing a removable battery, but with my S4, I<br>  could not only carry a spare charged battery, but I could change the<br>  capacity of the battery if I chose. I have a big 5200mAh battery for<br>  my S4. It came with a replacement back cover for the phone because it<br>  was so big. I even got a case that fit the phone and the big battery.<br>  I could go almost three days of heavy use on that big battery. My<br>  battery case tends to make up the difference on vacation and such, but<br>  like I said, I still miss removable batteries.<br>- In the S6 series, they didn't even include expandable memory. In the<br>  S7 series, it did make a comeback, but the sealed battery is still<br>  there.<br>- The S4 series felt more "solid" than these newer phones do. It is a<br>  little heavier, but I was okay with that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
