<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It depends on the condition of your discharge. In the vast majority of<br>cases, those with honorable discharges from active duty can turn around<br>and join the Reserves. It's not a guarantee; every situation is<br>different. Talk to your recruiter if you want to go this route.<br><br>If you were enlisted on AD and went on to get your Bachelor's degree in<br>your away time, you can even join the Reserves as an officer, at least<br>in the Air Force. You'll have to attend OTS (we jokingly called OTS<br>graduates "90-day wonders"), and then you'll have to serve in the<br>Reserves as an officer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
