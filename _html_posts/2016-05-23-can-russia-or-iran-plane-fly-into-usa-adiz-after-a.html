<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's dissect this question<br><br>***Can Russia or Iran plane fly into USA ADIZ (after all, it is an<br>international airspace)***<br><br>Of course. And as long as they have a valid flight plan on file, no one<br>will bat an eye.<br><br>*and tested their missile peacefully ?*<br><br>WHAT????? Firing missiles from aircraft??? You realize that firing<br>missiles from aircraft when you are not within the borders of your<br>sovereign airspace is potentially an act of war, don't you? And<br>depending on what you're shooting at, you could be within your own<br>sovereign airspace and it could *still* be an act of war (for<br>example, if you're shooting at a US aircraft overflying your nation on a<br>valid flight plan). The only place aircraft ever fire missiles when<br>*not* in actual combat is in live-fire missile ranges, and those are<br>well known and broadcast well ahead of time.<br><br>Other missiles that are test-fired are *declared* to the international<br>community. At the very least, any nation firing anything into the sky<br>would want to let the US know, because we know all/see all (thanks,<br>NORAD) and you wouldn't want the US to accidentally nuke you because<br>they thought you were shooting at them. 99.9% of the time, when a<br>missile is fired, our intelligence community is already well aware that<br>it was going to happen.<br><br>Of course, it's that 0.1% that makes you nervous.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
