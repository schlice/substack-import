<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**TL;DR: There are virtually no limits to where they can look once the<br>dog is legally searching the car.**<br><br>The police don't need reasonable suspicion to use the dog on the outside<br>of the car, so probable cause or consent are not required. If the dog<br>hits, this constitutes probable cause to search the vehicle. The<br>reasoning is that the dog only hits on illegal items, which you do not<br>have a right to possess, and therefore the 4th Amendment does not apply.<br><br>What they *cannot* do is detain you for longer than the normal amount of<br>time it takes to conduct a traffic stop in order to bring in a drug dog<br>to establish probable cause.<br><br>Nevertheless, if they already established probable cause (or they have<br>your consent) and they are searching your car with a drug dog, and the<br>dog hits on a trim panel, they can look behind that trim panel. If the<br>dog hits under a seat, they can take that seat out and search. If the<br>dog hits on your headliner, they can take down your headliner. At that<br>point, wherever the dog hits is fair game.<br><br>The caveat: the place where they look must reasonably be able to contain<br>the object for which consent was given to search. With drugs, they can<br>be concealed anywhere within the car, so the whole car is fair game.<br><br>For example (a poor one, but I'm trying to make a point), if they were<br>searching for a stolen baseball bat, they couldn't open the glove box to<br>do it, even if the "baseball bat sniffing dog" hit on the glove box,<br>because it can't possibly contain a baseball bat.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
