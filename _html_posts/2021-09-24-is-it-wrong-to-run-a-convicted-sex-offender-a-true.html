<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>100% wrong. It's both illegal and immoral.<br><br>This doesn't mean you get to be blissfully unaware of that person's<br>whereabouts. It doesn't mean they get to live next door to a school.<br>There are plenty of rules which they have to follow as a person on the<br>sex offender registry. But we are not unaware of their presence, and<br>they fully know that.<br><br>They know that every single person in a 10 mile radius knows who they<br>are and exactly where they live. They will spend the rest of their lives<br>under a microscope. I suspect that most people simply look at them with<br>derision instead of trying to run them out of town with threats of<br>violence. Threatening someone, even someone on the registry, is a crime,<br>and now you are the aggressor, not the offender.<br><br>They served their time. They are allowed to live, and they have to live<br>somewhere. Running them out of town just sends them to someone else's<br>town, and there is nothing morally acceptable about NIMBY.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it wrong to run a convicted sex offender (a true child rapist) out of<br>town with threats of deliberate vigilante violence?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
