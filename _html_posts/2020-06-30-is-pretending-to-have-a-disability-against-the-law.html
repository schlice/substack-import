Laws cannot<br>be made which restrict your right to free speech.<br><br>However, *why* you are pretending to have a disability may be<br>illegal. If you are attempting to extract some sort of benefit or even<br>monetary gain by declaring yourself disabled, this would be classified<br>as "theft of service" which is most definitely illegal.<br><br>However, if you simply tell people you are disabled when you are not,<br>you are not doing anything illegal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
