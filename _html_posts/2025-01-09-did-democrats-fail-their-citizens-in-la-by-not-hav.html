<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Those are indeed concerns. Some of those concerns are largely out of<br>everyone's hands, as not even Gavin Newsome could control the lack of<br>rainfall in California.<br><br>But some of the concerns are indeed choices which government leaders<br>could have made, such as allowing the priorities of the<br>environmentalists to win out over the priorities of the forestry<br>service. The fact that California has disallowed controlled burning to<br>remove undergrowth and fuel for wildfires is a direct contributor to the<br>quick spread of these wildfires. These fires have years of fuel to burn,<br>and the lack of water storage and rainfall aren't helping, as there just<br>isn't enough water to go around. Those are also policy choices, as they<br>could have prioritized water retention to prepare for times when water<br>is needed but droughts occur. They could have prioritized the creation<br>of water reservoirs, fed by both natural rainfall/snowmelt and import<br>through purchasing water from other locations. They could then manage<br>the distribution of water based on how much water is in the reservoirs<br>and how much is projected to be needed based on environmental concerns.<br>Pre-planning for droughts is work that is done now which won't see<br>benefit for years, maybe decades, and it's really easy to ignore when<br>faced with current problems.<br><br>It's a perfect storm of policy choices and Mother Nature.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
