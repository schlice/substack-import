<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In other words, you\'re asking if someone says they<br>committed a murder, but there is no body, can they be convicted of<br>murder?\<br>\<br>The answer is yes, you can be convicted of murder without the body,<br>assuming there is enough other evidence (i.e. physical, circumstantial,<br>etc) that shows that a crime was committed.\<br>\<br>If there is no evidence whatsoever that a crime was committed, it<br>would be very difficult (but not impossible) to convict someone of<br>committing said crime. Any halfway-competent public defender should be<br>able to avoid conviction if there is absolutely no<br>evidence.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
