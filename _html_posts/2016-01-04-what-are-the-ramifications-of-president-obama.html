<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>They will have virtually no impact on anything.<br><br>The biggest provision in his executive order will be to require<br>small-scale gun dealers to get Federal Firearms Licenses (FFLs). This<br>means that they will have to conduct background checks on every firearm<br>they sell.<br><br>I have no problem with this. I would personally like all states to close<br>the \"gun show loophole\" by requiring all personal transactions to go<br>through a FFL. There are many FFLs who will, for a small fee, do a<br>background check for you. They issue a background check \"certificate\"<br>that states that as of \<this day\>, this person is legally authorized<br>to purchase a gun. It will certainly spur the creation of more FFLs who<br>will do nothing more than process background checks and issue<br>certificates.<br><br>But that wasn\'t the question, was it? The question was \"what are the<br>ramifications of that order\". Well, besides creating a cottage industry<br>of FFLs, not much else. It doesn\'t curb any gun violence. It wouldn\'t<br>have stopped a Sandy Hook, or a Charleston church shooter, or an Aurora<br>theater shooter. The guns used there were all purchased legally (even<br>though Charleston messed up, it was legal). Sandy Hook was basically a<br>\"stolen\" gun, but the owner purchased it legally. So these changes<br>mean zero to actual gun crime.<br><br>But it shows that the president is \"doing something\" to try to combat<br>the problem. Even if the something that he did has no impact on gun<br>violence in America, he \"did something.\" And that\'s better than \"not<br>doing something,\" I guess.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
