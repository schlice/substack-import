<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *What can the community do? Education? Institutions? Family? Work?*<br><br>The community is already doing everything they can to support people<br>with MS. There are whole not-for-profit organizations dedicated to<br>helping people with MS do anything they want to do. The largest, of<br>course, is the [[National MS<br>Society](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=207640&url=http://www.nmss.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nmss.org"}]{.qlink_container}, and their local chapters<br>offer all of those services and more.<br><br>> *How can the poeple around you help you throughout your struggle?*<br><br>Understanding. Understand that for every MS patient, there is a<br>different incantation of MS. So there are literally 300,000 different<br>versions of MS in the United States, and millions more versions<br>worldwide, since everyone experiences MS differently. No one has the<br>same symptoms. No one can ever understand my MS completely, since I<br>experience it differently than anyone else.<br><br>If people would take the time to understand MS (not my MS, but the<br>fact that they are all different), we would go a long way to greater<br>understanding and acceptance.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
