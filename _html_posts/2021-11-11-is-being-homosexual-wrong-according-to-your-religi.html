<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>With relation to Christianity, "being homosexual" and "wrong" are terms<br>of art which must be nuanced before we can answer the question.<br><br>Love in the Bible is a strange thing. The big issue we have is<br>translation. There are [[six different words for<br>love](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=23034c&url=https://www.yesmagazine.org/health-happiness/2013/12/28/the-ancient-greeks-6-words-for-love-and-why-knowing-them-can-change-your-life){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="yesmagazine.org"}]{.qlink_container} in Greek. So you can't<br>simply say that "homosexual love is wrong." You have to *define* which<br>love we're talking about.<br><br>Most of the Greek forms of love are allowed, and even encouraged,<br>between same-sex people in Christianity. But one type of love, *eros*,<br>is limited to married couples, and the Bible only recognizes marriage as<br>something which God has ordained between one man and one woman.<br><br>So "being homosexual" in and of itself is not "wrong" according to my<br>religion. "Engaging in homosexual sex" is considered to be a sin in my<br>religion, and could rightly be classified as "wrong."<br><br>But that sin makes the homosexual *exactly like everyone else in<br>Christianity:* *a sinner.* We are all sinners. We may sin<br>differently, from one to another, but we're all sinners. I'd rather not<br>dwell on my past sin, but I was a sinner, just like the homosexual.<br><br>That said, we are *saved* through God's grace: he gives us what we do<br>not deserve. He pays for our past sin. He does this when we repent<br>and believe.<br><br>Repentance involves a "turning away" from our past sins. We acknowledge<br>that we are sinners and that we have fallen short of the glory of God.<br>And crucially, we resolve to *turn away* from our sins and to not sin<br>any more.<br><br>In short, we admit we did the bad things, and we stop doing the bad<br>things.<br><br>In return, we're given, freely, everlasting life. Sounds like a pretty<br>good deal.<br><br>Being a homosexual is no different than being addicted to porn or drugs,<br>or allowing money to supplant God in your life, or being an adulterer,<br>or being \<insert_your_sin_here\>. The difference is that the Christian<br>recognizes his or her sinful ways, and resolves to not sin any more.<br><br>No one said it would be easy. It is never easy to struggle against the<br>desires of the flesh. Sin is pleasurable, of this there is no doubt. But<br>we recognize our sinful nature and we resolve to be *better* than our<br>sin. This is what God wants for us. He knows we are human. He took human<br>form so he could experience everything we experience, including the<br>temptation of sin. So he truly knows what we go through.<br><br>But he overcame it. He lived a sinless life. While we fall short of that<br>standard, he recognizes who we are, and he knows our heart.<br><br>The question becomes: do you desire the sin more, or do you desire God<br>more?<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is being homosexual wrong according to your religion?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
