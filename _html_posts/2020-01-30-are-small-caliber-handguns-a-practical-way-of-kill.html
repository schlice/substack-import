<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Are small caliber handguns a practical way of killing mice and rats?<br>How problematic can the damage from over penetration and noise be?**<br><br>Handguns *might be* useful, but there are better choices.<br><br>There are indeed some subsonic 22 ammunitions that produce a report much<br>quieter than others. For example, the [[CCI<br>Quiet-22](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b44308&url=https://www.americanhunter.org/articles/2013/5/23/cci-quiet-22/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="americanhunter.org"}]{.qlink_container} subsonic round fires<br>a .22 caliber bullet at 710 feet per second but still only produces an<br>astonishing 68 decibels at the shooter's ear. For comparison, a loud<br>conversation is 65 decibels. City traffic is 85 decibels. Standard<br>gunshots (as other answers have noted) can be 140 decibels or above<br>(that's in the hearing damage range). You could shoot a Quiet-22 in your<br>apartment and your neighbors probably wouldn't even know you fired a gun<br>(even though doing so is ***extremely unwise and most likely<br>illegal***). Even better, one of the flavors of Quiet-22 offered is a<br>*segmented hollow point* which is designed to expand slightly and then<br>break into three segments on impact. This can potentially do more damage<br>than a single round-nose bullet.<br><br>The downside: you can't use this type of ammunition in a semi-auto<br>handgun or gas-operated rifle. The ammunition is not powerful enough to<br>cycle the action. Of course, you can manually cycle the action, but that<br>kinda defeats the purpose of a semi-auto mechanism. It would be most<br>useful in a single-action rifle or a revolver. But with a shorter barrel<br>comes slower muzzle velocity. Testing with handguns produces much slower<br>muzzle velocity (in the 500 ft/sec range), resulting in the segmented HP<br>not even separating on impact.<br><br>Nevertheless, the point of my (way too long) description of quiet .22<br>ammo is that you can indeed shoot it indoors, without hearing<br>protection, without disturbing the neighbors, without the fear of<br>over-penetration, and it might be effective for mice and rats.<br><br>But my point was that there are better choices.<br><br>Pellet guns, for example, can achieve much higher muzzle velocities than<br>the Quiet-22, without the fear of over-penetration or ricochet, and they<br>are virtually silent in operation. I keep a pellet gun for pest<br>management and it is extremely effective. A pellet rifle firing .177<br>pellets will still kill pests quite effectively (literally drops them<br>where they stand) and you won't run afoul of most city ordinances which<br>state that you can't fire a "firearm" within city limits.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
