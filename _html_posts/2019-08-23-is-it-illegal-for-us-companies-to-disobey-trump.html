<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it illegal for US companies to disobey Trump\'s orders to<br>immediately start looking for an alternative to China, including<br>bringing their companies home and making their products in the US? Can<br>the Supreme Court overturn Trump\'s orders?**<br><br>Anyone who has taken basic Civics classes already knows that Trump's<br>tweets aren't an "order." The Executive Branch does not have the<br>authority to "order" businesses to do anything. The Executive Branch<br>executes existing law. Trump likes to use words, but not all of his<br>words are grounded in law. We get that. He's a businessman, not a lawyer<br>or a politician. However, if there is a law that Trump is going to start<br>enforcing (where they failed to enforce it before), then maybe that's<br>something he can "order." But Trump sending out a few tweets does not<br>constitute an "order" that businesses "must follow."<br><br>But if I was an American company, I wouldn't read Trump's tweets as an<br>"order." I'd read them as a "strong suggestion." As in, "If I were you,<br>I'd start looking for an alternative to working in China." Reading<br>between the lines, I'd read: "Because there are going to be some<br>significant changes related to the things I can control: tariffs. And<br>those changes will have a significant impact on your company, if you<br>continue to choose to work in or with China." It's true, Shenzen set<br>itself up to provide this sort of cheap labor and parts, and American<br>businesses have taken advantage of it, but the rampant IP theft and<br>potential security issues leaves Shenzen a temptress which might just be<br>too costly with which to climb into bed. Or stay there.<br><br>As a company, I may not change anything *today*. But I also would have<br>put an entire team together to examine my whole business model, find out<br>what parts of it are dependent on manufacturing in China or materials<br>sourced from China, and look for alternatives.<br><br>I hear India is ramping up to meet the challenge. In fact, some<br>companies are already doing this (i.e. [[Apple is moving some of its<br>manufacturing to<br>India](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=469e12&url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/04/15/foxconn-confirms-that-mass-production-of-the-iphone-will-begin-in-india-soon){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="appleinsider.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br><br>If China continues to be so flippant with US patent law, I would be<br>looking elsewhere anyway.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
