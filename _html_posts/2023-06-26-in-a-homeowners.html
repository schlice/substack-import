They use HOA dues to pay for this<br>maintenance.<br><br>Homeowners *should not* be maintaining this area. Unless the homeowner<br>is being paid as a contractor for the association, homeowners should not<br>maintain common areas. There could be problems with liability should the<br>homeowner be injured and need to make a claim against the common area<br>insurance policy maintained by the HOA on the common areas.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
