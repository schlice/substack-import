<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What do I do if a tenant abandons the property?<br><br>(US answer only)<br><br>When a tenant leaves the property and the landlord believes the tenant<br>will not return, the law says that the tenant has abandoned the rental.<br><br>Normally, the rental agreement states that if the tenant is going to be<br>absent from the property for more than two weeks, notice must be given,<br>otherwise the landlord may consider the property abandoned. As is true<br>of all things in the US, states have varying rules to determine when a<br>landlord can presume that a tenant has abandoned the property. But<br>without presumption of abandonment, or if the landlord is at all unsure<br>about whether or not the tenant has abandoned the property, the landlord<br>should go through the legal process to declare the unit abandoned if the<br>rent has not been paid and the tenant still has possessions in the unit.<br>Some ways to determine whether or not the unit has intentionally been<br>abandoned:<br><br>> - Did the neighbors see them move?<br>> - Are the utilities shut off?<br>> - Did the tenant put in a change of address at the post office?<br>> - Is there any significant furniture left?<br>> - If you have access, are there sheets on the beds?<br>><br>> In some cases, the tenant has been arrested or is in the hospital,<br>> which would explain why he hasn't been around. Or, maybe the tenant<br>> has moved, but left behind some furniture to pick up later on. **Even<br>> if the tenant is not sleeping there, they are still "in possession" if<br>> they have their personal belongings in the unit and have not shown an<br>> intent to abandon these items.**\[1\](#gKxRO){#cite-gKxRO<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>If the tenant left property behind, the property is considered<br>"abandoned property."

The landlord must attempt to contact the tenant and<br>provide notice of the abandoned property, but then after the mandated<br>period of time has elapsed, the property can be sold, donated, or<br>discarded.
