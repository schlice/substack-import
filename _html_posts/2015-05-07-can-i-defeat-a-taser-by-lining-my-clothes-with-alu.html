<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You would have to wear something that the darts will<br>bounce off of. So you must be wearing a suit of Teflon, or some sort of<br>armor. Chain mail won\'t work, as the darts can catch on the chain and<br>then electrify the entire suit. I suspect that if your chain mail was<br>grounded and you were insulated from the suit, that might do the trick.\<br>\<br>OK, so spend the rest of your life walking around in chain mail to stop<br>the TASER, and you\'ve just bought yourself a one-way ticket to force<br>escalation.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
