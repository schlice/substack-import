<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> There is no god, in any form.<br><br>Evidence? I assume with something as important as your eternal destiny,<br>you would have weighty and overwhelming evidence that there is no god.<br>Please present your evidence. And as you would do to me if you asked me<br>to prove that God exists, make sure it is fully empirical, testable and<br>repeatable evidence which proves beyond a reasonable doubt that no god<br>exists.<br><br>The gravity of the decision to believe or not believe that God exists is<br>important. If you're making an inconsequential choice, it's not a really<br>big deal. But when you're *determining your eternal destiny*, I would<br>think you would require a tremendous amount of evidence to prove that<br>God does not exist.<br><br>Think of it this way. If I set two glasses of lemonade down in front of<br>you and I tell you that one is more tart than the other, you wouldn't<br>need a whole lot of evidence to choose one. But if I set two glasses of<br>lemonade down in front of you and I tell you one is sweetened with sugar<br>and the other is sweetened with rat poison, you would require weighty<br>and overwhelming evidence before you chose one.<br><br>This is where you sit when you claim that there is no god. Because the<br>decision to believe or not to believe in God could have eternal<br>consequences, the atheist should have weighty and overwhelming evidence<br>to prove their position, but they do not. They simply slide into<br>eternity with their fingers crossed, hoping that they do not discover<br>the unpleasant truth that God is real and eternity exists, and it's an<br>awfully long time to be wrong.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
