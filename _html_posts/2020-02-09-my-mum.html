<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My mum's boyfriend is homophobic. I feel like telling him I like girls<br>and that there's nothing wrong with it. Should I?**<br><br>No, because you're having the conversation with the wrong person.<br><br>You need to have the conversation with your mum, not with him. She needs<br>to know the friction that allowing him into her home will cause. If you<br>haven't come out to your mum yet, this would be a good conversation<br>starter.<br><br>Hopefully, your mum will put your mental health and your safety over her<br>new beau and choose you instead.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
