<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There are several factors at play here:\<br>]<br><br>- Aircraft aren\'t as sensitive as most airlines make them out to be.<br>  Testing this sort of thing is very difficult because of FCC rules and<br>  the fact that no one wants to be inside an airplane that we blast with<br>  radio waves to try to make the airplane crash. It would be ideal if we<br>  take an airplane out to the desert, turn it on, and then blast radio<br>  waves inside the airplane, but FCC regulations don\'t allow that sort<br>  of testing anywhere. So we\'re having a hard time actually committing<br>  the equipment and the airplane to do the test. That said, the airlines<br>  err on the side of caution and simply disallow the technology that<br>  they haven\'t fully tested.<br>- Aircraft are supposed to be shielded against outside radio waves. In<br>  some cases, the shielding has failed and someone has had a<br>  transmitting device on and interference has happened. But it\'s not as<br>  big of an issue as has been made of it. I can guarantee you that on<br>  every aircraft, there is at least one wanker who simply sets his phone<br>  on vibrate instead of turning it off, and there is at least one person<br>  who truly believes that flipping the little switch on the side of the<br>  iPhone to vibrate actually switches the phone off. So I can guarantee<br>  you that on every flight, there is at least one person with a phone<br>  on. It hasn\'t caused any crashes that we know of. It has definitely<br>  caused interference, but never so much that the aircraft was no longer<br>  capable of flight.<br>- There are far more cost-effective and simple methods of crashing a<br>  flight. Fact is, terrorists aren\'t out there trying to crash planes.<br>  The 9/11 scenario won\'t happen again, so that avenue (turning<br>  commercial aircraft into missiles) is closed. A terrorist simply needs<br>  a Stinger missile and he can shoot down a plane from the ground. No<br>  need to try to use complex electronics to scramble the avionics from<br>  the inside; far too complex.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
