<br><br><h2>Space Submission</h2><br><div><br><br>Space name: Hard Sayings<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There's a big difference between killing and murder: *justification*.<br><br>First, part of the problem is that the King James Bible mistranslated<br>the word *ratsach* as "kill" instead of "murder," so that translation of<br>the 6th Commandment says, "Thou shalt not kill."<br><br>However, the word *ratsach* almost universally means intentional killing<br>without cause. The correct translation of this word is "murder," and all<br>modern translations of the Bible list the 6th Commandment as "You shall<br>not murder."<br><br>Murder is "the premeditated, unlawful taking of a life," where killing<br>is just "the taking of a life."<br><br>In order for God to *murder*, he would have to take life without<br>justification. But God is the author of justice. "His works are perfect,<br>and all His ways are just. A faithful God who does no wrong, upright and<br>just is He" (Deuteronomy 32:4; see also Psalm 11:7; 90:9). In other<br>words, *everything he does is,* *de facto**, just.* This includes<br>the taking of the life *he created*. He created the life, he can take<br>the life.<br><br>Some people argue that executing the innocent is murder, so when God<br>wipes out whole cities, or when God killed the entire population of the<br>earth in the Flood, He is committing murder. However, nowhere in<br>Scripture can we find where God killed "innocent" people. In fact,<br>compared to God's holiness, there is no such thing as an "innocent"<br>person. All have sinned (Romans 3:23), and the penalty for sin is death<br>(Romans 6:23a). God has *complete and total justification to literally<br>obliterate every one of us where we stand.* He would be completely<br>justified to wipe us all out. The fact that he doesn't is proof of his<br>*mercy*. At the Flood, He was completely justified in killing everyone<br>on earth, because *He had already judged them*:<br><br>> "Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,<br>> and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil<br>> continually" (Genesis 6:5).<br><br>That baby you're killing with abortion, was it judged and found lacking?<br>Was it given due process before receiving a death sentence? No? You do<br>realize that killing without justification is murder, right? We said<br>that just a minute ago.<br><br>This is why God cares about abortion. It's not killing according to<br>*His* will, but according to *our* will. And it's not justified in any<br>way.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>The Bible has multiple instances of God commanding children, infants,<br>and pregnant women to be killed. There\'s also instances where God kills<br>children, infants, and pregnant women directly. Why would he care about<br>abortions based on this?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
