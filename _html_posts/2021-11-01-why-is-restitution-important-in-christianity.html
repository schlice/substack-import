Their catechisms describe restitution in this way:<br><br>> *What do we mean by restitution?*\<br>> If we have wrongfully taken anything from others, or mistreated them<br>> in any way, we must make it right by restoring as far as possible.<br>><br>> *Is restitution taught in the Bible?*\<br>> Yes. \"Them is shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that<br>> he shall restore that which he took violently away,\...and give it<br>> unto him to whom it appertaineth\" (Lev. 6:4, 5).<br>><br>> Zacchaeus said: \"Behold, Lord, \...if I have taken anything from any<br>> man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold\" (Luke<br>> 19:8).\[1\](#IRLTG){#cite-IRLTG .citation_link}<br><br>The majority of Christianity do not set this as a requirement, as most<br>Christian denominations follow the doctrine of [[*sola<br>fide*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3145d3&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_fide){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, or that you are saved<br>only by your faith, and God's grace, not by any good works you do.<br><br>Denominations which do not follow the *sola fide* doctrine may believe<br>in things like restitution as necessary to salvation.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why is restitution important in Christianity?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-IRLTG){.citation_index} [[Restitution (theology) -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c53dee&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restitution_(theology)){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
