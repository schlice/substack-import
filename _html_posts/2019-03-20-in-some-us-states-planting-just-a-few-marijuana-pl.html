<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In some US states, planting just a few marijuana plants for your own<br>use in your basement is legal. Do you think it\'s a good idea to make<br>this a federal law?**<br><br>When you ask yourself one of these questions (about whether or not<br>something should be federal law), ask yourself the following really<br>important question:<br><br>*Does the Federal government have a compelling interest in imposing a<br>law on* *all* *states?*<br><br>Perhaps there is a safety issue. Or perhaps uniformity between states is<br>the only way a particular thing will work properly.<br><br>So: is there a compelling reason that the federal government needs to<br>tell all states to allow marijuana?<br><br>The answer, truly, is no.<br><br>In fact, the Controlled Substances Act, designating controlled<br>substances at a Federal level, is only useful to determine what<br>substances can and can not be prescribed by a doctor (since<br>prescriptions are controlled at a federal level). It's also useful in<br>controlling what happens *between* states (i.e. what substances can and<br>can not move between states). It's not useful to *tell* a *state* what<br>it can and can not do with substances within that state. That should<br>rightly be left to the state to determine. If all of the residents of a<br>state vote to allow marijuana, it should be allowed. If the residents<br>vote to disallow it, it should be disallowed. But this is something<br>which is best left to states to decide on their own.<br><br>Put another way, something which is good for Oregon may not be good for<br>Illinois. Something which is good for California may not be good for<br>Texas. You get the point. The United States is *huge* and has a varying<br>population across its states. The most effective government is at the<br>state level.<br><br>It's also important to note that the Controlled Substances Act currently<br>makes it a federal crime to possess marijuana. The federal government<br>(i.e. the FBI and the DEA) can prosecute anyone, in any state, for<br>possession of marijuana. What states are doing by "legalizing" marijuana<br>is removing any state penalties for violating the federal law. In other<br>words, the *state* will not prosecute an individual found to be in<br>violation of this particular facet of the Controlled Substances Act.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
