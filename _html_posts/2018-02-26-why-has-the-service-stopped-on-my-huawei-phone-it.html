Pop your SIM tray, try cleaning it out with<br>    compressed air, and re-inserting it. You may need to power-cycle the<br>    phone.<br>2.  Your service has been disconnected. Check with your carrier and<br>    validate your contract status.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
