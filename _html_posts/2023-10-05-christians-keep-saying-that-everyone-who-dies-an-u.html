title: '"Christians keep saying that everyone who dies an unbeleiver will go to hell
  for willfully rejecting Christ. Yet countless souls never even heard His name? How
  can you be guilty of rejecting someone you never even met or heard of? It seems
  illogical."'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Bible does not agree with this sentiment.<br><br>The Bible tells us that God has clearly revealed Himself in nature and<br>in the hearts of people:<br><br>> For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities---his<br>> eternal power and divine nature---have been clearly seen, being<br>> understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.<br>> --- Romans 1:20 NIV<br>><br>> He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity<br>> in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from<br>> beginning to end. --- Ecclesiastes 3:11 NIV<br><br>Romans 1:20 says that "people are without excuse." Everything around us<br>displays God's fingerprints, and He has written His truth on our hearts<br>> Romans 1:21--23 NIV<br><br>If it wasn't for God's grace, we would be left to the sinful desires of<br>our hearts, permitting us to discover how useless and miserable life is<br>apart from Him. He does this for those who actively and continually<br>reject Him.<br><br>> Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to<br>> sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.<br>> They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served<br>> created things rather than the Creator---who is forever praised. Amen.<br>><br>> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their<br>> women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the<br>> same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were<br>> inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with<br>> other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.<br>><br>> Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the<br>> knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that<br>> they do what ought not to be done. They have become filled with every<br>> kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy,<br>> murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, slanderers,<br>> God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing<br>> evil; they disobey their parents; they have no understanding, no<br>> fidelity, no love, no mercy. Although they know God's righteous decree<br>> that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to<br>> do these very things but also approve of those who practice them. ---<br>> Romans 1:24--32 NIV<br><br>What is *truly* **illogical is to to debate the fairness of God<br>allowing someone to choose Hell because they "never had the opportunity<br>to hear the gospel of Christ."**<br><br>The Bible is clear that God has revealed Himself to everyone, in nature<br>and in their hearts, *and people are responsible to God for what He has<br>already revealed to them*. And as I've also shown, the Bible says that<br>people reject this knowledge, and therefore God is just in allowing them<br>to choose Hell as their final destination.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
