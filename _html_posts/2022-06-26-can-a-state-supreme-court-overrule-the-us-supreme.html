<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In law, we often say "The Supreme Court isn't the last word because<br>they're always right. The Supreme Court is always right because they're<br>the last word."<br><br>When the Supreme Court makes a ruling about a law, that ruling is final.<br>No one can overrule it except the Supreme Court. In the case of *Roe*,<br>the Supreme Court overruled itself and reversed a bad law.<br><br>*NOTE: Before you run to the comments, I said the* *law* *was bad. I<br>didn't say that the* *subject* *of the law* *was bad. Many<br>people wanted to keep the bad law around because they liked the outcome,<br>but that's not the right thing to do.*<br><br>However, you can *work around* it.<br><br>1.  Congress can rewrite the law in question so that it complies with<br>    the Constitution. Take out the parts that are flawed, or write it in<br>    such a way that it doesn't violate the Constitution. Or write a<br>    whole new law that will be broadly acceptable across the spectrum,<br>    not just a law that panders to your own political party. This is the<br>    primary way that you can "fix" a Supreme Court decision.<br>2.  When the Court says that there is no Constitutional protection for<br>    something (like abortion), the state can absolutely write their own<br>    laws and say that in that state, there is. And in roughly half of<br>    the country, states have provided some access to abortion.<br>3.  Amend the Constitution. Some states have amended their own state<br>    constitutions to enshrine a right to abortion in that state. And if<br>    you have as much public support behind an issue as you believe you<br>    do, it should be easy to get a supermajority of Congress and 3/4ths<br>    of the states to go along with your amendment.<br><br>People are wrongly blaming the courts for a situation created by<br>lawmakers. And it's a situation that lawmakers can fix, either at the<br>state level or at the national level.<br><br>And while you may not like the outcome that the Court reached, you can<br>always fix it at some level. In other words, if the Court was<br>egregiously wrong, there are still ways to work around that. That's why<br>the system is called "checks and balances." A runaway Supreme Court can<br>still be balanced by Congress and the states.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can a state supreme court overrule the U.S. Supreme Court?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
