<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Bible does not describe "holy water" in the way Catholics use it<br>today. There are a few references in the Bible to water which might<br>describe what today is called "holy water," but they are pretty vague<br>and don't really apply especially strongly to the water itself.<br><br>- Matthew 3:11 talks about \"baptizing with water for repentance," but<br>  nothing in the text even hints that the water itself is holy. Baptism<br>  is symbolic in that it represents following Christ through His death,<br>  burial and resurrection.<br>- You *might* draw a parallel to Levitical law (cf Leviticus 15, 16,<br>  and 17) wherein unclean things were ritually cleaned with water before<br>  they could be touched. But again, the *water* is not holy in that<br>  regard. The water is merely used for purification.<br><br>The modern use of holy water came into vogue in about the ninth century.<br>Today, holy water is permanently ensconced at the entrances to Catholic<br>churches, and congregants use the water to bless themselves as they<br>enter. Priests use holy water to bless the congregation using a device<br>called an<br>[aspergillum(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bc748e&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillum){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}<br>]{.qlink_container}dipped into holy water in an aspersorium, but<br>there isn't really any Biblical reference to it, especially in the way<br>it is used today.<br><br>TL;DR: The Bible does not talk about the use of holy water anywhere,<br>in any form. The Catholic use of holy water is unbiblical. The Bible<br>does not tell Christians to use holy water for anything.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
