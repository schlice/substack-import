<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do police officers in America have a duty to protect citizens?<br><br>There's a lot of answers in here, but let's break it down to the legal<br>nuts and bolts.<br><br>As far as the courts are concerned, police have what is called a<br>*general duty to protect citizens at large*, but they do not have a<br>*specific duty to protect any one person.* In 1989 SCOTUS stated,<br>\"Nothing in the language of the Due Process Clause itself requires the<br>State to protect the life, liberty, and property of its citizens against<br>invasion by private actors.\"<br><br>There are a few important exceptions, such as whether or not a *special<br>relationship* exists between the police and a citizen (i.e. if the<br>police have you in custody), or whether there is a *state-created<br>danger* (i.e. police left a situation more dangerous than they found<br>it).<br><br>The courts have been inconsistent when finding if a state created danger<br>exists in any one case. For example. the Third Circuit found that a<br>state created danger existed when police, after stopping two<br>pedestrians, left the intoxicated wife to walk a third of a block to her<br>home alone in the dark on a cold night after her husband had already<br>left. Sending her home \"unescorted in a visibly intoxicated state in<br>cold weather,\" made her \"more vulnerable\" to harm, which, the Court<br>held, was foreseeable. However, the Eighth Circuit held that a duty to<br>protect did not exist where the designated driver was arrested on a<br>warrant and allowed to drive his car to the police station. His<br>passengers, who were drunk, remained unattended in the car outside the<br>police station for about 30 minutes, drove off, and were involved in a<br>fatal crash. The Court reasoned that a due process claim could not be<br>brought, as it was not reasonable to find that the arresting officer<br>\"knew or should have known that the two passengers were drunk and unfit<br>to drive.\"<br><br>And specific to the tenor of the question, courts, like in *Castle Rock<br>v. Gonzalez*, have routinely found that there is no due process claim<br>when the police fail to serve orders or fail to investigate missing<br>persons or other calls for service. Prior to *Castle Rock*, for example,<br>the Tenth Circuit found that there was no due process claim when the<br>police failed to enforce a restraining order on a father who killed his<br>children.<br><br>As you can see, while there should be a due process claim when a special<br>relationship exists or when there is a state-created danger, Federal<br>courts don't always apply this standard consistently.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
