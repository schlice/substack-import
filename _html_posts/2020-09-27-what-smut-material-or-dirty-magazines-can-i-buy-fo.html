<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What smut material or dirty magazines can I buy for my teen son, so he<br>doesn't look online for it? We've talked about it and I said I would get<br>him something more "respectable" to keep under his bed, less porn...<br>more his own imagination.**<br><br>First off, I applaud your ingenuity. Trying to channel his normal urges<br>is a great idea.<br><br>But I've got a little secret for you: *you can't stop it.*<br><br>That material is going to make it to his eyeballs one way or another.<br>Maybe it will be a nude scene in a movie. Maybe it will be at a friend's<br>house (maybe you can filter your own Internet, but you can't filter<br>everyone's Internet). And regardless of what you do, he's going to want<br>to find *more* of what he just saw, because it's *way better* than<br>anything you give him.<br><br>So at that point, he will be searching for his own material, and he will<br>either keep the material you give him under his bed to appease you, or<br>(worse) he will secretly resent you trying to "control" him. Doing what<br>you are trying will only teach him that if he likes what he sees, he's<br>going to have to sneak past you to get to it. And if you are unaware,<br>there are more technological ways to do so than you can even imagine.<br><br>Sounds like this is a no-win situation, right?<br><br>Well, not so fast.<br><br>What I've found that works well is *more involvement, not less*. Talking<br>about porn is just one facet in the whole approach to sex. Watching<br>movies with your teen that may contain sensitive subjects are perfect<br>"teachable moments." Your son wants to know what you think about those<br>things, and discussing them live is a good way to use the material to<br>teach about relationships and sex, and to understand them in context.<br><br>With boys, developing self-control is key. In a society where sex is as<br>easily viewed as sunlight, teaching your son appropriate restraint along<br>with modeling appropriate relationships with women will go a long way to<br>help him to understand what he sees and to resist the temptation.<br><br>In other words, the material is always going to be there. Our job as<br>parents is to help our kids *frame it properly* so that it doesn't<br>become an outsized factor in his life. It's there, but it just isn't<br>that big of a deal for him. Living with the fact that it is so pervasive<br>in our culture means that we have to teach our boys to handle it.<br><br>For more information and parenting tips for dads, visit [[Fathers.com -<br>National Center for<br>Fathering](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4c3f8f&url=https://fathers.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="fathers.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
