<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Michelle Carter was convicted for participating in "wanton and reckless<br>conduct" for encouraging her then-boyfriend to commit suicide. She went<br>much further, though, by instructing him as to when and how he should<br>kill himself, reassuring him when he was concerned about killing<br>himself, and berating him when he delayed doing so.<br><br>With that in mind, if a prosecutor could prove that if someone made a<br>recommendation to not get a vaccine, and that person *knew* that not<br>taking a vaccine would result in a particular person's death, then you<br>could at least make the case that criminal charges may be warranted,<br>assuming that encouraging someone to kill themselves is a crime in that<br>state.<br><br>But failing to take a vaccine does not *directly* cause death. Failing<br>to take a vaccine, at best, leads to *more aggressive* disease, and<br>leads to a higher likelihood of a more challenging disease course and<br>worse outcomes, *including* death. And ultimately, recommending that<br>someone do something which is harmful to themselves is covered under the<br>1st Amendment. For example, if someone is standing on the ledge of a<br>tall building and I'm on the ground and I yell, "Jump! Jump!" and they<br>do, can I be charged with conspiracy to commit suicide? The answer is<br>no, because while I may have encouraged them to commit suicide,<br>ultimately the choice to do so is theirs. There are only a handful of<br>states which have statutes on their books regarding encouraging suicide.<br>Connecticut has a statute related to "causing" suicide and making it<br>murder:<br><br>1.  intentionally causing a person to commit suicide by force, duress,<br>    or deception is classified as murder (CGS ยง 53a-54a)<br>2.  intentionally causing or aiding a person, other than by force,<br>    duress, or deception, to commit suicide is classified as 2nd degree<br>    manslaughter (CGS ยง 53a-56). \[1\](#IlykM){#cite-IlykM<br>    .citation_link}<br><br>Oklahoma and South Dakota have laws which criminalize encouraging<br>suicide. California also has one, but the California Supreme Court said<br>that in order for it to be murder, you have to do something more direct<br>than just words encouraging a suicide. Minnesota had one, but their<br>Supreme Court ruled it was an unconstitutional 1st Amendment violation.<br><br>So no, you can't charge the GOP with murder even if they did actively<br>recommend people not take a vaccine, which I'm unaware that they did. I<br>think, at best, they simply said that vaccines are a personal decision<br>and should be up to the individual to decide, and should not be forced<br>by the government to take, even if it is in their best interest.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If Michelle Carter can be convicted for talking her boyfriend into<br>suicide, could GOP be charged with a form of conspiracy & murder for the<br>majority of the \>824,000 Covid dead who took their advice & are dying<br>today at 6x the rate of vaxxed people?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-IlykM){.citation_index}<br>[https://www.cga.ct.gov/2020/rpt/\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eb77dc&url=https://www.cga.ct.gov/2020/rpt/pdf/2020-R-0197.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ct.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
