<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Could communities that self-police work? It sounds like a good idea in<br>concept, but it\'s not hard to imagine jurisdiction conflicts and<br>discrimination if outsiders can freely travel into that district.**<br><br>I take it you've never been to the East Coast of the US then, have you.<br>Specifically the Northeast, where "incorporated townships" are quite<br>common. In fact, in all six New England states, the incorporated<br>township is the main form of local government. [[New<br>York](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d01958&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_New_York_(state)){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} is unique in that it has<br>62 counties, which are subdivided into 932 towns and 62 cities, which<br>are all authorized by the state Constitution to provide all municipal<br>services to their residents, and while most provide little more than<br>water and electricity services, some go as far as to provide<br><br>When a town "incorporates," it receives a charter from the state and<br>becomes a municipality, similar to a city. It can provide all services<br>to its residence, including police services.<br><br>I wonder if you're not thinking of incorporated townships or<br>municipalities when you refer to "community self-policing," but rather<br>more along the lines of unorganized, community-watch type policing. I<br>think that there would be many problems with such a setup, most notably<br>legal issues, as these people who participate are not authorized by any<br>government to carry out the law enforcement function. Therefore, any<br>"arrests" they make can be instantly challenged in court as the person<br>has no authority in law under which they can enforce the laws of the<br>state. There must be someone who is authorized to act "under color of<br>law" to enforce those laws, and only a duly appointed law enforcement<br>agency, authorized by the state, can do that.<br><br>State agencies are authorized when they train their officers to meet<br>state standards. A Peace Officer Standardization Training (POST) Board<br>at the state level authorizes local police departments to train and<br>certify that officers meet those standards. It is only then that those<br>officers are authorized to be sworn into office and assume the authority<br>to enforce the law. Communities which self-police would not have such<br>authorization, and therefore may operate outside of state-sanctioned<br>authority. It's really a recipe for disaster.<br><br>Communities work best when they work *with* local law enforcement.<br>Communities can organize "neighborhood watch" groups under the direction<br>of local police. A properly organized neighborhood watch is aware of<br>crime rates and current crime trends in their area, and advises their<br>residents on strategies to stay free of crime (i.e. leaving porch lights<br>on overnight, removing valuables from vehicles parked in driveways,<br>etc), and also remains aware of activities going on within their<br>communities. Who better to know what vehicles belong and don't belong in<br>your neighborhood than the actual people who live there? Who better to<br>know what exactly is a problem and what is not than the residents?<br><br>A well-functioning neighborhood watch is also known within the local<br>department, and calls for service from such a community can be given<br>higher priority.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
