<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If that's what God wanted, He'd have His name in big flashing lights in<br>the sky and everyone would see it and no one would be dumb enough to<br>ignore Him.<br><br>But presuming that God exists, and He doesn't make His presence<br>*blaringly known*, then there clearly is a reason.<br><br>That reason: free will.<br><br>> One beauty of God's creation is this: if you're not willing to accept<br>> Christianity, then you're free to reject it. This freedom to make<br>> choices---even the freedom to reject truth---is what makes us moral<br>> creatures and enables each of us to choose our ultimate destiny.<br>><br>> This really hits at the heart of why we exist at all, and why God<br>> might not be as overt in revealing Himself to us as some would like.<br>> For if the Bible is true, then God has provided each of us with the<br>> opportunity to make an eternal choice to either accept Him or reject<br>> Him.<br>><br>> And in order to ensure that our choice is truly free, He puts us in an<br>> environment that is filled with evidence of His existence, but without<br>> His *direct* presence---a presence so powerful that it could overwhelm<br>> our freedom and thus negate our ability to reject Him.<br>><br>> In other words, *God has provided enough evidence in this life to<br>> convince anyone willing to believe, yet he has also left some<br>> ambiguity so as not to compel the unwilling.*<br>><br>> In this way, God gives us the opportunity either to love Him or to<br>> reject Him without violating our freedom. In fact, the purpose of this<br>> life is to make that choice freely and without coercion. For love, by<br>> definition, must be freely given. It cannot be coerced. That's why C.<br>> S. Lewis wrote, "the Irresistible and the Indisputable are the two<br>> weapons which the very nature of \God's\ scheme forbids Him to use.<br>> Merely to over-ride a human will (as His felt presence in any but the<br>> faintest and most mitigated degree would certainly do) would be for<br>> Him useless. He cannot ravish. He can only<br>> woo."\[1\](#XHGBi){#cite-XHGBi .citation_link}<br><br>So if you're looking for that "smoking gun" that ***unequivocally,<br>beyond a shadow of a doubt, proves that God exists***, you're simply not<br>going to find it. Because if that existed, you'd be forced to love Him<br>because the evidence would be so overwhelming that it would overwhelm<br>our free will and eliminate any ability to reject Him.<br><br>But He only wants those who freely accept Him.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-XHGBi){.citation_index} [[I Don\'t Have Enough Faith to Be<br>an Atheist: Geisler, Norman L., Turek, Frank, Limbaugh, David:<br>9781433580758: Amazon.com:<br>Books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=770f5b&url=https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Have-Enough-Faith-Atheist/dp/1433580756){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
