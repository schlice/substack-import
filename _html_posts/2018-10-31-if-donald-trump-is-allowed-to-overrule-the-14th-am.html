<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>[[Matthew<br>Bohrer](https://www.quora.com/profile/Matthew-Bohrer)]{.qlink_container}'s<br>analysis is spot on.<br><br>Especially when he says, "At the time, the Court (and indeed the nation)<br>literally had no concept of 'illegal' immigration."<br><br>He's right. The Court has never actually ruled on the citizenship of<br>children born to *illegal immigrants*. The *Wong Kim Ark* case settled<br>the question about *legal immigrants* and *lawful permanent residents*.<br>It never settled the question about *illegal immigrants*.<br><br>No case law which has come since has actually ruled on this issue.<br><br>So despite his insistence that this will be a "quick reversal" by<br>SCOTUS, I'm not so certain.<br><br>Now specifically to answer the question:<br><br>**If Donald Trump is allowed to overrule the 14th Amendment by signing<br>an executive order, which Amendment will be the next to go?**<br><br>his EO would not actually "overrule" the 14th Amendment. It would just<br>codify the appropriate interpretation of the phrase "and subject to the<br>jurisdiction thereof". It would state that illegal immigrants are not<br>subject to the jurisdiction of the United States when it comes to<br>citizenship, and therefore their children are not automatcally granted<br>US citizenship.<br><br>Clearly, this EO would be immediately injuncted (my money's on the 9th<br>Circus), and the Supreme Court would have the opportunity to rule on the<br>14th Amendment's applicability to illegal immigrants.<br><br>I believe that the 14th Amendment was never intended to grant<br>citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants. Senator Jacob Howard<br>worked closely with Abraham Lincoln in drafting and passing the 13th<br>Amendment (which abolished slavery). He also served on the Senate Joint<br>Committee on Reconstruction, which drafted the 14th Amendment. In 1866,<br>Senator Howard clearly spelled out the intent of the 14th Amendment by<br>writing (emphasis mine):<br><br>> Every person born within the limits of the United States, and subject<br>> to their jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and national law a<br>> citizen of the United States. **This will not, of course, include<br>> persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who<br>> belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited<br>> to the Government of the United States**, but will include every other<br>> class of persons. It settles the great question of citizenship and<br>> removes all doubt as to what persons are or are not citizens of the<br>> United States. This has long been a great desideratum in the<br>> jurisprudence and legislation of this country.<br><br>To me, from the plain wording of the writers of the 14th Amendment, it<br>was never intended to grant citizenship to children of illegals.<br><br>In actuality, [[according to Ilya Shapiro of the CATO<br>Institute](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0372f5&url=https://www.cato.org/blog/birthright-citizenship-constitutionally-required){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cato.org"}]{.qlink_container}, that phrase was originally<br>written to exclude the children of Native American tribes from American<br>citizenship, since those children were subject to the jurisdiction of<br>Native American tribal government, and were citizens of their tribe, not<br>of the United States. The amendment was also written to guarantee the<br>citizenship of freed slaves and their children, in opposition to the<br>*Dred Scott* ruling.<br><br>If we apply the same reasoning, the children born to parents who are<br>subject to *another* government are not US citizens.<br><br>I'd like to see this SCOTUS issue a ruling on this.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
