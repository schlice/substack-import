<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Most definitely. In every jurisdiction I know of, *where you are* makes<br>very little difference. If you expose yourself, intentionally or<br>otherwise, you have committed the offense of *indecent exposure*, or<br>whatever it may be called in your jurisdiction. You get arrested and<br>charged, and you are placed on the sex offender registry. If a child is<br>involved (like the Girl Scout in your example), you are also charged<br>with *corrupting a minor* or *contributing to the delinquency of a<br>minor,* again depending on jurisdiction, and you are labeled as an adult<br>sex offender who offended against a child, and you'll be lucky to make<br>it out of prison alive, or in one piece. Prisoners don't like<br>pedophiles.<br><br>The only difference would be if you are in a location in which nudity is<br>*expected* and *forewarned*, like in a locker room, or at a nude beach.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
