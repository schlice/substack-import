<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Maybe.*<br><br>As I understand it, when Ralph Yarl rang the doorbell (to the wrong<br>house), Andrew Lester fired two shots through the door, striking Yarl in<br>the head and the arm.<br><br>Lester's account says that he was awoken by his doorbell, and he went to<br>the door and found a large black male pulling on his exterior door, and<br>he thought his home was being broken into. He fired twice, and the man<br>ran away. He then called 911. Lester said firing his weapon \"was the<br>last thing he wanted to do, but he was \'scared to death\'\" because of<br>his age and the male's size, according to police reports.<br><br>Yarl's account tells a different story. He says that he did not pull on<br>the door, but instead rang the doorbell and waited. He says that a man<br>opened the door holding a firearm, and he was immediately shot in the<br>head, and he fell to the ground. He was shot again in the arm, and he<br>claims he heard a voice say, "Don't come around here."<br><br>Investigation is still ongoing, but Lester claimed that he was in fear<br>for his life (rightly or wrongly). If he truly believed someone was<br>breaking in to his house, and he truly was in fear for his life, he may<br>be protected by Missouri's "stand your ground" law. Recall that in<br>Missouri, if you are legally allowed to be in a place, then you also<br>have a right to protect yourself if you reasonably believe you're in<br>imminent threat of deadly harm. Personally, I'm not sure I could find it<br>reasonable to believe that a home invader would ring your doorbell, but<br>perhaps the case could be made that the invader was first checking to<br>see if anyone was home before attempting to break in.<br><br>He will not be charged with a hate crime, because he is currently being<br>charged with Assault 1 (Assault in the First Degree), which is a higher<br>level of charge than attempted murder, and is also four degrees higher<br>than a hate crime modifier could raise the charge.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
