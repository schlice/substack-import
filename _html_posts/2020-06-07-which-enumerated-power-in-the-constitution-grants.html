<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Which enumerated power in the constitution grants the Federal<br>Government the right to pass the Justice in Policing Act? Many of those<br>issues addressed seem to be powers relegated to the states.**<br><br>The Justice in Policing Act only really crosses into state authority<br>when it starts mandating things like arrest control techniques which can<br>and cannot be used by police departments. That particular portion of the<br>Act, if it passes, will be quickly overturned by the courts as an<br>unconstitutional overreach.<br><br>But there are parts of the Act that are good, and which need to be<br>implemented right away.<br><br>Let's review some of the proposed changes which are directly related to<br>the current issue:<br><br>- Reforming "qualified immunity." I have been calling for this for some<br>  time now, and it's a good first step at holding officers accountable<br>  for their actions. Qualified immunity needs to be either seriously<br>  reformed, or scrapped altogether. This would not remove Constitutional<br>  protections for officers, but would allow more civil rights lawsuits<br>  to proceed on their merits. Granted, this will increase litigation<br>  costs for departments (and ultimately increase taxpayer expense of<br>  departments), but it should be done.<br>- Reform to the federal police misconduct statute. Currently, it is only<br>  a crime for an officer to "willfully" violate an individuals's<br>  constitutional rights, meaning prosecutors must prove an officer acted<br>  with the intention of depriving the person of their rights. The bill<br>  plans to lower the standard of criminal intent to "knowingly or with<br>  reckless disregard." This, in addition to reform of qualified<br>  immunity, will make it easier for the Federal government to seek<br>  redress against officers who act recklessly and violate civil rights.<br>  I fear for the unintended consequences of this, and police unions will<br>  argue that this will cause officers to not act and will cause more<br>  officers to be harmed and die. Some may find that acceptable. I'm<br>  certain that the nearly one million police officers in the country<br>  might not.<br>- Reform to the federal standard for the use of force by officers from<br>  "reasonableness" to only when it is "necessary to prevent death or<br>  serious bodily injury." The bill would require that federal officers<br>  use de-escalation tactics and use deadly force only as a last resort.<br>  This is acceptable for Congress to do with Federal officers (FBI,<br>  BATFE, USCBP, etc), but they also plan on making this a condition of<br>  grants to state and local police agencies as well, which is also<br>  likely to face Constitutional pushback.<br>- Ban Federal law enforcement use of chokeholds or other carotid holds,<br>  and condition Federal funding to states on them doing the same. Again,<br>  while this may work for Congress to impose this on Federal law<br>  enforcement, forcing this on to the states is again likely to face a<br>  Constitutional challenge.<br><br>From here, the legislation goes on to address other things which are<br>unrelated to the current situation, but are things that police reformers<br>have wanted for a long time, so they'll try to use the current crisis to<br>get passed (in the spirit of "never let a good crisis go to waste"),<br>like:<br><br>- Bans to "no-knock warrants." This one is also unlikely to succeed, as<br>  they are already governed by judges, and are useful when trying to<br>  prevent evidence from being destroyed and suspects from escaping. The<br>  resulting unintended consequences of this could be devastating, more<br>  so than where no-knock warrants intersect the Castle Doctrine.<br>- Limit the transfer of military excess hardware to police departments.<br>  All this will do will be to force the police to buy the hardware new,<br>  increasing policing costs to taxpayers. It will also cause<br>  manufacturers of this type of equipment to develop "military-style"<br>  gear, and "police-style" gear, but that both accomplish the same<br>  thing. They will find the gear that is most acceptable to the public<br>  and will produce that, again at increased cost (because the police<br>  will be barred from buying excess military gear, and will have to buy<br>  the new "police-style" gear). But hey, it's not "military" gear, it's<br>  "police" gear, designed especially for the police. This is a whole<br>  discussion unto itself. Ultimately, all this does is increase the cost<br>  to cities and towns of operating a police department, and will hurt<br>  small agencies and small communities much more than large ones.<br>- Direct state and local law enforcement agencies to undertake a new<br>  effort to end discrimination in their practices by conditioning<br>  federal funding on the adoption of policies and training to combat<br>  racial and other discriminatory profiling. This is also wholly<br>  unnecessary, as it's already been done after the last few high-profile<br>  incidents which were also branded as "institutional racism." But sure,<br>  let's do it again.<br>- Set new requirements on the Justice Department to come up with and<br>  deliver new policing standards for state and local agencies and<br>  collect new data on police actions all over the country. Again, this<br>  one steps across the line, where the Justice Department seeks to make<br>  changes to how state and local law enforcement operates, and is<br>  unlikely to pass in its current form, and if it does, will again face<br>  swift Constitutional challenge, so long as those standards are<br>  voluntary and are advice to departments instead of mandates.<br><br>As usual, parts of the Act are great, but other parts are just stupid<br>and threaten the whole bill.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit.
