<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How much immunity does POTUS have against any criminal prosecution?<br><br>None.<br><br>Let's clarify: the President can't be indicted while he's president. The<br>prosecutorial power in the Executive Branch is vested in the President<br>alone. Not the President and the DOJ, not the President and the Southern<br>District of New York, but the President alone. Any other agency that<br>prosecutes crimes does so *at the pleasure of the President and with<br>the* *delegated authority* *of the President*. This means that any<br>prosecution of the President would be akin to the President prosecuting<br>himself, and I have a strong hunch that he woudn't do that. Therefore,<br>if the President doesn't approve the prosecution, and revokes the<br>authority to engage in a particular prosecution, then it doesn't happen.<br>Therefore, it's highly unlikely that an indictment of a sitting<br>President would be Constitutional.<br><br>*That said*, if a President is unable to be prosecuted while he is<br>President, then the statute of limitations would be tolled (paused)<br>until such time as the President becomes eligible for prosecution: when<br>he is no longer the sitting President.<br><br>So while the President is not immune from prosecution, he just can't be<br>prosecuted *while he's President.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
