<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You have a few inaccuracies in here which are causing your confusion.<br><br>1\. You said that because only Jesus was without sin, it implies that<br>humanity is "inherently flawed." But this is incorrect.<br><br>Humanity was created with the *potential* to sin. This potential, which<br>God absolutely adores and promotes and protects, is called **free<br>will**. Free will, if we are truly free, means that we have the *free<br>choice* to pursue good or evil, with zero consequences in this life.<br><br>So in this life, I can choose to *kiss* a puppy or *kill* a puppy, and<br>my life continues on without interruption (human consequences<br>notwithstanding). God allows me to choose good or to choose evil. He<br>desires for us to choose good, but He allows us to choose evil, because<br>that is the very nature of free will.<br><br>2\. God does not condemn anyone to hell, not even the flawed. **People<br>choose hell on their own.**<br><br>Those who make a conscious decision to reject God will be eternally<br>separated from Him, which is a torment beyond any I can think of. As in<br>point 1, those who choose evil choose hell as well. That's their choice.<br>Their free will separates them from God.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
