<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not from the Supreme Court. That ship has sailed. Essentially, that's<br>like asking if the Court would ever reinstate the 3/5 Compromise or Jim<br>Crow. The Court has corrected a bad ruling, and barring something that<br>has never happened in US history, we're not going back. Abortion is not<br>a right in the Constitution, period. That error has been corrected.<br><br>Maybe there will be a new ruling, with new facts and new circumstances,<br>which legalizes abortion nationwide under a different Constitutional<br>provision, but the court will never reinstate the ruling of *Roe*.<br><br>But something *Roe-*like can be passed at the state level, and some<br>states do indeed have similar *Roe-*like laws, in that they permit<br>abortions. Or, a Constitutional amendment could be passed that makes the<br>right to an abortion Constitutional.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
