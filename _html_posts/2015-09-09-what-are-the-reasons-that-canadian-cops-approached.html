<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The most likely answer: the gas station attendant called<br>the police and reported someone loitering in their parking lot. When a<br>business is open, the parking spaces for that business are for the<br>exclusive use of the customers of that business. When you park in one of<br>those spaces and you\'re not a customer, the business has the right to<br>question what you\'re doing. Because of the late hour, I can imagine the<br>attendant not checking the occupant out himself and just calling the<br>police to do it.\<br>\<br>When police are contacted directly about an individual, they are<br>obligated to check it out and see why you\'re loitering in the parking<br>lot of a business which is still open. They did so, they did not ask you<br>to do anything illegal, they asked you some basic questions and ran a<br>basic check for wants and warrants to see if you were a criminal running<br>from the law. Clearly, they believed your story.\<br>\<br>Directing you to a business which is not 24 hours to catch some shuteye<br>was the appropriate action for the officer to take.\<br>\<br>Also, waving off the lookey-loos was another good thing. Notice the<br>difference between the attitude they presented to you and the attitude<br>they presented to the other loiterers. They were a bit more harsh with<br>the loiterers than they were with you. This, again, is a sign that they,<br>at least at first blush, believed you.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
