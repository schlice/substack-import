<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Anywhere from 50-75% of MS patients will get lesions on<br/>their spinal cord at one time during the cours of their disease. In<br/>about 20% of already-diagnosed MS patients, lesions occur on the spinal<br/>cord only, and not on the brain. This is what is commonly referred to as<br/>\"spinal MS.\" It simply means that lesions occur, either alone or along<br/>with others, on the spinal cord.\<br/>\<br/>The lesions on the spinal cord are more likely than any others to cause<br/>some sort of acute physical symptom, according to [[a<br/>report](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6a355c&amp;url=http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/smd/Rad/neurocases/Neurocase108.htm){.external_link<br/>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br/>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br/>qt-tooltip="rochester.edu"}]{.qlink_container} from the University of<br/>Rochester Medical Center. Spinal cord lesions [[may be more difficult to<br/>see](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=720fcd&amp;url=http://www.healthcentral.com/multiple-sclerosis/c/6639/25072/cord-ms){.external_link<br/>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br/>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br/>qt-tooltip="healthcentral.com"}]{.qlink_container} on MRI scans than<br/>brain lesions, so unless there are physical indications of spinal<br/>involvement through neurological exam, spinal cord lesions are easy to<br/>miss.]<br/><br/>*Disclaimer:*<br/><br/>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br/>substitute for professional medical advice.
