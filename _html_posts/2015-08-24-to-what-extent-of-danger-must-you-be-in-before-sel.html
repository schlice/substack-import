<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Self-defense can be used to counter any threat to your<br>person, or to someone else. Self-defense can be as simple as slapping<br>someone\'s hand away from touching you, or as final as a gunshot.\<br>\<br>The key here is *matching level of force.* You can\'t shoot someone who<br>was touching you and claim self-defense. The level of force used in your<br>defense can only match the level of force being applied to you. If you<br>are facing deadly force, you can respond with deadly force,<br>etc.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
