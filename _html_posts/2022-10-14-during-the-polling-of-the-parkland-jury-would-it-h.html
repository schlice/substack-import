<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Oh. you mean like the people who say, "not my President?" News flash:<br>while you may not have voted for him, he is your president.<br><br>In just the same way, you had a vote. You either said "guilty" or "not<br>guilty," and that vote expresses your opinion as to whether or not the<br>evidence sufficiently proved that the defendant did what he was accused<br>of doing.<br><br>That's the only opinion you get to give as a juror. Giving other<br>opinions means *you may not understand your job as a juror*, and could<br>actually result in a mistrial.<br><br>So I'd suggest that you say exactly what you are supposed to say, and<br>nothing more, or you could jeopardize the entire proceeding, meaning the<br>state would have to expend more money and resources to retry the case<br>after your uninformed comment.<br><br>Just to be clear, the court does not look favorably upon those who waste<br>its time, or whose recklessness cause its time to be wasted.<br><br>Don't be that person.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>During the polling of the Parkland jury, would it have been appropriate<br>for any juror to say "no, the verdict is not my verdict"?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
