<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Are DNA tests a violation of the 5th Amendment?<br><br>No. DNA tests are not in and of themselves *testimony*. They are<br>biometric data, not testimony.<br><br>This difference between "testimonial evidence" and "non-testimonial<br>evidence" means that you cannot be compelled to give statements against<br>yourself, but you can be compelled to give fingerprints, pictures, blood<br>samples, and DNA evidence, and these are not protected under the 5th<br>Amendment as "testimony."<br><br>Clearly, this only applies when you've been arrested for a serious<br>crime, at which point DNA can be taken, depending on state law. If<br>you're just a suspect and haven't yet been arrested and charged, you<br>can't be compelled to give your DNA. The court would have to issue a<br>"compulsion order" in order to require you to give your DNA.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
