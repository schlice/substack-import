Perhaps you could clarify?<br><br>In general, the only thing that can affect disease progression is one of<br>the disease modifying drugs (DMDs). These will slow the progression of<br>the disease, as well as reduce the severity and duration of relapses.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
