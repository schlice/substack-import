<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm glad you asked, [[Quora Prompt<br>Generator](https://www.quora.com/profile/Quora-Prompt-Generator)]{.qlink_container}!<br>Normally, I strenuously object to answering questions from the QPG<br>because its questions violate Quora's own Terms of Service, but that's a<br>topic for another discussion.<br><br>Being a veteran myself (and a 100% disabled veteran at that), I am<br>intimately interested in this topic, so in just this one instance, I<br>will make an exception.<br><br>Several programs can help veterans afford homes, primarily through loans<br>and grants. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers various loan<br>programs with favorable terms, including no down payment requirements<br>and potentially lower interest rates. In fact, I have used my VA loan<br>benefit each time I have purchased a home, and it is a great benefit. In<br>most cases, VA loans get more favorable rates, and while you technically<br>*can* buy a house with 0% down, I've only done that once, for my very<br>first home purchase. Grants and down payment assistance from<br>organizations like Soldier Next Door can also help with homeownership.<br><br>Additionally, programs like the HUD-VASH program provide rental<br>assistance and supportive services for homeless veterans.<br><br>Let's just list out a few of the programs available for veterans to help<br>them buy a home:<br><br>1\.
