<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can a HOA Board change the current management company without first<br>informing or consulting with HOA members via an official HOA meeting?**<br><br>In most cases, yes.<br><br>Unless your Governing Documents require that management company changes<br>be voted on at an Annual Meeting by a quorum of homeowners, there is<br>generally no such requirement. The Board is free to change the<br>management company in accordance with the contract between the HOA and<br>the company itself. When the contract comes due, the Board can choose to<br>renew the contract, or select a new management company.<br><br>Presumably, the Board did their due diligence and shopped around to find<br>a good deal. If they didn't, maybe those Board members shouldn't be<br>re-elected when their terms are up, and maybe someone else with a little<br>more fiscal sense should be on the Board.<br><br>But generally, homeowners rail on about how terrible their Board is, but<br>never volunteer to serve on the Board themselves. Or they become<br>"single-issue" Board members ("I'm only here to get X rule overturned")<br>and they are ineffectual at every other time. So you have a small group<br>of dedicated Board members and it appears like an oligarchy or some sort<br>of back-room power thing, when in reality, it's nothing of the sort. I<br>never feared losing my high-paying job on the Board.<br><br>That's sarcasm. Board members are volunteers. They get nothing (but<br>ridicule) out of the deal.<br><br>Unless they're actually good. I've had too many residents from my last<br>neighborhood approach me and ask if I'm still on the Board. When I say<br>that I served out my two three-year terms and I'm done now, they ask if<br>I can go back. That's the surest indication to me that I did something<br>right.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
