<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the US, this would be considered spam, which is opt-in. You can<br>only send commercial email to people who have opted-in to receiving<br>email from you. As long as the people to whom you are sending email have<br>already consented to being on your list, you are fine to email them<br>according to the frequency you informed them of when they joined your<br>list.<br><br>If, however, you have a random list of email addresses, you cannot email<br>them.<br><br>In the US, e-mail is covered by the [[CAN-SPAM<br>Act](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=09ce7d&url=https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ftc.gov"}]{.qlink_container}. I would strongly suggest you<br>read it over carefully before you send any email.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
