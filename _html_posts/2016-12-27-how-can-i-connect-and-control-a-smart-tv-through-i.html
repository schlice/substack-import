<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is no standard behind the moniker "Smart TV." It's not like that<br>implies some sort of standard feature set or standard build. It simply<br>means the TV has an application framework built in, probably some<br>default apps, and can connect to a wired or wireless network.<br><br>That said, most Smart TVs have apps available which will use your<br>network to connect to and control your Smart TV. Check the app store for<br>your brand of TV, and you will likely find that the manufacturer has<br>provided an app for your brand and model.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
