<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Depends on where you are licensed and where you are stopped.<br><br>In some locations, you can be arrested for not driving with a license,<br>especially if you have no other form of identification and you cannot<br>prove your identity. In others, it's a fine and the offense itself can<br>be dismissed if you take your license down to the courthouse and show<br>them that you were a licensed driver on the day you were stopped.<br><br>For your registration and your insurance, it's purely a dismissible<br>offense In other words, you get a fine but the offense can be dismissed<br>if you show the court you had insurance or that your car was registered<br>on the day you were stopped.<br><br>But again, it's different for every state.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
