<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Whoa, I thought I was on top of the news cycle! When did Congress<br>declare war on a friendly democratic nation? When did we start deploying<br>troops to a friendly democratic nation to take them over? Can you please<br>tell me what you're talking about?<br><br>Oh, wait. Are you talking about the Greenland thing? Yeah, you do know<br>that was a *negotiating tactic*, right? Once Trump started calling out<br>Denmark for failing to invest heavily enough in Greenland, Denmark<br>responded. In response to Trump's threats to annex Greenland, Denmark<br>announced a \$2 billion investment in defense on the island in January.<br><br>Denmark's defense intelligence service has determined Greenland to be<br>\"a priority for Russia, and it will demonstrate its power through<br>aggressive and threatening behavior, which will carry along with it a<br>greater risk of escalation than ever before in the Arctic.\"<br><br>\"We have not invested enough in the Arctic for many years,\" Danish<br>Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen admitted recently. \"Now we are<br>planning a stronger presence.\"<br><br>So, in short, the tactic *is working.* Denmark is committing more<br>resources to bolster security around Greenland.<br><br>Oh, maybe you're talking about making Canada the 51st state? It's cute<br>to watch Justin Trudeau squirm and blanche at the idea, but seriously,<br>we don't really want Canada as the 51st state. Once again, it's a<br>*negotiating tactic.* Let's take a look at the history here since Trump<br>was elected. Trump told Canada that he was going to impose a 25% tariff<br>on Canada, which Trudeau said would really hurt our northern allies. So<br>Trump floated the idea of Canada joining us. They wouldn't face any<br>tariffs if they were part of the United States. So why not?<br><br>Clearly, that idea is unpalatable to Canada. And it's unpalatable to<br>Republicans too, as most Canadians would actually lean Democratic if<br>they were thrust into US politics. So in actuality, it's *Democrats* who<br>would really want Canada to join the US, as it would solidify Democrat<br>control of Congress and the White House for the foreseeable future if<br>they did.<br><br>But since clearly Trump doesn't want that, and neither does Trudeau or<br>the Canadian government, why say it? Because it forces Trudeau to<br>negotiate. It shows Canada that there are worse things than engaging in<br>a tit-for-tat trade war. They could simply eliminate all tariffs by<br>becoming part of the US. So if we don't want to kill our economy, and<br>the only other option is to become part of the US, I guess we have to<br>negotiate with the US. That's what Canada is thinking.<br><br>So, in short, the tactic is *working*. Canada is actually coming to the<br>bargaining table ahead of the renegotiation of the USMCA (that's the US<br>Mexico Canada Alliance, the treaty which replaced NAFTA).<br><br>\<br><br>So in two instances, we're not actually taking over other countries.<br><br>In case you have forgotten in all the hateful Trump rhetoric from the<br>progressives, you are literally talking about the man who wrote the Art<br>of the Deal. You may not like him personally, you may think him brash<br>and boorish (which may be true), but at the end of the day, he makes the<br>deals. And that's why he was elected. He's setting the country up for<br>greatness for a long time to come.<br><br>Democrats, for all of their faults, are *really good* at playing the<br>long game, and we have to get better about it. These moves Trump is<br>making will secure our future for *decades*. We're making bold moves<br>that have some short-term effect, but definitely have long-term<br>benefits. That's why he was elected. We need to drain the swamp, fix the<br>runaway spending, reduce the size and scope of government, and<br>reintroduce common sense into how government works. These won't be fixed<br>in a day. But when they do get fixed, they will be fixed for the<br>foreseeable future.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
