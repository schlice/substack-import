<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Pro-life and pro-choice people have one major difference in philosophy:<br><br>The pro-life movement believes that the life of a human being<br>*deserves to be protected at any stage of development.*<br><br>The pro-choice movement believes that the life of a human being<br>*has differential value based on temporal circumstances.*<br><br>Saying something like "a fetus is not a person" or saying "a fetus is<br>not alive" are silly, and have already been disproven by science. Those<br>things they say are just cover to allow them the mental justification to<br>take a human life. Everything else is just fodder. I mean, some things<br>are definitely issues, like "pro life people don't care about the baby<br>after it is born" and while that may or may not be true (we can<br>certainly debate that), it has no bearing on whether or not it is<br>morally acceptable to kill a fetus. You can absolutely make those<br>arguments (and I expect the comments to light up with people telling me<br>that I just want women barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen, that I<br>believe women are nothing more than babymaking machines, "no uterus, no<br>opinion", etc), but all of that is ancillary. This is the real,<br>unvarnished truth about each movement.<br><br>Because pro-choicers don't value life in its earliest stages in the same<br>way or to the same degree, they find it morally acceptable to kill it.<br>Since pro-lifers value life equally at all stages of its development, we<br>believe that the fetus has rights, and one of those rights is the right<br>to life.<br><br>Therefore, we believe a person is obligated (in most circumstances) to<br>carry a fetus to term and then give it up for adoption if you don't want<br>it.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Pro-lifers, why do you think a person is obligated to carry a fetus and<br>give birth when they are pregnant?<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance<br>for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough<br>shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion<br>masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your<br>own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.<br>If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"<br>don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything<br>vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a<br>block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
