You can't force companies to do things right.<br>They will make mistakes, and often do. It even takes time to process a<br>change of address, and some mail will still go to your old address.<br>Additionally, certain items are never forwarded, like periodicals or<br>circulars.<br><br>Besides, it costs the new addressee nothing to write RETURN TO SENDER -<br>NO LONGER AT THIS ADDRESS on an envelope and throw it back in the<br>outgoing mail but a few seconds of their precious time.<br><br>There's simply no cause for legal action there.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
