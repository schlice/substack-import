<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you think that Pence could win the presidency in 2024 with Trump as<br>VP?**<br><br>I think that historically, once a president has served two terms, the<br>American people feel that he is done.<br><br>It's not that Trump couldn't be a VP, or even a good one (if he could<br>lay off the Twitter just a little bit). It's just that once the<br>president is done, he's expected to step away from politics.<br><br>We talk a lot about expectations. Presidential candidates are expected<br>to provide full access to their tax returns. Presidents are expected to<br>act *presidential*, or in a way which honors the legacy of the office<br>that they temporarily occupy. And once a president has concluded his<br>service, he is expected to step aside and let others take over. Those<br>aren't hard and fast rules. They're simply expectations shaped by<br>precedent.<br><br>This includes returning to politics in any other facet.<br><br>This is one of the reasons that Obama setting up an office inside the<br>Beltway was seen as distasteful.<br><br>To that end, a Pence/Trump ticket would likely be a *detriment* instead<br>of a *benefit*.<br><br>Besides, there are far better running mates that Pence could choose.<br>Can you say Nikki Haley? Even as I write that, I'd still rather see a<br>Haley/Gabbard ticket. But a Pence/Haley ticket would come in close<br>second.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
