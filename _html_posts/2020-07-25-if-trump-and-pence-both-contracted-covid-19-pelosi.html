McConnell<br>would pull the same trick he did with Merrick Garland, and the nominee<br>wouldn't even make it to the floor for a vote. He'd say that Pelosi<br>wasn't an elected president, so he'd wait until the next elected<br>president in November nominates someone.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
