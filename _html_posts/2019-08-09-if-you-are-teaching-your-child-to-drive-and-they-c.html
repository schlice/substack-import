<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you are teaching your child to drive and they cause a accident in<br>which there is considerable property damage and injuries are you still<br>covered under your policy even if you where not the one driving?**<br><br>Virtually every state in the country has some form of graduated driver's<br>license model. Most states have drivers start off as "provisional" or<br>"learners." You've probably heard that a young person has a "learner's<br>permit" in order to drive with a licensed adult.<br><br>So long as the child is following the state laws regarding eligibility<br>and enrollment for their learner's permit (in other words, they are<br>eligible for and have their permit), and you were operating the vehicle<br>in accordance with state laws regarding permit drivers, then you are<br>covered and insurance will also still cover you under your policy (as<br>the adult in the car).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
