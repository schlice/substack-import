He didn't expect to<br>be stopped by anyone. He expected to get out of the chamber as quickly<br>as possible.<br><br>And in that second of misunderstanding, someone snapped a picture. The<br>timeframe that he didn't understand what was going on was literally one<br>second. You see it all happen if you *watch the video* instead of<br>looking at the picture.<br><br>Context is everything.<br><br>Don't forget, the Left is literally grasping at straws right now. They<br>can't stop Kavanaugh's nomination, so they're going to try to<br>[Bork(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8c6d5e&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bork%23Bork_as_verb){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} him. That's literally all<br>they have at this point. So they're grasping for anything they can to<br>effect their Bork. If they can't Bork him, they can at least telegraph<br>to their base that they're doing everything they can to forestall the<br>process, and potentially showcase their nominees for 2020 #resisting.<br><br>"Doing everything they can" includes taking a photo out of context.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
