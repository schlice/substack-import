<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, nationalism and racism are distinct and different. Nationalism is<br>pride in your nation. Nationalism drives you to defend your own nation.<br><br>Nationalism can appear to be racism if you have a homogeneous culture,<br>but it's not about the race of the person, it's about the national<br>origin.<br><br>Extreme nationalism may be more closely linked to xenophobia than<br>racism.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
