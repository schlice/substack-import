You<br>should know (or be able to find out) what those rules are.<br><br>Those items can be sold up until the appropriate sell-by date. They can<br>be moved from one display case to another, assuming that appropriate<br>temperature and cross-contamination controls are in place (i.e. wrapping<br>a tray of donuts and transporting them to another sale location).<br><br>If the donuts remain on the shelf for the full time, and then they are<br>transported to another store and re-displayed and offered for sale after<br>the sell-by date, this may be a violation. It would be up to the state<br>to investigate and prosecute that. The state's food service enforcement<br>section may have an anonymous tip line you might be able to use to<br>report your concerns.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
