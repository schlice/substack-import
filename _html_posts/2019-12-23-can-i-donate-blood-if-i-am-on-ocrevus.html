People with MS in<br>general have been approved to donate blood since 2007. If you're<br>otherwise healthy, on a treatment, and your MS is under control, you<br>should be able to donate blood at any Red Cross blood donation location.<br>Of course, you'll need to meet all the other blood donor requirements:<br>be at least 17, be in good health, and weigh at least 110 pounds (49.89<br>kg). Also, while the Red Cross allows persons with MS to donate blood,<br>some individual donation centers may still reject you.<br><br>As for medications, in almost all cases, medication will not disqualify<br>you from donating blood; the underlying reason you're taking medication<br>might.<br><br>Currently, the only MS medication which prevents you from donating blood<br>is Aubagio (teriflunomide). You must wait two years after your last dose<br>before you can donate blood.<br><br>See [[the Red Cross<br>website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=24c433&url=https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html%23eligibility-medications){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="redcrossblood.org"}]{.qlink_container} for more information<br>about donating blood and what may prevent you from doing so.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
