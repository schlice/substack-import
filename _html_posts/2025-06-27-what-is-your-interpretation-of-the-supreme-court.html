<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Court did a great job of breaking down the concept of "equity<br>jurisprudence." They basically said that, in essence, only the person<br>who sues can seek equity. Equity cannot be extended to people who did<br>not sue, even if they may be harmed by the action in question.<br><br>> The Judiciary Act of 1789 endowed federal courts with jurisdiction<br>> over "all suits . . . in equity," *ยง11, 1 Stat. 78*, and still today,<br>> this statute "is what authorizes the federal courts to issue equitable<br>> remedies," *S. Bray & E. Sherwin, Remedies 442 (4th ed. 2024).* Though<br>> flexible, this equitable authority is not freewheeling.<br>><br>> \...\<br>><br>> The Court's early refusals to grant relief to nonparties are<br>> consistent with the party-specific principles that permeate the<br>> Court's understanding of equity. "\N\either declaratory nor<br>> injunctive relief," the Court has said, "can directly interfere with<br>> enforcement of contested statutes or ordinances except with respect to<br>> the particular federal plaintiffs." *Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U.<br>> S. 922, 931.*<br>><br>> from TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, ET AL. v. CASA, INC., ET<br>> AL.<br><br>This puts to rest the practice of district courts granting nationwide<br>injunctions against Executive action. Crucially, it does not mean that<br>people cannot sue if they believe that the way the Executive action<br>affects them is unconstitutional. It also does not prevent **class<br>action** lawsuits from proceeding, to the extent that they can. The<br>order merely prevents district courts from overstepping their bounds and<br>imposing nationwide injunctions, as the court found that such power<br>likely oversteps the authority granted to district courts by Congress.<br><br>\<br><br>To the next part of your question, this decision is separate from the<br>question about birthright citizenship. This decision actually had<br>nothing to do with the question of birthright citizenship. It only<br>addressed the issue of nationwide injunctions. The Constitutionality of<br>Trump's Executive Order is still undecided.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
