<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Your best bet is to do a factory reset. Your phone will wipe and will be<br>re-installed from the recovery partition. Unless you've been doing some<br>interesting phone hacking yourself, your recovery partition will have a<br>clean version of Android in it. Once you wipe and reboot, your phone<br>will reach out to the Google Play Store and re-install the apps you had<br>previously.<br><br>There may be some bits of data that don't get recovered, especially if<br>they were not stored in a cloud-based account.<br><br>(EDIT) Since the question changed, let's update the answer.<br><br>**How do I stop a relentless hacker from hacking my Android phone? I\'ve<br>changed phones and numbers and eventually it\'s right back.**<br><br>If your hacker is as relentless as you claim, then it's not about<br>hacking your phone. It's about you.<br><br>If you are certain it's a hacker targeting you, contact the police. Let<br>them help you catch the hacker. If he's persistent, he'll eventually get<br>caught.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
