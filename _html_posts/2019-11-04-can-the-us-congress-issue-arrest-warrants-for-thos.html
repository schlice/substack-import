<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can the US Congress issue arrest warrants for those who ignore<br>subpoenas and refuse to testify during the Trump impeachment<br>proceedings?**<br><br>Not directly, but there is a process by which they can have offenders<br>arrested.<br><br>Historically, Congress has used its own authority to arrest those in<br>contempt of Congress, though very infrequently.<br><br>Today, a Congressional subcommittee seeking to enforce a subpoena would<br>deliver that subpoena to the US Attorney's Office (usually the one in DC<br>is used) and a hearing would be scheduled. Attorneys from both sides<br>would be heard, and the judge would rule first on the validity and<br>enforce-ability of the subpoena, and then on whether or not the<br>respondent can be compelled to comply with the subpoena.<br><br>After a favorable ruling, the respondent will have a certain amount of<br>time to comply. Failure to comply at that point could result in a bench<br>warrant.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
