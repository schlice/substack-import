<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do police investigate missing parcels that say delivered and<br>aren\'t received when there is no security video or any proof. Also if<br>the sender files the report would the receiver get a knock on the door<br>by a investigating officer to get more info?**<br><br>*(US Answer Only)*<br><br>Police do not investigate missing parcels, because missing parcels is<br>not a crime. If you are alleging mail theft or "porch piracy," even if<br>you have proof, it's highly unlikely for the police to be able to catch<br>the perpetrator, so it's again highly unlikely that the police would<br>investigate at all.<br><br>The only investigation that *might* be done would be accomplished by the<br>delivery service (UPS, FedEx, or UPS if you used a trackable delivery<br>feature). They could tell you if they delivered the package, and where.<br>Amazon, now entering the "last mile" delivery game, has its system set<br>up so that the delivery person takes a picture of the parcel on the<br>doorstep, and that picture is included in Amazon's delivery report, thus<br>proving that they dropped the package on your doorstep. Porch piracy<br>would therefore need to be investigated by the police, if they will even<br>investigate.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
