<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Viability clauses make for bad law, for a number of reasons.<br><br>1.  Viability is a moving target. As medicine advances, babies are<br>    surviving at younger and younger gestational ages. For example, the<br>    current (2023) average minimum gestational age is about 28 weeks.<br>    [[But technology will change that, and<br>    soon.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b91327&url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/artificial-wombs-tested-human-trials-new-technology/story?id%3D103356485){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="go.com"}]{.qlink_container} Babies will survive earlier<br>    and earlier as medical technology advances. Adding a viability<br>    clause makes bad law because no one has a definite minimum date of<br>    viability.<br>2.  What does "viability" even mean? Does that mean survival without any<br>    assistance at all? Or does that mean survival with medical<br>    intervention? Does it mean survival in an artificial womb? We'd have<br>    to agree on a definition of viability.<br>3.  What difference does viability make? Why is a baby worthy of death<br>    because it can't survive outside of the womb? If the thought is,<br>    "the baby can survive if we do nothing to help it," then the logic<br>    is incorrect, because "do nothing" means leave it exactly where it<br>    is until it naturally leaves the womb. "Do nothing" does not involve<br>    killing a living human being, regardless of its stage of development<br>    or its "viability" outside of the womb.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
