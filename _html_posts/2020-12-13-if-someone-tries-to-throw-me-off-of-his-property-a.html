Deadly force can only be<br>used if the homeowner believes it to be necessary to stop a *forcible<br>felony*.<br><br>In Florida, a "forcible felony" means treason; murder; manslaughter;<br>sexual battery; carjacking; home-invasion robbery; robbery; burglary;<br>arson; kidnapping; aggravated assault; aggravated battery; aggravated<br>stalking; aircraft piracy; unlawful throwing, placing, or discharging of<br>a destructive device or bomb; and any other felony which involves the<br>use or threat of physical force or violence against any individual (Fl<br>Stat 776.08).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
