<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I want to block my ex on Gmail but I don't want our past emails to be<br>deleted. Does anyone know if they will be deleted?**<br><br>You said you want to "block your ex on Gmail." So let's make sure that<br>we fully understand what we're asking for:<br><br>- block: means you will no longer see or keep (your choice) the incoming<br>  emails<br>- Gmail: the online mail program. Not chat, not Facebook, Gmail.<br><br>In order to accomplish what you're asking, you need to set up a rule.<br>This rule will either auto-archive, or auto-delete, the incoming mail in<br>question. **It will not affect any of your existing messages unless you<br>tell it to.**<br><br>Here's how you do it:<br><br>1.  Find one of the messages from this person and select it. The email<br>    will have a checkbox next to it on the left.<br>2.  Click the three-dot menu at the right-side of the row of buttons<br>    just below the search bar.<br>3.  Choose Filter messages like this<br>4.  You will see a message selection box populated with the email<br>    address from the email in question. Without changing anything else,<br>    click the button which says Create filter at the bottom.<br>5.  A new window will appear titled "When a message arrives that matches<br>    this search". You have the option here of either keeping the mail<br>    and just not seeing it, or deleting it outright. If you want to keep<br>    it but just never see it, select the first two boxes: **Skip the<br>    Inbox (Archive it) and Mark as read**. If you don't want to keep<br>    the messages at all, click Delete it. DON'T CHOOSE ANYTHING<br>    ELSE. *ESPECIALLY* the box at the very bottom which says "Also<br>    apply filter to X matching conversations". That would perform that<br>    action on all of your existing mail, and if you chose "Delete it,"<br>    that would delete all your existing email.<br><br>You might want to keep the messages and just not see them. Who knows,<br>they may be useful in the future. But if you really don't want to keep<br>them, set your filter to simply delete them as soon as they arrive.<br><br>The magic of filters.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
