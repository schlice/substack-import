<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In the USA, if the Supreme Court has ruled that police have no duty to<br>protect, do I have the right to act?**<br><br>The short answer is yes.<br><br>The longer answer is *you have a right to protect yourself, because the<br>police are under no obligation to protect* *you**.*<br><br>The courts have indeed ruled that law enforcement generally does not<br>have a federal constitutional duty to protect one private person from<br>another. For example, if a drunk driver injures a pedestrian or a drug<br>dealer beats up an informant, agencies and their officers usually would<br>not be liable for those injuries because there was no duty to protect.<br>In 1989 the U.S. Supreme Court stated, \"Nothing in the language of the<br>Due Process Clause itself requires the State to protect the life,<br>liberty, and property of its citizens against invasion by private<br>actors.\" Generally, the Due Process Clause does not provide an<br>affirmative right to government aid, \"even where such aid may be<br>necessary to secure life, liberty, or property interests of which the<br>government itself may not deprive the individual.\"<br><br>There are two exceptions to this rule: the special relationship<br>exception, and the state-created danger exception.<br><br>The special relationship exception exists when the police have<br>created a special relationship with an individual. This usually happens<br>when the police arrest someone. In that scenario, the person is unable<br>to defend themselves, and must rely on the police to protect and defend<br>them.<br><br>The state-created danger exception happens when officers leave an<br>individual in a situation that is more dangerous than the one in which<br>they found him, by creating a previously non-existing danger or<br>increasing the danger. For example, leaving a woman to walk home, alone,<br>in the dark, while she was clearly intoxicated, is a state-created<br>danger, but no state-created danger existed when a designated driver was<br>arrested on a warrant and allowed to drive his car to the police<br>station. His passengers, who were drunk, remained unattended in the car<br>outside the police station for about 30 minutes, drove off, and were<br>involved in a fatal crash. The Court reasoned that a claim had not been<br>stated, as it was not reasonable to find that the arresting officer<br>\"knew or should have known that the two passengers were drunk and unfit<br>to drive."<br><br>So now that you know that the police are not there to protect you, what<br>does that mean? This means that **your protection is your<br>responsibility**. You are responsible, first and foremost, to protect<br>yourself and your family. No one else. That job falls on you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
