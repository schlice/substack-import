<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why can't Americans understand that gun-violence numbers are inflated<br>to include gang violence and suicides, and that by addressing drugs,<br>mental health and enforcing current firearms laws, we can leave the 2nd<br>Amendment alone?**<br><br>I have reported your question to Quora Moderation as "Insincere." This<br>means you're not seeking genuine answers, but are instead making a<br>point.<br><br>Most Americans do understand every point you've made. There is a small<br>but vocal minority of Americans which, despite knowing these facts,<br>still believes that they can be fixed by "getting rid of guns." And it's<br>really difficult to change their minds.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
