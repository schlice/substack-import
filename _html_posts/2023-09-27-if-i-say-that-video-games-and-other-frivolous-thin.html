<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not necessarily, but you're approaching precariously close to a very<br>serious sin.<br><br>Because next, after declaring that "video games and other frivolous<br>things" are more fun than God, you might go on to say, "I want to<br>ignore, disobey, and dishonor God and spend all my time with video games<br>and other frivolous things."<br><br>And you can probably guess what might happen if "video games and other<br>frivolous things" become your god instead of God.<br><br>The First Commandment addresses this: "I am the LORD your God. You shall<br>have no other gods before me."<br><br>If you allow something else to become "god" in your life, you are indeed<br>committing a very serious sin.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
