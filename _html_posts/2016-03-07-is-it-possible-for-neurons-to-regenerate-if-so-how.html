<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Neurons can live for a hundred years, and while it is true that we can<br>make new ones, it\'s also true that this process does not happen quickly<br>or easily. That\'s why we are born with about 100 billion neurons,<br>because we will need them for our entire lifetime.<br><br>I don\'t know how long it takes a neuron to regenerate in an adult, but<br>I do know that the process is a slow one.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
