Why is the new US<br>flagship fighter jet only limited to mach 1.6?**<br><br>First of all, let's talk about the MiG for a second. The MiG-25 had a<br>top speed of Mach 2.85, which was the maximum speed the aircraft could<br>sustain without damage. It also had an "emergency over-speed" mode which<br>would push it to about Mach 3.2. Every time the emergency over-speed<br>mode was used, the engines would have to be replaced on landing because<br>flying faster than Mach 2.85 would overheat and damage the engines.<br><br>The A-12 (later called the SR-71) was specifically designed to primarily<br>go fast and high, because its primary mission was aerial reconnaissance.<br>It could easily out-run the MiG-25, even in its emergency over-speed<br>mode, as well as outrunning its missiles. But the SR-71 was *expensive*<br>to fly, and it was specifically designed to go fast. Its engines could<br>routinely do Mach 3+, and not sustain damage. Its skin was designed to<br>take the thermal stress of air moving across it that quickly and not<br>disintegrate.<br><br>Put simply, the reason that the F-35 can only do Mach 1.6 is that<br>*that's all it needs to do*. It simply doesn't need to go that fast.<br>With its integrated sensor and avionics package, which receives data<br>inputs from both on and off-aircraft sensors, pilots have more<br>battlefield and situational awareness in the aircraft than in any other<br>aircraft. They have better target identification and weapon delivery<br>capabilities than anyone else in the inventory. The aircraft boasts a<br>new stealth technology using structural fiber materials which offers<br>better stealth capability and much lower weight and maintenance costs<br>than previous generation radar-absorbent material (RAM) which was heavy,<br>extremely expensive and difficult to maintain.<br><br>It simply doesn't need to expend the cost to send the aircraft that<br>fast, when the lower-cost design and engines will do for its mission.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
