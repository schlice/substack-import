<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is yes, but it is unlikely.<br><br>The legal standard is that the law at the time of the action is the law<br>which governs. Therefore, if a criminal action is taken while that<br>action is actually a crime, it can be prosecuted.<br><br>However, the truth of the matter is that the action has now been<br>decriminalized. It is likely, therefore, that there will be little will<br>to prosecute a crime which is no longer a crime. That action was<br>intentionally decriminalized; the impetus therefore is that no one wants<br>to actually prosecute such a crime.<br><br>So legally, the crime could be prosecuted, but in actuality, it is<br>unlikely that anyone would take up that mantle to prosecute that crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
