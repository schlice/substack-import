<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What can Congress do if the White House stonewalls the subpoenas?<br><br>1.  Make them real, enforceable subpoenas, with little chance of being<br>    able to wiggle out of them, by holding a full House vote on an<br>    impeachment inquiry. They have the votes to pass it, so they should<br>    just vote on it. It would legitimize the investigation, and thus<br>    legitimize the subpoenas.<br>2.  *At that point,* any subpoenas which are ignored would find the<br>    subject of that subpoena in contempt of Congress.<br>3.  Then deliver the subpoenas to the US Attorney's Office (usually the<br>    DC office is used for this sort of thing) to compel the person to<br>    provide the listed information.<br>4.  The person complies, or goes to jail.<br><br>If they really want answers, the method is very simple.<br><br>If they don't do this, then they don't really want answers. They want a<br>made-for-TV impeachment show meant to do little more than discredit the<br>President before an election, not actually find answers.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
