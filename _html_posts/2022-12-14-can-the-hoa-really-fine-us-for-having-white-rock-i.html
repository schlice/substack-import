<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer to your question can be found in your Governing Documents. In<br>general, the ARB Guidelines and the Rules & Regulations can be modified<br>by the Board alone, at any time. Other documents in your Governing<br>Documents (your Declaration of Covenants, your Articles of Incorporation<br>and your Bylaws) require different amounts of homeowners to approve in<br>writing of any changes.<br><br>In general, the Board could make a new rule that white rocks are no<br>longer allowed in landscaping. Even that change, though, would have to<br>be voted on during a Board meeting. Board meetings are open to all the<br>homeowners, and you should be notified in some public manner (a bulletin<br>board, an email, etc). But what do they plan on doing regarding people<br>who already have white rocks? Are they going to force those people to<br>replace those rocks with another color?<br><br>Legally, they can make you change out your existing rocks with new ones;<br>they can force you to remove your existing white rocks at your expense<br>and replace them with rocks of a different color. But that's a pretty<br>awful move for a Board to pull. There would have to be some really good<br>reason to make you remove your white rocks and replace them with another<br>color. They are making you expend money to get that replacement done,<br>and they should know that this would be a pretty unpopular move,<br>especially if there are a lot of people with white rocks. I'd want the<br>Board to explain their reasoning, and it better be something more<br>pressing than "I don't like the look of white rocks."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
