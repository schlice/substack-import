<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You're absolutely correct. The FBI only has jurisdiction when a<br>kidnapper crosses state lines. In that case, the FBI has **original<br>jurisdiction**. They have jurisdiction defined by statute.<br><br>However, the FBI has developed a pretty good kidnapping investigation<br>program. So generally, state and local authorities ask the FBI to<br>assist. In most cases, they do not automatically get involved.<br><br>The FBI will automatically initiate a kidnapping investigation involving<br>a missing child "of tender years," even when there is no known<br>interstate travel. "Tender years" is generally defined as a child 12<br>years or younger. The FBI will monitor other kidnapping situations when<br>there is no evidence of interstate travel, and it offers assistance from<br>various entities including the FBI<br>Laboratory.\[1\](#MfCTj){#cite-MfCTj .citation_link}<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why is the FBI involved with kidnappings? The FBI's jurisdiction only<br>applies to interstate crime. Most kidnappings occur within one state.<br>What gives the FBI the authority to intercede?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-MfCTj){.citation_index} [[If a child is missing and<br>possibly kidnapped, but no interstate transportation is known, will the<br>FBI begin an investigation? \| Federal Bureau of<br>Investigation](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f39cbd&url=https://www.fbi.gov/about/faqs/if-a-child-is-missing-and-possibly-kidnapped-but-no-interstate-transportation-is-known-will-the-fbi-begin-an-investigation){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="fbi.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
