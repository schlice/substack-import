<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can someone hack my phone through my Gmail if it is opened on my<br>phone?**<br><br>**YES!!! If your Gmail account is open and accessible on your phone (and<br>someone has access to it on your phone), they can reset ANYTHING!!!**<br><br>Your Gmail account (if it is your primary email) is your **skeleton<br>key** to every other account you own, and not just your phone. It's your<br>bank accounts, your work accounts, your school accounts, your doctor's<br>office account, *literally everything*.<br><br>How? If I have access to your Gmail account, *I can reset any of your<br>passwords.*<br><br>PROTECT YOUR GMAIL ACCOUNT! If you don't have *two-factor<br>authentication* turned on, do it. In fact, stop reading this answer and<br>go enable it now. If you don't know how, seriously go look it up and<br>enable it.<br><br>Then if your Gmail is logged in to your phone, add a passcode to your<br>phone. Set your phone to auto-lock after a certain time. Never leave<br>your phone unattended.<br><br>That's the quickest way to ruin your life in a big hurry.<br><br>Let's assume you're thinking, "Can they hack my phone *just because<br>Gmail is logged in on my phone?*" If that's the question you're asking,<br>then no, just because Gmail is logged in on your phone doesn't mean your<br>phone can be hacked.<br><br>Someone has to be able to access your Gmail before your phone can be<br>hacked. But if you have an Android phone, there is a lot you can do<br>through your Google account to mess with your phone. So maybe not<br>"hack," but how about "remote wipe?" That's no fun either.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
