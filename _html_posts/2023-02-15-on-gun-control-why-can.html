<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Okay, let's assume that you could sneak in an unconstitutional law<br>banning all guns.<br><br>Let's run through what happens.<br><br>1.  Person buys a gun, legally (he thinks).<br>2.  Person walks out of the gun store and is immediately arrested,<br>    citing the new law you just sneakily passed which makes purchasing<br>    guns illegal.<br>3.  Person goes to trial and is prosecuted under the new law.<br>4.  Person appeals the decision, claiming that the law is<br>    unconstitutional because it violates the 2nd Amendment.<br>5.  Appeals court agrees, law is struck down<br><br>So, what was the result of this little exercise?<br><br>- Your law is gone<br>- People find out who passed this unconstitutional law.<br>- You are outed as an anti-Constitutional lawmaker who tries to skirt<br>  the law for his own purposes<br>- You all get voted out of office the next time elections come around.<br><br>So if you are trying to get yourself kicked out of office, then this is<br>a good plan.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
