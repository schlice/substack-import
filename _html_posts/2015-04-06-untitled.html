<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [And the defense would VERY easily show that the police<br>officer was following the law to the letter when trying to effect a<br>traffic stop, and the defendant refused to stop, for almost a mile. They<br>will then show the in-car recording that shows that the defendant had<br>many \"safe places\" to stop and she failed to do so.\<br>\<br>And the defense would then present the ACTUAL SUGGESTIONS provided<br>by the state of Indiana, which say FIRST CALL 911, and ONLY KEEP<br>DRIVING WITH FLASHERS AND WAVING ARMS **IF YOU CANNOT REACH AN<br>OPERATOR.** They will then show that the defendant\'s cell phone did not<br>call 911 during the time period; therefore, she did not follow the<br>recommendations of Indiana police, and was simply refusing to stop<br>because she has a fear of reprisal or a fear of law enforcement, or<br>simply disregards the law. Then they\'ll show every other incident that<br>she was involved in, and will develop a pattern in this particular<br>person of lawless behavior, and say that this is no different.\<br>\<br>Remember that the whole \"waving your arms\" thing is just SUGGESTIONS,<br>it is not LAW. If you think that this should be LAW, you lobby your<br>congressman in your state to pass a law. A police officer, or a chief of<br>police, can make a suggestion; that does not make it LAW. It\'s still<br>unlawful to fail to stop for police, and you failing to stop means you<br>accept the possibility that you are not stopping **FOR AN ACTUAL POLICE<br>OFFICER**, for whatever reason you might cite, and you accept the<br>repercussions of that decision.\<br>\<br>You\'re right, no prosecutor is going to touch this case with a ten-foot<br>pole. They are going to allow the arrest to stand.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Are-felony-charges-appropriate-for-DelRea-Good-the-Indiana-woman-who-drove-to-a-parking-lot-while-being-pulled-over-for-speeding/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
