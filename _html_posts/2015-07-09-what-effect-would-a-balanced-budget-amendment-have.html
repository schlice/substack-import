<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I agree with [[Robert J.<br>Kolker](https://www.quora.com/profile/Robert-J-Kolker)]{.qlink_container}<br>that social services would decline.\<br>\<br>But from a purely Libertarian perspective, they should. The government<br>should not be redistributing people\'s wealth. Supporting the poor is<br>something that individuals and charitable organizations do for each<br>other. Government should get out of the welfare game; it was never<br>designed to be a welfare supplier, and shouldn\'t be one now.\<br>\<br>The Declaration of Independence said that people have the right, and the<br>government should protect, the \"pursuit\" of happiness. Government was<br>never designed to \"supply\" happiness.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
