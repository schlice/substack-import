<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do doctors in the US receive kickbacks from drug makers to prescribe<br>their medicines? If so, how much do they receive? My Dr. is very<br>particular on costly medicines which require pre-authorization and it<br>makes me feel suspicious.**<br><br>Doctors do not get paid for prescribing certain medications. In general,<br>doctors don't receive any money from drug manufacturers at all.<br><br>My neurologist was on a product advisory board for a few Multiple<br>Sclerosis drugs, and he was paid for that time. You may or may not know<br>that those drugs are very expensive. Without insurance, those drugs<br>would be prohibitively costly (to the tune of \~\$10,000 for a 30-day<br>supply). I often wondered about the same issue, especially because of<br>the advisory boards, so without pretense or accusation, I asked him<br>about it. Interestingly, he had already recommended that I not take<br>the drug that his advisory board had researched. He welcomed the<br>question, understood from whence it came, and was glad to share what he<br>received, when he received it, and he showed me how it was the efficacy<br>of the drug and how it fit my particular disease profile, and not his<br>time on any advisory boards, which prompted his decision to recommend<br>one drug over another.<br><br>I'm very plain with my doctor, and in situations like this, especially<br>where you have concerns or questions about reasonings for drug<br>recommendations, you should be too.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
