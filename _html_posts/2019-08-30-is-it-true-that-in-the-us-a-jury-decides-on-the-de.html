<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it true that in the US, a jury decides on the death penalty or not?<br>If so, why? Isn\'t that like a kangaroo court?**<br><br>This process varies by state. In most states, a judge decides sentences.<br><br>However, in some states, judges are not allowed to determine whether or<br>not the death penalty will be applied; that is left up to a jury to<br>decide.<br><br>But it is most definitely not a kangaroo court. Remember that the actual<br>*trial* has already concluded and the defendant has already been found<br>guilty of a crime which carries a possible death sentence.<br><br>The trial then moves on to the *sentencing* phase, where sometimes in<br>some states a jury must decide to apply the death penalty.<br><br>Colorado is one of those states. In Colorado, after a guilty verdict<br>where the death penalty can be applied, the prosecution informs the<br>court that they are seeking the death penalty. The jury will then decide<br>whether or not the death penalty will be applied. The decision of the<br>jury must be unanimous. If even one juror opposes the death sentence in<br>the case, the sentence is life without parole.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
