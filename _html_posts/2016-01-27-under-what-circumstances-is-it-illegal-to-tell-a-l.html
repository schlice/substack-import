<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When you are stopped by the police, it is illegal to lie about your<br>identity.<br><br>You can lie to the police at any other time you choose (at your own<br>peril, of course), but you may not lie about your identity. This is a<br>separate charge in and of itself (obstruction of justice, or obstruction<br>of the duties of a peace officer, or barring justice, depending on<br>jurisdiction), but you can be jailed until the police can establish your<br>identity.<br><br>The reason for this falls under [[Scott<br>Welch](https://www.quora.com/profile/Scott-Welch)]{.qlink_container}\'s<br>answer, that it is illegal to lie to a government official. For the<br>police, this clause only applies to your identity.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
