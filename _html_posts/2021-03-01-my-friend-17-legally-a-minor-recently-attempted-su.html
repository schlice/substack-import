<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My friend (17; legally a minor) recently attempted suicide. She is in<br>a mental hospital and was prescribed Zoloft for her disorders. However,<br>her parents are refusing to let her take it for no reason. What are her<br>legal rights in this situation?**<br><br>She is a minor, and while her wishes are certainly valued, it is<br>ultimately her parents who are empowered to make medical decisions on<br>her behalf, and that includes the right to refuse or discontinue<br>treatments, even those that may be life-sustaining. However, parental<br>healthcare decision must always be in the best interests of the child.<br>Decisions that are clearly not in a child\'s best interest can and<br>should be challenged.<br><br>When older children have a disagreement with their parents over medical<br>decisions, those should be taken seriously. It is up to the medical<br>professional to assist with the discussion, always with the best<br>interests of the child at heart. The older child's voice should always<br>be considered, and in cases which cannot be resolved through discussion,<br>the hospital ethics team should be consulted. As a last resort, the<br>hospital can turn to the courts for assistance if they truly believe<br>that the parents are not acting in the best interests of the child.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
