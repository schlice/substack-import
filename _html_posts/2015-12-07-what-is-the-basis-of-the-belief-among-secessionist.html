<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is no such \"belief\". Unless you have some credible sources for<br>your assertion, I\'m going to believe that this is a question which<br>contains an assumption.<br><br>I think you will find that if the government orders the military to<br>attack civilians without just cause, in violation of the Posse Comitatus<br>Act, you may find many military officers refusing those orders as<br>illegal. However, if the military is ordered to assist a state<br>government with quelling an insurrection in full compliance with the<br>Insurrection Act, the military will comply.<br><br>You\'re not going to see the military go against the orders of its chain<br>of command unless you see the government ordering the military to act<br>lawlessly, or in contrast with currently-established law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
