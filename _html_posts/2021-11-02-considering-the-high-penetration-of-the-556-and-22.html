Don\'t forget<br>that a pistol can still over-penetrate, so it\'s not like pistol users<br>can ignore Rule 4.<br><br>A single family home may be different though. It might be easier to<br>ensure nothing is behind your target.<br><br>Plus, there is a lot to be said for accuracy in a neighborhood. I want<br>to hit what I am shooting at, and I have the best chance at that using a<br>rifle.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Considering the high penetration of the 5.56 and 223, why would someone<br>use an AR15 for self defense in a neighborhood or apartment?
