<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, this is normal.<br><br>But this is *also* a sign that you need help.<br><br>It's okay to need help. Sometimes, we need someone else (who is an<br>expert on these sorts of things) to help us understand and sort through<br>our feelings.<br><br>Professionals can absolutely help you with this. Don't feel bad about<br>needing to talk to someone about your feelings. Sometimes, our feelings<br>are hard to sort through, and they don't make sense.<br><br>Please, get help. Take a look at the box on this page titled, "There is<br>Help" and avail yourself of the resources in that box, or if you have<br>access to your medical care team, ask your doctor who you can talk to.<br><br>You *can* feel better. You just need to ask for help. You've already<br>taken the first step, and that's the hardest one to take. It gets better<br>and easier from here.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>In high school, I was 16 and found out that my father killed himself<br>when I was 3. I started to cut myself and tried killing myself. I feel<br>unloved by him and unwanted and that I don't belong.
