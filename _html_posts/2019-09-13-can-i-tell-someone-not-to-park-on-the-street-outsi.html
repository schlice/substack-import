<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>(US Answer)<br><br>First of all, you can tell anyone anything you like. First Amendment and<br>all.<br><br>Secondly, in most cities and in most places where people live, you can<br>*ask* people to not park in front of your house. But since you don\'t<br>own the street, you can\'t *compel* people to park somewhere else.<br><br>Note that in some places, you *may* indirectly own the street, like if<br>you live in a gated community. In that case, parking in front of your<br>house *may* be controlled by your HOA. If you do live there, check your<br>HOA rules to learn more about parking.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
