<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>An excellent question, and it gives me the opportunity to talk about the<br>two different facets of sin.<br><br>When Adam sinned, the human nature was corrupted by sin. Our bodies, and<br>our planet, were corrupted by the stain of sin. Every human lives in a<br>fallen, sinful body. This is what some call *original sin*. When we<br>stand before the throne of God, we are not specifically held accountable<br>for this sin.<br><br>There is a second category of sin: the sin we commit ourselves. This can<br>be either knowingly or unknowingly: in our thoughts and in our words, in<br>what we have done, and what we have failed to do. When we stand before<br>God on the day of judgement, *we are specifically held accountable* for<br>this sin.<br><br>With this in mind, we can answer the question.<br><br>Every human is affected by original sin, from the moment they are<br>conceived until the moment they die. This means fetuses, infants,<br>adolescents, adults, and the elderly are all similarly stained by<br>original sin. This is what Aquinas meant when he said that all newborns<br>a sinner according to Thomas Aquinas as they are born from the "loins of<br>Adam". Because Adam sinned, we are all affected by original sin.<br><br>However, we are only *held accountable* for the sin we ourselves commit.<br>Here's the point: because we are sinners, we all sin.<br><br>I know, that's far too simplistic. Adam and Eve were in perfect bodies<br>not stained by sin when they sinned. So their sin was far more impactful<br>than ours. Our sin doesn't change the human condition. Our sin is<br>expected because we live in a fallen world in fallen, sinful bodies.<br><br>But (thank God) we have a way to atone for our sin. Jesus' sacrificial<br>death and resurrection pays the penalty for our sin: past, present, and<br>future. We are still subject to our sinful nature, but saved people are<br>no longer responsible to pay for it. Our sin debt has been paid; we were<br>bought with a price.<br><br>And amen and hallelujah for that wonderful truth.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
