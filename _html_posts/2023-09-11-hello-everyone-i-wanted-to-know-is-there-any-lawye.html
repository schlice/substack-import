<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You have to explain what "harassment" is. In Florida, harassment has a<br>specific legal definition.<br><br>> Fl. Stat. 784.048 Stalking; definitions; penalties.--- (1) As used in<br>> this section, the term: (a) "Harass" means **to engage in a course of<br>> conduct directed at a specific person which causes substantial<br>> emotional distress to that person and serves no legitimate purpose**.<br><br>So while the HOA fulfilling its duty may cause you substantial emotional<br>distress, in order to qualify as harassment, what the HOA is doing must<br>serve no legitimate purpose.<br><br>If the HOA can claim that their actions are in furtherance of the<br>execution of their duties, and those duties are found to be lawful, it's<br>unlikely you will prevail in a harassment lawsuit.<br><br>But if you really believe you have a case for harassment, contact a real<br>estate attorney in your jurisdiction who specializes in HOA law. That<br>would be the correct way to not only find out if what you are<br>experiencing is actual harassment under Florida law, but what you can do<br>about it.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer**:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal adveic or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
