<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Air Force One is not routinely escorted by fighter jets while it is<br>flying. Yes, it is closely monitored by Air Traffic Control and by the<br>US military (through NORAD) during its flight, but it does not routinely<br>receive fighter escort, especially over the continental United States.<br><br>It has happened in the past, however. When President Nixon was on his<br>way to Syria for a scheduled appearance in 1974, Syrian fighter jets<br>intercepted Air Force One, which took evasive action.<br><br>As far as I am aware, Air Force One does not have any offensive<br>capabilities. It does have both ECM and flare/chaff packages which can<br>be deployed, but it would likely call for fighter assistance should it<br>run into trouble. This happened on 9/11, when President George W. Bush<br>left Sarasota, Florida. A credible threat was received and AF1 called<br>for fighter escort.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
