<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's actually very, very easy. The tenets of Christianity actually make<br>it so.<br><br>We are directed to \"\'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and<br>with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind\';<br>and, \'Love your neighbor as yourself.\'\" (Luke 10:27).<br><br>We love our neighbors. That doesn't mean liking them unless they believe<br>as you do. That means loving them as they are, faults and all.<br><br>You feel sorry for them sometimes, but you love them just the same. And<br>you *show them* through your own actions how to live as a Christian.<br>Show them compassion. Show them respect. Show them mercy.<br><br>We were provided with the penultimate example of a good life in Jesus<br>Christ. We'll never meet that standard, but that's the gold standard for<br>how to live. Living your life in this way is a far better example of<br>your faith than proselytizing.<br><br>I want people to ask me, "How can you be so upbeat all the time, with<br>all the misery around us?" Because I can show them a better, happier way<br>to live.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
