<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a person is disabled by an injury as a young adult, and is on<br>Medicaid for many years, and then receives life insurance from a parent,<br>is that person legally bound to give some of it back to the state? The<br>state in question is Washington.**<br><br>No. Medicaid is not a loan. It is a program which is purchased with<br>deductions from your paycheck. In other words, you've already paid for<br>it. Even if you get more out of it than you put in, the system was<br>originally designed for this. It's an insurance program (but a really<br>bad one at that), it's not a loan that must be repaid.<br><br>Additionally, life insurance is a disbursement that is not under state<br>control. It's between the life insurance company and the beneficiary.<br>The money received from life insurance does not come with any<br>responsibilities to pay anyone.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
