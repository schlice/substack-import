<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Of course truth matters! Many of us are ignorant and apathetic about<br>truth---but not when it comes to money, medicine, or other tangible<br>items. We care *passionately* about those things. But many people are<br>ignorant and apathetic about truth in morality and religion (we know<br>you're not, because you're taking the time to read this answer). Are<br>they right, or does truth in morality and religion really matter?<br><br>It does really matter. How do we know? First, even though people may<br>claim that truth in morality doesn't matter, they don't really believe<br>that, especially when someone treats *them* immorally. For example, they<br>might claim that lying isn't wrong, but just watch how morally outraged<br>they get when you lie to them (especially if it's about their money!).<br><br>We often hear that "it's the economy, stupid!" But just think about how<br>much better the economy would be if everyone told the truth. There would<br>be no Enrons or Tycos. There would be no scandals or scams. There would<br>be no burdensome government regulations. Of course the economy is<br>important, but it's directly affected by morality! Morality undergirds<br>virtually everything we do. It not only affects us financially, but, in<br>certain circumstances, it also affects us socially, psychologically,<br>spiritually, and even physically.<br><br>A second reason truth in morality matters is because success in life is<br>often dependent on the moral choices a person makes. These include<br>choices regarding sex, marriage, children, drugs, money, business<br>dealings, and so on. Some choices bring prosperity, others result in<br>ruin.<br><br>Third, all laws legislate morality. The only question is, "Whose<br>morality will be legislated?" Think about it. Every law declares one<br>behavior right and its opposite wrong---that's morality. Whose morality<br>should be legislated on issues such as abortion or euthanasia? These are<br>issues that directly impact the lives and health of real people. If it's<br>morally wrong to kill innocent people, shouldn't that truth be<br>legislated? Likewise, whose morality should be legislated on other<br>issues of public policy that may affect your life, health, or finances?<br>The answers we legislate can dramatically affect every citizen's life,<br>liberty, and pursuit of happiness.<br><br>There's no doubt that what we believe to be true about morality directly<br>impacts lives. Did it matter that the United States Supreme Court (as<br>reflected in the 1857 *Dred Scott* decision) believed that blacks were<br>not citizens but the property of their slave owners? Did it matter that<br>the Nazis believed the Jews were inferior to the Aryan race? Does it<br>matter today what we think about the moral status of people in other<br>racial or religious categories? Of course! Truth in morality matters.<br><br>What about truth in religion? That truth can impact us even more<br>profoundly than truth in morality. If the Bible is true, then everyone's<br>eternal destiny can be read from its pages. On the other hand, if the<br>Bible is not true, then many Christians are unwittingly wasting a lot of<br>time, money, and, in some cases, even their lives by preaching<br>Christianity in hostile territories. Either way, truth in religion<br>matters.<br><br>It also matters if some other religion is true. For example, if the<br>Qur'an is true, then I'm in just as much eternal trouble as my<br>non-Christian friends. On the other hand, if the atheists are right,<br>then we might as well lie, cheat, and steal to get what we want because<br>this life is all there is, and there are no consequences in eternity.<br><br>But forget eternity for a minute. Consider the temporal implications of<br>religious teachings around the world. In Saudi Arabia, some<br>schoolchildren are being taught that Jews are pigs and that non-Muslims<br>(infidels) should be killed (while, thankfully, a majority of Muslims do<br>not believe that non-Muslims should be killed, militant Muslims teach<br>that type of Jihad straight from the Qur'an). Is it really true that<br>there's a God up there by the name of Allah who wants Muslims to kill<br>all non-Muslims (which probably includes you)? Does this religious<br>"truth" matter? It does when those kids grow up to fly planes into<br>buildings and blow themselves up in populated areas. Wouldn't it be<br>better to teach them the religious truth that God wants them to love<br>their neighbor?<br><br>The Saudis may be teaching that Jews are pigs, but in our country, by<br>means of a one-sided biology curriculum, we teach kids today that<br>there's really no difference between any human being and a pig. After<br>all, if we're merely the product of blind naturalistic forces---if no<br>deity created us with any special significance---then we are nothing<br>more than pigs with big brains. Does this religious (atheistic) "truth"<br>matter? It does when kids carry out its implications. Instead of good<br>citizens who see people made in the image of God, we are producing<br>criminals who see no meaning or value in human life. Ideas have<br>consequences.<br><br>On the flip side, Mother Teresa helped improve conditions in India by<br>challenging the religious beliefs of many in the Hindu culture. The<br>Hindu belief in karma and reincarnation leads many Hindus to ignore the<br>cries of the suffering. Why? Because they believe that those who suffer<br>deserve their plight for doing something wrong in a previous life. So,<br>if you help suffering people, you are interfering with their karma.<br>Mother Teresa taught Hindus in India the Christian principles of caring<br>for the poor and suffering. Does that religious idea matter? Ask the<br>millions whose lives she touched. Does the religious teaching of karma<br>matter? Ask the millions still suffering.<br><br>The bottom line is this: regardless of what the real truth is concerning<br>religion and morality, our lives are greatly affected by it today and<br>perhaps even in eternity. Those who cavalierly say, "So what? Who cares<br>about truth in morality and religion?" are ignoring reality and are<br>blindly skating on thin ice. We owe it to ourselves and others to find<br>the real truth, and then act on it.<br><br>So of course the real truth matters to Christians. We literally stake<br>our eternity on it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
