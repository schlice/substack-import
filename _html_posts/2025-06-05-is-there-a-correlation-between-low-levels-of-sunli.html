<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, in fact there is a correlation.<br><br>The low levels of sunlight results in a vitamin D deficiency, since<br>humans generate vitamin D when the skin is exposed to sunlight. Vitamin<br>D is known to be neuroprotective, and there has been a positive<br>correlation between people who have vitamin D deficiency and MS.<br><br>Even more tightly defined is people who grew up above 40° latitude<br>(where the sun's rays arrive at a greater angle). They have a higher<br>incidence of MS than people who grew up below 40° latitude. And we<br>believe the reason is the same: lower angle of sunlight produces less<br>vitamin D than higher.<br><br>Remember, this is just a correlation; this is not a causation (i.e. MS<br>is not caused by vitamin D deficiency, but it could be an exacerbating<br>factor)<br><br>The best way to potentially mitigate this problem would be to develop<br>appropriate levels of vitamin D as observed in the blood, but we don't<br>have that information yet. We do not know what an appropriate level of<br>vitamin D is for anyone, so work with your doctor on what is safe to<br>take.<br><br>Or if you can, try to get at least 15 minutes of sun a day, but be<br>careful to not overstay your welcome, especially in the hot summer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
