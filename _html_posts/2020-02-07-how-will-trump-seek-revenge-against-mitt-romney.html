<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How will Trump seek revenge against Mitt Romney?<br><br>No revenge needed. Romney (as with the majority of the current crop of<br>Democrats in Washington) has torpedoed himself. He stands alone. Romney<br>voted in Romney's perceived best interest. He didn't work to convince<br>any of his fellow Republicans to vote his way. He didn't seek advice<br>from any of his fellow Republicans. Romney "sought his own counsel."<br><br>The rest is up to the people of Utah.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
