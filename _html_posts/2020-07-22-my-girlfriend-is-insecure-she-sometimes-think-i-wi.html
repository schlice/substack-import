<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My girlfriend is insecure. She sometimes think I will cheat on her or<br>leave her for someone who she thinks is "better" Should I ask her is<br>there anything bothering her or is there anything I could do to help her<br>feel better?**<br><br>YES!!! A MILLION TIMES YES!!!<br><br>Communication is absolutely key in any relationship.<br><br>If she confides in you, make it your personal mission in life to never<br>do what it is that bothers her. Seriously. Tape it up on your bathroom<br>mirror. Set it to your home screen on your phone. Whatever you need to<br>do to remind yourself to not do what bothers her.<br><br>Then continue to talk to her about it. Tell her about the times you were<br>confronted with whatever she is worried about, and then tell her what<br>you thought and what you did. And keep doing this until she gets tired<br>of hearing it.<br><br>Open and honest communication is vital for a healthy relationship.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
