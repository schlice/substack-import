We are 'cradle<br>Catholics' & don't engage at the door. How do we stop them?**<br><br>Short answer: you can't.<br><br>Unless you can get off of their mailing list somehow, they can send you<br>junk mail. The problem with the mail system is that the sender has paid<br>the Post Office to send material to you, so the Post Office will ensure<br>that their mail gets to you.<br><br>Literally, your best option is to simply trash the junk mail.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
