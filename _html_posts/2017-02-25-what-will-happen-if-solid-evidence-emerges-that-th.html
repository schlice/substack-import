<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This whole Russia thing has been blown so far out of proportion, that<br>it's bordering on the ridiculous.<br><br>Let's look at facts and ignore hyperbole.<br><br>- What was done, if anything? If anything at all was done, someone<br>  in the RNC (not likely Trump or Pence themseleves) colluded with<br>  Russia \*somehow\* and Russian hackers exposed e-mails from a private<br>  organization (the DNC) and gave them to WikiLeaks. The RNC staffer may<br>  have known that the Russians were attempting to hack the DNC. The<br>  staffer may have asked the Russians to get hackers to hack the DNC and<br>  give the details to WikiLeaks. The staffer may have even paid for<br>  those services.<br>- Is this a crime? It depends on how the information was obtained.<br>  We're assuming that the RNC didn't actually gain access to the data<br>  themselves, but simply asked the Russians to do it for them. The level<br>  of collusion is also unknown. So the crime, if any, was "conspiracy to<br>  commit computer fraud." The level of evidence required to prove this<br>  crime is quite high, and I'm certain that the FBI does not possess<br>  such evidence.<br>- **Does this rise to the level of "high crimes and misdemeanors"<br>  specified in the Constitution for impeachment?** It does not. First of<br>  all, it's highly unlikely that Trump or Pence were even personally<br>  involved, even if it did happen. Second, there is no affirmative "duty<br>  to report" a crime, so by not saying anything, *even if they knew,*<br>  they still did noting wrong.<br>- Did anyone "hack the election?" This is just media hyperbole. Was<br>  anyone claiming that voting machines were tampered with by the<br>  Russians? No. Was anyone claiming that the Russians participated in<br>  voter suppression? No. Was anyone claiming that election results, vote<br>  counts, or ballot tallies were tampered with? No. There was no<br>  "election tampering" as we know it. There was definitely an<br>  information campaign which included WikiLeaks leaking e-mails from the<br>  DNC, a private organization. No government tampering is even alleged.<br>  So was the election "hacked?" Not even close. In fact, both<br>  organizations engage in information campaigns, sometimes including<br>  leaked information, just usually not leaked to WikiLeaks.<br><br>It is for these reasons that I don't see how a charge rising to the<br>level of "high crimes and misdemeanors" could even be levied against the<br>President or Vice President.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
