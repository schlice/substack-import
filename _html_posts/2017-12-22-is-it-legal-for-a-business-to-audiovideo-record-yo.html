<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it legal for a business to audio/video record you in a lobby?<br><br>While some states have different rules regarding video recording, in the<br>majority of locations, the answer is mostly yes. The facility can<br>video record you; but laws are still wildly different regarding<br>audio recording.<br><br>For the purpose of the remainder of this answer, we will assume that you<br>are talking about a building in the United States.<br><br>If you are referring to a private or government building which is open<br>to the public, the owner of the building can pretty much record using<br>video in any publicly-accessible area of the building (including the<br>lobby) with the exception of areas which have an implied right of<br>privacy (i.e. bathrooms, locker rooms, changing rooms, etc). The owner<br>can use that video for whatever lawful purpose they want, such as<br>prevention of theft or vandalism, or to protect against trespassing.<br>Some states will require that a sign be posted indicating that video<br>recording is being used, others do not. You would see that sign on the<br>outer door, and entrance into the building signifies your understanding<br>of and agreement to that recording.<br><br>Audio recordings are a completely different story. In most states, audio<br>recordings still follow the laws regarding consent to recording that<br>were established with telephone wiretapping laws, and states have<br>varying laws regarding what level of consent is required of the<br>participants in a recorded audio conversation before that recording can<br>be used as evidence in court. It is for this reason that most<br>surveillance cameras in most buildings will only record video, and not<br>audio.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
