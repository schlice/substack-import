<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In Mueller\'s report, he said he wouldn\'t exonerate Trump and pointed<br>to the Justice Department guidance that a President couldn\'t be<br>indicted while in office as a reason for not reaching a conclusion.<br>Should Trump be indicted after leaving t/office?**<br><br>This is an incorrect statement.<br><br>1.  Mueller actually stated in his report, "while this report does not<br>    conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not<br>    exonerate him.\" In other words, Mueller declined to make a<br>    judgement. Mueller had three choices: (1) exonerate Trump; (2)<br>    declare that there was not enough evidence to indict Trump on<br>    obstruction; or (3) refuse to take a position. In this case, option<br>    2 is the best course of action, as AG Barr pointed out, because it<br>    would be impossible to meet the legal standard of obstruction of<br>    justice beyond a reasonable doubt. Additionally, Mueller laid out<br>    counterevidence for every single allegation of obstructive behavior<br>    by the President, which would make prosecution virtually impossible.<br>    But Mueller chose option 3 instead. Why? Because he knew he couldn't<br>    meet the legal standard for obstruction (so the right thing to do<br>    would have been to declare the same), so he "punted." Doing so<br>    leaves the door open for impeachment, and also smearing the AG for<br>    making a decision, since the AG was appointed by the President.<br>    Spreading the notion that the AG is the President's lap dog is the<br>    perfect way to fan the flames for impeachment.<br>2.  It was not Mueller who stated that Trump would have been indicted<br>    were it not for DOJ guidance. It was "hundreds of ex-DOJ<br>    prosecutors" in an open letter posted online (which CNN and every<br>    other mainstream media outlet picked up and ran). Mueller and Barr<br>    both emphatically stated that DOJ guidance did not factor into the<br>    decisions that either of them reached.\<br>    \<br>    Also, if you still want to indict Trump for obstruction of justice,<br>    if the DOJ policy is held to be true, the statute of limitations<br>    will be tolled during the period of time when you *cannot* indict<br>    someone. The statute of limitations would only run during the period<br>    of time that the defendant is indictable. Therefore, this charge<br>    will wait until the President leaves office. Then, if you think you<br>    have enough evidence, you can easily indict him. So the other false<br>    headline that the media is spouting, that Trump is merely trying to<br>    run out the statute of limitations, is ludicrous. You can't run out<br>    the statute of limitations while at the same time being unable to<br>    indict the target of the investigation. If you *can* indict a<br>    sitting President, you should have the courage to state that there<br>    is enough evidence to do so. But Mueller failed to do so, and the AG<br>    is siding with his Special Counsel.<br><br>The only logical course of action is for Congress to act if they feel<br>that impeachment is the way to go.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
