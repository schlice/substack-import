<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Thank you for your comments and your respectful dialog. This is how a<br>proper debate should be held. Other Quora users, take note.<br><br>I don\'t want to belabor the point of 12-step programs, but they are<br>founded on the very real belief that addiction is an illness, and that<br>we are powerless over it. Without such a belief, the very foundation of<br>any real recovery disappears.<br><br>But about your point regarding our national obsession with people who<br>use drugs, I agree. The two issues (whether or not addiction is a<br>disease and how the nation views addicts), however, are most definitely<br>linked. We can\'t change that national obsession until we get the<br>medical community to admit that addiction is a disease. Once they do so,<br>we can separate the user from the dealer. The user is a<br>patient. The dealer is a criminal. Under our current system, both<br>are criminals, which is wrong.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/If-something-is-of-no-harm-to-others-and-the-person-doing-it-should-it-be-legal-Are-psychedelics-associated-with-belief-and-spiritual-rights/answer/Edward-Jameson<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
