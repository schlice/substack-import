<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How can we control immigration?<br><br>The inscription on the base of the Statue of Liberty reads:<br><br>> *Give me your tired, your poor\<br>> Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\<br>> The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\<br>> Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me.\<br>> I lift my lamp beside the Golden Door!*<br>><br>> \- Emma Lazarus, *The New Colossus*<br><br>The poem says two things you must note:<br><br>- We want immigrants of all kinds<br>- They must enter through the Golden Door.<br><br>The symbolism of a Golden Door is critically important to understanding<br>how to control immigration. The door symbolically implies *control* to<br>the immigration process. We are the keepers of the door. We can open it<br>wide. We can shut it partially, or we can close it completely. The guest<br>entering the door does not have a say on how wide the door is opened, or<br>whether or not it is open at all. It is entirely though our generosity<br>as a nation that the door is open *at all*.<br><br>So how do you control immigration? You force everyone to enter through<br>the "Golden Door."<br><br>Seems simple, but how do you do that?<br><br>It's a combination of things:<br><br>- Physical border security<br>- Strict border security policies<br>- Good foreign relations<br>- Efficient immigration processes<br><br>You must have physical border security. The memes are funny. You know,<br>the ones that screech that a billion dollar wall can be defeated by a<br>ten dollar ladder. We're not looking at defeating single people with<br>ladders, otherwise the wall would be 100 feet tall. We're looking at<br>making it harder for someone smuggling illegal guns or illegal drugs or<br>large groups of illegal immigrants across that border, and a wall will<br>most certainly slow those criminals down.<br><br>Good foreign relations are extremely important as we attempt to vet<br>incoming legal immigrants. We need information from their home country.<br>You know, like the basics: Is this person a terrorist? Have they done<br>terrorist-y things? How many mass shootings have they committed? You<br>know, the basics. You might be surprised that many countries do not<br>readily provide this information, and many other countries do not<br>provide this information in a timely manner. Much of the source of<br>elongated times when processing immigrants into the US is related to how<br>quickly the home country provides us with background information on the<br>immigrant.<br><br>Cleaning house is also crucial. We know we have a backlog, but we<br>knocked it out. It takes focus, a dedicated team to do it, and funding.<br>We've not had at least one of those (we occasionally don't have several<br>of those) all together in the last 40 years, and it has caused massive<br>backlogs in our immigration system. A dedicated effort to process that<br>backlog and then a comprehensive plan to streamline the process is<br>required.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
