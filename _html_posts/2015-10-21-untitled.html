<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [What you\'ve stated has no bearing on the fact that any<br>attempt to restrict handgun *ownership* (which *Heller* and<br>*McDonald* already addressed and said is legal, even if only in the<br>home) to those who can take a training course and pass a test would be<br>unconstitutional.\<br>\<br>States already have laws which restrict the concealed carry of handguns<br>to those who are properly trained and vetted, and this is not<br>unconstitutional. Some states have \"open-carry\" laws which allow<br>anyone who has the right to own a firearm (which is almost everyone) to<br>carry it anywhere out in the open (not concealed). This also does not<br>constitute an ownership restriction as implied by the Second Amendment.\<br>\<br>You can\'t apply the same rules to possession and ownership that you<br>apply to carry outside the home. The state has a compelling interest in<br>regulating carry of weapons. The state cannot similarly regulate<br>ownership.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-do-British-police-officers-manage-to-stop-knife-wielding-suspects-safely-when-they-dont-carry-firearms-A-knife-wielding-suspect-is-likely-to-be-shot-by-North-American-police/answer/Samuel-Agboola<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
