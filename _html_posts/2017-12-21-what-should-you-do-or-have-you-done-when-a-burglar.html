<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The key is to prepare for this type of thing before someone is actually<br>in your house. Defense-in-depth is what you're going for. I've already<br>written a post on defending your home; if I find it, I'll link it.<br><br>But you spoke about a burglar in the house. What you will need is a<br>safe room. You've probably seen movies like *Panic Room* with Jodie<br>Foster; you probably don't need to go that crazy. Just find a closet<br>that has power and set it up as your safe room. At the least, make sure<br>it has a lock on it that you can lock from the inside. In there, you<br>should put a cell phone that works, and a charger for that phone. It<br>doesn't need to have a cellular plan active on it; you can call 911 from<br>any cell phone whether or not it has a contract on it, so long as it can<br>connect to the network. You can optionally have some form of personal<br>defense in there, be it a baseball bat or a gun, your choice.<br><br>If someone breaks into your home, go straight to your safe room and lock<br>the door. Call 911 from inside your safe room. Wait for the police to<br>arrive.<br><br>If you hear the burglars attempt to enter your safe room, yell to them:<br>"Do not come in here! I have a gun and I'm on the phone with the<br>police!" Yell this whether you have a gun or not. Chances are, the<br>burglar won't take the chance on entering the closet.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
