<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The thought problem goes like this:<br><br>*If Hitler, on his death bed, mere moments before he died, had a true<br>epiphany and was truly repentant for what he had done and asked God for<br>forgiveness, would he be saved? Would he be in Heaven right now?*<br><br>As you work through the thought problem, you may say, "Hitler was so bad<br>during his life, he killed so many (or so many died at his command) that<br>there is no way he could be saved."<br><br>But then you ask, what makes someone "saved?" When is someone truly<br>saved? At what point?<br><br>Christian theology teaches that someone who truly repents and accepts<br>Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, and asks for forgiveness and<br>salvation, will have that granted, right then and there.<br><br>Even Hitler, on his deathbed, could have asked for salvation, and if he<br>was truly repentant, it would have been given to him. Remember,<br>salvation is a gift. Gifts are not given with strings attached. Gifts<br>are offered without request by the receiver. The gift of salvation has<br>already been bought and paid for through Christ's death and<br>resurrection. All you have to do is take it.<br><br>But don't wait too long. The gift offer may never expire, but I'd hate<br>for you to be the person who waits too long to accept the gift. If<br>you're already dead, you're going to have a hard time accepting that<br>gift.<br><br>What if you are offered the gift, reject it, but later come to your<br>senses and realize you were wrong about what that gift actually meant,<br>or what it could mean for your life or your future? Will you still be<br>saved? Again, we teach that yes, you can be, if you have truly changed<br>in your heart. But what if you live your life *knowing that the gift is<br>there, ready to be accepted,* you know what it means and what it will do<br>for you, and you believe it to be true, and you then *willingly*<br>*reject* it? How are you living your life at that point? Are you living<br>like a person who is saved? Do you think this is what God had in mind<br>when He gave you free will?<br><br>So while it's not a "one-time offer," once you *know* that the gift is<br>there and what it means and you *choose* not to accept it, aren't you<br>living your life knowing that salvation is being offered to you and you<br>are consciously turning your back on it, choosing to not accept it? If<br>you were giving someone a gift and they chose to not accept your gift,<br>how would that make you feel? Do you think God feels any better about<br>your conscious decision? Do you think He does not *grieve* for you? He<br>*wants* this for you, but He has also bestowed free will on you. He<br>allows you to make your own decisions, including whether or not to<br>accept His gift of salvation, and then live like a person who has been<br>saved.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
