<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Part of being a responsible citizen means doing your "civic duty."<br><br>When we live in a community, we all know we have rights. We have our<br>rights to live (mostly) free from government intrusion in our lives.<br>Government, on the other hand, provides services (paid for by our taxes)<br>that make it possible for us to live together in communities. These<br>services include, but are not limited to, fire, police, hospitals,<br>roads, infrastructure (water, gas, sewer), recreation areas, etc.<br><br>The Constitution says that people have the right to a jury of their<br>peers. As we know, with every right, there is a requisite<br>responsibility. If we have a right to a jury of our peers, we have a<br>responsibility as "peers" to staff that jury. It is up to us, as<br>citizens, to be the "peers" that make the system work. We cannot have a<br>right to a trial by a jury of our peers if we do not shoulder the<br>requisite responsibility to be the peers.<br><br>In my community, they attempt to make it as fair and equitable as<br>possible. They randomly select the jury pool from driver license rolls<br>and other demographic information. We have what's called the "one day,<br>one trial" system. You can only be called once per calendar year. If you<br>are called and you sit in the jury room but are never impaneled into a<br>jury, you have fulfilled your civic duty by being available for the<br>pool. If you are selected for be part of the pool of candidates for a<br>jury but are not selected to sit on that jury (as a primary or an<br>alternate), you have fulfilled your civic duty. If you are asked to<br>leave the jury during attorney pre-trial questioning, you have fulfilled<br>your civic duty. If you sit for an entire trial, you clearly have<br>fulfilled your duty.<br><br>The point is that arriving at court and being available to be one of the<br>"peers" spoken of in the Constitution is part of the "requirement" that<br>speaks to the "right" to have a trial by jury of your peers. If we are<br>to live in a community, and if we are to make the Constitution work for<br>everyone, we must fulfill our civic duty to staff that system when<br>needed. Responsible citizens fulfill their civic duty when they are<br>called to do so.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
