<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Anyone in the United States who is authorized to own a firearm is<br>Federally authorized to own an automatic weapon. However, states have<br>many varied restrictions on whether or not state residents may own,<br>possess, or use, automatic weapons.**<br><br>There is a popular misconception that you need all sorts of Federal<br>Firearms Licenses and certifications, and that civilians can't own them,<br>but that is simply not true.<br><br>Automatic weapons are classified under the National Firearms Act<br>(colloquially called "NFA weapons"), and there are generally three ways<br>to own one: as an individual, through a gun trust, or as part of a<br>Limited Liability Corporation (LLC). For the purpose of this answer,<br>we'll stick to the individual ownership method.<br><br>Legal possession of an NFA weapon requires transfer of that weapon<br>from one legal owner to another. The weapon must be registered with the<br>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE). Private<br>owners wishing to purchase an NFA item must obtain approval from the<br>BATFE, pass an extensive background check (which includes a photograph<br>and fingerprints), ensure the firearm is fully registered, receive BATFE<br>written permission before moving the firearm across state lines, and pay<br>a \$200 tax. BATFE will provide you with a "tax stamp" which shows the<br>tax was paid, and that stamp gets affixed to the approved paperwork.<br>Additionally, BATFE can inspect your firearm at any time, and the<br>paperwork approving the firearm must be with it. BATFE mandates safe<br>storage of automatic weapons, and failing to keep that weapon in its<br>safe storage can net you big fines and possibly jail time.<br><br>Since no new automatic weapons which have been manufactured after May<br>19, 1986 can be registered to civilians, there is an artificially low<br>quantity of them, which makes their price artificially high. For<br>example, a transferrable M-16 (fully automatic) will run anywhere<br>between \$11,000 and \$18,000, while the same weapon, brand new, sold to<br>law enforcement or the military, retails for between \$600 and \$1000.<br><br>As I mentioned, there are state restrictions on fully automatic weapons,<br>as well as additional licensing and approval requirements, and these<br>restrictions are many and varied.<br><br>However, the short answer is that anyone who can own a firearm legally<br>can also own a fully automatic weapon. It's not cheap, but it is doable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
