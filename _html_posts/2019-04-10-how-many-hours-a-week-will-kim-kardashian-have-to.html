<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>From the linked *Vogue* article, which I read so you don't have to:<br><br>> You might be wondering: How does someone study law if they haven't<br>> finished college? Turns out, four U.S. states, including California,<br>> offer another path to passing the bar---what is known as "reading the<br>> law," or apprenticing with a practicing lawyer or judge.<br><br>Kim must do 18 hours a week of supervised study, which she is<br>currently doing with lawyers Jessica Jackson and Erin Haney, as part of<br>a four year apprenticeship with their law firm. Sometime this summer,<br>she'll take what's known as the "mini bar," which if she passes will be<br>enough to allow her to continue her studies.<br><br>She will continue with this apprenticeship, and hopefully take the bar<br>in 2022.<br><br>California is one of four states which allows people to apprentice<br>instead of attending law school.<br><br>*(edited, as the linked Vogue article is pretty scant on details. Needed<br>CNN and some others to clarify the specifics about CA's alternate bar<br>procedures).*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
