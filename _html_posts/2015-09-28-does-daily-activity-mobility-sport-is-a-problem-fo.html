<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [For the majority of MS patients, problems with movement<br>are not quite as common as some other symptoms like fatigue. Known as<br>\"MS Lassitude,\" fatigue hits about 80% of people with MS. Movement<br>issues can actually be exacerbated with fatigue.\<br>\<br>Walking (gait) issues are the most frequently reported movement issues<br>with MS. There are several factors that contribute to gait issues,<br>including weakness, spasticity, loss of balance, sensory deficit and<br>fatigue.\<br>\<br>Walking issues can be helped by physical therapy, assistive therapy<br>(such as electromuscular stimulation to help combat foot drop) and<br>medications such as Ampyra. Ampyra was the first drug designed<br>specifically to treat a symptom of MS.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
