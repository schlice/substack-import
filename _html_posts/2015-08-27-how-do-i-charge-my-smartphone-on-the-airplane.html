<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Four ways:\<br>]<br><br>- Fly in Business or First Class, or on an airline that has power ports<br>  at each seat. Check with<br>  [SeatGuru(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=004fee&url=http://www.seatguru.com){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="seatguru.com"}]{.qlink_container} to see if your airline<br>  and your airframe has power ports to which you can connect.<br>- Use an external battery pack. There are literally a bzillion on the<br>  market (yes, it is a real number, as it was used in *Toy Story*, which<br>  makes it real by default).<br>- Use a solar powered charger and hope that you get enough sunlight in<br>  your window seat to power it. Chargers from<br>  [GOALZERO(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2a1781&url=http://www.goalzero.com){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="goalzero.com"}]{.qlink_container} should do the trick, but<br>  there are many different kinds.<br>- Use your laptop as a charger. Most modern day laptops have some USB<br>  ports that can be set to continuously deliver 5V power *even when the<br>  laptop is off.* My Lenovo ThinkPad has this feature. The USB port is<br>  yellow to indicate the \"always-on\" port.<br><br>There\'s probably even more creative ways to charge your phone, but this<br>is all I can think of at the moment.\<br>\<br>(EDIT) Some older lavatories on aircraft had 110V sockets to power<br>electric razors and toothbrushes. You might be able to suck a tiny bit<br>of juice out of there in the time you\'re in the lav. With a fast<br>charger, you might get yourself 5-10% of battery charge this way.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
