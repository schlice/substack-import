<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it illegal to use my old Iowa driver\'s licenses to claim instate<br>tuition, even though I\'ve been living in Minnesota for 6 months?**<br><br>The answer is "it depends."<br><br>It depends on which state is your state of residence, of which you can<br>only have one.<br><br>You can own property in more than one state, and you can live in more<br>than one state throughout the course of a year, but which state you<br>claim as your state of residence is well established.<br><br>You will file a tax return under one state as a resident, and the other<br>state as a non-resident. You can claim a state as your state of<br>residence, but then your other state is not your state of residence.<br><br>In this case, you may have been living in Minnesota for 6 months (maybe<br>for school or for work, or just for fun), but that doesn't automatically<br>make you a resident of the state of Minnesota. Unless you "abandoned" or<br>"moved out" of Iowa, or you intended to change your state of residence<br>from Iowa to Minnesota, you're still a resident of the state of Iowa.<br><br>You will remain a resident until you "abandon" or "give up" your<br>residency in Iowa in order to live in Minnesota permanently. If you<br>earned money in Minnesota, you may have to file a non-resident tax<br>return in Minnesota as well as a resident tax return in Iowa, but your<br>state of residency does not change until you take positive steps to<br>change it, such as "moving out" of Iowa and selling your property in<br>Iowa. If you have done *this*, there is a case to be made that you are<br>*de facto* no longer a state resident of Iowa, but are in fact a<br>resident of Minnesota, and maintaining an active Iowa driver's license<br>may be unlawful under Minnesota state rules.<br><br>If you're only temporarily in Minnesota, but you intend Iowa to be your<br>state of legal residence, then that remains so. If you have sold all<br>your property in Iowa and moved all of your belongings out of the state,<br>it is clear that you have "abandoned" your residency in Iowa and have<br>"moved" to Minnesota.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
