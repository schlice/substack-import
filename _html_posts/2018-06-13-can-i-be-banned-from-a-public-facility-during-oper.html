Private facilities which are open to the pubic are places like<br>restaurants and coffee shops.<br><br>The manager can ask anyone to leave for any non-protected reason<br>(protected reasons would be because of your race, sex, religion,<br>national origin, or in some jurisdictions, sexual orientation). The<br>management must apply this rule equally to all customers, whatever it<br>is.<br><br>For example, if the manager bans all tank tops, then management must<br>equally ban all people who wear tank tops.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
