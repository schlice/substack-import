<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There are definitely limitations on free speech. You<br>can\'t shout \"Fire!\" in a crowded movie theater if there is no fire<br>(the classic example). You can\'t incite a riot. You also can\'t lie<br>about someone (this is a separate crime called slander). So there are<br>limitations on free speech.\<br>\<br>Inciting a riot is one thing. Inciting hatred is another thing<br>altogether. Under the Constitution, it is legal to incite hatred. If I<br>speak and it causes you to hate someone else, that\'s legal. If I speak<br>and it causes people to inflict injury on others, that\'s illegal.\<br>\<br>In 1969, the Supreme Court developed the \"imminent danger\" test in the<br>[[*Brandenburg v.<br>Ohio*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=40da47&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} case that states, in<br>part, \"the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do<br>not permit a state to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force,<br>or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting<br>imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such<br>action.\" This theory has been tested many times, most recently in 2011<br>in Snyder v. Phelps, where hate speech was again protected because it<br>did not immediately incite dangerous or lawless action.\<br>\<br>The Internet is also being tested as to how the Constitution applies to<br>speech there. But regardless, the speech has to incite \"imminent<br>lawless action\" in order to be a 1A violation, which, while<br>hate-filled, Islamic clerics do not do. Therefore, their speech is<br>protected under 1A.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
