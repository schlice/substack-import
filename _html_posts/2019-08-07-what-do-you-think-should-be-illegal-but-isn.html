<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What is illegal but should not be?<br><br>In some states, riding a motorcycle without a helmet.<br><br>Look, I get the controversy over seatbelts. Yes, seatbelts save lives,<br>and if I want to kill myself, that's my own business. However, seatbelts<br>should be mandatory for those in the front seat. The seatbelt keeps the<br>driver in his seat and able to continue to control the vehicle, and<br>keeps the passenger from becoming a very distracting in-car missile.<br><br>But a motorcycle helmet? It's a law designed to protect me from me, and<br>that's not a good basis for a law.<br><br>And if you're going so fast that not wearing a helmet in a crash will<br>kill you (i.e. highway speed), that helmet's not going to protect you<br>anyway. It's just a case so they can identify you using dental records,<br>once they locate your head (which will still be strapped firmly inside<br>your helmet, although somewhat disconnected from the rest of your body).<br>There is some degree of argument surrounding your disability, in a<br>slower-speed crash, becoming a public burden, but we still have private<br>health insurance in this country as well as Medicare, and we have<br>EMTALA, and we understand the costs associated with that as well, so<br>such public burden will be limited.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
