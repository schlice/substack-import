<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If it\'s legal to *walk* away from a police officer, it\'s legal to<br>*run* away from that officer. If you\'re not being detained (or even<br>spoken to), the law doesn\'t care what speed you move.<br><br>That all changes depending on whether or not the officer spoke to you<br>first.<br><br>I know in your example you said you ran the second you saw the police.<br>But if the police said, "Hey, I need to talk to you," and then you<br>ran, now we have a problem.<br><br>And if the police were looking for someone who matched your description,<br>if you start running, even if you are totally innocent, you just shined<br>a huge spotlight on yourself, basically saying, "Hey! Here I am!" Expect<br>lots of attention.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
