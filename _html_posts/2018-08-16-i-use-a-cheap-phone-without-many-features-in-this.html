<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I use a cheap phone without many features in this modern world of<br>technology. Is it clever to invest my money in the latest expensive<br>smart phone or should I invest in something productive?**<br><br>The answer, of course, is "it depends."<br><br>Whether or not you need the "many features" in the latest high-end<br>smartphone is entirely up to you.<br><br>So what are those features?<br><br>- Near professional-quality camera<br>- Bright display with very high resolution<br>- Long battery life<br>- Most modern, up-to-date operating system<br><br>Smartphones are miniature computers, and the high-end models are priced<br>almost as much as a laptop computer. Considering that you use the device<br>every day, usually many times per day, the cost is at least somewhat<br>justified.<br><br>People who use their smartphones as their *primary content delivery<br>device* will tend towards a higher end device. These people will be<br>doing *nearly everything* with their smartphones. This includes, but<br>is by no means limited to:<br><br>- Banking<br>- Health management<br>- Email / messaging<br>- Social<br>- Shopping<br>- Photography<br>- Music<br>- Mobile payments (NFC, MST \for Samsung\)<br>- Consuming content (YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, etc)<br>- Two-factor authorization<br>- Work-related functions separate from the above<br><br>If this is the primary device you use to access this content on a<br>day-to-day basis, throughout the day, then a higher-end device may be<br>for you. You'll want to do all of those things in a snappy device which<br>multi-tasks as quickly as you do, and looks beautiful while doing it.<br><br>The extent to which you do those things (and many more) will determine<br>what type of phone you should get. Do you consume content on your<br>device, or do you have cable or satellite only? Do you use social media,<br>or do you only use SMS messaging with your friends? Do you spend more<br>time making voice calls than sending text messages?<br><br>You see, it is your usage which determines what kind of device you would<br>like to spend money on. And again, don't forget that you are literally<br>using the device every day, multiple times a day. Can you say the same<br>for your PC? Your TV? Your stereo equipment? Yet you have no problem<br>shelling out similar amounts of money for those devices and their<br>associated accouterments, and you don't use them *nearly* as much as you<br>use your phone. If you finance your phone and amortize the payments over<br>two years, you're usually paying about \$30 a month. You are paying<br>*literally \$1 a day* for a device that you use multiple times a day.<br>Whether or not that is worth it is up to you.<br><br>*Can you get by with a budget smartphone?* The answer to that question<br>is enirely up to you. If you can get by (and you don't feel limited by)<br>using a budget smartphone, then you should absolutely do so. If that<br>Tracfone flip phone works for you, then go for it.<br><br>But here's something else to consider: a middle ground. *Midrange*<br>smartphones have been improving in quality by leaps and bounds. For<br>*literally* half the price of a top-tier smartphone, you can get a<br>[[Huawei Mate 10<br>Pro](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=869ec0&url=https://smile.amazon.com/Huawei-Unlocked-Processor-Camera-Resistant/dp/B078T3D547){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container} (it's only \$549, where the<br>Apple iPhone X is currently \$1000), and it's *really good*. Its specs<br>compare quite favorably to top-tier phones. I mean, it's got Leica<br>camera lenses built in, a dual camera setup on the back, fingerprint<br>sensor, all-screen mostly bezel-less front, and it's actually quite<br>snappy. Its quick-charge technology is actually the fastest in the<br>industry. It will charge its 4000 mAh battery (biggest in the<br>industry in a consumer-grade device) in about 20 minutes.<br><br>There is plenty to consider here, but the choice is literally up to you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
