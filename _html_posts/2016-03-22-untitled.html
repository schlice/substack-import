<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I wonder in how many jurisdictions a certification such as a Red Cross<br>CPR/First Aid course (which is pretty common; we give it to our Boy<br>Scouts routinely) legally creates a duty to assist, and what the<br>limitations to that duty are. Are you aware?<br><br>My employer gave us CPR/FA/AED training when we got AEDs in the<br>building, so we\'d have some trained people around on a regular basis. I<br>wonder if that created an affirmative duty to assist. Not like I<br>wouldn\'t help anyway. I\'m just curious.<br><br>BTW, the new Resusci-Annies are really cool; they work with the AED as<br>well and indicate when you got the pad placement correct.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Do-I-have-a-legal-obligation-to-help-someone-in-medical-distress/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
