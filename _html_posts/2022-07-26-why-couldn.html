<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because while individual Justices may have liked the *outcome* of the<br>case (i.e. what it provided), they didn't like the *Constitutionality*<br>of how it did what it did.<br><br>While it provided a result they may have liked, it did it in a wholly<br>unconstitutional way.<br><br>That's why it couldn't be saved. The Court cannot keep a decision on the<br>books because they like the outcome. They can only keep a decision on<br>the books if it is Constitutional. And *Roe* was not constitutional<br>because it was based on a "Constitutional right" which did not actually<br>exist in the Constitution.<br><br>The *right* people to make abortion legal are legislators at the state<br>or federal level, not the courts.<br><br>The Court was right to overturn *Roe*, not because abortion is bad, but<br>because the courts are not the place to create law. It's up to lawmakers<br>to make law. And in many states, they have done just that. Abortion is<br>legal in many states. Many other states have placed *limits* on<br>abortion, and a few states have banned abortions completely.<br><br>Abortion is an issue to be decided by the states. If the people in that<br>state want abortion, they will vote in legislators who will allow it in<br>their state. Abortion is not an issue to be decided by the courts.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why couldn\'t Justice Roberts save Roe v. Wade?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
