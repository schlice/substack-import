<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with any legal question, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>The law in NC prohibits HOAs from banning solar panels outright. **It<br>does, however, allow HOAs to control the *placement* of solar<br>panels.**<br><br>The relevant NC law, updated in 2007:<br><br>> Article 8 of Chapter 160A of the General Statutes is amended by adding<br>> a new section to read:<br>><br>> \"*§ 160A-201. Limitations on regulating solar collectors.*<br>><br>> *(a)* *Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, no city<br>> ordinance shall prohibit, or have the effect of prohibiting, the<br>> installation of a solar collector that gathers solar radiation as a<br>> substitute for traditional energy for water heating, active space<br>> heating and cooling, passive heating, or generating electricity for a<br>> detached single-family residence, and no person shall be denied<br>> permission by a city to install a solar collector that gathers solar<br>> radiation as a substitute for traditional energy for water heating,<br>> active space heating and cooling, passive heating, or generating<br>> electricity for a detached single-family residence.*<br>><br>> *(b)* *This section does not prohibit an ordinance regulating the<br>> location or screening of solar collectors as described in subsection<br>> (a) of this section, provided the ordinance does not have the effect<br>> of preventing the reasonable use of a solar collector for a detached<br>> single-family residence.*<br>><br>> *(c)* *This section does not prohibit an ordinance that would prohibit<br>> the location of solar collectors as described in subsection (a) of<br>> this section that are visible by a person on the ground:*<br>><br>> *(1)* *On the façade of a structure that faces areas open to common or<br>> public access;*<br>><br>> *(2)* *On a roof surface that slopes downward toward the same areas<br>> open to common or public access that the façade of the structure<br>> faces; or*<br>><br>> *(3)* *Within the area set off by a line running across the façade of<br>> the structure extending to the property boundaries on either side of<br>> the façade, and those areas of common or public access faced by the<br>> structure.*<br>><br>> *(d)* *In any civil action arising under this section, the court may<br>> award costs and reasonable attorneys\' fees to the prevailing<br>> party.*\"<br><br>So the law is clear: a homeowner's association may not prevent you<br>from installing solar. However, the local government or your HOA can<br>regulate the location of those solar panels.<br><br>You will have to check your Governing Documents for your HOA to<br>determine whether or not they regulate the location of your solar<br>panels. The law in NC says they *can*. It's up to you to get in to the<br>Governing Documents to find out if they *do*.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
