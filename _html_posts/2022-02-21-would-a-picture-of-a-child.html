<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think you wanted to ask if it was considered "child porn," not<br>"nudity."<br><br>From the US Department of Justice (emphasis mine):<br><br>> Images of child pornography are not protected under First Amendment<br>> rights, and are illegal contraband under federal law. Section 2256 of<br>> Title 18, United States Code, defines child pornography as **any<br>> visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor**<br>> (someone under 18 years of age). Visual depictions include<br>> photographs, videos, digital or computer generated images<br>> indistinguishable from an actual minor, and images created, adapted,<br>> or modified, but appear to depict an identifiable, actual minor.<br>> Undeveloped film, undeveloped videotape, and electronically stored<br>> data that can be converted into a visual image of child pornography<br>> are also deemed illegal visual depictions under federal law.<br>><br>> Notably, the legal definition of sexually explicit conduct does not<br>> require that an image depict a child engaging in sexual activity. **A<br>> picture of a naked child may constitute illegal child pornography if<br>> it is sufficiently sexually suggestive.** Additionally, the age of<br>> consent for sexual activity in a given state is irrelevant; any<br>> depiction of a minor under 18 years of age engaging in sexually<br>> explicit conduct is illegal.\[1\](#vYXni){#cite-vYXni<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>The definition above says that child porn is about what is "sexually<br>suggestive."<br><br>A simple picture of a naked child may not be considered to be child<br>porn, assuming it is not sexually suggestive. This also means that a<br>picture of a *clothed* child *which is sexually suggestive* can also be<br>considered child porn. In other words, the nudity does not make the<br>pornography; the sexual suggestiveness of the image *does*.<br><br>TL;DR: If the picture is, as you say, not sexually suggestive, it is<br>unlikely that a simple photo of a naked child would be child porn.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Would a picture of a child\'s genitals/buttocks be considered nudity if<br>it is not portrayed in a sexual way?
