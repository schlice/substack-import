They will hurt a<br>thief just as badly as they will hurt an innocent child who was playing<br>nearby.<br><br>A booby trap cannot determine *intent*. What if I had to move that<br>cooler to get to someone who was injured? I wasn't trying to steal your<br>cooler, but now you've injured me, and now you'll be responsible for any<br>medical costs I incur due to your trap.<br><br>Additionally, you can't injure someone to protect *property*. You can<br>use force to defend against force, but this is not that situation.<br><br>A better option would have been to use something that is non-injurious.<br>A pepper spray bomb/fart spray bomb/glitter bomb is a great way to catch<br>porch pirates, as you can see in [[this<br>video](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9cbb23&url=https://youtu.be/xoxhDk-hwuo){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="youtu.be"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>[https://youtu.be/xoxhDk-hwuo(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9cbb23&url=https://youtu.be/xoxhDk-hwuo){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>This device produces non-lethal (but highly annoying) results.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
