Separated does not equal divorced. No property rights have changed.<br>2.  You said the vehicles are in your name. They cannot be sold without<br>    your consent. Title cannot be exchanged without your consent.<br><br>You should contact an attorney about this. Sooner rather than later.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
