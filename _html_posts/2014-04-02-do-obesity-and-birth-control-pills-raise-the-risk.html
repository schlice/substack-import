<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [To the best of my knowledge, there have not been any<br/>studies linking obesity to MS, nor have there been any studies linking<br/>the use of birth control pills to the risk of MS.\<br/>\<br/>Although, since women develop MS at a rate 2 to 3 times that of men, the<br/>assumption is that there is a hormonal component to MS. But, as you<br/>point out, an environmental component unique to women (birth control<br/>pills) could also be a factor. It\' definitely worth<br/>studying.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
