<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes.<br><br>Even if there was no rule against it, the HOA can make you take it down.<br><br>The reason is in the very beginning of the rule which establishes the<br>HOA and (secondarily) the Architectural Control Committee (or<br>Architectural Review Committee or Architectural Review Board in some<br>HOAs). For now, I'll call it the ARC.<br><br>The charter of the ARC is to approve only changes which will enhance the<br>look and feel of the neighborhood and keep the neighborhood looking much<br>the same way as it did when it was designed. ANY change to the<br>outside of your home, REGARDLESS of whether or not it was listed as<br>an allowed or prohibited change, can be disallowed by the ARC (and by<br>extension, the Board).<br><br>So yes, if the ARC, *in its sole discretion*, sees the change you<br>made and does not approve of how it makes your house (and by extension<br>the neighborhood) look, they can make you take it down. If you refuse,<br>they can fine you, and if you refuse to pay the fines, they can place a<br>lien against your house for the unpaid fines, late fees and (eventually)<br>attorney's fees, and if this goes on too long, they can foreclose on<br>that lien, selling your house out from under you to recoup their money.<br><br>Besides, there are other options to keeping sunlight out of your windows<br>in order to keep your house cool:<br><br>- Blackout curtains<br>- Low-E coatings on your glass which are not reflective from the outside<br>- Window tint (not reflective)<br><br>These changes would not make the windows appear unacceptable from the<br>street, but would still reduce heat transfer across the windows.<br><br>Because there is more than one option available to you, and the one you<br>chose is unacceptable visibly from the outside, the ARC (and by<br>extension, the Board) can tell you to take it down.<br><br>\<br><br>So how do you avoid making changes that the ARC and the Board will later<br>make you take down?<br><br>*Get approval for your change BEFORE you do it!*<br><br>So if you would have put in an ARC Request Form (all HOAs have them,<br>check your Governing Documents to find yours, or ask your Board for it)<br>before you put up aluminum foil on your windows, you would have found<br>out quite quickly that the ARC would have rejected that change. Then,<br>rather than wasting all that time putting up aluminum foil that you're<br>now going to have to take down, you could have investigated other<br>changes which would accomplish something similar for you but would not<br>unacceptably change the exterior appearance of your home.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
