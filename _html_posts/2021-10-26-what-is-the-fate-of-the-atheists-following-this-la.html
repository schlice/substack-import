<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is more specifically related to Catholic churches, as it is written<br>dogma for them.<br><br>This phrase was first written by Saint Cyprian of Carthage, a 3rd<br>Century bishop. The phrase is generally accepted as truth in those<br>churches, namely that the church is necessary for salvation. Catholic<br>churches and Eastern Orthodox churches believe that outside the church<br>there is no salvation, because salvation is the church. They also<br>acknowledge, however, that not all in the church will be saved. But<br>those *not* in the church (i.e. atheists) will definitely not be saved.<br><br>Protestant denominations do not hold this doctrine quite as strongly, as<br>they debate about what is the meaning of "the church" and what it means<br>to be "outside" of it.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What is the fate of the atheists, following this Latin phrase \"extra<br>Ecclesiam nulla salus\" which means \"outside the Church there is no<br>salvation\"?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
