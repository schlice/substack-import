<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There is no escaping the fact that Jane is definitely<br>fighting an uphill battle here. Jane already has a divorce and child<br>abuse allegations under her belt, so she\'s starting the game from<br>behind.\<br>\<br>I would suggest Jane move to a more parent-friendly state. Researching<br>which states have parent-friendly laws (i.e. Colorado) and which states<br>have grandparent-friendly laws (i.e. California) will help her to find a<br>place to take her child.\<br>\<br>While Joan\'s actions may have gotten her standing to appear before a<br>judge to petition for court-ordered visitation, some states still<br>require that Joan show that she was previously an integral part of that<br>child\'s life, and that Jane\'s refusal to allow Joan to participate in<br>that child\'s life will do irreparable harm to the child. If Joan is<br>found to have been a \"psychological parent,\" one who has played a<br>significant role in a child\'s life, the court may grant visitation,<br>even when she has no other standing.\<br>\<br>Sadly, the divorce and abuse allegations will play into Joan\'s hand, as<br>Jane will be fighting an uphill battle when abuse is present. Joan now<br>has two reasons to have standing: the divorce, and the alleged abuse.<br>The divorce was the first thing that gave Joan standing, but the divorce<br>alone wasn\'t enough. Joan would have to have proven she was a<br>psychological parent in order to get court-ordered visitation. The abuse<br>allegations not only gave her nearly guaranteed court-ordered<br>visitation, but opened the door for her to have Jane ruled as an unfit<br>parent.\<br>\<br>Jane should also seek counsel from a family practice attorney in her<br>area. Jane doesn\'t have a lot of resources, so contacting her local bar<br>association is her best bet at finding low-cost (and sometimes pro bono<br>or no-cost) legal representation.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
