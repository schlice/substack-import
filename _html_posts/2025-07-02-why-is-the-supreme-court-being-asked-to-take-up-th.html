<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Supreme Court is being asked to clarify the extent of the<br>President\'s power to remove heads of independent agencies, particularly<br>when those agencies are designed to be independent from direct<br>presidential control. This issue arises from cases where the President<br>has attempted to remove officials from these agencies, and the officials<br>have argued that their removal is unconstitutional due to the agency\'s<br>independent status.<br><br>**The core question is whether the President\'s power to remove<br>officials, as outlined in the Constitution, extends to these<br>"independent agencies," and, if so, under what circumstances.**<br><br>The Constitution grants the President the power to appoint and remove<br>certain federal officials, but it doesn\'t explicitly address the<br>removal of heads of independent agencies.<br><br>Several SCOTUS cases talk about this issue, but none address it<br>completely. These two cases form the core of the issue being decided by<br>SCOTUS. They are:<br><br>- *Myers v. United States (1926):* This Supreme Court case established<br>  that the President has broad removal power over executive branch<br>  officials, but the context of independent agencies wasn\'t directly<br>  addressed.<br>- *Humphrey\'s Executor v. United States (1935):* This case limited the<br>  President\'s removal power over officials in agencies Congress created<br>  to be independent, emphasizing that the nature of the office and the<br>  intent of Congress in establishing the agency should be considered.<br><br>Recent attempts by a President to remove heads of independent agencies,<br>like the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the Merit Systems<br>Protection Board (MSPB), have triggered legal challenges that reach the<br>Supreme Court.<br><br>The central issue is whether the President\'s power to remove officials<br>is *absolute* or whether it can be *limited* by Congress in establishing<br>independent agencies. The Court is being asked to review the tension<br>between *Myers* and *Humphrey's Executor.* In *Myers*, the Court held<br>that the President has unlimited power to remove executive officials he<br>appointed. That case emphasized the need for **unitary executive<br>control** to ensure the President can "take Care that the Laws be<br>faithfully executed" (Article II Clause 2). *Humphrey's Executor*,<br>however, established that Congress can restrict removal of officials<br>in independent agencies (like the FTC) who perform quasi-legislative<br>or quasi-judicial roles. The case differentiated these officials from<br>purely executive ones, protecting them from at-will removal.<br><br>The progression of cases over time shows that the Court has moved from<br>rigid "executive control" toward functional analysis---examining whether<br>removal restrictions impede the President's ability to perform core<br>constitutional duties. That is what is at issue in this case: Do the<br>limits imposed in *Humphrey's Executive* (et seq) constitute an<br>*unconstitutional limitation* of the President's ability to perform his<br>core Constitutional duties under Article II Clause 2?<br><br>Depending on the Supreme Court\'s decision, there could be further legal<br>challenges and ongoing debates about the balance of power between the<br>executive and the other branches of government.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
