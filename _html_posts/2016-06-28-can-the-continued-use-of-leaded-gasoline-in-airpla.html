<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: no.<br><br>Longer answer: Lead has been phased out of most aircraft fuels. Some<br>aviation fuels still contain lead, as no suitable substitute has been<br>found to replace it yet.<br><br>Aircraft engines have to be designed to run on specific fuel types.<br>While commercial jet engines have been modified to run on "JET A," which<br>is basically a kerosene-like fuel which does not contain lead,<br>piston-based engines still use "avgas" which does contain low lead.<br><br>Lead levels in the atmosphere have been falling since leaded gas was<br>prohibited for cars. It was almost completely phased out by 1986. The<br>highest concentrations of airborne lead are now found in the areas<br>around airports where avgas is used.<br><br>[[Scientific<br>American](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2c7296&url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/lead-in-aviation-fuel/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="scientificamerican.com"}]{.qlink_container} reports, "Some<br>of the health effects of repeated exposure to lead include damage to the<br>central nervous system, kidneys and red blood cells, and decreased<br>function in the cardiovascular and immune systems. Lower IQ levels and<br>learning disabilities can also result from lead exposure, especially in<br>children, whose young bodies are more sensitive than those of adults.<br>And scientists at the National Toxicology Program have concluded that<br>lead and lead compounds are 'reasonably anticipated to be human<br>carcinogens.'"\[1\](#dhEOW){#cite-dhEOW .citation_link}<br><br>So while lead is most definitely a carcinogen and harmful to health,<br>lead exposure is not directly linked to antisocial or criminal behavior.<br><br>The most likely cause of the decrease in crime rates through the 90s was<br>the newly-developed practice of policing which actually began with the<br>NYPD in 1994. The bosses there got around the then-radical idea that<br>police could actually stop crime before it started instead of merely<br>responding to crime. They analyzed crime statistics on a daily (and<br>later, hourly) basis, assigning officers to known hot-spots to prevent<br>crimes from taking place. As these efforts started paying off, they<br>spread nationwide. No other government program has had the levels of<br>success that data-driven policing has had.<br><br>Over the last two years, however, movements like Black Lives Matter have<br>caused officers to back off of data-driven policing. Sure, they still<br>respond to 911 calls where a victim has been identified, but the number<br>of discretionary traffic stops and preventative policing calls has<br>sharply fallen. And in its wake is the first sustained spike in violent<br>crime the United States has seen in 20 years. The "Ferguson Effect," as<br>it has been coined, has seen murders rise nearly 17 percent in the<br>nation's 15 largest cities last year alone, and cities with large black<br>populations have seen crime rise the most.\[2\](#WmhWJ){#cite-WmhWJ<br>.citation_link}<br><br>So is aviation fuel responsible for more violent crime? Not likely. The<br>Ferguson Effect is a far more likely cause.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-dhEOW){.citation_index} [[Does the Continued Use of Lead<br>in Aviation Fuel Endanger Public Health and the<br>Environment?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2c7296&url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/lead-in-aviation-fuel/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="scientificamerican.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-WmhWJ){.citation_index} [[The Danger of the "Black Lives<br>Matter"<br>Movement](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1ff1b7&url=https://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/the-danger-of-the-black-lives-matter-movement/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="hillsdale.edu"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
