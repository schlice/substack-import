<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why do people say hurtful and very offensive things whilst inciting<br>hate and try to justify it as \"freedom of speech\"?**<br><br>Because "hate speech" *is* free speech.<br><br>**The First Amendment is in place specifically to protect the speech<br>that you don't like.** You don't need to protect speech that you agree<br>with, right? You'd never need a First Amendment in the first place if<br>everyone said nice things all the time. No speech would ever need to be<br>protected.<br><br>The First Amendment specifically allows people to say things with which<br>we disagree. And yes, sometimes those things are offensive and hurtful<br>and filled with hate. But they are, indeed, allowed to say them. That's<br>what the First Amendment is all about.<br><br>However, and we can't put too fine a point on this, the First Amendment<br>does not protect you from the *consequences* of your words. For example,<br>if your employer hears you or finds out you used those words, you could<br>be looking for a new job. If you are a business owner, people could<br>choose to do business elsewhere, or people in business may choose not to<br>do business with you. People do not have to agree with you. People do<br>not have to listen to you, either.<br><br>You can say what you like, but you will still have to face the<br>consequences of your words.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
