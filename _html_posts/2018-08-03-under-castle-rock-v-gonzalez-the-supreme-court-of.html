<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Under Castle Rock v. Gonzalez, the Supreme Court of the United States<br>ruled police have no duty to enforce. Does that mean that police owe<br>citizens no duty to protect and serve?**<br><br>That's almost exactly correct. The ruling extends other rulings<br>beginning with the watershed case *Warren v. District of Columbia*,<br>where it was shown that the police do not have a duty to protect any one<br>individual, but instead have a *general duty* to protect the population<br>*at large.*<br><br>"To Protect And Serve" is a *motto*, not a law or an oath.<br><br>The precedent in *Warren*, and extended in *Castle Rock*, states that<br>officers do not have an individual responsibility to protect any one<br>person unless a special relationship exists (i.e. a person is in custody<br>or specifically under police protection). The complainant in *Castle<br>Rock* argued that her restraining order created a special relationship<br>and that the police were required to protect her. SCOTUS ruled that<br>there was no legal requirement under Colorado law to enforce a<br>restraining order, and even if there was, it wouldn't create an<br>individual right to enforcement that could be considered a protected<br>entitlement, AND EVEN IF THERE WAS, such an entitlement would have no<br>monetary value, and would thus not be counted as eligible property for<br>due process purposes.<br><br>You are partially correct when you say that *Castle Rock v. Gonzalez*<br>states that the police have "no duty to enforce." Colorado has no law<br>which places the burden on law enforcement to enforce restraining<br>orders. There is nothing in state law which *requires* police to enforce<br>them, or subjecting the department to penalties if they fail to do so.<br>Therefore, the previous precedent is continued.<br><br>The precedent flows from the Due Process clause itself, and basically<br>says that while the *government* may not deprive an individual of life<br>without due process, this does not place a burden on the government to<br>protect your life against *someone else* taking it. In 1989, SCOTUS<br>stated, \"Nothing in the language of the Due Process Clause itself<br>requires the State to protect the life, liberty, and property of its<br>citizens against invasion by private actors.\" Generally, the Due<br>Process Clause does not provide an affirmative right to government aid,<br>\"even where such aid may be necessary to secure life, liberty, or<br>property interests of which the government itself may not deprive the<br>individual.\"<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
