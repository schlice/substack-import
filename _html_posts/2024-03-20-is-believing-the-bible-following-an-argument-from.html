<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is an excellent question!<br><br>An argument from authority, also known as an appeal to authority, is a<br>logical fallacy that occurs when someone uses an authority\'s words to<br>justify an argument instead of their reasoning. The logical flow of an<br>argument from authority would look like this:<br><br>- Person A is an authority on a given topic.<br>- Person A claims proposition P is true.<br>- P is within the topic that A is an authority on.<br>- Therefore, P is true<br><br>Notice that proposition P is not proven true using investigation or<br>empirical evidence. Proposition P is only deemed to be true because<br>Person A claims that Proposition P is true. The conclusion that<br>Proposition P is true only relies on the word of Person A, who happens<br>to be an authority within which Proposition P exists.<br><br>An example of an argument from authority is, "I have been a lawyer for<br>thirty years, and I am telling you that the fair use law is a sham."<br>Notice that I have provided no evidence that the fair use law is a sham.<br>You would have to rely on my word as an expert in the field of law if<br>you wanted to rely on the truth of my statement.<br><br>So is believing the Bible following an argument from authority?<br><br>In order to answer this, we must determine:<br><br>1.  if the Bible is an authority<br>2.  if the Bible tells you to believe it without evidence<br>3.  if people believe the Bible without investigation, only relying on<br>    its word as an authority.<br><br>Let's take a look at each of these and see if we can determine if the<br>action of belief in the Bible is following an argument from authority.<br><br>1. Is the Bible an authority on a given topic? I believe we have<br>strong evidence that the Bible is indeed an authority on the topic of<br>Christian belief. In fact, the Bible is the *only* source of authority<br>for a Christian. The Bible does indeed claim to be the inspired word of<br>God, in several places, but probably most directly telling is 2 Tim<br>3:16--17:<br><br>> *All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking,<br>> correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God<br>> may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. (ESV)*<br><br>It doesn't get much clearer than that. All Scripture is God-breathed<br>("breathed out" by God). Therefore, it is not incorrect to claim that<br>the Bible is the inspired word of God, and is therefore an authority on<br>the same word of God, as well as being the authority on the topic of<br>Christian belief.<br><br>2. Does the Bible tell you to believe it without evidence? So this<br>is a tricky one to wrap our heads around, because it ties directly into<br>point 3. But let's stay focused on what the Bible says to do. The Bible,<br>in fact, does not tell you to believe it without evidence. In fact, it<br>commands believers to do exactly the opposite. Just look at this<br>exchange between Jesus and a lawyer:<br><br>> "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?" And He said to<br>> him, "'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with<br>> all your soul, and with all your mind.' This is the great and foremost<br>> commandment." --- Matthew 22:34--35 NASB<br><br>How exactly do you love the Lord your God *with all your mind*? You use<br>your mind! You think about what you believe. You investigate the truth<br>of what's being taught to you. Lest you think this is just me blathering<br>on to try to make a point (thus creating my own appeal to authority), it<br>is actually the Bible which talks about people questioning what is being<br>taught to them, and to test it against the Bible. The Bereans examined<br>what they heard by comparing it to the Old Testament Scriptures. The<br>fact that they honestly listened and conducted further personal research<br>led many Bereans to faith in Jesus as the Messiah. The Bereans are the<br>perfect Biblical example of testing what you hear.<br><br>Additionally, believing without evidence is what's called "blind faith."<br>The Bible talks about blind faith in Hebrews 11:1 and 6, the Bible<br>appears initially to define faith as blind belief, or believing in<br>things that are not seen. However, this verse is instead about believers<br>who *trusted in God\'s faithfulness based on His past actions*. They<br>reasoned that if God was faithful in the past, then they could trust Him<br>to be faithful in the future, including in the fulfillment of his<br>promises. Therefore, believers can trust the Bible based on God's<br>fulfillment of His past promises. If He was faithful before, you can<br>trust that He will be faithful again.<br><br>3. Do people believe the Bible without investigation? Sadly, many<br>Christians, knowing that the Bible, as a whole, is the inspired word of<br>God, trust it without question. While they arrive at the same place,<br>they do so without using their minds. They do so without investigation,<br>without question. The disciple Thomas would not believe that Jesus had<br>risen from the dead until he put his hand in Jesus' side (where the<br>spear pierced Him) and touched the nail holes in His hands. Fortunately<br>for Thomas, he had the opportunity to do just this, and he believed. But<br>as Jesus goes on to say, "Blessed are those who have not seen and yet<br>believed" (John 20:29). So while it's not the investigation, but the<br>belief, that matters, Jesus does not discount the investigation. He does<br>not tell Thomas that he is wrong for investigating before belief, only<br>that those who believe without investigation are also okay.<br><br>ANALYSIS: So what does all of this tell us? The Bible is indeed an<br>authority on God's word as well as on Christian theology. But the Bible<br>does not tell people to believe it without question. The Bible allows<br>for people to believe without investigation. The Bible does not condemn<br>those who believe without investigation, and therefore neither should<br>we.<br><br>CONCLUSION: Belief in the Bible without investigation cannot rightly<br>be categorized as part of the argument from authority fallacy, because<br>the Bible does not direct anyone to believe it without question or<br>investigation. While Christianity, and the teachings of Christ, allow<br>for this type of belief, it does not demand that it be believed without<br>investigation. Certainly, the Bible purports to be an authority on<br>Christianity. It purports to be God's word, and Christians are right to<br>trust it and to put their faith in it. But it does not demand that one<br>do this without question.<br><br>Therefore, belief in the Bible does not constitute following an argument<br>from authority.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
