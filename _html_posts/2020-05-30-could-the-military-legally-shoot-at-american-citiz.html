As others have mentioned, the Posse<br>Comitatus Act forbids it.<br><br>But there is one circumstance in which they can be engaged. If the fully<br>constituted forces of a state National Guard can\'t quell an<br>Insurrection, the governor can appeal to the President, and he can<br>activate the military under the Insurrection Act.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
