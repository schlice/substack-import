<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>They can be *justified*. You can justify your actions in any way you<br>choose, such as "the majority of people in the population act with human<br>rights and dignity, so that's what makes it right."<br><br>Justification without God is not the problem. *Grounding your ideology*<br>is. Locating a common source for your ideology is impossible without<br>God.<br><br>Without a divine giver of justice, a single source for rights and<br>ideology, you can justify your actions in any way you choose, and it is<br>no more or less "right" than anyone else's justification.<br><br>For example, I could say that human rights is whatever gets me the most<br>of everything, and I can kill you to get your stuff to advance my human<br>rights, and dignity means killing you quickly so that you don't suffer<br>because I just want to get my stuff in the quickest way possible, and my<br>justification could be that my ideology means whatever is best for me is<br>what I do. And that ideology is no more or less right than the ideology<br>which says that whatever the majority of the population thinks is right<br>is actually what is right.<br><br>Without some way to ground the ideology, to ground the belief, then no<br>one's belief is any more or less right than anyone else's belief.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>"Can human rights and dignity be justified if God does not exist? If so,<br>how?"<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
