<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I lost my mobile phone and someone else is using my account. What do I<br>do?**<br><br>- Call your carrier and have them suspend your account. They can do that<br>  immediately.<br>- Have them place your IMEI (your phone's hardware address) on the<br>  "stolen" list, so that it can't be re-activated on any other account<br>  or on any other carrier. That will essentially render it useless to<br>  the majority of bad guys. Only the most technically adept can change<br>  the IMEI, and on most flagship devices, even that doesn't work.<br>- Report your phone lost/stolen to the police. Do whatever they require<br>  you to do, but get a jacket number from their investigation<br>- Use your insurance benefit (you got insurance through your carrier,<br>  right?) to get yourself another handset. Since your phone is<br>  officially reported stolen (see the jacket number from the police from<br>  the last bullet), a replacement handset shouldn't be too expensive.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
