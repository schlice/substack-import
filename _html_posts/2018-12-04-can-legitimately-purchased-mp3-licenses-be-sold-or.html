<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can legitimately purchased mp3 licenses be sold or otherwise<br>transferred to somebody else?**<br><br>It used to be that you could re-sell your CDs and records legally. This<br>was called the *first sale* doctrine. Otherwise, donating your CDs or<br>records, or selling them at a garage sale, would be illegal. The first<br>sale doctrine says that you have the right to "sell or otherwise<br>dispose" of your media without seeking the permission of the copyright<br>owner.<br><br>But what about digital media?<br><br>The courts have said that the first sale doctrine does not apply to<br>digital media.<br><br>When you sell your hard media, there is still only one copy of that<br>media. When you sell your digital media, a flawless perfect duplicate<br>copy is created on the purchaser's computer. That copy, said the courts,<br>is an unauthorized reproduction. Traditional media had an inbuilt<br>limiting factor slowing down reproductions: copies degrade with each<br>passing copy. However, digital copies do not suffer from this<br>limitation: each copy is an exact duplicate, which retains 100% of its<br>quality.<br><br>There is an opportunity for digital retailers and content creators to<br>create a marketplace for reselling copies of music, and Amazon and<br>Google are working towards that. But today, no such technology exists.<br><br>So for now, reselling digital licenses and transferring the media to<br>someone else is illegal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
