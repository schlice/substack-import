If so, what<br>are they?**<br><br>The odds are so good, they're not worth your money.<br><br>*There is a 100% chance that Trump will not resign.* And you can<br>take that one to the bank. In fact, if there is a bet going that he will<br>resign, you could take the "long odds" and bet against it, and make a<br>ton of holiday cash.<br><br>Nixon resigned because he was facing certain conviction in the Senate.<br>Trump, on the other hand, is facing certain acquittal in the Senate (if<br>the Articles of Impeachment ever make it there, which I'm starting to<br>have my doubts). So there is absolutely zero reason for him to resign.<br><br>And understanding his personality as I do, even if he was facing the<br>possibility of being removed from office, he'd fight it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
