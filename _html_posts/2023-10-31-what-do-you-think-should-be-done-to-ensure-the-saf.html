<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why do you feel that they need special protection outside of any other<br>American citizen?<br><br>And why do think the insane ramblings of a delusional nutball pose any<br>significant threat to anyone?<br><br>If Sheriff Labat feels threatened, he has the entirety of the Fulton<br>County Sheriff's Office at his disposal; he can place himself under<br>24-hour surveillance by his own deputies, if he really feels there is a<br>valid threat.<br><br>The District Attorney can similarly appeal to the Sheriff and receive<br>the same treatment, if they believe there is a credible threat.<br><br>Since neither of them have taken this drastic step, it's quite possible<br>that they believe that there is no threat.<br><br>I concur.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
