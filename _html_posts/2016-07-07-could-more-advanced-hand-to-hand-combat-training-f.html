<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is a *continuum of force* which officers have at their disposal.<br>It involves everything from application of hands to pepper spray, the<br>baton, the Taser, and ends with the firearm. As you can see, it is an<br>escalating scale. Officers definitely receive training called "arrest<br>control" which teaches the proper techniques to subdue violent or<br>resistant suspects, techniques which can control them without causing<br>permanent damage.<br><br>It used to be that officers were far more "hands-on" with policing.<br>However, over the past few years, that has all changed. Organizations<br>like Black Lives Matter have spread the false notion that police are the<br>most dangerous organization in the lives of citizens, and any<br>application of force by police is an unlawful one. Therefore, every time<br>police use force, they can be reasonably assured that they are being<br>recorded and their actions will be used in a civil suit claiming an<br>unreasonable use of force.<br><br>As a result of this anti-cop movement, several things have happened. For<br>starters, discretionary stops and proactive policing are way down. These<br>sorts of data-driven policing activities were the proximate cause of the<br>decrease in violent crime in the 1990's and 2000's. As a result of this<br>decline in proactive policing strategies, the United States is seeing<br>its first sustained spike in violent crime in over two decades. Murders<br>rose nearly 17 percent in the nation's 50 largest cities in 2015, and it<br>was in cities with large black populations where the violence increased<br>the most. Baltimore's per capita homicide rate last year was the highest<br>in its history. Milwaukee had its deadliest year in a decade, with a 72<br>percent increase in homicides. Homicides in Cleveland increased 90<br>percent over the previous year. Murders rose 83 percent in Nashville, 54<br>percent in Washington, DC, and 61 percent in Minneapolis. In Chicago,<br>where pedestrian stops are down by 90 percent, shootings were up 80<br>percent through March, 2016.\[1\](#IQtWL){#cite-IQtWL .citation_link}<br><br>Secondly, police are far less likely to engage in physical altercations<br>for fear of being the next headline and losing their jobs, justified or<br>not. They fear the video recording which shows them out of context,<br>which only shows the application of force, not the incident or the bad<br>behavior which led to the application of force. Therefore, police are<br>far quicker to "skip" that step in the force chain, or for that matter,<br>to skip any step which might be misconstrued as unreasonable force when<br>applied. Therefore, most cops will completely skip laying hands on a<br>suspect, or using a baton. They will go straight for the Taser, and if<br>it is ineffective or not suited for the situation, they will move<br>directly to the firearm. This is not the fault of the police; they have<br>been forced into this position; we the public have done this to them.<br><br>Do police tend to use fewer tools to subdue violent or resistant<br>criminals? Yes. They do this because we've made them do it, because we<br>have demonized other, less-deadly methods to subdue violent or resistant<br>criminals. It's funny. We've made the police stop using more hands-on<br>approaches, and now we're upset because police are using less hands-on<br>approaches.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-IQtWL){.citation_index} [[The Danger of the "Black Lives<br>Matter"<br>Movement](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1ff1b7&url=https://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/the-danger-of-the-black-lives-matter-movement/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="hillsdale.edu"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
