<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>That's the fundamental operation of belief in a belief system. If you<br>believe *your* religion, by default, you necessarily believe that<br>*other* religions are not true.<br><br>It also indicates that all these religions believe *contradictory<br>things*. In other words, religions generally don't all believe the same<br>thing. The idea that Americans hold that "all religions essentially<br>believe the same things" is gibberish. While most religions have a<br>similar moral code, nearly all religions disagree on every major issue:<br>the nature of God, the nature of man, sin, salvation, heaven, hell, and<br>creation.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why is it with over 10,000 religions in the world, everyone who is a<br>part of any of these 10,000 religions, is 100% sure, their belief system<br>is the right one?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
