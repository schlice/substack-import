<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *(Details from the question: Assume there is a crowd of people<br>> looking. Your girlfriend never committed any crimes and is not part of<br>> a bust, sting, or investigation.*<br>><br>> *Do you ask the crowd to record a video and plead for her life? Do you<br>> try to help her escape the choke and then cover her with your body? Do<br>> you just stand there?*<br><br>Keep in mind the bounds of this question. You have to be able to stop<br>the police officer without being killed or **without being arrested<br>yourself.**<br><br>*The answer is:* ***there is no situation in the law which allows you to<br>interfere with a police officer who is carrying out his duty.***<br><br>None.<br><br>And whether or not he is actually carrying out his duty is a matter of<br>law to be determined by a judge and a matter of fact to be determined by<br>a jury, well after the incident is concluded. You are not qualified, nor<br>permitted by law, to make that determination on your own, at the scene.<br><br>As heartbreaking as it may seem to you, *you must let the officer<br>proceed.*<br><br>Remember that the OP asked how you can save her **without being killed<br>or arrested. The answer is that *you cannot stop the officer from<br>doing what he is doing without, at a minimum, being arrested, or at<br>worst, being killed yourself.*** *What's more, you must understand that<br>if the officer kills her, there was nothing you could have done without<br>being arrested or killed yourself.*<br><br>If you intervene, you will be arrested and charged with assault on a<br>police officer, interfering with the duties of a police officer, aiding<br>and abetting, and a myriad of other charges.<br><br>**I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH. ANY INTERVENTION YOU TAKE FOR WHATEVER<br>REASON YOU CHOOSE TO TAKE IT WILL DEFINITELY GET YOU ARRESTED AND MAY<br>GET YOU KILLED.**<br><br>**Your sense of chivalry (if that concept still exists any more) may<br>make you willing to take that risk of arrest, but that's not what this<br>question asked.**<br><br>Your best bet is to get out your cell phone and record as much as you<br>can. The problem is that you won't have video of what happened *before*<br>you started recording, and if there is no video of that, we're down to<br>testimony, in which case it will be his word over yours.<br><br>You also have to understand that there are police arrest control holds<br>which "look like" choking, but are not. Look up the Carotid Control Hold<br>if you're interested. It looks, to an outsider, like the officer is<br>"choking out" the suspect, but in fact there is little to no pressure on<br>the windpipe at all.<br><br>There are two types of neck restraints: vascular and respiratory.<br>Respiratory neck restraints use direct pressure to constrict the<br>anterior (front) portion of the neck, which causes asphyxiation. The<br>police *never* intentionally, deliberately use this as it can cause<br>significant injury and death (note that we're not excluding accidents,<br>where an officer attempts a neck restraint and does it wrong). The<br>second type of hold is a vascular hold. This applies no pressure to the<br>anterior portion of the neck (the crook of the elbow is in front), while<br>the pressure is applied bilaterally (on the *sides*) to the neck. This<br>restricts blood flow to the brain, causing the suspect to briefly lose<br>consciousness. If you're a WWE fan, it's what the "sleeper hold" is<br>supposed to mimic. The Carotid Control Hold is very useful on a large<br>and uncooperative suspect. It gives the officer enough time to calm the<br>suspect down and safely apply handcuffs. If it is done correctly, it<br>minimizes injury to the suspect and to the officer.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If a strong police officer is using excessive force and choking out your<br>100 pound girlfriend, how can you save her without being killed or<br>arrested?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
