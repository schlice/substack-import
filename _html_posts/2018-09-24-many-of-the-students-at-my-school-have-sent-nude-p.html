<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Many of the students at my school have sent nude photos to each other.<br>Why are they not in federal prison for distribution and possession of<br>child pornography?**<br><br>Federal law only applies if the sender and the recipient are in<br>different states, so in the majority of cases, it's up to the state to<br>prosecute the teens under that state's juvenile justice system.<br><br>Generally, they're not in state prison because they're not adults, and<br>generally these laws are directed at adults in possession of nude photos<br>of children. Juveniles who break "sexting" laws are usually dealt with<br>through the juvenile justice system, not the adult justice system. From<br>our friends at nolo.com:<br><br>> Juvenile courts have a wider discretion in the kinds of penalties they<br>> impose, even when a juvenile is charged with a serious offense.<br>><br>> - Warning. Juvenile judges can choose to punish a teen who commits<br>>   a sexting offense with a verbal warning without requiring any other<br>>   penalty.<br>> - Fine. At least one state, Florida, imposes a fine of \$60 on<br>>   first-time juvenile sexting offenders. Subsequent offenders may face<br>>   more significant penalties.<br>> - Community service or counseling. A judge may order a teen who<br>>   commits a sexting offense to perform community service. The court<br>>   may also order a teen to attend individual or family therapy.<br>> - Probation. Probation is also possible for juveniles sexting<br>>   offenders. A teen on probation must typically report to a probation<br>>   officer, stay in school, and comply with any other orders the court<br>>   decides.<br>> - Detention. Teen sexting might result in a a court ordering the<br>>   juvenile into a detention center, home confinement, group home, or<br>>   other placement location.\[1\](#HxVeF){#cite-HxVeF .citation_link}<br><br>So as you can see, it's not always prison time that can be imposed under<br>the juvenile justice system.<br><br>It's also important to note that while laws punish the person *sending*<br>the message, you generally can't prevent someone from sending you a<br>message, so the law generally only punishes the *recipient* if they<br>keep the picture (in legal terms, this is called "receiving and<br>keeping").<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-HxVeF){.citation_index} [[Teen<br>Sexting](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=199841&url=https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/crime-penalties/juvenile/sexting.htm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="criminaldefenselawyer.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
