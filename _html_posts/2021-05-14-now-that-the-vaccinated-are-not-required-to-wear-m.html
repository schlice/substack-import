<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's take these one at a time:<br><br>> **Now that the vaccinated are not required to wear masks in many<br>> places, will you feel safe out in public, since some unvaccinated<br>> people will also be maskless;**<br><br>Of course. Why? **Because I protect myself; I don't count on anyone else<br>to protect me**. That means that I already got my vaccine. So I don't<br>care if someone else has COVID; that's their problem, not mine.<br><br>Look, while it is *possible* that a vaccinated person could still<br>contract COVID, it's highly unlikely, and even if you do, the disease<br>will be far more mild than if you were unvaccinated. Sure there are<br>exceptions to that, but there was already a seriously low chance I was<br>going to get it anyway; now that I'm vaccinated, that seriously low<br>chance turned into an extremely low chance.<br><br>> **are those who refuse to get vaccinated or wear a mask violating our<br>> rights?**<br><br>What right is that, exactly? The right to not catch a virus? I missed<br>that in the Bill of Rights, can you show me which Constitutional<br>amendment says that the Federal government cannot deny you the right to<br>be free from viruses?<br><br>Let me save you the Constitutional lookup: there is none. You have<br>no right to be free from harm in this country. You protect yourself.<br>It is no one else's responsibility to protect you but you.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Now that the vaccinated are not required to wear masks in many places,<br>will you feel safe out in public, since some unvaccinated people will<br>also be maskless; are those who refuse to get vaccinated or wear a mask<br>violating our rights?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
