<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So for those not following the news, SCOTUS ruled 8--1 that a person<br>under a domestic violence-related restraining order can be barred from<br>possessing firearms. The justices found that the Second Amendment is not<br>violated when an individual is disarmed after a court has found him to<br>pose a credible threat to the physical safety of another.<br><br>> Holding: When an individual has been found by a court to pose a<br>> credible threat to the physical safety of another, that individual may<br>> be temporarily disarmed consistent with the Second Amendment.<br><br>Remember that this differs from Red Flag laws, where courts are not<br>involved, and a single party can make an accusation and police will<br>simply remove firearms. This is a case where a competent court has made<br>a determination that an individual actually poses a credible threat to<br>someone's physical safety.<br><br>What's important about this case (*United States v. Rahimi*) is that the<br>defendant does not dispute the restraining order. He was disputing what<br>he believed was an unconstitutional law in light of the SCOTUS ruling in<br>*NYSRPA v. Breun*. The complaint says that in light of *Breun,* the<br>statute which bars someone from possessing firearms is, on its face,<br>unconstitutional, because the reasoning in *Breun* says that in order<br>for a statute to stand, it must fit "within our Nation's historical<br>tradition of firearm regulation."<br><br>SCOTUS ruled that the DV statute does indeed fit "within our Nation's<br>historical tradition of firearm regulation." They also argued that 2A<br>"is not unlimited\.\" (District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570,<br>626). In discussing whether or not that is the case here, the Court<br>said:<br><br>> When firearm regulation is challenged under the Second Amendment, the<br>> Government must show that the restriction "is consistent with the<br>> Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation." *Bruen, 597 U.<br>> S., at 24*. A court must ascertain whether the new law is "relevantly<br>> similar" to laws that our tradition is understood to permit,<br>> "apply\ing\ faithfully the balance struck by the founding generation<br>> to modern circumstances." *Id., at 29, and n. 7.* Why and how the<br>> regulation burdens the right are central to this inquiry. As Bruen<br>> explained, a challenged regulation that does not precisely match its<br>> historical precursors "still may be analogous enough to pass<br>> constitutional muster." *Id., at 30. Pp. 5--8. (b)*<br>><br>> \The DV regulation\ survives Rahimi's challenge.<br><br>\<br><br>So back to the question, what does this mean for victims of domestic<br>violence? If you go through the proper channels and get a restraining<br>order, and a court finds a "credible threat to \your\ physical<br>safety," state regulations can require that person temporarily surrender<br>his or her firearms. So you won't be shot by your crazy ex. But you can<br>still be beaten, kidnapped, raped, and all manner of other terrible<br>things, so you must do more than just get a restraining order.<br><br>Remember, a restraining order is nothing more than a piece of paper. And<br>[[studies have<br>found](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=683c78&url=https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/restraining-orders-stalkers-domestic-violence-victims-call-enforcement/story?id%3D9999086){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="go.com"}]{.qlink_container} that they're only effective<br>about 70% of the time. So absolutely, get the restraining order, but<br>don't stop there. Protect yourself. Reach out to domestic violence<br>advocacy groups for assistance. Do the things they tell you. Don't kid<br>yourself that a piece of paper and your aggressor without access to his<br>own firearms is going to stop him from hurting you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
