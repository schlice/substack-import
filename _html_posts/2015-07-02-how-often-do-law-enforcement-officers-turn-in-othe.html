<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There is no law that prevents anyone from saying something<br>racist. In fact, racist statements are protected under the First<br>Amendment.\<br>\<br>Anyone has the right to be an ass. They don\'t have the right to<br>*discriminate* because they are an ass. But making a racist statement is<br>legal.\<br>\<br>However, that said, an officer should never make such statements.<br>Members of the public have more power to effect change in such a<br>situation than other officers, and should be reporting such incidents to<br>the police department by filing an official statement or visiting<br>Internal Affairs in that department.\<br>\<br>It would be very hard for fellow officers to report other officers for<br>making racist statements. An officer might casually approach the racist<br>officer\'s supervisor and say something about how officer X should<br>probably learn some tact. But beyond that, it\'s hard to turn someone in<br>for being an ass.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
