The Presidential Alert has never<br>been used, and has never been tested until just recently.<br><br>It basically functions like an advanced text message. It can get through<br>when other applications are using your phone.<br><br>But to be sure, it's a one-way message. It sends nothing back.<br><br>Additionally, your phone doesn't have an "E911" chip. You do have a GPS<br>chip in your phone, and in the future, E911 systems will be able to see<br>your GPS location when you call 911. Most 911 centers don't have this<br>functionality, and most carriers haven't enabled the 911 interface to<br>allow dispatchers to see the GPS data on your phone when you call 911<br>yet. It's in the works, but not rolled out yet.<br><br>And as I mentioned, while there are indeed privacy concerns about your<br>GPS chip and its utilization by law enforcement, they have absolutely<br>zero to do with Presidential Alerts. When WEA is activated, it sends a<br>text message to your phone. That's literally it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
