<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**As a matter of national security, why isn\'t Donald Trump stopped from<br>making calls on phones he knows aren\'t secure?**<br><br>You only need to be concerned about the phone you're using when you're<br>discussing things that are not unclassified.<br><br>Just because you have the capability of discussing classified things<br>doesn't mean you have to use secure phones 100% of the time.<br><br>It comes down to policing yourself and knowing you're on an unsecured<br>line and not discussing classified things on an unsecured line. You<br>can't police everyone, least of all the President. All you can do is<br>provide him the tools he needs to conduct classified discussions<br>securely while giving him all the tools he wants to make any kind of<br>call he needs.<br><br>Additionally, don't forget that a secured phone call requires secure<br>telephone devices *on both ends* or the call cannot be completed.<br><br>That said, the President has all of the tools available to him at all<br>times to make any classification of phone call he may need.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
