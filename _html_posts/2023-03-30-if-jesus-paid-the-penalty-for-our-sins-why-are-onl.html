<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ah, an excellent question. The question is: *to whom is Christ's<br>forgiveness given*?<br><br>The answer is that the forgiveness of sins, by the grace of God, is<br>offered to everyone. *But not everyone* *accepts* *that gift.*<br><br>To get a gift, two things must happen: 1. someone must offer the gift,<br>and 2. someone must accept the gift. If 2 happens but not 1, that<br>doesn't make sense because you don't get a gift that wasn't offered to<br>you. But if 1 happens and not 2, then the person giving the gift is<br>standing there, holding a gift, and you don't take it. In either case,<br>you don't get the gift.<br><br>In the case of the unbeliever, it's the latter. Christ stands there,<br>offering the gift, and the unbeliever does not take it.<br><br>Here's another analogy. Let's say you have a curable disease but you<br>don't accept the treatment. The cure exists and is available for anyone,<br>but you don't get cured of the disease until you accept the treatment.<br><br>**You have to accept the gift of Christ's death and resurrection in<br>order to be saved by it.**<br><br>Unbelievers need the gift before they die. The forgiveness of sins is<br>only through Christ. Anyone can be in Christ through faith in the<br>Gospel.<br><br>TL;DR: The forgiveness is there, waiting for you to accept it. But<br>you must *believe* it to *receive* it!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
