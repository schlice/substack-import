<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I understand you're 12, but you came on to Quora to ask a serious<br>question, so I'm going to give you a serious answer. Understand that<br>when someone gives you a serious answer, you may not be comfortable with<br>that answer. You may not even like what I'm about to tell you. **But<br>it's super important that you listen to it, and if at all possible, do<br>what it is that I will be asking you to do.**<br><br>Ready? Okay, here goes:<br><br>You are not suicidal. You probably already knew that, but you<br>probably also needed to hear it. You also said "I sometimes self-harm."<br>People who self-harm often do it because they want to avoid those<br>feelings that make you want to commit suicide.<br><br>So self-harm is what we would call "a cry for help." It means *I am<br>trying my very best to avoid suicide or suicidal thoughts, so I<br>sometimes self-harm.*<br><br>Now, what to do about it?<br><br>Get help. Please.<br><br>But don't talk to a teacher. Not because teachers are bad, but because<br>it's not a teacher's job to help you with this kind of thing. Your<br>teacher equating self-harm with suicide is exactly the problem that I'm<br>talking about. In most cases, people who self-harm are actively trying<br>to deal with the feelings that *could* lead to suicidal thoughts,<br>and the way they accomplish that is<br>self-harm.\[1\](#UPYEu){#cite-UPYEu .citation_link}<br><br>The point is: self-harm is not suicide, but it may *become*<br>suicide.<br><br>Please talk to a counselor. At your school, you can talk to a counselor<br>if you have one. You can also talk to the school nurse. If you have<br>access to your primary care doctor, you can talk to that person as well.<br>You can also reach out to any of the resources listed in the box on this<br>page titled "There is Help" if you can't talk to a counselor or your<br>school nurse or your doctor.<br><br>But please, please talk to someone like that who can help you.<br><br>Okay?<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**I\'m 12 and a teacher accused me of being suicidal just because I have<br>scratches on my face, arms, and legs. I sometimes self-harm but most of<br>my scratches are from my 4 kittens. What do I do?**<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-UPYEu){.citation_index} [[Self-harm and Suicide - Centre<br>for Suicide<br>Prevention](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ef21bd&url=https://www.suicideinfo.ca/resource/self-harm-and-suicide/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="suicideinfo.ca"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
