<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, because "Stand your Ground" is only applicable if you are following<br>the law yourself.<br><br>I'll assume you're talking about Florida's law, since that's the most<br>recent, and the most frequently mischaracterized.<br><br>Florida's law creates civil immunity for people who drive out of<br>crowds of protesters in roadways, meaning they won't be sued for damages<br>if people get hurt or killed if they claim self-defense.<br><br>This doesn't mean there won't be a criminal investigation. The police<br>and the District Attorney will still investigate. If they find that the<br>driver deliberately drove over people in a roadway, and that the driver<br>was not being attacked but did the attacking, criminal charges will<br>still follow, **and that driver can later be sued for negligence or<br>wrongful death**.<br><br>But if someone was genuinely in fear for their life because protesters<br>swarmed their car and started attacking them, leaving the scene by<br>driving away won't result in a civil suit if any of the protesters,<br>who themselves were violating the law, get hurt or killed. If there<br>are no charges because the driver claimed self-defense, under the<br>state's new law, the driver can't later be sued over that incident.<br><br>That's all the law says. The criminal process will continue, but<br>motorists who were in fear for their lives no longer have to fear being<br>sued for injuring protesters.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If a State passes a law allowing Drivers to run over Protesters, can<br>Protesters use a State's "Stand-Your-Ground" law to protect themselves?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
