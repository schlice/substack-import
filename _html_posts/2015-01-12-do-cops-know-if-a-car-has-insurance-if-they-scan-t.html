<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In most states, insurance information is only provided to<br>the DMV at the time of vehicle registration. So the DMV only knows that<br>the vehicle was insured at the time that it was registered.\<br>\<br>Officers require an insurance card during a traffic stop because they<br>need to see that the insurance is \"current.\" For the most part,<br>insurance companies do not routinely provide this information to the<br>DMV, and this information is not normally transmitted to the officer<br>when running the plate.\<br>\<br>It is the driver\'s responsibility to carry an updated insurance card<br>for the vehicle to show that the vehicle has active, current<br>insurance.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
