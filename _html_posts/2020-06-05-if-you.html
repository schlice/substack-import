<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you're going to defund law enforcement, who's going to confiscate<br>all the guns when you vote to ban them?**<br><br>It doesn't make logical sense to both defund the police and disarm the<br>population. You have to pick one.<br><br>You can't say, "You don't need guns, the police will protect you" and<br>then say "The police are the most corrupt, institutionally racist<br>organization in government and must be disbanded" and expect to be taken<br>seriously. Either the police can protect me, or they can't. And if they<br>can't, then it's up to me to protect myself.<br><br>The truth is, it's *always* been up to me to protect myself. The fact<br>that my taxpayer dollars fund a government organization which can take<br>the first crack at defending me doesn't alleviate me of my<br>responsibility to protect myself. You can't subrogate my self-protection<br>responsibility to the police and then defund the police. Again, pick<br>one.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
