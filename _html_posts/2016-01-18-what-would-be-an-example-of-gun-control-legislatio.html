<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As most folks have alluded to, we do need to enforce the laws we have.<br>And we need to make crimes with a gun so dangerous to do (in terms of<br>consequences) that no criminal (and criminals are not well known for<br>being all that bright) would be stupid enough to do them. So along those<br>lines, how do we better \"enforce\" the laws we already have? Here\'s a<br>few ways that not many folks on either side will like (thus fitting the<br>actual definition of \"compromise\"):<br><br>1\. Attach mandatory jail time to crimes committed with a gun. I<br>don\'t like mandatory sentences very much; they take the natural<br>flexibility away from the courts which is the fundamental reason we have<br>courts in the first place. But if we are to effect any meaningful<br>changes to gun crime, criminals who use guns must be punished, harshly,<br>for doing so. And no, we do not do this today.<br><br>2\. Similarly, we need to make it so that this charge (a crime<br>committed with a gun) cannot be plea-bargained. In other words, if<br>you commit a crime with a gun, that charge cannot be changed or reduced<br>by pleading guilty. What happens today: a prosecutor may offer a<br>\"plea-bargain\" wherein he tells the criminal that he will charge him<br>with the lesser included offense of unlawful possession of a handgun (or<br>some similar lesser included offense) in exchange for a guilty plea. He<br>will do less prison time (if he does any time at all), and will be back<br>out on the streets much sooner, all in the name of expediency in the<br>court system. Prosecutors do not use this indiscriminately (for the most<br>part), but they do use it, and criminals know it. They know they can<br>offer a guilty plea for a lesser charge. When it comes to crimes<br>committed with a gun, if we are serious about reducing it, we need to<br>eliminate this practice.<br><br>3\. You\'re thinking, \"well, this is going to overload the jails!\" So<br>let\'s get the non-criminals out of jail. For my third bullet (which no<br>one will like), we need to stop jailing drug users. We should<br>absolutely jail drug distributors and drug manufacturers. But jailing<br>drug users is counterproductive, a huge resource sink, and a waste of<br>everyone\'s time. Most of the people in prison are there on drug<br>charges, because they were caught buying drugs or caught using drugs.<br>They are not criminals and should not be in prison. Period. Instead,<br>force drug users to be placed into inpatient drug treatment, which<br>should be paid for by redirected funds which previously funded the \"war<br>on drugs.\" That means the money that was going to police departments to<br>fund increases in personnel or armament to fight this \"war\" will now<br>go to inpatient hospitals and clinics where former inmates are now<br>receiving treatment for their addiction. Police departments won\'t like<br>that, since they were able to use those funds to upgrade and modernize<br>their line-level officers\' gear. I am sorry to say that they will have<br>to work a little harder to get funding for line-level gear upgrades, as<br>\"war on drugs\" money will be going elsewhere.<br><br>This will also benefit a reduction of crime since we will be removing<br>much of the incentive that small-time criminals used to commit crime in<br>the first place: getting money to buy more drugs.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
