In fact, in most cases, your rights under Miranda are<br>not read to you when you are arrested.<br><br>Miranda rights only apply when you are being questioned, not when<br>you are being arrested. Before you are sat down to be questioned,<br>your Miranda rights will be read to you, and you will usually sign a<br>small form which indicates that you were read your rights, you<br>understand them, and you will also tick a box indicating whether or not<br>you invoked your right to counsel.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
