<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, this is permitted. But you might want to let your fellow employees<br>know that your employer is not doing everything in its power to protect<br>them.<br><br>Employers are required to create a safe workplace, and bringing in<br>employees who have been exposed to COVID-19 during the time period when<br>they are ostensibly *most contagious* is reckless at best, and criminal<br>at worst.<br><br>But is it allowed? Sure it is. It's just not very *safe* for everyone<br>else.<br><br>So go to work, keep your mask on, and keep your distance as best as you<br>can.<br><br>And maybe look for a better job.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I was exposed to covid 2 days ago. My manager called me and demanded I<br>cover the shift today or I am fired. I am unvaccinated.
