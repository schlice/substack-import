<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No.<br><br>The old Christian children's song goes:<br><br>> Oh be careful little eyes what you see,\<br>> Oh be careful little eyes what you see,\<br>> For the Father up above is looking down with love,\<br>> So be careful little eyes what you see.<br><br>Jesus also (more graphically) talked about the sins which enter the body<br>through the eyes when He said the following in the Sermon on the Mount:<br><br>> And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It<br>> is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and<br>> be thrown into the fire of hell. ---Matthew 18:9 NIV<br><br>Now, Jesus wasn't really talking about body mutilation, and children<br>don't know if something is desirable until they see it first. What these<br>songs and passages are talking about is the truth to the old adage that<br>*the eyes are the window to the soul*. What you let in through your eyes<br>will eventually worm its way into your soul.<br><br>Indeed, the path to sin is the same for most of us: I saw it, I desired<br>it, I took it, I hid from the consequences. **I saw, I desired, I took,<br>I hid.**<br><br>Remember the song "Hallelujah" by Leonard Cohen?<br><br>> Your faith was strong but you needed proof\<br>> You saw her bathing on the roof\<br>> Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya<br><br>He was talking about King David, when he saw Bathsheba bathing one<br>night.<br><br>> Then it happened one evening that David arose from his bed and walked<br>> on the roof of the king's house. And from the roof he saw a woman<br>> bathing, and the woman was very beautiful to behold. --- 2 Samuel 11:2<br><br>Even though she was married to one of his guards, he desired her anyway.<br>And after he took her, he covered up his crime by killing his guard.<br><br>Seeing her on the roof was an accident, a mistake. **The sin happened<br>when he didn't look away**. He allowed the vision to enter his soul, and<br>his vision turned into the sin of lust.<br><br>\<br><br>So how does all of this relate to *Harry Potter*?<br><br>The *Harry Potter* books are a story. They are fiction. They do not<br>depict reality. People all over the world know this. We know there<br>really isn't a Hogwart's or a Hagrid or a Hermione or a Snape and there<br>never was, but it's fun to pretend.<br><br>But what we see with the eyes (including what we read) can burrow its<br>way into our soul and possibly cause us to sin.<br><br>The primary Christian objections to *Harry Potter* are that it is a<br>pagan text and that it encourages children to oppose authority (because<br>of Harry's rejection of the Dursley's, his adoptive family). These<br>claims are utter nonsense because 1. *Harry Potter* is not a religious<br>book and never claimed to be, and 2. the Dursley's were *objectively<br>evil* and Harry was right to oppose them.<br><br>Christians also claim that the *Potter* series is a sort of "gateway<br>drug" that will lead children away from Christianity and into Paganism<br>or Wicca or any other number of cults.<br><br>To that claim, I offer the beginning of this answer. "Be careful, little<br>eyes, what you see." Understand what you are looking at, know that it is<br>pure fantasy, and enjoy it for what it is, and nothing more.<br><br>If you have trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy, maybe *Harry<br>Potter* isn't the book you should be reading.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
