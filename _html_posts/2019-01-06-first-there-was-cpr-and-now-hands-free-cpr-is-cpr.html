<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First there was CPR and now hands free CPR. Is CPR really useful?<br><br>CPR is extremely useful, but you've stated a common misnomer.<br><br>It's not "hands-free CPR." It's actually [[Hands Only<br>CPR](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2ac8c3&url=https://cpr.heart.org/AHAECC/CPRAndECC/Programs/HandsOnlyCPR/UCM_473196_Hands-Only-CPR.jsp){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="heart.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>What they have found is that the rescue breaths are actually much less<br>needed than the chest compressions. In fact, if you do only the chest<br>compressions, you can effect a very good lifesaving technique.<br><br>The new CPR mantra to remember:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-41f062a5b475a3fffa19490bc33bbf94){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-41f062a5b475a3fffa19490bc33bbf94" master_w="340"<br>master_h="260"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>The rhythm used to be what you could compress to the beat of "Stayin'<br>Alive" in your head (about 60 compressions a minute). You actually want<br>to go slightly faster than that (now around 100 to 120 compressions a<br>minute, which means faster than one compression a second, up to maybe<br>two pushes a second). The new mantra: push hard and fast.<br><br>You want to continue compressions (i.e. do not stop) until one of two<br>things happens:<br><br>- The person basically says, "OK, that's enough, get off of me" (which<br>  means they're conscious and breathing on their own),<br>- Paramedics arrive and relieve you.<br><br>Coughing and sputtering do not mean that the person's heart is beating<br>independently and they are fully functioning on their own. Continue<br>compressions! Only stop when help arrives, or the person basically swats<br>you off of them.<br><br>If you haven't taken a Red Cross CPR and First Aid class, you should.<br>They will teach you the technique and let you try it out on a<br>Resusci-Annie doll which accurately simulates what you'll feel when<br>compressing a chest in this way.<br><br>[[CPR & First Aid Training<br>Classes](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=23731a&url=https://cpr.heart.org/AHAECC/CPRAndECC/FindACourse/Courses/UCM_473162_Find-A-Course.jsp){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="heart.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
