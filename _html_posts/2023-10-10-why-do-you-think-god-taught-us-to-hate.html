<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>While He didn't "teach" us to hate, He created us with the capacity to<br>both love and hate.<br><br>This shouldn't be surprising. We naturally hate the things which destroy<br>what we love.<br><br>And if we are made in the image of God, then God too can hate. But the<br>difference is that God's hate is *perfect*, while our hate can easily<br>lead us to sin, as we cannot hate without ill will.<br><br>We cannot love with a perfect love, nor can we hate with a perfect<br>hatred. But God can both love and hate perfectly, because He is God. God<br>can hate without sinful intent. He can hate the sinner in a perfectly<br>holy way and still lovingly forgive the sinner at the moment of<br>repentance and faith (Malachi 1:3; Revelation 2:6; 2 Peter 3:9).<br><br>It might seem a contradiction that a God who is love can also hate. Yet<br>that's exactly what the Bible says is true: God is love (1 John 4:8),<br>and God hates (Hosea 9:15). God's nature is love (He always does what is<br>best for others) and He hates that which is contrary to His nature (He<br>hates that which is contrary to love).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
