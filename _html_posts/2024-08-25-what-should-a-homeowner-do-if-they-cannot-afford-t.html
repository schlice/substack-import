<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You didn\'t mention whether or not this is \$12,000 for you, or is it<br>\$12,000 per homeowner across the entire HOA. My answer is in relation<br>to a \$12,000 special assessment per homeowner across the entire HOA.<br><br>Work out a payment plan.<br><br>Go to your Board of Directors and work out a payment plan with them.<br>Because a \$12,000 special assessment actually comes out to be about<br>\$300 a month for 3 years. I would be surprised if the Board didn\'t<br>already have a payment plan in place for all of the homeowners. \$12,000<br>is not an amount of money that most people simply have on hand. I<br>presume that there is some sort of payment plan already in place.<br><br>But if they don\'t, and they expect you to front the \$12,000 up front,<br>you can probably get a loan for that amount, and pay it back over 3<br>years, but that doesn\'t sound fair to me. I would think the Board would<br>be open to creating a payment plan for you. Unless of course the<br>\$12,000 assessment is for you only because you did something which<br>violated the rules that cost the HOA \$12,000, in which case you may<br>have to fund the loan yourself. For example, let\'s say you left a<br>faucet running in the common area and it caused \$12,000 worth of<br>damage. You would have to repay that, and the HOA can take it from you<br>in a special assessment. But that would be for you alone. In that case,<br>you would probably have to take out a loan yourself to pay them back.<br>But if it\'s an assessment for every homeowner in the entire<br>neighborhood, the HOA should be taking out the loan.<br><br>If the Board doesn\'t give you a repayment plan, you may need to hire an<br>attorney in order to challenge the Board in not creating a payment plan<br>for the assessment. However, if you can\'t afford the assessment, how<br>are you going to afford an attorney? You do it be getting together with<br>your neighbors. I presume that if you have trouble raising the \$12,000,<br>some of your neighbors probably also have trouble raising \$12,000. So<br>perhaps you and your neighbors can go in together on a lawyer to<br>pressure the HOA to create a payment plan for all of the homeowners.<br>They can spread that special assessment out over a number of years, and<br>then the HOA can take on the loan for the full amount, and use your<br>monthly payments to pay back the loan.<br><br>In actuality, when a large expense comes up for the HOA, that\'s what<br>they do. The HOA takes out the loan, and then they use a special<br>assessment spread out over a number of years for all of the homeowners<br>in order to repay the loan.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
