<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer, in the case of this pro-lifer, is infinity (or none,<br>depending on how you look at it). The reason is primarily because I<br>don't think you understand what the definition of the word misogyny is,<br>and secondarily because I don't think you understand what it means to be<br>pro-life.<br><br>Misogyny is *hatred of women*. It's more than chauvinism, which is<br>simply the belief that men are better than women. Misogyny goes further.<br>Misogynists actively hate women, simply because they are women.<br>Misogynists actively threaten, intimidate, and are directly violent<br>towards women, simply because they are women.<br><br>I do not hate women. Therefore, definitionally, I am not a misogynist.<br>Even if I were a person who directly pursued policies which<br>affirmatively physically hurt women, I might not be a misogynist if<br>I had some other reason for pursuing those policies besides hurting<br>women. Perhaps I thought that a different goal of the policy trumped the<br>physical pain my chosen policy position would inflict. The only way such<br>a choice would be misogynistic is if the goal of my pursuit of the<br>policy was to cause pain to women simply because they are women.<br><br>With that understanding, now we need to look at why I'm a pro-lifer, and<br>at the same time understand what it means to be pro-life. We just<br>established that in order to be misogynistic, I would have to be a<br>pro-lifer just to cause violence and pain to women. I am not a pro-lifer<br>because I desire to cause pain to women.<br><br>I am a pro-lifer because I value the sanctity of all life<br>*equally* at all stages of its development.<br><br>That's it. Nothing more, and nothing less.<br><br>The opposite is true as well. At their core, **a person who is a<br>pro-choicer places *differential value* on life depending on its<br>temporal locality**. "Temporal locality" is just a fancy term meaning<br>"position in time and space." Position in time means how old it is, and<br>position in space means where it is physically located. Pro-choice<br>people place a lower value on life when it is pre-born, and when it is<br>in the womb.<br><br>You can try to make as many arguments as you like, I've heard them all<br>and I've debated most of them. And once we have exhausted all the<br>bullets in our collective arsenals, the two fundamental truths I shared<br>above remain: I value all life equally at all stages of its development,<br>and the pro-choicer devalues the life of the fetus because it is a fetus<br>and because it is pre-born. And just so that we are clear, believing<br>that it is okay to kill a baby because a woman is inconvenienced or<br>uncomfortable means that you value a woman's comfort and convenience<br>over the life of a baby. This is only possible if you devalue the baby<br>because it is pre-born and because it is so early in its development.<br><br>TL;DR: I don't care who you are. I don't care what structures reside<br>between your legs. Just don't kill babies at any age. That is not a<br>misogynistic position, because it is not intended to hurt women. "Just<br>don't kill babies" doesn't hurt women, and since that's not the goal of<br>the position, it is, by definition, not misogyny.<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to engage with me in a civil manner, and I do like<br>that. But do not misunderstand, my mental well-being isn\'t worth your<br>harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit.<br>If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion<br>masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your<br>own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.<br>If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"<br>don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything<br>vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a<br>block and a mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with<br>no compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
