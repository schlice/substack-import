<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I've prayed to God for him to give me a sign or vision to show me that<br>he is here every night and I feel like any of my prayers aren't being<br>answered, what should I do?**<br><br>When I was young, I prayed to God to get laser beam eyes. No joke. You<br>might be surprised to learn that I, in fact, do not have laser beam<br>eyes.<br><br>When I was a little older, I prayed to God to reveal himself to me in<br>some way I could see. I never actually saw him.<br><br>Then, I learned.<br><br>I prayed to God to better understand what he had in store for my life,<br>and to be happy with that. He didn't answer right away (he answered in<br>his time), but he answered.<br><br>I prayed to God to have him take over, just do with my life whatever he<br>wanted, because I was so distraught and depressed that the thought of<br>swallowing the barrel of my gun did not immediately disgust me. I was in<br>such anguish, and for the first time in my life, I heard him speak. He<br>said, and I quote, "be patient."<br><br>I had an answer! But the answer was, "Relax, I'm here, I've got this,"<br>and more importantly, "I've always been here."<br><br>The point of this story is that **praying to God is not about getting<br>what *you* want. It's about being happy with what *he***<br>wants. And what he wants is for you to just talk to him. Tell him<br>about how you feel. Tell him about your day. Tell him everything, even<br>though he already knows all and sees all. He wants to hear it from you,<br>because it helps you to acknowledge it. He also has given all of us free<br>will, so he wants you to choose him. He wants you to keep choosing him<br>over everything else in the world.<br><br>And don't be surprised if he doesn't answer in a way that you can<br>immediately see or hear. He will answer, but in his time, and in his<br>way, *if it is his will*. When Jesus was going through the worst part of<br>his life, right before he was arrested and crucified, he prayed to God<br>and basically said if its possible, don't do this to me, **but if it's<br>your will, I'll do it**.<br><br>> Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and<br>> prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me.<br>> Yet not as I will, but as you will." ---Matthew 26:39 NIV<br><br>Jesus was saying, *I'm scared. I don't want to do this. But I trust you,<br>and if you want me to do this, I will.*<br><br>We don't pray to God to change him. We pray to God to change *us*.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
