<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [*In this answer, I differentiate \"in the military\" with<br>\"not in the military\" by differentiating commissioned officers and<br>NCOs as \"in the military\" and military contractors and civilians as<br>\"not in the military\". Basically, if you wear the uniform to work,<br>you\'re in the military. If you wear a suit to work, you\'re not in the<br>military. Civilians and contractors don\'t \"join the army.\" They join<br>civilian corporations that work for the Army. They may work alongside<br>their military counterparts in military installations, but they are not<br>military. I will be discussing non-combat career fields in the<br>military.*\<br>\<br>Everyone in the military is a soldier/sailor/airman first, and a<br>specialist next. No one is a \"non-soldier.\" I know you meant no<br>offense by that question, but we are all soldiers. Wearing the uniform<br>puts you in the same category as so many others who have come before<br>giving their lives for their country. Wearing the uniform makes you a<br>soldier, regardless of what job you have to do in the military. Not<br>everyone is on the front lines. Not everyone flies the planes or drives<br>the sub or shoots the missiles. There are many cogs in the military<br>machine, and all have important jobs.\<br>\<br>Perfect example: In 1992, the drawdown from Desert Storm meant that the<br>number of pilot slots for Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) for the<br>USAFA Class of 1994 went from over 1,000 down to 225. This meant that<br>roughly 75% of the over 1,000 pilot qualified cadets were not going to<br>fly.\<br>\<br>When this news was presented to the class, they gave us an extra week to<br>decide whether or not we wanted to stay at the Academy, knowing that we<br>were, more likely than not, not going to fly. This was a tough decision<br>for many cadets who spent their lives dreaming of \"Top Gun\" and about<br>wearing the flight suit and the leather jacket.\<br>\<br>This taught us a valuable lesson, something that many other classes at<br>the Academy simply didn\'t get. You are officers first, and pilots next.<br>Your college major doesn\'t matter. Your chosen career field doesn\'t<br>matter. You are all officers first. Graduating from the Academy doesn\'t<br>make you primarily a pilot, or a computer scientist (which is where I<br>went when I couldn\'t fly), or whatever. It makes you an Air Force<br>officer. Your career field is secondary to that.\<br>\<br>And a note about military computer scientists: Look 20 years down the<br>road. We are going to have UAVs as combat pilots, and a pilot seated in<br>a virtual cockpit with a 360 degree view of the battlefield that he can<br>see as he swivels his head. Is this pilot \"Billy Bad-Ass\" who can<br>withstand 9+ G\'s and chews nails and spits out quarters? Nope, he\'s an<br>R/C enthusiast and/or a gamer. Billy Bad-Ass pilots say that it will<br>never happen. Regardless of their bravado or vitriol, they are wrong.<br>Removing all of the weight of the life support systems from the cockpit<br>will allow us to put that many more bullets or bombs in that weapons<br>platform. And air power will not be the primary theater that will need<br>control in battlefields of the future. Space Dominance will be key, as<br>all of our wars will be directed by satellite links to our unmanned<br>aircraft and warfighting robots. And it\'s all made possible by<br>\"computer scientists\". It may have been that the military could<br>function without its comm in the old days, but not any more. The<br>military is dead in the water without comm.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
