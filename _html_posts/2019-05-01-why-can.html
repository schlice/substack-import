<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why can't we, as citizens of our own country, file a lawsuit to<br>prosecute politicians for breaking international law?**<br><br>US citizens are not bound by international law. Therefore, you cannot<br>prosecute politicians for violations of international law because it's<br>not a prosecutable offense in US courts.<br><br>**Why don't courts recognize international law so citizens could file a<br>lawsuit to prosecute politicians for breaking international law?**<br><br>Courts do not recognize international law because courts have no<br>jurisdiction over international law. US courts are only authorized to<br>interpret the constitutionality of US laws. International law is not<br>controlled, nor administered, by the United States, and therefore is not<br>under the purview of the United States.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
