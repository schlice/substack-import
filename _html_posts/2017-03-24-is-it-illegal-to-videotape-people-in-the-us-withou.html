<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Along with what everyone else says, it sounds like you're talking about<br>school (probably high school or possibly middle school). Your ability to<br>record videos are also subject to your school's rules, which are tighter<br>than local laws.<br><br>Besides the fact that your videos probably won't help you at all, they<br>may be restricted by your school.<br><br>A better tack to take would be to talk to your teacher about it rather<br>than resorting to video recordings. Explain that your group is not doing<br>any work and either ask to be transferred to another group, or ask to do<br>the project on your own. I'd rather be 100% responsible for all the work<br>than to be 100% responsible for the whole group's work AND carry the<br>rest of the group along.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
