<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would Michael Jackson not have died of stress rated ailments, if he<br>was never falsely accused for sexul offenses? If so, shouldn\'t his<br>false accusers be charged with murder?**<br><br>1.  You simply cannot know that his death (which was actually caused by<br>    medication interactions which he was taking due to stress) was due<br>    to the stress of the lawsuits. He was acquitted in 2005, and he died<br>    in 2009. The court cases wouldn't even be seen as a proximate event<br>    to his death, so it's unlikely that they would ever be seen as<br>    causative.<br>2.  Murder is a very specific crime which requires the taking of a life,<br>    with malice, and forethought. It would be a tremendous stretch (and<br>    one which would require weighty and convincing evidence) to show<br>    that the sexual offense accusers were acting with the specific goal<br>    of causing Jackson's death through medical malpractice, which they<br>    could never know would take place four years in the future.<br><br>It's simply an impossibility to believe that the people who accused<br>Jackson of sexual offenses would have known that he would be subjected<br>to medical malpractice four years in the future.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
