<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I was attacked by a homeowner as I was grabbing his package from his<br>porch. Isn\'t this use of excessive force since I didn\'t attack him? He<br>broke my shoulder in the attack.**<br><br>The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends." It depends on<br>where you were when the attack took place.<br><br>If you were in a US state, then it depends on if it is one of the more<br>than 25 states which have "stand your ground" laws on the books, or one<br>of the handful of states who have interpreted their self-defense law in<br>a way which allows you to exercise a version of "stand your ground." If<br>that is the case, then a homeowner can use force to eject a trespasser<br>from his property. In some states, the homeowner may use deadly force if<br>he believes the trespasser is going to commit, or is already committing,<br>a *forcible felony* (any felony involving the use of force against the<br>victim). He can use the threat of deadly force to preclude such a felony<br>from taking place.<br><br>Some states have a "duty to retreat." If your attack took place in one<br>of those states, you could sue for damages.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
