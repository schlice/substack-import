<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>While the Bible doesn't specifically mention this, we do know that God<br>keeps a record of sins and for those who have not repented and turned to<br>Christ as savior, they will be held to account for all of their sins.<br><br>> Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God,<br>> for it is written, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord."<br>> \-- Romans 12:19 ESV<br><br>More likely than not, this punishment will not take place during our<br>lifetimes, or during their lifetime, either. This punishment will take<br>place at the day of judgement, when we all stand before the throne of a<br>sovereign God and He reviews the record of our sins. Remember though,<br>only those who have repented and have accepted Christ as our savior can<br>be assured that His sacrifice pays for our sins.<br><br>Remember too that if those who have hurt and betrayed us ***truly<br>sought repentance and were saved*, then they too are covered by the<br>blood of Christ.** If you read that last sentence and felt anger that<br>this person might not suffer for what they have done, then you must<br>examine your own heart and see what it is that you desire. Because if a<br>person can be saved by the blood of Christ and you feel like "justice<br>was not served," then you want vengeance *for yourself*. You want a<br>pound of flesh for what was done to you.<br><br>You must realize that this is not a problem of theirs, but is instead a<br>problem of yours.<br><br>If you feel this way, you must let go of those feelings. God will repay,<br>not you. You are not commanded to repay. You are commanded to love and<br>forgive. Jesus talked about it during His famed Sermon on the Mount:<br><br>> "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a<br>> tooth.' But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if<br>> anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And<br>> if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak<br>> as well. And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two<br>> miles. Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one<br>> who would borrow from you. \-- Matthew 5:38--42 ESV<br><br>So it feels like God is telling us that we must let this need for<br>vengeance go. Vengeance is for God, not for us. This is hard for us to<br>do, and we can't do it without Him. If you feel this way, bring these<br>concerns to God, who knows what you need even before you ask Him for it.<br>But ask Him anyway; He wants to hear you say it. He wants you to lean on<br>Him for your needs. Have Him help you work through this pain and<br>forgive. And if punishment is due, rest assured that God will take<br>revenge on the last day.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
