<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> From question comments:<br>><br>> *I have a neighbor who is borderline crazy. We\'ve been trying to do<br>> property work legally while she wants to do it under the table. Today<br>> we saw a video camera in her 2nd story window pointing directly on our<br>> side into our backyard... is this illegal?*<br><br>As with any legal question, the answer is "it depends." Laws regarding<br>video recordings vary from state to state. But realistically, if you<br>stop and think about it, if she can see the same view of your yard from<br>that window that she can see from the camera, she's really not seeing<br>anything more than she would have by just sitting in front of the<br>window.<br><br>If it's a security camera, and she can show that it's looking at things<br>she is responsible for protecting (even if it also sees stuff in your<br>yard), this is legal.<br><br>What may be actionable is what she intends on doing with any footage she<br>gets from such a camera. For the most part, these actions are pretty<br>similar across states.<br><br>If she intends to file a lawsuit against you, the video "evidence" she<br>presents from that camera would not be admissible, as it was obtained by<br>violating privacy. You have a reasonable expectation of privacy in your<br>yard, that's why you have a 6 foot privacy fence (they call it a privacy<br>fence for a reason, btw). Looking over such a fence to gather "evidence"<br>has already been adjudicated to be an invasion of privacy.<br><br>If she tried to make a documentary and get monetary gain from that<br>documentary, this too would be illegal. Your likeness cannot be used for<br>commercial gain without your consent.<br><br>She could give the footage to the local news, which would be fine. She<br>could write a scholarly paper at the local university and include stills<br>from the camera, although they would likely attempt to get some<br>permission from you before they publish, even though it's technically<br>legal. She could even publish stills here on Quora, as long as she was<br>not attempting to acquire any money for her post. Educational uses do<br>not violate the privacy exceptions. And finally, if she just loves your<br>yard and keeps any video to herself, this is also not likely to be too<br>much of a concern either.<br><br>Although it is really creepy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
