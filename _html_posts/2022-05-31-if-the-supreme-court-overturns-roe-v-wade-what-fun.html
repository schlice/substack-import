<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Interesting. A little history:<br><br>> In its 1987 decision in *South Dakota v. Dole*, which arguably remains<br>> the leading case regarding the use of the federal government's<br>> conditional spending power, the Court held that legislation enacted<br>> pursuant to the Spending Clause must be in pursuit of the "general<br>> welfare." In addition, the Dole Court held that any conditions<br>> attached to the receipt of federal funds must: (1) be unambiguously<br>> established so that recipients can knowingly accept or reject them;<br>> (2) be germane to the federal interest in the particular national<br>> projects or programs to which the money is directed; (3) not violate<br>> other provisions of the Constitution, such as the First Amendment or<br>> the Due Process or Takings Clauses of the Fifth Amendment; and (4) not<br>> cross the line from enticement to impermissible coercion, such that<br>> states have no real choice but to accept the funding and enact or<br>> administer a federal regulatory program. The fourth of these criteria,<br>> in particular, is intended to ensure that any conditions on federal<br>> grant funds do not run afoul of the Tenth Amendment's prohibition on<br>> the federal government's "commandeering" of state or local governments<br>> or officials by requiring them to carry out federal<br>> programs.\[1\](#XBieU){#cite-XBieU .citation_link}<br><br>In other words, it's at least legally questionable whether or not the<br>Federal government can use spending restrictions to impermissibly coerce<br>states.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, what funds does the<br>president have the discretion to withhold from states to pressure the<br>decision one way or another?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-XBieU){.citation_index} [[The Federal Government's<br>Authority to Impose Conditions on Grant<br>Funds](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ca11e6&url=https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R44797.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="everycrsreport.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
