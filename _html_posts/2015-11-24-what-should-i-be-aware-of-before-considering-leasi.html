<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [A2A\<br>\<br>Legally, you should consider zoning laws in your area. You need to<br>ensure that the locality in which you live permits you to build aerials<br>on top of your house. There are regulations such as max height and<br>transmitting in your area, but this is all dependent on exactly where<br>you are located and how it is zoned.\<br>\<br>Since we\'re talking cell phones, the radiation levels are not unsafe<br>(if you were talking microwave long-haul telephone, that would be a<br>different story altogether). The amount of radiation you get from a cell<br>phone tower is about 10,000 times less energetic than the UV radiation<br>you get from standing in the sun, and not many people have developed<br>radiation poisoning from standing in the sun. You should enquire as to<br>how the house below the tower is shielded, or if the beam is beamformed<br>in such a way that there is no impact to the residence below.\<br>\<br>You should consider what needs to happen when the cell phone company<br>needs to do maintenance on the equipment. Be aware that most of that<br>maintenance will be off-hours (evenings and weekends). Will they notify<br>you, or will they have rights to waltz onto your property at any time<br>they choose and climb up to your roof?\<br>\<br>Then, as some of the other answers alluded to, you should ask the<br>\"what\'s in it for me\" questions. Besides the money you will receive<br>from the lease agreement, will your signal improve? If not, can they add<br>an attached picocell to the tower gear to do so? I mean, if you have a<br>cell on your roof, you should have full signal<br>everywhere.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
