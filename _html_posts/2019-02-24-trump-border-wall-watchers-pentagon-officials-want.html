<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Trump Border Wall Watchers: Pentagon Officials want to move money from<br>other departments to cover the shortfall in the counterdrug funds<br>account that has been almost completely drained. Congress has promised<br>to disallow the move. What will Trump do?**<br><br>Congress may have promised to disallow the move, but just like they<br>promised not to let Trump declare a national emergency and use the<br>military, they can't stop this either.<br><br>Why? *They already wrote it into the law.*<br><br>10 USC ยง2808(a) states (emphasis mine):<br><br>> In the event of a declaration of war or the declaration by the<br>> President of a national emergency in accordance with the National<br>> Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) that requires use of the<br>> armed forces, the Secretary of Defense, without regard to any other<br>> provision of law, may undertake military construction projects, and<br>> **may authorize the Secretaries of the military departments to<br>> undertake military construction projects**, not otherwise authorized<br>> by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces.<br>> Such projects may be undertaken *o*nly within the total amount of<br>> funds that have been appropriated for military construction, including<br>> funds appropriated for family housing, that have not been obligated.<br><br>Nothing here says that your department must be engaged in the area<br>affected by the national emergency before your funds can be requested,<br>and if your department approves the use of those funds, they can be<br>used.<br><br>Also relevant is 10 USC ยง284, which allows the secretary of defense to<br><br>> provide support for the counterdrug activities or activities to<br>> counter transnational organized crime of any other department or<br>> agency of the Federal Government or of any State, local, tribal, or<br>> foreign law enforcement agency for the purposes set forth in the<br>> section if requested by another Federal agency or State, local, or<br>> tribal governments in support of law enforcement efforts.<br><br>Those purposes include, among other things,<br><br>> \c\onstruction of roads and fences and installation of lighting to<br>> block drug smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the<br>> United States,<br><br>as well as<br><br>> \t\he establishment (including an unspecified minor military<br>> construction project) and operation of bases of operations or training<br>> facilities for the purpose of facilitating counterdrug activities or<br>> activities to counter transnational organized crime of the Department<br>> of Defense or any Federal, State, local, or tribal law enforcement<br>> agency within or outside the United States.<br><br>Those are pretty broad allowances given to the president during a period<br>of national emergency. It appears that from a plain reading of the law,<br>the Secretary of Defense can request allocation of funds from other<br>departments for use during a national emergency, and those departments<br>can provide those funds.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
