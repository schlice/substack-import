<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You\'re not obligated to declare against yourself in a<br>police investigation either. You are just held under a different<br>standard.\<br>\<br>The 5th Amendment states (the important part highlighted), \"No person<br>shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime,<br>unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases<br>arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual<br>service in time of war or public danger; nor shall any person be subject<br>for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; **nor<br>shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against<br>himself**, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due<br>process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use,<br>without just compensation.\"\<br>\<br>There\'s a lot of different things in there (the Double Jeopardy clause,<br>the Due Process clause, etc), but the important one is the one that<br>protects you against self-incrimination.\<br>\<br>In a police investigation, you are protected by the ruling in *Miranda v<br>Arizona*, commonly referred to as the *Miranda* rule. It says you don\'t<br>have to make any statements, but anything you do say will be used<br>against you in court. In a police investigation, you haven\'t yet been<br>charged with a crime, so the 5th Amendment does not apply, because you<br>haven\'t been held to answer for a crime yet. That\'s why the Miranda<br>ruling is so important.\<br>\<br>In a courtroom, your statements are protected by the 5th Amendment,<br>which protects you from self-incrimination. At this point, you\'ve<br>already been charged with a crime, so the 5th Amendment<br>applies.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
