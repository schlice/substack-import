If you mean the<br>traditional definition of assault rifles, which means automatic weapons,<br>those are most definitely illegal.\<br>\<br>Extended magazines are illegal in most states.\<br>\<br>All gun sales from gun shows or gun Stores require background checks.<br>Only private party sales don\'t require background checks in most<br>states.\<br>\<br>So you\'re mostly wrong.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
