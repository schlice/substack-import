<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Since your question is a little thin on details, I'll assume by "record"<br>you mean with video cameras, in common spaces (not private spaces like<br>changing rooms or bathrooms).<br><br>First of all, they are not recorded without their consent. Entering the<br>protected facility (i.e. the space where cameras are in use) means that<br>you have read and agreed to the rules of that space, which clearly state<br>that cameras are in use. Therefore, by you entering that space, you<br>imply that you read and understood the rules, and that you would be<br>recorded, and you consent to such recording.<br><br>Same holds true for your Internet usage at work, and your phone calls<br>while using a company phone line. For your Internet, you signed a usage<br>agreement when you hired on, which includes your usage of any technology<br>(computers, telephones, etc).<br><br>None of it is done "without your consent."<br><br>Why do companies monitor you? They have a right to protect their assets,<br>and their usage of their assets. They also have a right to ensure that<br>company confidential information is not being misused or stolen. They<br>have the right to make sure that their assets are not being misused.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
