<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [I live in Colorado. We allow open carry here. I see it all<br/>the time. People don\'t bat an eye (usually) around here when they see<br/>someone open carry.\<br/>\<br/>The difference is \*what\* they carry openly that will determine if<br/>there is an issue.\<br/>\<br/>Most people who open carry will have a pistol on their hip; no big deal.<br/>On rare occasion, you will see someone carry an AR-15 or a rifle.<br/>THIS is what attracts attention. It\'s certainly not illegal, but it<br/>does raise eyebrows and sometimes causes some calls to police, because<br/>the Aurora theater shooter and Columbine are all still fresh in<br/>Coloradan\'s minds. The police then have to investigate, determine<br/>whether or not the person is following the law, reassure the nearby<br/>public, and leave.\<br/>\<br/>By the way, these people are usually carrying AR-15s and other long guns<br/>in public because they are trying to demonstrate that they have the<br/>right to do so (the \"right-to-open-carry\" crowd). It\'s a hassle for<br/>everyone involved. Many times, they will video the entire police<br/>encounter to try to trick the police into violating a right so that they<br/>can file suit against the department. Usually, as long as the police<br/>were acting in good faith and in the interest of the public at large,<br/>the suits are dropped. But it requires a full-time legal staff at the<br/>police department to handle this stuff. See the hassle<br/>here?]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
