<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There\'s nothing wrong with anxiety after witnessing a<br>crime. Crime in your neighborhood is not normal, so when something<br>traumatic like that happens in your neighborhood, it can be scary.\<br>\<br>Your best bet is to be prepared. Preparation can overcome anxiety every<br>time.\<br>]<br><br>- Make sure your home has layers of security: a well-lit exterior,<br>  shrubbery which does not obscure the view of windows, solid-core front<br>  door, etc. Make sure all your windows and doors securely lock and<br>  can\'t be jimmied. Some of these little fixes are very inexpensive and<br>  be done in just a few minutes, like adding a wood dowel to the track<br>  of a sliding glass door. Your local police department\'s community<br>  outreach officer may be able to do a security walkthrough with you and<br>  help you identify weak points. This may not be a bad thing to do.<br>  Check with your local police department to see if they offer such a<br>  service; not all departments do.\<br>- Get a dog. Even a smaller dog will be a deterrent, but normally I\'d<br>  recommend a full-size dog. My dog would probably have licked an<br>  intruder to death, but you wouldn\'t have known it from her bark. She<br>  was the friendliest dog in the world, but she sounded like she\'d tear<br>  your face off.\<br>- You might also consider getting a real security system. It will help<br>  alert you if someone tries to come into your house, and can call the<br>  police on your behalf as well.\<br>- Finally, establish a \"safe room\" in your home that you can go to if<br>  someone makes it in. It should have only one door, and if it\'s a<br>  standard interior door, you should consider replacing it with a<br>  solid-core door with a deadbolt. Put a few bottles of water in there,<br>  and make sure you have a cell phone and a charger there as well. If<br>  you always have your phone with you, just make sure you\'ve got a<br>  charger. You can retreat to your safe room and lock yourself in and<br>  call the police. You can yell through the door, \"I\'m on the phone<br>  with police, and I\'m armed. Don\'t come in here or I\'ll shoot you.<br>  You better leave now or the police will catch you.\" Whether or not<br>  you have a gun is irrelevant.\<br>- Don\'t open the door for him if he comes to your door. You should have<br>  a peephole. If it\'s too small or ineffective, you can fairly easily<br>  and rather inexpensively replace it with a peephole camera. There are<br>  lots of great solutions out there.<br><br>And as [[Todd<br>Allen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Todd-Allen-9)]{.qlink_container}<br>said, seeking the advise of a counselor is not a bad thing. Have them<br>help you with your anxiety. But being prepared is always a good thing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
