<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The phrase conveys exactly enough information to prejudge the situation<br>without knowing any of the pertinent facts.<br><br>The two most important things to remember<br><br>1.  **Unless you're attempting to inject the pretense of racial bias,<br>    there is no need to indicate any of the races of any of the people<br>    involved.** Race has no bearing on whether or not an individual is<br>    dangerous. In fact, it is well-established that police are more<br>    likely to shoot whites than blacks, and it is also well established<br>    that white police officers are less inclined to shoot blacks than<br>    black or Hispanic police officers. There is little to no evidence<br>    that race plays any part at all in who gets shot by police.<br>2.  "Unarmed" does not equal "not dangerous." There are plenty of<br>    situations in which unarmed individuals can legally be stopped with<br>    lethal force. For example, persons who are not in a stable mental<br>    state can cause serious bodily harm to police or to bystanders<br>    without being armed. Also, people who are on drugs can cause death<br>    or serious bodily harm, and are virtually immune to pain compliance<br>    techniques (i.e. Tasers).\<br>    \<br>    Remember, police do not shoot to kill, nor do they shoot to "not<br>    kill." Police shoot to stop a threat. If they are allowed to use<br>    lethal force (which is something determined by a court afterwards),<br>    they shoot until the threat is stopped. The threat must be<br>    "objectively reasonable," which means that we can't review the<br>    situation from the lens of hindsight; we must review the situation<br>    from the officer's point of view, at the time of the incident. How<br>    much information did the officer have? What factors did he use to<br>    make his judgement on whether or not the person was a threat? What<br>    did he know at the time, not what should he have known?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
