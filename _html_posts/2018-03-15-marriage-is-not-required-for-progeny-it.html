<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Marriage is not required for progeny, its just a law. So, thousands of<br>years ago, before medicine had yet to advance, why was marriage made<br>up?**<br><br>Marriage existed before governments and before modern religions<br><br>From our partners over at<br>[Slate.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=64d255&url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2013/02/same_sex_marriage_when_did_weddings_become_religious_events.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="slate.com"}]{.qlink_container}:<br><br>> Marriage developed independently in hundreds of human civilizations,<br>> so it's difficult to pinpoint history's first marriage or even the<br>> society that first conceived of marriage as an institution. Early<br>> Sumerian marriage agreements, which date to the third millennium B.C.,<br>> are among the oldest records relating to marriage. The couples [[swore<br>> an<br>> oath](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3bac67&url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/mesopotamia-contracts.asp){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="fordham.edu"}]{.qlink_container} to a series of deities in<br>> a small number of agreements, but most of the records contain no<br>> mention of gods or religion, suggesting that the Sumerians viewed<br>> weddings as legal events. The terms of marriage were decidedly<br>> contractual, including specific worldly punishments for cheating. (The<br>> penalty for male infidelity was 10 shekels in alimony to the jilted<br>> wife. If the wife strayed, she would be strangled and dumped into a<br>> river.) There is no indication that someone who violated the marriage<br>> agreement suffered the eternal wrath of Shamash and Marduk, or that<br>> those deities took a personal interest in strong marriages.<br>><br>> The ancient Hebraic take on marriage is difficult to ascertain.<br>> Scholars have argued for years over whether to translate the Old<br>> Testament word describing a marriage agreement as "contract," which is<br>> a simple agreement between two parties, or "covenant," which includes<br>> an additional vow to God. One of the difficulties is that the Old<br>> Testament uses the same word to describe both God's relationship with<br>> the Israelites and a husband's promise to his wife. Some ancient<br>> Hebrew writers explicitly analogized those two commitments, and, of<br>> course, the Ten Commandments mention God's aversion to adultery.<br>> However, like the Sumerian marriage agreements, documents describing<br>> ancient Jewish marriages are mostly [[lists of legal obligations and<br>> consequences](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=adc6f7&url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id%3DZ-MDLRaMhTsC%26pg%3DPA15){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="google.co.uk"}]{.qlink_container} and rarely contain<br>> spiritual language. It's likely that the idea of marriage as a sacred<br>> union involving God developed over time among ancient Jews, but the<br>> evidence is open to interpretation.<br><br>So before government regulated marriage, and before religion ordained<br>marriage as an institution, marriage was essentially a contract made in<br>the presence of some deities between two people.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
