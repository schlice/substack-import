<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You should be able to unsubscribe without logging in, but<br>the CAN-SPAM Act does not discuss specifics of how websites should<br>operate. It talks about how mailing lists should be entered, that people<br>should always maintain control over their membership, mailing lists<br>should be \"opt-in\" instead of \"opt-out\" as their first order of<br>business, and people should have control over their mailing list<br>preferences at all times.\<br>\<br>Have you tried the opposite tactic? Try staying away from the mailing<br>list section, and instead try to sign up for an account at the site,<br>which should tell you that you already have one. Then use the \"Forgot<br>Password\" link to reset your password.\<br>\<br>The site should have a way to contact them (usually at the bottom). Try<br>to contact them if the above fails.\<br>\<br>If all of this fails and you still believe the site is operating in<br>violation of spam laws, contact the Attorney General\'s office in your<br>state. They handle spam issues for the residents of their<br>state.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
