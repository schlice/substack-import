<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The takedown was excessive, in my opinion.\<br>\<br>Cops need to keep in mind, regardless of how uncooperative she was, that<br>she was drunk, and they could easily hurt her. Force that would normally<br>be used on a non-intoxicated person has to be adjusted for the<br>intoxicated person who doesn\'t respond in as coordinated a manner.\<br>\<br>The public also needs to understand that some people are sloppy drunks,<br>and some people are violent drunks. Some people get far more aggressive<br>when they are drunk. Drunks can\'t be left to their own devices, and<br>uncooperative drunks can turn violent in a heartbeat. She had been<br>uncooperative since their initial contact.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
