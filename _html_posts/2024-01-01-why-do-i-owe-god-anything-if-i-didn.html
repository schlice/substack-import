<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So let me get this straight. You know God exists. You know God created<br>you. But because you didn't *ask* to be born (which makes absolutely no<br>sense whatsoever, because it means you would have to exist before you<br>existed), you don't owe God anything.<br><br>But God didn't ask you for anything, did He? Is He asking for *payment*<br>for creating you? Is He asking for *fealty* for creating you? He hasn't<br>asked you for anything in return. Do you feel like thanking Him for<br>creating you is some kind of *obligation?*<br><br>There is no obligation here. God created you with free will. You can<br>choose to love Him or reject Him, and it will have zero impact on your<br>life whatsoever. You can go on about your life and simply pretend He<br>doesn't exist, and He won't hurt you at all. He'll just let you live,<br>and let you die.<br><br>But at that point, you'll be gone. The complete and utter separation<br>from God will be final, and *eternal*. Your only opportunity to live on<br>after you die can be secured during this life.<br><br>You have an opportunity here. You can learn about why you were created.<br>You can learn about why Jesus needed to come to earth and die on a<br>cross. You can learn all of it while you're alive.<br><br>Or you can continue to shake your fist at God.<br><br>Your choice.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
