<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [A2A\<br>\<br>Could they? Of course they could. The mechanism for doing so is in place<br>and is not expected to change.\<br>\<br>Will they? Not any time soon. Remember, you need a supermajority in<br>Congress (that\'s a 2/3 majority, not a simple majority which is just<br>\"more than half\"). Once they do, it becomes a Constitutional Amendment<br>once 3/4ths of the states ratify it. So that means you need ratification<br>in 34 of the states for the Amendment to be added to the Constitution.\<br>\<br>It\'s a difficult, but not impossible process. It\'s happened 17 times<br>in the history of the United States (the first 10 were ratified<br>together), making 27 Constitutional Amendments. The last Amendment was<br>added in 1992; the one previous in 1971. So it\'s absolutely possible to<br>amend the Constitution.\<br>\<br>So will the US ever repeal the Second Amendment? When popular support<br>for doing so actually exists, there will be an amendment that repeals<br>the Second Amendment. Until popular support exists for it, however, it<br>will never be repealed.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
