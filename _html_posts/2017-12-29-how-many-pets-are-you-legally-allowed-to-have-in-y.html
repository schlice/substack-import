<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How many pets are you legally allowed to have in your town, and do you<br>have more pets than the town\'s legal limit?**<br><br>Where I live, the city has limits on how many and what types of pets you<br>can own, and our HOA has tighter restrictions on the same. In our HOA,<br>I'm reasonably certain (off the top of my head) that you can have no<br>more than four pets living with you on your property.<br><br>I have never heard of this regulation enforced, and even if it was, it<br>would only be because we had a Crazy Cat Lady who owned 20 cats and took<br>in another 20 strays and her house smelled like a cat box from a block<br>away. Not only does that produce a nuisance odor, but it is an<br>environmental toxin, and hurts the neighborhood overall, so at that<br>point the HOA would step in.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
