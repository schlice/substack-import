<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because Trump drops that much *everywhere he goes*.<br><br>Estimates circulating online placed the cost of Secret Service<br>protection alone at \$7 to \$10 million, with air travel and motorcade<br>expenses ranging from \$4 to \$5 million. Additional costs included<br>stadium security enhancements and local law enforcement support,<br>bringing the total up to \$20 million.<br><br>Basically, anywhere Trump goes, it's going to cost upwards of \$10 to<br>\$15 million, because as the President of the United States, he is<br>entitled to full-time Secret Service protection. Air Force One must be<br>paid for, as well as his travel entourage, which includes his<br>communications and logistics teams he needs to stay in constant<br>communications.<br><br>How can taxpayers avoid these "ridiculously high" expenses?<br><br>1.  Don't let Trump travel anywhere.<br>2.  Don't let Trump pick where he goes and where he does not.<br>3.  Make Trump pay for his own security.<br>4.  Remove some of the requirements he has to stay in constant<br>    communications.<br><br>Since none of these options are really viable, these are just the costs<br>necessary to protect the President. And in case we've forgotten, these<br>security measures are<br>[absolutely(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e23815&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Donald_Trump_in_Pennsylvania){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br>[required(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6bc975&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Donald_Trump_in_Florida){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>Our President needs to be visible. He needs to be out there, supporting<br>the things that we support, doing the things that we do. He is *OUR*<br>President. He needs to be out there with *US*. So there will<br>necessarily be a cost to that.<br><br>But for everyone clutching their pearls about \$20 million in travel<br>costs, DOGE has already saved the country \$65 billion. With *just<br>the savings Trump's team has found in his first month in office,* Trump<br>can pay for 3,250 Super Bowl trips.<br><br>Time to stop missing the forest for the trees.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
