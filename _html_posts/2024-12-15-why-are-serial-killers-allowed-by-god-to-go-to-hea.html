<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Anyone who *truly* repents of their sins and trusts in Jesus as their<br>Lord and Savior, who truly believes that He died to pay for their sins,<br>will be saved.<br><br>No one's sin is too great that it can't be forgiven. Are you saying that<br>God is incapable of forgiving some sin? Or that He's not as loving as<br>people make Him out to be? Or that His mercy has limits? Or that some<br>people are beyond saving?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
