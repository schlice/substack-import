<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Really, your only option is to contact the detective who owns the case<br>and let him/her know that you no longer want to pursue the case. The<br>detectives may choose to continue to investigate. They may choose to<br>close the case. That is entirely up to them. Once you have opened an<br>investigation with the police department, it is up to them whether or<br>not they will continue to pursue it.<br><br>However, if you were the victim who opened the case, and you call and<br>tell them you are no longer pursuing charges against the alleged<br>criminal, it\'s likely the police will close the case, citing \"victim<br>rescinding charges\" or \"uncooperative/unresponsive victim\".<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
