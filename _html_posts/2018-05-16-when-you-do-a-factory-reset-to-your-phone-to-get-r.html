<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**When you do a factory reset to your phone to get rid of malware, and<br>you do a back up first, won\'t you be backing up the malware too?**<br><br>The answer, of course, is "it depends." Primarily, it depends on the<br>source of the malware. Secondarily, it depends on whether or not you are<br>rooted and what kind of wipe/restore you are performing.<br><br>For the sake of discussion, I'll assume we're talking about Android,<br>because malware is more likely to occur in the Android ecosystem than in<br>the Apple ecosystem, especially because Android allows "Unknown Sources"<br>(i.e. APK files downloaded off of the Internet) to be used to install<br>apps on your device.<br><br>The theory revolves around the fact that when you wipe and re-install,<br>your Google backup does not contain the APKs (i.e. source files) for the<br>applications you are reinstalling. It only contains an index file<br>showing all of the apps which were on your phone. During the<br>installation process, that list is used to reach back to the Google Play<br>repository and re-download the source files for re-installation. If the<br>app is not hosted on Google Play, it will not be re-installed<br>automatically after wiping and re-loading.<br><br>To that end:<br><br>- If you downloaded the malware as part of an app from a third-party<br>  website (the most likely scenario), then wiping and re-installing all<br>  of your apps will clean off the malware. Wiping and re-installing your<br>  phone will NOT reach out to third-party websites to re-install<br>  apps which were not downloaded from the Google Play Store.<br>- If the malware was resident in the app *in the Google Play Store*,<br>  wiping and re-installing will re-install the malware. This is less<br>  likely, but is still a slight possibility.<br>- Generally, your app settings (which are saved in your backup) will not<br>  contain executable code, so it's unlikely that your backup file on the<br>  Google servers will contain malware.<br><br>Of course, if you are rooted and you performed a nandroid backup or if<br>you used something like Titanium Backup to back up your entire data<br>partition (including all apps and settings), then restoring that backup<br>would restore the malware right back on to your phone. This, again, is<br>only a problem if you are rooted and you used backup software to back up<br>your phone. A standard (non-root) wipe and re-install from Google will<br>avoid this problem.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
