<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So the other major religions where there is a creator but not part of<br>the Abrahamic religions are pantheistic religions. And logically, we<br>know that pantheistic religions are false. Here's how we know this.<br><br>In order to know this, you must first ask the correct question. And that<br>question is the most fundamental question of life: *why am I here?* *Why<br>is there something, rather than nothing at all?* The search for the<br>truth about why something exists rather than nothing at all leads us to<br>understand the truth about God. The argument for God can be expressed<br>very simply:<br><br>1.  We exist (we are not an illusion).<br>2.  You can't get something from nothing.<br>3.  Therefore, a necessary and eternal entity exists which created us.<br><br>Even atheists do not deny this logic. They simply claim that the<br>universe is that eternal entity. However, to date, all scientific and<br>philosophical inquiry has proven and re-proven that the universe had a<br>beginning, and the body of evidence proving this fact is continually<br>growing. If something had a beginning, it is not eternal. Therefore,<br>being that the only two sources of eternality are an eternal universe or<br>an eternal Creator, and we have proven that the universe is not eternal,<br>an eternal Creator must exist.<br><br>*Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that a creator God exists.*<br><br>Now, this conclusion says nothing about what kind of God exists, but it<br>does rule out all pantheistic religions. All pantheistic worldviews say<br>that the universe is God and is eternal. And this assertion is false,<br>because we know that the universe is not eternal. So, Hinduism,<br>Buddhism, Jainism, and all other pantheistic religions are ruled out as<br>valid belief systems.<br><br>Therefore, we know that it is the Abrahamic God who created the<br>universe, as belief in an Abrahamic God is the only belief system which<br>fits the evidence in our universe.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
