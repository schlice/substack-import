<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Gays have way better fashion sense than I, and they literally have a<br>better sense of humor than any straight person I know except for<br>professional comedians whose job it is to have a great sense of humor. I<br>feel like they just have way more fun than straight people. The gay men<br>I know certainly seem like they are much happier than many of the<br>straight people I know, and while that's certainly anecdotal on my part,<br>it's my experience.<br><br>I absolutely love them. Is that gay? Yeah, it is a little gay. But I'm<br>okay with that.<br><br>Oh, that's not what you were asking? Were you asking how a Christian<br>views the lifestyle choices of a gay person? That's not specifically<br>what you asked, though.<br><br>As a Christian, I believe that any person's choices (gay or straight or<br>anything else) are between himself and his God. Which means **I don't<br>care what they do.**<br><br>If they were to *come to me and ask me questions about religion and sin<br>and salvation*, I'd answer them as best I could. But as far as I can<br>tell, no gay person is here asking me questions, and as of yet, no gay<br>person has ever come to me asking religious questions. So I'm not going<br>to opine about my religious beliefs regarding their lifestyle choices.<br>Nor am I going to impose my will on them. Nor am I going to give them<br>any unsolicited religious advice. I'm here if they want to talk, I'm a<br>ghost if they don't. And I like it that way. Why should it be any<br>different with a gay person than a straight person who is also a sinner?<br>News flash: we're all sinners and have all fallen short of God's<br>standards.<br><br>I believe that there will be a reckoning at the time of God's choosing<br>where He will lay out our actions and will judge us. But again, for me,<br>that's between me and God and no one else.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
