<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You are talking about attempted crime. Whether or not the<br>*actus reus* (the guilty act) of attempt has taken place is a question<br>of fact for a jury to decide.\<br>\<br>The law varies by state, but the [[Model Penal<br>Code](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b93273&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Penal_Code){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} states that for a<br>defendant to be convicted of an attempted crime, they have to perform a<br>\"substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in \[the<br>defendant\'\]s commission of the crime\" (MPC 5.01(1)(c)).\<br>\<br>So what does this mean? If the police arrest someone for an attempted<br>crime, the state has to show that the defendant performed a<br>\"substantial step\" towards committing that crime. In your example<br>above, the defendant plans a crime (let\'s assume it\'s a burglary),<br>gets some utensils (I assume you mean \"tools of the crime\"), and makes<br>plans when to execute the crime. All of these are legal and probably<br>wouldn\'t suffice as attempted criminal activity.\<br>\<br>However, if the police know when the defendant plans to execute the<br>crime, and they stake out the location and they see the defendant arrive<br>at that location, the arrival at the location of the planned crime at<br>the time of the plan would likely be considered a \"substantial step\"<br>towards the commission of the crime. With their foreknowledge of the<br>plan, the arrival of the defendant at the location of the crime at the<br>time at which the defendant pre-planned the crime would be considered<br>reasonable suspicion enough to perform a *Terry* search of the defendant<br>and his vehicle. If they find the aforementioned \"tools of the crime,\"<br>the police would then have the probable cause needed to arrest the<br>defendant for the crime of attempted burglary.\<br>\<br>In summary, in order to be considered an attempt, the defendant must<br>make a \"substantial step\" towards committing the crime (such as<br>travelling to the location at the pre-planned time). Simply planning a<br>crime is generally not considered a \"substantial step\" towards<br>commission of a crime.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
