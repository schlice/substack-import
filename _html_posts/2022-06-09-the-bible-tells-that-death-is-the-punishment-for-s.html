<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not quite accurate.<br><br>The Bible specifically says, "the wages of sin is death." But is that<br>passage talking about *physical* death? Of course not. Everyone dies,<br>our physical bodies were not meant to live forever. We're talking about<br>*spiritual* death.<br><br>Remember that the Bible also says that before we were saved, we were<br>"dead in our sin."<br><br>> As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which<br>> you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the<br>> ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in<br>> those who are disobedient. All of us also lived among them at one<br>> time, gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires<br>> and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath. But<br>> because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us<br>> alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions---it is by<br>> grace you have been saved. --- Ephesians 2:1--5 NIV<br><br>Before we were saved, we were *dead*. But once we are saved, we are<br>"made alive with Christ even when we were dead in our transgressions."<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>The Bible tells that death is the punishment for sin. Do you agree? Are<br>the deaths that happen daily because of the person's sin?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
