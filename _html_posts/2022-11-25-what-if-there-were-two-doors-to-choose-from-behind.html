<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is an incomplete question.<br><br>You forgot to mention *the consequences of choosing each door.*<br><br>Adam and Eve were faced with this very choice in the Garden of Eden.<br>Except that they, too, had incomplete information. While they knew that<br>they were disobeying God by choosing the apple, I don't think they were<br>completely aware of the full ramifications of their choice.<br><br>So if the consequences are the same (choosing according to your own<br>preference is a sin against God), I'd choose God's will every time. It<br>may not look the way I want, but I gain something wonderful in my life,<br>and I don't sin through my choice.<br><br>Sounds like a good trade-off, no?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
