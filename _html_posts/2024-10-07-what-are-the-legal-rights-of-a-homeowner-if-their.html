<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Currently, in nearly every jurisdiction in the United States, there is<br>no easement for light or air. This means that you do not have a right to<br>have sunlight or free airflow on your property when adjacent properties,<br>built according to code, block that sunlight or airflow.<br><br>People still try to argue tort claims that construction of fences is<br>unlawful because they believe there is a natural right to sunlight.<br><br>But for the most part in almost every jurisdiction in the US, there is<br>no easement for light or airflow.<br><br>Therefore, as long as the fence is built to code, and (in one specific<br>instance) is not a "spite fence," then the fence is allowed and the<br>blocking of sunlight is incidental and, while regrettable, is not a<br>reason to block the construction.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
