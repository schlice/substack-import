<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Under the National Emergencies Act, the President can use certain<br>emergency powers which have been written into Federal law at a time of<br>war or declared national emergency. Basically, when Congress writes a<br>law, they add a section that the President can activate in time of war<br>or national emergency.<br><br>> Congress has delegated at least 136 distinct statutory emergency<br>> powers to the President upon the declaration of an emergency. Only 13<br>> require a declaration from Congress; the remaining 123 are invoked by<br>> an executive declaration with no Congressional input.<br>><br>> Emergency presidential powers are dramatic, and range from suspending<br>> all laws regulating chemical and biological weapons, including the ban<br>> on human testing (50 U.S.C. § 1515, passed 1969); to suspending any<br>> Clean Air Act implementation plan or excess emissions penalty upon<br>> petition of a state governor (42 U.S.C. (f) § 7410 (f), passed 1977);<br>> to authorizing and constructing military construction projects (10<br>> U.S.C. (a) § 2808 (a), passed 1982) using any existing defense<br>> appropriations for such military constructions (\$10.4 billion in<br>> FY2018); to drafting any retired Coast Guard officers (14 U.S.C. §<br>> 331, passed 1963) or enlisted members (14 U.S.C. § 359, passed 1949)<br>> into active duty.\[1\](#tadel){#cite-tadel .citation_link}<br><br>The President is required to promptly notify Congress of the national<br>emergency, and notify them of the section of Federal law enacted via<br>national emergency.<br><br>Congress has the authority under the same law to pass a joint resolution<br>to terminate a national emergency. The President can veto the<br>resolution, and then Congress would need a 2/3 majority in both houses<br>to override the veto.<br><br>However, any funds obligated during the national emergency would remain<br>obligated after the national emergency ends.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-tadel){.citation_index} [[National Emergencies Act -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eaf2df&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Emergencies_Act){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
