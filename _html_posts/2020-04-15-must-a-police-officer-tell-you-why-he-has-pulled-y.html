Their legal requirement is to tell a judge why<br>they stopped you. They tell you out of courtesy.<br><br>Legally, they are only required to ensure you are a licensed driver and<br>that your registration is valid and that your insurance is up to date<br>(requirements for those things vary by state).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
