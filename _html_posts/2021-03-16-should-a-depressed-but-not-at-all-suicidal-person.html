The longer answer is yes also, but the short<br>answer is yes.<br><br>There is a list of things that can cause you to lose your access to<br>firearms:<br><br>- Conviction of a violent felony. It's any felony in some states, but a<br>  violent felony will cause you to lose your firearms in almost all<br>  states.<br>- Being declared a mental incompetent<br>- Being declared a known terrorist<br>- Transporting weapons across state lines<br>- Dishonorable discharge from the military<br><br>There are a few others, but I can't remember them off the top of my<br>head.<br><br>Depression is not on that list.
