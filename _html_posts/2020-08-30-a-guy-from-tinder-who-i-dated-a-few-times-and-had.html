<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Same rule for anyone at your door:<br><br>- Tell them to leave.<br>- If they do not leave, tell them to leave or you will call the police.<br>- If they do not leave, call the police and report a trespasser<br>  harassing you in your home. Make sure they know you are afraid he<br>  might hurt you (even if you aren\'t sure).<br><br>That goes for anyone at your door, regardless of whether it\'s a mean<br>neighbor, a vacuum salesman, or that regrettable Tinder hook-up.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
