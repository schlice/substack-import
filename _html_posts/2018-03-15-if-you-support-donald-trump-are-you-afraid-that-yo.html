<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you support Donald Trump, are you afraid that your children will<br>think it is OK to act like him?**<br><br>My support (or lack thereof) for a political candidate doesn't mean I<br>hold that person up as an example of virtue against which my children<br>should mold their lives.<br><br>That's my job. I am required to lead a life worthy of modeling for<br>my children.<br><br>Politicians are just that: politicians. They are in office to run the<br>business of the nation, not to serve as role models for how our children<br>should act.<br><br>When we allow the state to parent our children, the potential exists<br>that our children learn virtue from politicians. I believe that<br>politicians are the least virtuous people in society, followed very<br>closely by 99% of Hollywood. And this is who you want teaching virtue to<br>your children?<br><br>Trump's no angel. *Access Hollywood* made sure we knew that before the<br>election. But we elected him anyway because we were electing a<br>*President*, not a moral leader.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
