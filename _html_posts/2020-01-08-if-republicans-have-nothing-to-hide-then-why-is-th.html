<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If Republicans have nothing to hide, then why is the Senate afraid to<br>have witnesses and why suddenly start a war out of nowhere?**<br><br>Let's break this down by the two questions you posed:<br><br>> why is the Senate afraid to have witnesses<br><br>The Senate is not *afraid* to have witnesses. The Senate is not<br>*required* to have witnesses. It's not a matter of being afraid to hear<br>them. It's a matter of scope creep. It's not their job.<br><br>The House did the investigation, it's over. The House Democrats found<br>there was enough evidence to impeach the President. The time for<br>investigation is complete. The House was presumably as thorough as it<br>could have been (we'll leave that point open for debate). However, the<br>fact that they voted on Articles of Impeachment implies that they have<br>completed their investigation to their satisfaction and have voted.<br>Since the House has the sole power to impeach, that they have done<br>so is no longer in question.<br><br>The Senate has the sole power to hold a trial to determine whether<br>or not the impeached person should be removed from office. The Senate<br>is not re-litigating the impeachment. The impeachment has been done.<br>It's the Senate's job to determine if the impeachment, ***as presented<br>and passed by the House***, is sufficient to remove the person from<br>office. That's it. It's not time to dig for new evidence, or hear from<br>new witnesses, because that's not the Senate's job. If 67 Senators<br>believe the impeachment, *as presented and passed by the House*, is<br>sufficient to remove the President from office, then they will vote to<br>do so. If they believe they need to hear from the witnesses who were<br>already called in the House, they can, in order to make their<br>determination as to whether or not the President should be removed from<br>office. They don't have to; the House has already interviewed them, and<br>all of the evidence they should need is contained in the Articles of<br>Impeachment.<br><br>> and why suddenly start a war out of nowhere?<br><br>So it's clear from your question that you haven't been following the<br>situation in the Middle East. Soleimani was a *terrorist*. He has<br>already directly ordered the killings of ***over 600 American<br>citizens***. He was in Iraq because he loves the scenery; he was just a<br>person on vacation. LOL JK he was there directing more attacks against<br>US forces.<br><br>In other words, *he was a target of opportunity.*<br><br>We had the opportunity to kill a terrorist, and we did. He was a<br>High-Value Target (HVT), and we capture or kill HVTs. We had an<br>opportunity to kill him, and we took it.<br><br>We're most definitely not *starting* a war. We took steps to *prevent* a<br>war.<br><br>Killing Soleimani sends a message to any other terrorist inside or<br>outside of Iran: prosecute terror attacks against US citizens, and die<br>horribly by drone strike when you least expect it.<br><br>Iran's not stupid enough to go to war with us. I mean, their government<br>is corrupt and they'll just as soon risk their peoples' lives by<br>provoking the US as they will wake up in the morning. But they aren't<br>stupid enough to provoke the US into aggression. Which is why, after<br>some paltry retaliatory strike to appease the radicals in their state,<br>they emphatically stated that they won't progress any further. They<br>threw a couple of missiles at us to show their people that they did<br>something to avenge Soleimani's death, and that's it.<br><br>But we should also be aware that they won't stop there. And they should<br>be warned that if they kill Americans, there will be a price to pay.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
