<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [This is the same reason that the M-16, arguably one of the<br>best military rifles ever, removed the fully automatic mode in the A3<br>version, replacing it instead with a three-round burst fire mode.\<br>\<br>Even for the best shot, fully automatic mode is very difficult to<br>control, and when in that mode, most good shooters will only fire a few<br>rounds at a time. While I can\'t shoot as fast as an automatic rifle<br>using a semi-automatic pistol, I can shoot pretty fast. Guess whether<br>I\'m more or less accurate when I do that.\<br>\<br>Some weapons systems work much better in a fully automatic mode; best<br>example I can think of is the SAW (the M249 Light Machine Gun \LMG\,<br>also known as the Squad Automatic Weapon). Unlike the Uzi in Las Vegas<br>this past week, the SAW does not jump around when it is fired. Plus, our<br>SAWs can be vehicle-mounted, so they don\'t jump around *at<br>all.*]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
