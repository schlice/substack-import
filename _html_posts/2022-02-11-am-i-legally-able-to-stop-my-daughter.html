<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Of course you are! If it is indeed your house, you can control who<br>enters and who must leave. A daughter's ex-boyfriend has no special<br>authority to enter your house without your permission. You can lock him<br>out and keep him out. If he has a key, change the locks. If he tries to<br>break in, get a gun.<br><br>You deserve to feel safe in your home. No one gets to threaten that.<br><br>You get to control who comes in and who does not. Tell ex-boyfriend-boy<br>that if you find anything of his, you'll send it on to him, otherwise he<br>can go kick rocks.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Am I legally able to stop my daughter's ex-boyfriend from entering my<br>house to \"look around\" to see if he left anything?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
