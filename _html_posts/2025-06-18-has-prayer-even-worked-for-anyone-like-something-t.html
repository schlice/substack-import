<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's impossible to know the answer to that question. We'll never know if<br>the "response to prayer" was *because* of the prayer, or was going to<br>happen that way anyway. Even if it was a one in a million thing, there<br>is no definitive proof that it would have happened one way *but for* the<br>intervention of God.<br><br>Only God knows.<br><br>People get hung up on that all the time. Like, "If God knew how it was<br>going to turn out, then my prayer didn't mean anything, because it was<br>going to happen the way God saw it happen."<br><br>It's true that God exists outside of time and space. For God, everything<br>is *now*. The past is *now*. The present is *now.* The future is *now*.<br>So God sees it all, as He is not constrained by time.<br><br>Therefore, if we apply that thought to your prayer, then you could say<br>that God saw, for all time, that something was going to happen, He also<br>saw, for all time, that you were going to pray for that person. And so<br>He could, for all time, choose to honor your prayer by making the<br>outcome happen in the way you prayed. So even though it didn't happen in<br>human "real time," God did "hear" the prayer, and He did "act" on it.<br>And it still happened because you chose to pray.<br><br>Nevertheless, we'll never be able to know if God intervened until we get<br>the chance to talk to Him face to face.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
