<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is actually not true. In fact, if you as a private citizen were<br>threatened with death or grave bodily harm, you too have the right to<br>defend yourself with force. There are two differences:<br><br>- As a citizen, you can only match the force presented to you. The<br>  police are allowed to use higher levels of force to compel compliance.<br>- The police have an additional duty to safeguard the general public;<br>  the private citizen has no such duty.<br><br>But if that attacker is engaging you, you have the same right to defend<br>yourself as any police officer does.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Are-you-legally-allowed-to-shoot-a-police-officer-to-prevent-him-from-killing-an-unarmed-man/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
