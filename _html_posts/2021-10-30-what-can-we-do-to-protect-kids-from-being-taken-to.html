<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I get what your question was about: you think that children being<br>exposed to religion at a young age is akin to forced indoctrination.<br><br>But you know, church or no, you'll never stop that.<br><br>Ultimately, parents are responsible for the upbringing of their<br>children, which includes whatever indoctrination they choose. And it<br>doesn't have to be about religion. It can be about politics. It can be<br>about racism. It can be about literally anything you use to create your<br>personal morality. That is, rightly, the parent's responsibility, not<br>the state's. So your proposal is really ineffectual as parents are<br>legally responsible for that indoctrination.<br><br>Plus, there's that pesky Constitution in the United States which kinda<br>states pretty specifically that the government can't stop you from<br>worshipping how you please, so you'll never be able to do what you are<br>asking anyway.<br><br>When children grow up and are able to think for themselves, they will<br>either accept or reject that parental indoctrination. Believe me, I<br>know. It is possible to reject what your parents taught you about<br>religion. Just look at my credential.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What can we do to protect kids from being taken to places of worship<br>till they are able to think for themselves?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
