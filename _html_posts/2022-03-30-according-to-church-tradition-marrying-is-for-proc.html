<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This question goes back to the reason why marriage exists in the first<br>place. It's interesting, because this question was very recently argued<br>in our society, when the government, through its various machinations,<br>permitted same-sex marriage.<br><br>The question about why marriage exists in the first place was raised,<br>and was often debated. Because, as you stated, if marriage is for<br>procreation, if a couple is infertile and does not procreate, is their<br>marriage invalid?<br><br>Clearly, that answer is no. The marriage is not justified by children.<br>The marriage may be *blessed* by children, but the marriage is not<br>validated based on the presence or absence of biological children.<br>Remember: children do not make a marriage; marriage makes children. At<br>the very least, we should avoid putting the cart before the horse.<br><br>Therefore, whether or not you have children doesn't change the validity<br>of a marriage. Which raises another question: *what's the purpose of<br>religious marriage?*<br><br>Thankfully, the Bible has a lot to say about marriage.<br><br>The very first reason that the Bible gives for marriage was simple: Adam<br>was lonely and needed a helper (Genesis 2:18). This lays out the primary<br>reason for marriage: companionship. God created humanity for<br>companionship and fellowship. We are *designed* to be together. That<br>doesn't mean we can't live successfully on our own, but we are made for<br>community and communion.<br><br>This structure mirrors Christ's relationship with the church. The Bible<br>often refers to the relationship between Christ and the church using the<br>terms "bride" and "bridegroom." The structure of our lives reflects the<br>reality of Christ's love for the church. Jesus gave his life for his<br>bride, and his selflessness is an example we husbands should learn from.<br><br>And finally, to address your specific question, just because you don't<br>want children at your age doesn't mean that having a safe place to<br>express your sexuality isn't beneficial, either for you or for your<br>future husband. This world is full of sexual immorality and temptation.<br>Even if you're not looking for that sort of material, *it's looking for<br>you*. It pursues even the most chaste among us. Marriage is the only<br>place where we can safely express those desires, which helps us to be<br>stronger against that temptation to sin.<br><br>I know how you feel, as I'm knocking on 50 myself. The old maxim goes<br>like this: sex is like air; it becomes very important when you aren't<br>getting any. In practice, this means that the less we exercise our<br>sexuality (in whatever form that may look like at our age and our<br>physical condition), the more likely we are to be tempted. Expressing<br>our sexuality with our spouse is a *hedge* against the temptation of the<br>world, which is strong and addictive. Please don't forget that while you<br>may not desire children, or even intercourse, expressing your sexuality<br>with your spouse, in whatever form that expression takes, is still<br>important for you, and for your future husband. Together, you can<br>strengthen each other against the temptations of this world. In other<br>words, your marriage helps you to produce holiness and godliness in both<br>of your lives.<br><br>TL;DR: God created marriage to benefit us, and to promote a<br>vigorous, healthy society, not *just* to create children.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>According to Church tradition marrying is for procreation and a<br>sanctified outlet for sexual desire. But in 1 Timothy 5:9--16 it says<br>widows under 60 should get remarried. After 45 or 50 most women are<br>infertile and no longer overwhelmingly desirous of sex. So why is the<br>age so high? And do I have any business dating\--no luck finding a<br>husband due to chronic illness in my 20\'s\--now that I\'m pushing 50?<br>Could God bless such a union when He meant for marriage to be about<br>founding families which I cannot produce now?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
