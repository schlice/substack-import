<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**As a theist, do you think that your God could instantly eliminate<br>Covid-19?**<br><br>First of all, what you must know about Christians broadly is that for<br>any question which starts with "Can God..." the answer is always **yes<br>he can**.<br><br>God can do anything. God can do more than you even have the capability<br>to imagine.<br><br>Which begs the question: why doesn't he?<br><br>Why doesn't God simply eliminate COVID-19? Why doesn't he walk before us<br>with his great cosmic broom sweeping away anything that can hurt us?<br><br>Let me answer that with a question: **Where did you ever get the idea<br>that this is what God is supposed to do?**<br><br>I'm guessing by the tenor of your question that you are not a "theist."<br>You may be agnostic, or atheist, it doesn't matter. In any case, it's<br>likely you haven't read the Bible. The Bible is actually very clear on<br>the point:<br><br>God never promised that you would have an easy life.<br><br>There is no record in the Bible of God ever promising that you would<br>have a carefree life, free of any bad thing ever happening to you. In<br>fact, Jesus tells his followers that they should prepare for the world<br>to hate them, reject them, and ultimately kill them.<br><br>> "If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you<br>> belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do<br>> not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That<br>> is why the world hates you. Remember what I told you: 'A servant is<br>> not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will<br>> persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours<br>> also. They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not<br>> know the one who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they<br>> would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.<br>> Whoever hates me hates my Father as well. If I had not done among them<br>> the works no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. As it is,<br>> they have seen, and yet they have hated both me and my Father. But<br>> this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: 'They hated me<br>> without reason.'" --- John 15:18--25 NIV<br>><br>> "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In<br>> this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the<br>> world." --- John 16:33<br><br>Despite what some may tell you, being a theist is no foolproof insurance<br>policy against the trials of life. Even the greats of the Bible were<br>thrown in prison, tortured and ultimately executed, for committing no<br>other crime than simply believing in God. And God doesn't really clarify<br>for us what his plan is, or how our part in it glorifies him.<br><br>Believers know, however, that God keeps his promises, and that<br>everything he allows to happen, be it wars, famine, or illness,<br>ultimately glorifies him and furthers the church. That is the essence of<br>faith: believing in the truth of God when the world spends all of its<br>energy trying to convince you otherwise. Paul wrote:<br><br>> In all our troubles my joy knows no bounds. For when we came into<br>> Macedonia, this body of ours had no rest, but we were harassed at<br>> every turn---conflicts on the outside, fears within --- 2 Cor 7:4-5<br><br>Peter explained that there would be trouble when he said:<br><br>> Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are<br>> suffering, as though something strange were happening to you. But<br>> rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you<br>> may be overjoyed when His glory is revealed. ---1 Peter 4:12-13<br><br>In other words, there will be suffering, but we will ultimately prevail.<br>And it's only human to have doubts. But if you want to believe that<br>there is a silver lining to this dark cloud, talk to your "theist"<br>friends and ask how they've learned to dance in the rain. Ask them where<br>their hope comes from. If you don't have any theist friends, ask us<br>here. Because we do have hope. Christ gives us hope in the future, and<br>it may not even be an earthly future.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
