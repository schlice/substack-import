<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Legally, there is no provision in the law to allow you to "refuse" to<br>pull over. Therefore, any reasoning you may have for not stopping (i.e.<br>I thought the officer was not real) would be a defense in court to the<br>charge of failing to stop.<br><br>You really only have two possibilities:<br><br>1.  When you are illuminated by a car which you believe is not a real<br>    police officer, your first course of action would be to immediately<br>    get out your cell phone and call 911. Inform the dispatcher that<br>    there is a car behind you with red and blue lights but it doesn't<br>    look like a police officer. They will be able to tell you if it is a<br>    real police officer behind you. If the dispatcher tells you it is a<br>    real police officer, you must stop immediately. By the way, if<br>    you live in a state where it is illegal to talk on the phone while<br>    you drive, this emergency situation would be a perfect example of an<br>    affirmative defense to that charge.<br>2.  If you cannot call 911 because your cell phone is not working, your<br>    only other viable option is to drive (safely, do not speed) to the<br>    nearest police station, and go inside. Tell the desk officer that<br>    there is a car following you and you are unsure whether or not it is<br>    a police officer. If it is, the officer will come inside and you<br>    will sort it all out together. If not, the car will likely drive<br>    away and you will be safe.<br><br>Beyond these two options, there really is no other way to fail to stop.<br>If you have any other reasoning (I tried to drive to a more<br>populated/safer/better lit, I didn't think he was real but I didn't do<br>anything about it, etc), your decision will be weighed against the<br>reason the officer was stopping you when and where he was, and the judge<br>or jury will decide if your excuse was reasonable enough. If you don't<br>do the things that a reasonable person would do if they suspect the<br>officer behind them is not real (see the numbered list above), your<br>decision will not be looked upon favorably.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
