<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Congratulations. You developed a conscience and the<br>ability to think on your own.\<br>\<br>You\'ve decided that there are other things more important in your life.<br>How can anyone fault you for that? It\'s not my place to look upon you<br>with despair and say, \"how sad, he grew up around guns and now he<br>doesn\'t even want to buy one.\" It\'s absolutely positively none of my<br>business.\<br>\<br>But by the same token, don\'t deride those that choose to buy guns and<br>carry them and own them. And don\'t try to place your values on them,<br>and say that if it\'s good enough for you not to own a gun, then it must<br>be good enough for everyone else.\<br>\<br>The phrase \"to each his own\" comes to mind. This essentially means, I<br>have mine, you have yours, and we\'re okay with that.\<br>\<br>Voltaire said, \"I may not like what you have to say, but I will defend<br>to the death your right to say it.\" Those of us who are military/police<br>understand this facet of America better than most. I don\'t have to<br>agree with you. But I will still defend you, and your ability to say<br>whatever you choose, even if you choose to deride me for my own beliefs<br>and choices.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
