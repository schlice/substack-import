<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You are an interesting dichotomy. You own a firearm, a device<br>specifically designed to kill living beings (humans, animals, etc), and<br>you don't know if you could live with the thought of killing someone?<br><br>You have two choices:<br><br>1.  Learn to live with killing someone if it comes down to it<br>2.  Sell your firearm.<br><br>Don't keep it in the home if you're not prepared to use it. Use the<br>money to buy a good Taser. There are many models to choose from, and<br>they are legal to carry in most states (check your local laws before<br>carrying one, though. They're not legal to carry everywhere).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
