<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Nothing. People have a right to set their own boundaries. And that<br>includes you.<br><br>You can't give her an ultimatum (either get the vaccine or I'm gone).<br>That's not right to do to her. But you can tell her that you're going to<br>go swimming or go to the bar, and you're going to do it without her if<br>she won't get the vaccine. That's a natural consequence of her decision.<br>She should feel the consequences of her decision. But it's not fair for<br>you to miss out on going swimming or going to the bar just because of<br>her decision. It's not fair for her to do that to you.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What can I say to my girlfriend who won\'t get the covid vaccine? For<br>her it\'s a violation of her personal freedom. She misses things like<br>going to the swimming pool or bars, yet won\'t get jabbed. I try to<br>avoid the topic now, too difficult<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
