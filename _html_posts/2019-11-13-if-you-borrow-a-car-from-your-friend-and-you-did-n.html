<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you borrow a car from your friend and you did not return your<br>friend's car on time**<br><br>In other words, you had a verbal agreement and you didn't keep your end<br>of the agreement.<br><br>and he calls 911 and reports it missing,<br><br>which he has every right to do, except for that it's quite the dick<br>move. Obviously, he's more interested in getting his car back than<br>keeping his friend. Second, you don't report a car "missing" like a cat.<br>Cars don't wander off on their own. Cars are either in your possession<br>or they are not. That makes them "stolen." He would have to call 911 and<br>report a stolen car.<br><br>**can the court charge you for car theft if you get pulled over by<br>police and police arrest you and take you to jail?**<br><br>Most assuredly, yes. The owner of the car reported it stolen. That's not<br>a charge undertaken lightly. When the police stop you and tell you the<br>owner reported the car stolen and you tell them you had the owner's<br>permission, they'll tell you, "yeah sure, tell it to the judge" while<br>they arrest you. And when you tell the judge that you had permission to<br>borrow the car, but it was supposed to be returned on a certain day and<br>you failed to do so, your breaking of your agreement will not be taken<br>lightly.<br><br>Did you make any attempt to reach out to the owner in order to request<br>an extension on your borrowing? Even a text or a phone call? Anything?<br>Or did you just keep the car and assume that your friend would be cool<br>with it? You know what they say about what happens when you assume:<br>it makes an ass out of u and me.<br><br>Did you misunderstand the terms of the agreement? Or did you just decide<br>that since it was a verbal agreement, it was okay to break?<br><br>In any case, your day in court will probably not go exceedingly well for<br>you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
