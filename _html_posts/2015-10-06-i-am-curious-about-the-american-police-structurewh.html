<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In operation, very little. The difference is in the<br>*jurisdiction.*\<br>\<br>A state can have its own police force. Generally, the law enforcement<br>organizations at the state level are called \"State Police\" and their<br>officers are called \"Troopers.\" The State Police is divided into<br>\"Troops\" for ease of functioning across such a<br>geographically-dispersed region as a state.\<br>\<br>States in the United States are further divided into \"counties\" for<br>administrative and other purposes. There are 3,144 counties and county<br>equivalents in the United States. For the most part (the Northeast being<br>the notable exception), counties have a Sheriff responsible for law<br>enforcement throughout the county. Sheriffs will \"deputize\" law<br>enforcement officers to carry out the law enforcement within the county.<br>They are called \"Sheriff\'s Deputies\" or just \"Deputy\" for short.\<br>\<br>Incorporated cities within a county are separately-functioning<br>government entities. They can collect taxes and perform all normal<br>governmental functions. Accordingly, cities can have their own police<br>departments. These departments are called \"Police Departments\" and<br>their officers are called \"Police Officers\" or just \"Officer\" for<br>short.\<br>\<br>In total, counting all state, city and county law enforcement, there are<br>over 18,000 separate law enforcement agencies within the United States.\<br>\<br>In general, the organization with more broad jurisdiction will defer<br>actions within a smaller jurisdiction to that smaller department, even<br>though both organizations have \"concurrent jurisdiction\" within that<br>area.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
