<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It is not illegal to carry around loose pills. If your purse happens to<br>be searched by the police, you may have some \'splainin\' to do if they<br>don\'t know what the pills are either. However, the police can look up<br>the pills online to determine what they are.<br><br>However, private venues that are \"open to the public\" (such as night<br>clubs) can establish whatever entrance rules they choose as long as such<br>rules are enforced equally against all patrons and do not discriminate<br>based on race, religion, color, sex, or national origin (or sexual<br>orientation in some states).<br><br>I can tell you that if you were to visit Cheyenne Mountain Air Force<br>Base (also known as NORAD), for example, you would find that they<br>require any medication you carry to be legal and be prescribed to you.<br>Therefore, to carry such medication into the Mountain, you would need to<br>have them in their original prescription bottles (to show that they are<br>both legal and prescribed to you).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
