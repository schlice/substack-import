<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It sounds like you're talking about the "Android Device Manager" feature<br>of your Android phone (where "Find My Mobile" is more of an Apple<br>moniker).<br><br>First, let me answer your specific question. If the perpetrator is able<br>to access your phone and wipes it or does a hard reset, Android Device<br>Manager will no longer work, so you will not be able to track your phone<br>any more.<br><br>But I'm here to tell you that **tracking your phone is not important if<br>it has been truly stolen. *Erasing your phone is better than trying<br>to recover it.*** I'll explain that in a minute.<br><br>First, however, if your device has truly been stolen, *IMMEDIATELY*<br>go to the [[Android Device<br>Manager](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=970542&url=https://www.google.com/android/devicemanager){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container} and log in with your Google<br>credentials used to set up the phone. Your phone should be located. If<br>your phone is not located, it is either powered off or has already been<br>wiped. If it has been located, you should definitely click "Lock" to<br>lock your phone. If you think the person was not nefarious in their<br>intent, you can apply a phone number to the lock screen which can be<br>called to return your phone to you. However, if you believe the phone is<br>definitely stolen, you should instead click "Erase" to remotely wipe<br>your phone. If you ever accessed your bank accounts or your email from<br>your phone (which many people do), you'll want to "Erase" your phone.<br><br>It sounds a little harsh to say that you should forget about retrieving<br>the device, but you must remember that your phone links to your email.<br>***If a perpetrator gains access to your email, you're in big<br>trouble.*** Your email is the "skeleton key" to all of your accounts.<br>The perpetrator can access any of your other accounts which authenticate<br>you through email and reset their passwords using your email to do it.<br>Therefore, protecting your email account is of the utmost concern. I<br>would strongly recommend wiping your phone so that the perpetrator no<br>longer has access to it.<br><br>Forget the hardware. Take the insurance claim and get a new one. But<br>please, protect your email address. Erase your phone if you can.<br><br>Note that if the perpetrator wipes your device, it accomplishes the same<br>thing as you remotely wiping the device. The hardware is of less<br>concern; that's why we have insurance. The protection of your personal<br>information is far more important.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
