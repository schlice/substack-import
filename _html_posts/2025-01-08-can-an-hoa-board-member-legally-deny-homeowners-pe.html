<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In concept, yes. Not in actual practice.<br><br>An HOA board member, acting alone, cannot deny a homeowner permission to<br>sell their property.<br><br>However, the HOA (as an entity) will report to title company whether or<br>not the seller is "in good standing" with the HOA (i.e. their account is<br>current and there are no past due balances on the account). In many<br>states, you cannot complete the sale of a house if the owner is in<br>arrears with the HOA.<br><br>Please note that this varies by state. In many states, you cannot<br>process the sale of your home until the HOA reports that your account is<br>settled, but in nearly all cases, the HOA will provide a Statement of<br>Account to the title company which clearly shows that the HOA is due<br>money to be paid out of the proceeds of the sale. The title company will<br>ensure that the account is returned to good standing before any proceeds<br>are paid to the seller.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
