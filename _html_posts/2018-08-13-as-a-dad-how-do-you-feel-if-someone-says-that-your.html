I'm crushed.<br><br>To be fair though, women always told me (as a child) how much they loved<br>my eyelashes. I wouldn't have minded if my boys had inherited those. I<br>really never knew what to say when they told me that. "Thanks" always<br>seemed wrong since I didn't do anything to get them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
