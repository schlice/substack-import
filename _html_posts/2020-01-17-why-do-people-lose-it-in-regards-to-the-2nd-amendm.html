<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why do people lose it in regards to the 2nd amendment? Wasn\'t it<br>meant for other times and circumstances?**<br><br>Questions like this seem to revolve around the basic idea that a<br>particular amendment is no longer needed so there should be no problem<br>getting rid of it.<br><br>The problem is that *the Constitution doesn't grant rights. It only<br>prevents government from infringing on the rights you already have.*<br><br>This means you already have the right to defend your life, because you<br>have the natural right to self-defense, not because of the Constitution.<br>The Constitution only ensures that the government can't infringe on the<br>rights you already have.<br><br>Looking at the list of rights which the government cannot infringe and<br>then deciding that the government actually can infringe on those rights<br>breaks the basic compact which the states agreed to when they joined the<br>union. They joined with the understanding that rights existed prior to<br>the Constitution and the government would never infringe on those<br>rights. Saying now that the government can infringe on those rights is a<br>complete abdication of the government's responsibility to the states to<br>maintain the treaties they signed when they joined.<br><br>It actually throws the question of state secession back into the fore.<br>If the government can modify the agreement made with the states, then<br>the basis upon which the states entered the union is no longer intact.<br>It's like re-writing the contract after it's been signed. Yes, the Bill<br>of Rights was signed after the Constitution, but the Union was only<br>agreed to with the understanding that the Bill of Rights was going to be<br>signed.<br><br>Note that the Bill of Rights is a different animal than the other<br>seventeen Amendments that follow it. The Bill of Rights details the<br>natural rights which the government cannot infringe. If you now say that<br>the government can restrict your rights, then what good is the<br>Constitution at all? Breaking up the Bill of Rights could have<br>disastrous consequences for the entirety of the Union.<br><br>Under this view, it's hard to see how a state would ever agree to a<br>repeal of any of the Amendments in the Bill of Rights.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
