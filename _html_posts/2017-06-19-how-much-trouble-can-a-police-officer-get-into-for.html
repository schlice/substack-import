<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Pulling anyone over when you don't have reasonable suspicion that they<br>have violated a law is in itself a violation of department policy. There<br>is no police department I am aware of that allows you to stop a vehicle<br>without at a minimum reasonable suspicion that they have committed a<br>violation.<br><br>How much trouble can an officer get into? He does have the authority to<br>stop cars, so what he did was not criminal. But he almost certainly<br>violated department policy, which could get him reprimanded, suspended,<br>or at worst, fired.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
