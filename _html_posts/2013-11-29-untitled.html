<br/><br/>Answer Comment<br/><br/><br/>Content: [So as long as a faction does not have any tie to any<br/>particular country, or sponsored by any particular country, they can<br/>attack a nation haphazardly without any worry of repercussion because<br/>that nation cannot retaliate? If only a nation can declare war, how do<br/>we engage our military if we have no one against whom we can declare<br/>war?\<br/>\<br/>Also, you make it sound as if Afghanistan and Iraq are blameless. They<br/>should have been \"actively\" contributing to the ouster of Al Qaeda<br/>from their country. Not only did they not help, they stonewalled us at<br/>every turn. The only way we killed OBL is by concealing the operation<br/>from Afghanistan.\<br/>\<br/>We live in an imperfect world. Black and white is never an<br/>option.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Answer:<br/>https://www.quora.com/Why-do-commanding-officers-allow-inept-and-deceitful-politicians-to-order-them-into-combat-where-the-men-they-lead-are-killed-and-where-the-military-strategy-and-orders-make-no-sense/answers/1766550<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
