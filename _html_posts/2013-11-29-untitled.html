<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [So as long as a faction does not have any tie to any<br>particular country, or sponsored by any particular country, they can<br>attack a nation haphazardly without any worry of repercussion because<br>that nation cannot retaliate? If only a nation can declare war, how do<br>we engage our military if we have no one against whom we can declare<br>war?\<br>\<br>Also, you make it sound as if Afghanistan and Iraq are blameless. They<br>should have been \"actively\" contributing to the ouster of Al Qaeda<br>from their country. Not only did they not help, they stonewalled us at<br>every turn. The only way we killed OBL is by concealing the operation<br>from Afghanistan.\<br>\<br>We live in an imperfect world. Black and white is never an<br>option.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-do-commanding-officers-allow-inept-and-deceitful-politicians-to-order-them-into-combat-where-the-men-they-lead-are-killed-and-where-the-military-strategy-and-orders-make-no-sense/answers/1766550<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
