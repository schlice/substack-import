<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the vast majority of cases, "Can God" questions can be answered with<br>"Yes, God can."<br><br>But not always.<br><br>Some things God cannot do:<br><br>- God cannot violate His nature. For example, God cannot sin, so God<br>  cannot do anything sinful or condone sin.<br>- God cannot do things which are not possible to do in our world. The<br>  "gotcha" question which comes to mind is "Can God make a rock so heavy<br>  that even He can't lift it?" No, God can't because such a rock would<br>  be larger than the entire universe, and it is not possible to create<br>  something so large that it would exceed the size of the universe.<br>- God cannot create other infinite beings. God can create *finite*<br>  beings, but God cannot create other infinite beings. The definition of<br>  an infinite being means *complete*. God is lacking nothing. If God<br>  lacks something, then He is not complete, and thus is not infinite. If<br>  there is more than one infinite being, then in order to distinguish<br>  between the two, one must lack something that the other has, and this<br>  violates the very nature of an infinite being.<br><br>\<br><br>Now to answer the question. Since Odin, while powerful, is not<br>*infinite*, then yes, God could create a creature *like* Odin. He<br>wouldn't be a "god" per se (God said that you shall have no other gods<br>but me), but maybe He could create a *demi-God*. Not worthy of worship,<br>but powerful nonetheless, although not more powerful than God Himself.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
