<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are the odds that Donald Trump gets impeached for collusion with<br>Russia in the near future?**<br><br>Somewhere between slim and none.<br><br>The whole Russia collusion distraction isn't enough for Republicans to<br>impeach. You'd have to show something that actually rises to the level<br>of "high crimes and misdemeanors" while in office before Republicans<br>would even think about impeachment.<br><br>If Congress wants to do something useful, it can define a crime and<br>write a law. It can make collusion a crime. Until then, there isn't<br>enough to sway Republicans to vote for impeachment.<br><br>And even if they DO impeach him, do you think they will be able to get<br>67 Senators to vote to convict? I don't know. We'll have to see what the<br>party lines look like if an impeachment actually does go forward to the<br>Senate.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
