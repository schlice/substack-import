<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's unlikely that your SIM was blocked by putting it into another<br>phone. It's much more likely that the phone you put the SIM into does<br>not accept the SIM from your carrier.<br><br>If, however, your SIM was indeed blocked, you will need to contact the<br>Customer Service department for your carrier to have it unblocked. There<br>is no other way to unlock a SIM, as it is the carrier which controls<br>access to its network through that SIM.<br><br>If the phone you put the SIM into is locked to one type of carrier, you<br>may need to unlock the phone to work on your carrier. When the phone<br>hasn't been paid completely, carriers will lock the phone to their<br>network. You can pay a fee to a third-party company to unlock your<br>phone, or you can wait until the phone is completely paid off, and the<br>carrier will unlock it for you.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How do I unblock a SIM that got blocked by putting it in another phone?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
