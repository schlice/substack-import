<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can you get Oreo on a Galaxy J7 Sky Pro?<br><br>The J7 Sky Pro has a quad core Snapdragon 425 processor and 2 GB of RAM.<br>That's going to be enough for it to run Android 6.0.1 (Marshmallow). At<br>launch, this is what it ran.<br><br>Officially, it should get one upgrade to Android 7 (Nougat). Nougat<br>probably runs okay on the J7, but not stellar.<br><br>I wouldn't expect to see an official upgrade to Android 8 (Oreo) on the<br>J7. Generally, you'll get one official code family upgrade, but two is<br>pushing it a little. The hardware probably isn't robust enough to run<br>Oreo officially. There are plenty of ways to get Oreo, but none of them<br>are through official carrier channels, and all of them involve rooting<br>your phone.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
