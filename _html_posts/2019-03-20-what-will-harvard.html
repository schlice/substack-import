<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What will Harvard\'s defense be in a Connecticut woman\'s lawsuit<br>against them for \"allegedly \'shamelessly\' turning a profit from<br>photos of slaves and ignoring requests to turn the photos over to the<br>slaves' descendants\"?**<br><br>The article states that the photos were taken in 1850. Any work<br>published in the US before 1923 is in the public<br>domain.\[1\](#rNrvD){#cite-rNrvD .citation_link} The plaintiff has no<br>copyright claim to the photos, and neither does Harvard.<br><br>Harvard may use the public domain works in any other collection (and<br>charge money for that collection) without paying royalties to anyone<br>else. They can therefore charge for a book which contains the photos.<br>However, the suit also alleges that Harvard charged a "licensing fee" to<br>reprint the photos. If Harvard charged to license this photo, and if<br>that fee is more than the cost of the reprint, she may have a case that<br>Harvard is improperly charging fees for works in the public domain.<br><br>However, she herself has no claim on the title of those photos, nor does<br>she have a claim for remuneration for any royalties from that photo. No<br>one does. That's what "public domain" means.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-rNrvD){.citation_index} [[Public Domain Frequently Asked<br>Questions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=dd0ab7&url=https://www.teachingcopyright.org/handout/public-domain-faq.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="teachingcopyright.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
