<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: everything which has not been granted to the government or<br>denied to the states.<br><br>We'll do this as a math problem for better understanding. This actually<br>may be more confusing to some, but I'm trying here.<br><br>1.  Enumerate all the powers granted to the government in the<br>    Constitution.<br>2.  Add to the answer to step 1 any power expressly forbidden by the<br>    Constitution to be a state power.<br>3.  Subtract the answer to step 2 from ***ANYTHING YOU COULD CONSIDER TO<br>    BE A POWER.***<br><br>What you have remaining are the powers left to the states respectively,<br>or to the people.<br><br>The Tenth Amendment has been characterized as a "trusim" rather than a<br>power granted or denied. It reaffirms the understanding of the people<br>who wrote the Constitution that any power not expressly granted to the<br>government or denied to the states belongs to the states, or to the<br>people. In other words, "All is retained which has not been<br>surrendered." (United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 124 (1941))<br><br>*The actual text of the Tenth Amendment: The powers not delegated to the<br>United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States,<br>are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
