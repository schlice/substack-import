<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When the authentication question comes up, if you don't have access to<br>the phone registered on the account any more, click the "Need another<br>way to authenticate?" button down at the bottom.<br><br>It will present you with a variety of options. Some options include<br>authenticating from a device on which you are already logged into<br>Facebook (if you have one).<br><br>If none of the options listed will work, click the "Other options" link<br>at the bottom. You will be asked to either provide a government-issued<br>ID, or take a picture of yourself holding a sign with a hand-written<br>code on it. Once you provide one of these, Facebook will review your<br>submission and you will be allowed access to your account again.<br><br>Be sure to update your phone number so that you can receive login codes<br>again.<br><br>(EDIT) Sorry, I had to disable comments on this answer. Too many people<br>advertising scams about people getting paid to recover accounts, things<br>which can be done by you, for free. Don't fall for the hype. Do it<br>yourself and save!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
