<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Tolling is not a function of equity, nor is tolling reimbursement for<br>law enforcement cooperation. In general, the statute of limitations is<br>in place to protect the defendant. It is the *plaintiff* who benefits<br>through tolling of the statute of limitations, so that he can avoid<br>having the statute lapse for failure to bring an action.<br><br>Tolling of the statute of limitations on a particular action occurs when<br>some outside force causes "legal disability," or a lack of legal<br>capacity to take an action. Once that disability is removed, the time<br>starts again.<br><br>> \For example, a\ child or a person with a mental illness is regarded<br>> as being incapable of initiating a legal action on her own behalf.<br>> Therefore, the time limit will be tolled until some fixed time after<br>> the disability has been removed. \O<br>ce \the\ child reaches the<br>> age of majority, the counting of time will be resumed. \...\ Once<br>> the statute begins to run, it will not be suspended by the subsequent<br>> disability of any of the parties unless specified by statute.<br>><br>> Mere ignorance of the existence of a cause of action generally does<br>> not toll the statute of limitations, particularly when the facts could<br>> have been learned by inquiry or diligence. In cases where a cause of<br>> action has been fraudulently concealed, the statute of limitations is<br>> tolled until the action is, or could have been, discovered through the<br>> exercise of due diligence. Ordinarily, silence or failure to disclose<br>> the existence of a cause of action does not toll the statute. The<br>> absence of the plaintiff or defendant from the jurisdiction does not<br>> suspend the running of the statute of limitations, unless the statute<br>> so provides.<br>><br>> The statute of limitations for a debt or obligation may be tolled by<br>> either an unconditional promise to pay the debt or an acknowledgement<br>> of the debt. The time limitation on bringing a lawsuit to enforce<br>> payment of the debt is suspended until the time for payment<br>> established under the promise or acknowledgement has arrived. Upon<br>> that due date, the period of limitations will start again.<br>> \[1\](#ahMZO){#cite-ahMZO .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ahMZO){.citation_index} [[Statute of Limitations - Tolling<br>The<br>Statute](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8d12ef&url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/10500/Statute-Limitations-Tolling-Statute.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="jrank.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
