<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are many things that make homeownership more compelling than<br>renting. These may not be important to you, and that is why some people<br>continue to rent instead of buying. These are all individual choices<br>that will lead you to either pursue renting or buying.<br><br>1.  Equity. When you invest in a house, it's real property that you<br>    own. All of the money you put into paying for your house becomes<br>    accessible to you in the form of equity. It's real property,<br>    with real worth, that you can even borrow against (i.e. a HELOC, or<br>    a Home Equity Line of Credit). When you rent, you're just borrowing<br>    the space, and the money you pay monthly is the fee to borrow the<br>    space. When you leave, that money is gone.<br>2.  Gains. Over the course of the past two years, my home's value<br>    has increased over \$150,000. Clearly, these are *unrealized* gains<br>    because I haven't sold my home. But those who did basically made<br>    profit on their homes, because it's now worth more than what they<br>    bought it for. The home is essentially an investment as well as a<br>    residence.<br>3.  Freedom. I can do whatever I want to the inside of my home.<br>    Anything, from as simple as repainting a wall to as complex as<br>    knocking down a wall. I don't have that flexibility in a place I<br>    don't own.<br><br>If none of these things are important to you, then maybe renting works<br>for you. Let someone else own the place and take care of the major<br>mechanical issues, I just want to pay some money and have a place to<br>live. There is no right answer for everyone.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why do people want to be homeowners when it so much more expensive than<br>renting? I currently have at least \$30k in repairs that are needed that<br>will have to wait because of the lack of funds.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
