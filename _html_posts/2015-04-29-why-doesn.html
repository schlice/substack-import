<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Any time the US forcefully (i.e. uninvited) takes over<br>another country, we are universally seen as oppressors. It doesn\'t<br>matter why we are there. If we take over, we are conquerors. Period.\<br>\<br>Forcefully taking over a country, without the permission of that<br>country, is barbarism. The U.S. does not engage in such barbarism in any<br>sanctioned way.\<br>\<br>We are doing just fine providing humanitarian aid to Haiti. But as<br>always, we have to balance our aid; for example, between Haiti and<br>Nepal, both of which are going to require long-term<br>support.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
