<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *You obviously enjoy inflicting pain and suppressing the rights of<br>> others.*<br>><br>> *Freedom if you forgotten is a souls right to breathe and not have<br>> their arm broken for disobeying an arbitrary command from a "law<br>> enforcement" officer.*<br>><br>> *Your not the final say on anything. Your a hired thug and killer and<br>> exist, like plumbers and cage cleaners, to do a job no one else would<br>> want to do.*<br>><br>> *Don\'t ever forget you are the enemy of the free peoples.*<br><br>Ah, I think I've found the problem here. **You honestly have no idea why<br>the police exist, who they work for, and what they do.** It's a common<br>problem, but it in no way affects what the police are required by law to<br>do. Your lack of knowledge, or your misinformation, regarding the<br>police, does not in any way change how they do their job.<br><br>The one point you made that has any validity and veracity at all is that<br>the police exist to do a job no one else would want to do. That much is<br>absolutely true. The police are there to remind people like you that<br>there are consequences to your actions. That's why people don't like<br>to see the police: because everyone wants to live by their own rules,<br>and no one wants to be held accountable when they violate the law.<br><br>Nevertheless:<br><br>- You cannot disobey the law and expect nothing to happen.<br>- You cannot ignore the lawful directives of a peace officer and expect<br>  nothing to happen.<br>- You cannot simply claim the system is corrupt while attempting to live<br>  as a productive citizen within that system, benefiting from its<br>  product.<br><br>If a peace officer gives you a lawful directive (that is, any directive<br>while acting as an agent of the state), whether or not you recognize the<br>authority of the state, you are required by law to obey that directive.<br>A police officer may use force to compel your compliance with that<br>directive. Shortened and dumbed down, this is how the interaction with<br>the police will go, in order:<br><br>- I ask you to do it<br>- I tell you to do it<br>- I make you do it<br><br>But one way or another, you will do it. I will listen with compassion to<br>your sob story, but at the end of the day, *you will still do exactly<br>what I told you to do.* The level of force required and the level of<br>pain you experience is directly proportional to the level and amount<br>of resistance you provide to the officer attempting to do his job, the<br>job we the people gave to that officer.<br><br>Oh, you didn't tell him to do that job? Actually, yes you did. When you<br>said you wanted to live in a free society, you also said that you don't<br>want anyone to mess with your freedom. So laws were passed which ensure<br>that your freedom doesn't encroach on someone else's freedom. And when<br>someone violates those laws, we have enforcement which brings those<br>lawbreakers to account for their crimes in front of a duly appointed<br>judge. You'll never see the inside of a courtroom if you follow the law.<br>But if you willingly violate the law, the police will take you to see<br>the judge, who will decide what happens to you.<br><br>That's all, no more, no less.<br><br>The harder you resist, the more it's going to hurt. But it only hurts<br>when you resist. Stop resisting, and it stops hurting. It's all up to<br>you, not the officer.<br><br>I'm really disinclined to address the remainder of your "comments," and<br>I will caution you that you are on the bleeding edge of a BNBR<br>violation. I could report you for your last little rant, but I'll assume<br>that you simply "didn't know" and you know now. So a word of warning:<br>don't spout that hateful crap again; it's a one-way ticket to being<br>banned from this site.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/If-a-police-officer-wants-to-arrest-me-and-I-start-to-sob-and-curl-into-a-fetal-position-on-the-ground-what-would-happen/answer/Robert-Thibodeau-2<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
