<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The idea behind the bill is to prevent people from<br>interfering with police officers while recording and to set standards<br>that prevent confrontations between police and people recording cops<br>doing their jobs.\<br>\<br>It\'s not intended to protect any police privacy. Police have no more<br>privacy when they are doing their jobs as anyone else on the street.\<br>\<br>It\'s not intended to prevent people from filming police officers.<br>Nothing should ever prevent that.\<br>\<br>The whole idea behind the bill is to codify a safe distance at which you<br>can film a police officer while he is in the course of doing his job. 25<br>feet is about a car length-and-a-half away. As [[Cliff<br>G.](https://www.quora.com/profile/Cliff-G-13)]{.qlink_container} notes,<br>the law likes objective standards like \"25 feet away\" better than<br>subjective standards like \"interfering with the execution of his<br>duties\" which can be interpreted differently by different people. You<br>can still get an effective video from 25 feet and be sure to not be in<br>the way of an officer. If you\'re 25 feet away, there can be no doubt<br>that you are doing nothing more than recording and you are not trying to<br>interfere with the officer doing his job.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
