<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What does "all gun control is racist" mean? It was printed on t-shirts<br>worn at a political rally in Harrisburg, Pa.**<br><br>Gun control disproportionately affects the poor. Especially when you<br>talk about certain gun control measures, like increasing mandatory<br>background checks or instituting mandatory licensing schemes, which will<br>increase the overall price of a gun, pricing the poor out of the market.<br>Essentially, any gun control measure which requires new hoops through<br>which a new owner must jump will increase the cost of a gun, which<br>disproportionately impacts the poor, probably the demographic which is<br>in the most need of guns for protection.<br><br>In areas where the poor communities are largely one race, the argument<br>is made that gun control is therefore racist because it affects one<br>particular race more than others.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
