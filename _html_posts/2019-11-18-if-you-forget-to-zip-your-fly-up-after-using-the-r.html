<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you forget to zip your fly up after using the restroom and people<br>see your genitals, can you get into legal trouble?**<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends." However, for<br>most circumstances, an inadvertent or unintentional exposure of genitals<br>is not something for which you would be charged.<br><br>The reason: in *most* states, in order to be charged with indecent<br>exposure, you must purposefully display genitals **with the intent<br>to sexually arouse.**<br><br>To that end, there are two areas in the laws of most states which will<br>prevent you from being charged, and they both involve intent:<br><br>1.  *Purposeful conduct*. This means purposefully exposing yourself for<br>    any reason, including reasons unrelated to sex. You could be drunk<br>    and urinating against a wall; this sort of exposure is generally<br>    considered purposeful. You indicated in your question that you<br>    accidentally left your clothing open. This does not indicate the<br>    purposeful conduct needed for an indecent exposure charge.<br>2.  *Intent to sexually arouse*. This portion of the statute is usually<br>    the one that differs by state. For example, Colorado says that in<br>    order to be indecent exposure, the exposure must be intended to<br>    sexually arouse. In order to be indecent exposure in Colorado,<br>    therefore, the subject must be performing some action which could<br>    reasonably be assumed to be an attempt to sexually arouse (such as<br>    suggestively touching themselves). Just being naked in your own<br>    backyard in Colorado wouldn't constitute indecent exposure. However,<br>    in New Jersey, if you are exposing in an area where someone who has<br>    not affirmatively consented to seeing you naked can see you, you can<br>    be charged with indecent exposure. So same backyard example, but<br>    someone could possibly see you from a second story window in the<br>    house next door, and you can be charged.<br><br>Note that each state runs its indecent exposure laws differently, and<br>this may vary from state to state.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
