<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Christians, do you know the meaning of the shadow of appointments,<br>> relating to Feast of Trumpets, Day of Atonement and Feast of<br>> Tabernacles?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>While I have no idea what the "shadow of appointments" means (probably<br>because I'm not Jewish), I recognize the feasts:<br><br>The Feast of Trumpets is a Jewish celebration which marked the<br>beginning of ten days of consecration and adoration before God.<br><br>The Day of Atonement is a Jewish celebration also known as Yom<br>Kippur. It is the most solemn holy day of all the Israelite feasts and<br>festivals, occurring once a year on the tenth day of Tishri, the seventh<br>month of the Hebrew calendar. On this day, the High Priest performs<br>elaborate rituals to atone for the sins of the people.<br><br>The Feast of Tabernacles is one of three feasts that all "native<br>born" male Jews are commanded to participate in, and is the seventh and<br>last feast that the Lord commanded Israel to observe. The Feast of<br>Tabernacles, like all of the feasts, was instituted by God as a way of<br>reminding Israelites in every generation of their deliverance by God<br>from Egypt.<br><br>> Is Messiah your King, High Priest and Bridegroom?<br><br>If you're referring to Jesus, then yes. Jesus is our Messiah. He is our<br>King. He is our savior. He is sovereign, He is holy, He is worthy of our<br>praise. Several passages in the bible hint at Christ as the bridegroom<br>(cf Revelation 21:2, Revelation 21:9, Ephesians 5:25 etc)<br><br>> Are you going to practice these Appointments this fall?<br><br>No.<br><br>Primarily, I'm not going to practice these Appointments because I'm not<br>Jewish.<br><br>Secondarily, these feasts do not make sense in a Christian worldview.<br>For example, the Day of Atonement is the day that the High Priest<br>performs a ritual to atone for the sins of the people. As Christians,<br>Jesus Christ sacrificed Himself on the cross to atone for all of our<br>sins; past, present, and future. There is no further need for sacrifice.<br>Christ sacrificed once, for all. Therefore, the Day of Atonement has<br>been "overcome by events," so to speak. The necessity of continuing to<br>atone for sins has been replaced by Christ's one-time sacrifice. His<br>blood washes us clean. We don't "re-sacrifice" Christ every year, or<br>every week, or on any other periodic schedule. Christ's sacrifice was<br>sufficient to cleanse us of all of our sins.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
