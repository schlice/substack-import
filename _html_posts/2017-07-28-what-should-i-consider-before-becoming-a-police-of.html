<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm sure you will get some juicy answers to this one, but I want to<br>share the one that sticks out with me. My training sergeant told us this<br>on day one of the academy.<br><br>*Nobody becomes a cop to be loved.*<br><br>If you want to be loved, be a firefighter. Cops are either regarded with<br>skepticism at best, or outright disdain and hatred at worst.<br><br>*Why?*<br><br>Because **police officers remind you that there are consequences to your<br>actions.**<br><br>If you're okay with being viewed skeptically at best, and with hostility<br>at worst, everywhere you go, then maybe police work is for you.<br><br>And after a *long* while of slogging it out in the soup, you *might* be<br>able to make a difference in someone's life.<br><br>I know, not painting a very glamorous picture, am I? Well, for the most<br>part, it's not. Long hours, not the best clientele, time away from your<br>family, working almost every holiday, etc.<br><br>But it is very personally rewarding work, if you are the type of person<br>who is energized by providing some small service to others. For them,<br>the promise that you are making a difference in some small way is<br>extremely appealing. It's the same mindset that makes someone a good<br>military member, which is why you see a lot of former military personnel<br>in police work.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
