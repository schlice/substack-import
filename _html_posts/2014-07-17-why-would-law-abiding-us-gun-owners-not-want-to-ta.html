<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Thank you for your question, and I see that you\'re at<br/>least trying to take positive steps in the right direction. However,<br/>you\'re a little confused about some of the points you made.\<br/>\<br/>1. Registration is the first step towards confiscation. This is not<br/>hysteria talking, we are only learning from history. It happened in<br/>England, it happened in Australia, and it will happen here too if we<br/>allow guns to be registered by the government.\<br/>\<br/>What exactly would be the purpose of registering a gun? There is no<br/>other purchase in America that you have to register. You have to<br/>register cars, but you don\'t register the \*purchase\* of a car with<br/>the government. Registering your car tells the government that you paid<br/>the road use tax to use the roads (that\'s why \"license plates\" is a<br/>misnomer; in the UK, they are called \"tax tags\"). What good does gun<br/>registration further? All it does is allow the government to know who<br/>has guns and how many. What purpose, exactly, does that serve? Weapons<br/>would be registered by the government so the government can control<br/>them. If only to identify to the public, in another 20 years following<br/>the passing of such legislation, that the weapons used to commit crimes<br/>are either stolen from law-abiding citizens, or were never registered in<br/>the first place (i.e. sold on the black market). But we already know<br/>that. So why register such a purchase? When would weapons be<br/>confiscated? When crimes are committed with them, in which case they are<br/>confiscated anyway. You suggest going door to door to search for<br/>unregistered weapons? Law-abiding citizens certainly won\'t have<br/>unregistered weapons, only criminals will, and their guns get<br/>confiscated anyway. The only reason, based on history, to register guns,<br/>is so that there is a national registry of which houses to go to to<br/>confiscate the same purchased items when the government decides to<br/>repeal the Second Amendment and take guns away from people.\<br/>\<br/>2. You can\'t require a \"license to own.\" That clearly violates<br/>the Second Amendment, and licensure to keep an bear arms would be<br/>Congress passing a law that restricts people from keeping and bearing<br/>arms. Again, until the Second Amendment is repealed, this will not<br/>happen. Yes, essentially Illinois has this, but the people in that state<br/>clearly have no desire to stand up to the government and tell them that<br/>it\'s a Second Amendment violation, so they get what they deserve.<br/>That\'s why I only lived in Illinois when I was assigned there, not by<br/>choice.\<br/>\<br/>3. **Taking a health test to validate that you are sane isn\'t a<br/>workable solution**, and also could be seen as a violation of the Second<br/>Amendment. While I do agree that we have to do something to prevent guns<br/>from falling into the hands of the mentally ill, forcing everyone to<br/>take tests to determine their mental capacity is not a workable<br/>solution, and again focuses on the legal owners instead of focusing on<br/>the people we want to keep away from the guns. Requiring that tests be<br/>passed and other hoops be jumped through before purchasing a gun is also<br/>a \"restriction\" on lawful firearms ownership, which is a 2A violation.<br/>We have to do a better job at determining whether or not people are<br/>mentally ill, and then flag them so that they cannot purchase firearms<br/>from the white market. We don\'t \"test\" people for mental capacity<br/>when making any other purchase, and cars would be a far better choice<br/>for testing people before making purchases, since a person with<br/>diminished mental capacity can kill lots of people in a really short<br/>amount of time with a car, even more so than with a gun. I can kill<br/>twice as many people as James Holmes did in a matter of seconds by<br/>driving my car down the middle of an open-air mall. Yet I don\'t have to<br/>take a mental health test before getting behind the wheel of a car. The<br/>logic doesn\'t pass muster.\<br/>\<br/>4. **The focus is wrongly on the weapon, when it should be on the<br/>person.** We\'ve answered this question many times on Quora, but we\'ve<br/>proven that it is not the gun that kills the person. We tend to focus on<br/>guns because they\'re an easy target; they are the only device<br/>purpose-built to kill. But killing is justified in certain<br/>circumstances, so how I kill in those circumstances should be with the<br/>tool that provides me the maximum benefit with the minimum possibility<br/>of collateral damage (to myself or others) and when I have to kill<br/>someone, a gun is the best way to do it. It\'s the best tool for the<br/>job, but people are concerned because its job is to kill. We should<br/>focus on the persons who should not be allowed to possess a gun. We also<br/>have answered this question many times, but improving the mental health<br/>system in this country would be a great place to<br/>start.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
