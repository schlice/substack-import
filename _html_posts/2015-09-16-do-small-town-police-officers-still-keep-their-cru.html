<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Yes. Even in larger towns, officers can be assigned<br>\"take-home\" cruisers. Regulations are very strict with how and when<br>the vehicle can be driven: to and from official duty. That\'s it.\<br>\<br>And no passengers. It\'s not a taxi service.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
