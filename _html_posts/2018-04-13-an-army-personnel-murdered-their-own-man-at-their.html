<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**An army personnel murdered their own man at their camp. Can the police<br>arrest them and persecute them in civilian court?**<br><br>Let's assume for the sake of the question that you are referring to an<br>army post on US soil.<br><br>The answer is yes, the police can arrest the murderer, and the city<br>or county can try him in the civilian court.<br><br>This is because the vast majority of military bases are *concurrent<br>jurisdiction*, where both the local police or sheriff's office<br>(depending on ownership of the land) and the military have jurisdiction.<br>There are some exceptions, where the base may be on Federal land, but<br>the majority of US military installations are on state-owned land.<br><br>However, they usually do not. Usually, they allow the military to retain<br>jurisdiction and prosecute the offender, assuming (as your question<br>presupposes) that the incident took place on the post.<br><br>You'll note that when the military prosecutes the offender, and he<br>serves his time and is released, the civilian authority can then arrest<br>the offender and try him *again* in civilian court and send him to<br>civilian prison, and this is one of the chief exceptions to the Fifth<br>Amendment protections against "double jeopardy." This would be a very<br>rare occurrence, and would generally only happen in cases where it was a<br>very high profile murder on post, or where general opinion was that<br>justice was not served through the UCMJ.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
