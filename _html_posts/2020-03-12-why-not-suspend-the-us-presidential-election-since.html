<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**According to the US Constitution, if there is a massive national<br>crisis, can the presidential election be suspended?**<br><br>No, because we don't have one Presidential election governed by the<br>Constitution. We have 51 Presidential elections, all controlled by<br>entities outside of the Federal government. The Federal government<br>doesn't control elections, the states do.<br><br>And there's no provision in the Constitution for it to govern how the<br>states elect presidents. There's no provision for a President's term to<br>be extended because of a crisis. We must hold an election.<br><br>It would be up to the state to effect an election during a massive<br>national crisis.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
