<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You give a great opportunity to make a point, which is why I didn\'t<br>summarily delete your comment.<br><br>Yes, it is true that both the addict and the user/abuser both begin in<br>the same place: a poor choice. Everyone makes poor choices in their<br>lifetime. It happens. And on a side note, your absolutist opinions about<br>addicts are quite disturbing, and pretty closed minded.<br><br>The problem comes after that first poor decision. In the brain of<br>the addict, the system which controls choice is broken. It causes<br>addicts to *inappropriately* assign more importance to the drug than<br>would normally be assigned. The drug becomes more important than sleep,<br>food, sex, hygiene, etc. in the primitive portion of the brain.<br><br>Being an addict is not a choice. It is a disease *of choice.* Addicts<br>should not be treated like criminals. They should be treated like<br>patients.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-would-police-know-Im-a-recovering-addict-if-Ive-never-been-arrested/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
