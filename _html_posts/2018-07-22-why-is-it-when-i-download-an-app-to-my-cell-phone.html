<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is it when I download an app to my cell phone or any cell phone it<br>doesn\'t have even a quarter of the features that that app would have on<br>my PC, it\'s like an extremely limited useless version?**<br><br>The fact that you're recognizing that there is a difference between a PC<br>version and a mobile version illustrates the problem we have of taking a<br>PC-based app and porting it to a mobile phone rather than designing a<br>mobile experience from the ground up.<br><br>Your phone is a computer. It's just a smaller, less-powerful computer.<br>It can't do nearly as much as your PC can do. Therefore, in order to<br>make the app actually functional on your tiny handheld PC, the app<br>designers have to make some, er, *trade-offs*. Will we structure this<br>page to look exactly as the PC app does, or do we have to trim some<br>stuff to what is barely needed in a mobile experience? Can we do some<br>remote processing and backend crunching in order to move the workload<br>off of the phone and into the cloud?<br><br>If the app starts off its existence as a mobile-designed app, you don't<br>notice any trade-offs, because it always was a mobile app.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
