<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [As [[Scott M.<br>Stolz](https://www.quora.com/profile/Scott-M-Stolz)]{.qlink_container}<br>indicated, New York and New Jersey had previously been a red-only state<br>for police and fire, green for volunteer medical personnel, and amber<br>for slow-moving vehicles or caution. The police at the time (mid 80\'s)<br>commissioned a study on visibility of lights at distance, and found<br>that, as indicated, blue lights are easier to see at greater distance at<br>night. The New York Chiefs of Police petitioned the State Assembly to<br>change the law regarding colors of lights because of safety. It took<br>them more than 20 years to take action on that, and are now just<br>starting to allow blue lights on police vehicles.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
