<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>My best friend at USAFA was prior enlisted at Plattsburg AFB in upstate<br>New York. He worked on avionics and automatic flight controls (I have no<br>idea why I remember that) on the F-111. Several flavors of F-111s were<br>flown out of Plattsburg, but this story involves the Ravens (EF-111As)<br>that had the large electronic countermeasures (ECM) pod at the tip of<br>the vertical stab:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-2204e886a055785b90f6733d9b962a62){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-2204e886a055785b90f6733d9b962a62" master_w="300"<br>master_h="202"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Realize that this is early to mid 80s when this happened: no cell<br>phones, and TV was still broadcast OTA (over-the-air). The story is told<br>that a right-seater in the Raven had a house that was roughly on final<br>approach for one of the runways at Plattsburg. Apparently, he would let<br>his wife know that he made it home by quickly powering on and powering<br>off the ECM pod when he was over his house. This would cause all the TVs<br>in the neighborhood to briefly "fuzz out." It was also entirely outside<br>of regulation.<br><br>Eventually, other people in the neighborhood complained to the base that<br>their aircraft were interfering with their TVs. A little research,<br>matching up the incidents to flight plans, and the culprit was quickly<br>discovered and disciplined.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
