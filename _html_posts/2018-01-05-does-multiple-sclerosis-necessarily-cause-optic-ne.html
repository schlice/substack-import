<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Does multiple sclerosis necessarily cause optic neuritis?<br><br>Short answer is no.<br><br>Optic neuritis is one possible symptom of MS, among many. Not everyone<br>who gets MS will also get optic neuritis, but it is a very common first<br>symptom.<br><br>And even so, the question also could imply that optic neuritis is always<br>caused by MS, and this is also not true. It's only true in about half of<br>the cases of optic neuritis that the cause is MS.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
