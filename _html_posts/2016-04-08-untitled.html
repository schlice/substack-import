<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So you\'re saying that the Executive branch could force its workers to<br>be of a particular religion, and could potentially punish them for<br>failing to do so.<br><br>In the United States, this is true. It could happen. It legally can<br>happen. Just as many states do not regulate how the businesses in their<br>state run, the government is left to regulate itself as far as how it<br>runs.<br><br>The question then becomes: will it ever happen?<br><br>Take a look at this: [[GUIDELINES ON RELIGIOUS EXERCISE AND RELIGIOUS<br>EXPRESSION IN THE FEDERAL<br>WORKPLACE](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d6035b&url=http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/New/html/19970819-3275.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nara.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>This was written during the Clinton era, and applies to all Federal<br>agencies. Could it be re-written by another President? Yes, it could.<br><br>It\'s hard to imagine it being done without becoming a huge black eye<br>for that administration, since most people in the US take their<br>religious freedom very seriously.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Hypothetically-does-the-First-Amendment-tolerated-officers-proselytizing-enlisted-men-given-none-are-members-of-the-legislative-branch/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
