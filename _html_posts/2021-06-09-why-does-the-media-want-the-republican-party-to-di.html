They will do anything<br>and everything they can to discredit, destroy, and utterly annihilate<br>him. They will even re-work their core principles so that they buddy up<br>with other groups which also hate Trump. No more "centrist to a fault,"<br>the media now gleefully jumps into bed with the DNC so that together,<br>they can destroy Trump. Hasn't worked so far, but they won't stop<br>trying.<br><br>So it's no surprise that the media gets behind any effort to sideline<br>Trump and make him insignificant, including backing certain Republicans<br>who think the party should distance itself from Trump in order to win in<br>2022. They excitedly scream, "Yes! Yes! Do what he says!" while pointing<br>at the Republicans who want to sideline Trump, bouncing up and down like<br>giddy schoolgirls.<br><br>I will be completely honest: I don't know whether or not the Republican<br>party should distance itself from Trump. I don't know if that would be<br>beneficial or harmful to the party. I haven't really decided yet.<br><br>But why the media wants Republicans to distance themselves from Trump is<br>an easy answer.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why does the media want the Republican Party to distance itself from<br>Donald Trump in order to win in 2022 when many GOP like Lindsey Graham<br>feel that they can't move on without him?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
