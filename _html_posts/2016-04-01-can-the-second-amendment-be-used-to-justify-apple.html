<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Regardless of the parallels you may draw between the *reason* behind the<br>Second Amendment and any data privacy issues, you cannot use the Second<br>Amendment to justify data encryption unless you can prove that data<br>encryption can be classified as \"arms.\"<br><br>Arms, in the Second Amendment\'s vernacular, refer to mechanical devices<br>which cause a projectile to be fired at a very high velocity for the<br>purpose of killing (by the way all you Quoran sticklers, if you want to<br>debate the purpose of a gun, ask me a separate question; I\'m not going<br>to get into it here, nor will I answer any comments about it; it is<br>unrelated to this question).<br><br>\"Data encryption\" is the act of using a \"cipher\" and a \"key\" to<br>make data unreadable but when \"decrypted\" using the \"key\" the data<br>once again becomes readable.<br><br>As you can see, \"data encryption\" is not \"arms.\"<br><br>So in the strictest sense, you cannot use the Second Amendment to<br>justify data encryption. The Second Amendment is strictly limited in<br>scope to \"arms,\" and the keeping and bearing thereof.<br><br>Data encryption is more closely related to the \"right to privacy\"<br>which has been interpreted to exist in the Constitution than the Second<br>Amendment. You can therefore use the Constitutional \"right to privacy\"<br>to justify data encryption much more readily than you can use the Second<br>Amendment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
