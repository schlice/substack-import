<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is impeachment a legislative action?<br><br>Impeachment is an action that can only be carried out by the Legislative<br>branch of government, so in that sense it is a legislative action.<br><br>I think you were meaning to ask whether impeachment is a *legal* action<br>or a *political* action. In that sense, impeachment is a *political*<br>action. In other words, you don't technically need to break a law in<br>order to be impeached.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
