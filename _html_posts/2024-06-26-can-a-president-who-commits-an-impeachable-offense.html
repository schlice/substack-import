<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, but probably not until after that president leaves office.<br><br>I say "probably" because it has never been tested before, and the<br>Constitution doesn't speak about it. The Department of Justice's Office<br>of Legal Council (OLC) published a memorandum in 1973 amidst the<br>Watergate scandal saying that it is unconstitutional to prosecute a<br>sitting president. Its arguments include that the president \"is the<br>symbolic head of the Nation. To wound him by a criminal proceeding is to<br>hamstring the operation of the whole governmental apparatus in both<br>foreign and domestic affairs.\" It says that the statute of limitations<br>should not be tolled while the president is in office, but suggests that<br>Congress could extend the statute of limitations specifically for<br>presidents.\[1\](#HqQTf){#cite-HqQTf .citation_link}<br><br>After *Clinton v. Jones* was decided, saying that presidential immunity<br>does not apply to crimes which are alleged to have occurred before the<br>president took office, the OLC once again issued a memorandum in 2000.<br>They said that it was still improper to prosecute a sitting president<br>due to the adverse affect it might have on his ability to govern.<br><br>These memorandums do not have the force of law. They merely govern how<br>the Department of Justice will operate.<br><br>So even if a president commits an impeachable offense which could also<br>be criminally charged, but is not removed from office, it is unlikely<br>that criminal charges will be filed while the president remains in<br>office.<br><br>(EDIT) Dateline, July 1, 2024: The Supreme Court has decided in *Trump<br>v. United States* that a president enjoys *absolute immunity* from<br>criminal prosecution for any official act performed while the<br>subject is president. It is the responsibility of the Court to determine<br>what acts are "official acts" and what acts are "unofficial acts."<br><br>The President enjoys absolute immunity when those acts relate to the<br>core powers granted to them by the Constitution -- for example, the<br>power to issue pardons, veto legislation, recognize ambassadors, and<br>make appointments. The President enjoys presumptive immunity when<br>the act is not "manifestly or palpably beyond \the president's\<br>authority." The President has no immunity when the act is determined<br>to be an "unofficial act."<br><br>Clearly, the Court said, determining what acts are "official" and what<br>acts are "unofficial" "...can be difficult," said Chief Justice John<br>Roberts. He emphasized that the immunity that the court recognizes takes<br>a broad view of what constitutes a president's "official<br>responsibilities," "covering actions so long as they are not manifestly<br>or palpably beyond his authority." In conducting the official/unofficial<br>inquiry, Roberts added, courts cannot consider the president's motives,<br>nor can they designate an act as unofficial simply because it allegedly<br>violates the law.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-HqQTf){.citation_index} [[This obscure 1973 memo kept<br>Mueller from considering a Trump indictment - Roll<br>Call](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6708e6&url=https://rollcall.com/2019/05/29/this-obscure-1973-memo-kept-mueller-from-considering-a-trump-indictment/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="rollcall.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
