<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm going to venture a guess and say that this is the Harvest Church you<br>are referencing (since you didn't specify):<br><br>[https://harvest.org/(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=77b146&url=https://harvest.org/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>I don't have a problem with their stated beliefs. They believe in *sola<br>scriptura*, *sola fide* and *sola Cristo* from what I can see from their<br>website. I can also infer that they probably believe in *sola gratia*<br>and *soli deo gloria* as well, meaning that they believe in the five<br>*solas* of the Reformation.<br><br>Which puts their beliefs squarely in line with mine.<br><br>If there was something specific about them you wanted to discuss,<br>perhaps you should ask about that.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What are everyone\'s thoughts on the Harvest Church?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
