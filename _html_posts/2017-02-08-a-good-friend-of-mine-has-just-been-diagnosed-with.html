<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We've answered this question multiple times on Quora. Did you use Quora<br>search? I'll admit it's not very good, but try it sometime.<br><br>Your friend will be going through some very heavy emotions. It's the<br>same set of emotions (the stages of grief) one goes through when someone<br>close to you dies. There's rejection, anger, compromise, and eventually<br>acceptance. Those emotions all happen, but they don't happen at any<br>pre-defined pace. In other words, it's different for everyone. With MS,<br>there are lots of "if only" mental exercises you go through. "If only I<br>would have done X differently, I wouldn't have MS." "If only I hadn't<br>smoked in my late teens, I wouldn't have MS" (that was mine, by the<br>way). But then comes compromise. "Maybe if I do X, I can get through<br>this." Such as, "Maybe if I walk a mile a few times a week, I can<br>improve my overall health and it will all be manageable." "The MS pills<br>aren't so bad, I can take a pill a day." Or for me, when I started an<br>only injectables were available, "My seven-year old neighbor is diabetic<br>and gets insulin shots three times a day; my medicine is only once a<br>day. If he can do it, so can I." And then you accept that "you have MS,<br>but MS does not have you." In other words, MS is just one of the things<br>that make up who you are; it does not define you.<br><br>You should be there for your friend while they go through this emotional<br>roller-coaster. It's important to remember that while MS represents a<br>significant change to life and how you plan on living it, *it doesn't<br>represent a death sentence.* You cannot die from MS. You can die from<br>complications from severe, long-term untreated MS, but MS itself is not<br>fatal.<br><br>Make sure that through the grief and anxiety, your friend makes an<br>appointment with a neurologist if they haven't done so already. That<br>diagnosis should be delivered or confirmed by a neurologist. While there<br>is no cure for MS, your friend will need to start on one of the approved<br>MS therapy drugs. There are plenty to choose from, but they all<br>basically do the same thing: slow down the progression of MS, and reduce<br>the severity and duration of relapses. It's important to start on one of<br>the approved MS therapy drugs as soon as possible. This is the<br>"conservative" approach: to "conserve" as much brain matter as possible,<br>because once it's damaged, it doesn't come back. Depending on neural<br>load, some reserve neurons can wire around the damaged areas, but that<br>reserve load is a fixed quantity. The current theory is that once that<br>reserve load is depleted, relapses gain more permanence and do not remit<br>as easily (or fully). Therefore, we want to save as much brain matter as<br>possible.<br><br>In short, *just be a good friend*. Be the ear to listen, and be the<br>shoulder to lean on, while your friend goes through the stages of grief<br>which, while painful to watch (and even more painful to go through<br>yourself), are necessary to the healing process.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
