<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Constitution does not recognize rights as pre-existing. That was the<br>Declaration of Independence:<br><br>> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created<br>> equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable<br>> Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of<br>> Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted<br>> among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed<br><br>So you'd not only need to completely re-write the Constitution, but<br>you'd need to re-write the Declaration of Independence too.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Should the Constitution be amended so that it says that the Constitution<br>is the source of our rights instead of how it currently recognizes<br>rights as pre-existing since it leads people to say that rights are God<br>given?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
