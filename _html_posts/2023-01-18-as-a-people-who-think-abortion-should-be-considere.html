<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm just going to assume you're talking about the October 2021<br>conviction of one Brittney Poolaw in Oklahoma, who was indeed convicted<br>of 1st degree manslaughter because she miscarried her baby.<br><br>[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bri\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eec06e&url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/brittany-poolaw-manslaughter-miscarriage-pregnancy/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cbsnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Prosecutors say that she violated the manslaughter statute of the state,<br>because she was taking methamphetamines during her pregnancy. Oklahoma<br>manslaughter law says that a homicide is manslaughter in the first<br>degree when the offender is \"engaged in the commission of a<br>misdemeanor; in a heat of passion, but in a cruel and unusual manner, or<br>by means of a dangerous weapon; or when perpetrating unnecessarily<br>either while resisting an attempt by the person killed to commit a<br>crime, or after such attempt shall have failed.\" Because she was<br>committing a misdemeanor (use of a controlled substance), the homicide<br>of the baby becomes manslaughter.<br><br>Critics of the prosecution say that the state\'s murder and manslaughter<br>laws don\'t apply to those who have miscarriages. In a statement<br>released shortly after Poolaw was convicted and sentenced to four years<br>in prison, National Advocates for Pregnant Women (NAPW) spoke out in her<br>defense, arguing prosecutors had blamed Poolaw for her miscarriage<br>"contrary to all medical science." "Ms. Poolaw's case is a tragedy,"<br>NAPW said in its statement. "She has suffered the trauma of pregnancy<br>loss, has been jailed for a year and half during a pandemic, and was<br>charged and convicted of a crime without basis in law or science."<br><br>Oklahoma has, starting in at least 2020, been cracking down on women who<br>abuse their unborn children through their own voluntary actions.<br><br>No one questions that she did what she is accused of doing. But the<br>questions surrounding the ethics of using the law to prosecute women who<br>have miscarriages are varied and not questions we can definitively<br>answer. Of course, the elephant in the room is this: should we even<br>consider prosecuting a woman who didn't definitively cause the death of<br>her baby? Note that in this case, there were several birth defects which<br>could have led to the miscarriage; the drug use was not conclusively<br>ruled to be the cause. However, the drug use could have caused the birth<br>defects, so the state can definitely make the case that she was<br>intentionally engaging in behavior that could harm her child, and if<br>harm came to that child, it is likely that the state would "connect the<br>dots" and claim that the drug use was a contributing factor to the death<br>of the baby. This is what they did in this case, and the jury was<br>persuaded by that argument.<br><br>We can have our own personal opinions, but the overturn of *Roe* means<br>that each state is allowed to decide for itself, and ultimately it's the<br>majority of the people in that state who will make that decision.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
