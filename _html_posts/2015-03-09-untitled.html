<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [*While we rush people out of cars on fire, people ARE held<br>responsible for injuries resulting when they touch injured people.*\<br>\<br>Actually, this is not true. All 50 states have what they call \"Good<br>Samaritan\" laws that indemnify most individuals when assisting at the<br>scene of an accident. A small number of states do not indemnify<br>civilians, but most do. There are peculiarities that vary from state to<br>state, but they all have some form of the law. So if you rushed in to an<br>accident scene and tried your best to help but you actually ended up<br>causing a secondary injury, the Good Samaritan laws in your area<br>(assuming you have appropriate ones \-- we do) would protect you from<br>any civil or criminal penalties, assuming you were not acting recklessly<br>(dragging a person by a clearly broken arm, etc), or if you have<br>training, acting outside of the bounds of your<br>training.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Can-the-phrase-hit-and-run-apply-to-bicycle-accidents/answer/Steve-Austin-37<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
