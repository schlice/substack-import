<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What Texas should do is entirely up to Texas.<br><br>What the Texas legislature should do is entirely up to the Texas<br>legislature and the voters in Texas.<br><br>I am a believer in equal rights for all humans. This means that the<br>fetus has a right to live, just like the mother has a right to live. In<br>my opinion (and in the opinion of the founders of this country), the<br>right to life is pre-eminent amongst the rights. That means that nothing<br>is more important than the right to life. All other rights are<br>subordinate to that. Therefore, if there is a conflict between the right<br>to life of the fetus and the right to bodily autonomy of the mother, the<br>right to bodily autonomy must *cede* to the right to life. This<br>isn't an "anti-woman" position, nor is it an "anti-women's healthcare"<br>decision. It's a right to life position. If you believe that the right<br>to life is the most important right we have, then all other rights must<br>take a back seat to the right to life..<br><br>That's my personal opinion.<br><br>But if I were a *legislator*, I would be more swayed by the consent<br>argument. You consent to pregnancy when you consent to sex. Therefore,<br>most pregnancies should not be terminated. However, in the case of rape,<br>there was no consent to sex, so there was no consent to pregnancy<br>either. To that end, if I were a legislator, I could see including a<br>provision in the case of rape.<br><br>However, I also understand that there is a case to be made which says<br>that the fetus is an innocent victim, just like the mother, and the<br>solution is not to kill the innocent victim. Doing so doesn't "treat"<br>rape. It may treat a *symptom* of rape, but it does so in the most<br>brutal and inhumane way possible.<br><br>It's a tough decision. Texas made the call that the majority of the<br>people of Texas wanted. You may have made a different decision had you<br>been a legislator in Texas. That's okay. We are allowed to have<br>different opinions.<br><br>You're welcome to discuss my opinion with me if you choose. But if you<br>just want to comment and tell me what an evil person I am because I want<br>to force women to be "baby factories" and have no rights at all, then<br>you didn't read what I wrote, and I will not discuss with you. I'll<br>simply delete your comment without a second thought and move on with my<br>life.<br><br>And as a side note, don't you find it interesting that all of the people<br>who support killing babies have already been born themselves? They have<br>"born privilege." They don't even recognize their privilege. Sheesh.<br>Check your privilege.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
