<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why is Trump still in office if he\'s doing illegal things?<br><br>The presidency is an elected office. It is an office that has specific<br>procedures about how someone can be removed from that office.<br><br>If the president was actually doing illegal things (for which you have<br>provided no proof, but let's play Devil's Advocate), the<br>Constitutionally-mandated procedure is for the House of Representatives<br>to pass Articles of Impeachment against the President, and for the<br>Senate to hold a trial after which they can remove him from office.<br><br>Once he is removed from office, he can face criminal proceedings for<br>doing "illegal things."<br><br>So why is he still in office? Because Congress hasn't done anything to<br>remove him from office yet. Maybe that's because there's no evidence<br>that he's done any "illegal things." I don't know, just a thought.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
