<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The pressure you\'re feeling is the difference between the<br>pressure on the inside of your ear and the outside of your ear.\<br>\<br>]<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-e93fffc481599f43221dc958029ae0ae){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-e93fffc481599f43221dc958029ae0ae"<br>master_w="3100" master_h="2500"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br>Your inner and outer ear are separated by your eardrum, which is a thin<br>membrane that vibrates when sound waves hit it, which allows you to<br>hear.\<br>\<br>You can see in the diagram that your eardrum separates the ***outer<br>ear* (the tan part) from the *middle ear*** (the red part). The air<br>pressure is balanced by the Eustachian tube (in the diagram above as the<br>\"Auditory tube\"). The Eustachian tube enters the back of the throat to<br>balance that pressure.\<br>\<br>One of the problems that often occurs is that sinus drainage or sinus<br>blockage will block the Eustachian tube and prevent that pressure from<br>equalizing normally. This will result in \"clicks\" or \"pops\" being<br>heard during ascent or descent (while pressure is changing). In some<br>instances, the sinuses cause such significant blockage that pressure<br>doesn\'t change at all, causing pain as the eardrum is stretched by the<br>difference in pressure between the outer and inner ear.\<br>\<br>One of the things that pilots are taught (as well as scuba divers for<br>the same reason) is what\'s referred to as the [[Valsalva<br>maneuver](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=523f14&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valsalva_maneuver){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. This is essentially<br>forcing air up into the Eustachian tube in order to equalize pressure on<br>both sides of the ear drum. To perform the Valsalva maneuver, pinch your<br>nose and try to blow out your pinched nose. Don\'t do this too<br>forcefully or you could hurt your ears, but if you do it moderately<br>forcefully, you will hear pops and cracks as air is forced into your<br>middle ear.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
