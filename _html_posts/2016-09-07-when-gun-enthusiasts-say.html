<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You've heard that violation of these laws is rarely charged. The result<br>at the prosecutor's table, when they are actually charged, is that they<br>are used as bargaining chips in plea deals. Prosecutors will agree to<br>drop the gun charges in exchange for guilty pleas on the actual crime.<br>So even when the charges are actually levied, they are not treated with<br>much seriousness, because prosecutors appear to be more worried about<br>"wins" than charges.<br><br>In order to fix this, we would need to change the law. We would need to<br>make it so that when a crime is committed with a gun, the gun charges<br>must be applied (not optional). We would also have to specify that the<br>gun charges cannot be removed via plea bargain. Finally, we must set a<br>minimum mandatory sentence, not a simple mandatory sentence. We must<br>set a floor below which a sentence could not go for that charge.<br><br>(EDIT) Also, we have to ensure that the sentence for the gun charge runs<br>*consecutively* with any other sentences, not *concurrently*. So if you<br>do a crime with a gun, you're getting a minimum of five years in jail,<br>regardless of what other charges are filed or what other sentences are<br>handed down.<br><br>Until we do this, we will never see criminals be serious about the fact<br>that they commit crimes with guns. They will use guns with impunity,<br>knowing that in plea bargain, they can usually get the gun charges<br>thrown out. They do a minimum amount of time in jail, and they walk<br>free.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
