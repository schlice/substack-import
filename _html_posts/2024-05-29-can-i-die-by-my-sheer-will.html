<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You've actually listed two different things:<br><br>1.  Willing your body to stop working, or willing your heart to stop<br>    beating<br>2.  "Broken Heart Syndrome"<br><br>You can't *will* your body to stop working. Your autonomic nervous<br>system is impervious to shutdown. That said, the vagus nerve is<br>susceptible to *influence*, to wit, we can calm our minds and in turn,<br>slow our breathing and in turn, slow our heart rate.<br><br>But you cannot, through sheer force of will, make you heart stop<br>beating, or shut off your autonomic nervous system. Your body's will to<br>live is greater than that.<br><br>To your second point regarding the old couple, there is a phenomenon<br>known as "Broken Heart Syndrome" or takotsubo cardiomyopathy. It is a<br>reaction your heart has to a surge of stress hormones caused by an<br>emotionally stressful event. Broken heart syndrome causes the heart to<br>stop operating normally, resulting in heart failure. During these<br>situations, the body releases an increase of hormones, which temporarily<br>paralyzes your heart and limits its standard functionality.<br><br>And if this happens in an old person, who already has a weakened heart,<br>it is possible that they could succumb to this heart paralysis and die.<br><br>So while rare, it is possible to "die from a broken heart," but it is<br>not possible to stop your heart beating through sheer force of will.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
