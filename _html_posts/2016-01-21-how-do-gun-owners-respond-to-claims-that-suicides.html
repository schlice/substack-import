<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It\'s a spurious argument. It\'s like saying that households which have<br>computers with DVD-RW drives will illegally copy movies more than houses<br>that don\'t.<br><br>Guns don\'t make suicide *possible*. They certainly make suicide<br>*easier*, as the sole purpose of a gun is to kill, and it does so<br>very effectively and efficiently. But the fact that a gun makes suicide<br>easier isn\'t an argument to get rid of the gun. It\'s an argument to<br>get rid of suicide.<br><br>However, I will say this: I think technology has come far enough that we<br>can have fast access to our firearms in advanced gun safes while still<br>keeping them out of the hands of those who would do stupid things with<br>them (i.e. commit crimes or kill themselves). I think we should start<br>looking more closely at \"safe storage\" and what we can do to increase<br>the number of people who regularly use gun safes. As I said, safe<br>technology has come a long way, baby (sorry, I\'m reminded of that<br>infamous Newport ad every time I say \"come a long way.\" I\'m a child<br>of the 80s, I can\'t help it). Anyway, safe technology has advanced to<br>the point where we can get quick access to our firearms and still keep<br>them out of the hands of those in which they do not belong.<br><br>If the government wants to invest money in something, don\'t bother with<br>a national gun registry (which accomplishes nothing; you can still<br>commit suicide with a registered gun just as easily as you can with an<br>unregistered gun), don\'t bother with a buyback (heh, they don\'t have<br>enough money to by back 1/10th of the guns in circulation), how about<br>federal subsidies to buy advanced gun safes? How about grants to gun<br>safe manufacturers to drive the costs down? How about grants to improve<br>the technology behind a gun safe? The technology isn\'t in the box,<br>it\'s in the method by which we determine who is authorized to open the<br>box. We have to be accurate, and we have to be fast. I should be able to<br>reach my hand towards the handle of the gun safe and it should recognize<br>me and unlock before I even touch the safe. That would be cool. We<br>[[already<br>have](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3d3eed&url=https://jet.com/product/detail/1992dfd9339c4677a164697f593f3ddb?jcmp%3Dpla:ggl:home_garden_a1:business_home_security_security_safes_a1_other:na:na:na:na:na:2%26code%3DPLA15%26k_clickid%3D082f5193-22fb-47ce-9ad3-5dcb62ee45e7%26abkId%3D403-498938%26gclid%3DCNbatdaTu8oCFYVFaQodCpwHag){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="jet.com"}]{.qlink_container} such technology available. I<br>always hesitate to post such links, because I\'ll get a slew of people<br>telling me why that particular safe is bad, or that particular<br>technology is bad, or why I shouldn\'t be required to lock my gun up,<br>ever.<br><br>Safe storage in a technologically-advanced gun safe is a<br>*compromise*. Gun owners won\'t like it because they\'ll actually<br>have to lock up their guns. Gun control advocates won\'t like it because<br>we\'re not reducing the number of guns in circulation, or limiting<br>magazine size, or getting rid of scary-looking \"assault weapons.\"<br><br>But safe storage might prevent someone from committing suicide with a<br>gun. It probably won\'t prevent the committed suicidal person from<br>actually committing suicide. But it will prevent them from doing it<br>*with a gun* which is apparently important to anti-gunners.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
