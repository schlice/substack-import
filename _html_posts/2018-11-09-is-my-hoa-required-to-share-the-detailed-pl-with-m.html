Not every state requires HOAs to share<br>detailed P&L statements directly with you. Most do it anyway. Most share<br>their P&L statements during the Annual Meeting.<br><br>You can usually request a copy of your HOA's P&L statement from the<br>Management Agency working with your HOA.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
