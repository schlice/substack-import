<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Once you intimate that someone\'s views have less standing<br>than your own (calling them mental instability is a good start) you<br>place yourself as the arbiter of others\' beliefs. You have as much<br>authority to perform that role as I do.\<br>\<br>Ultimately, it is up to voters to decide if their representative is<br>adequately representing his or her constituency. If the voters are<br>looking for a Fundamentalist to radically change the laws in the<br>country, and they elect someone to do just that, then they are<br>satisfied. You do have to have enough of them in Congress in order to<br>actually make a difference though. One voice is not enough to transform<br>Congress and our entire system of laws.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Would-the-U-S-Congress-work-better-if-fundamentalist-Christians-were-kept-out-of-the-government/answer/Max-Jones<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
