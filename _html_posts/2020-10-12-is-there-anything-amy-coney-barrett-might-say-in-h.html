<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Exceedingly unlikely.<br><br>See, these confirmation hearings are no longer about *Senators* learning<br>anything about the nominee. They may have already met with her in<br>private. They have teams of researchers looking into everything from her<br>family life to her legislative history. They don't *need* these<br>hearings.<br><br>These hearings are much more about *the American people* learning<br>something about the nominee, and also possibly about the Senator. They<br>are also a stage where potential Presidential candidates can get a few<br>sound bites recorded (see Booker, Cory and Harris, Kamala, during the<br>Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearings).<br><br>These hearings are nothing more than a glorified dog-and-pony show.<br>Judge Barrett needs only get in there, say that she won't talk about how<br>she will potentially rule on any particular issue, talk about her<br>values, talk about her judicial record, and that's it. She should avoid<br>other entrapment-style questions like the plague.<br><br>And then Senators are going to mostly vote along party lines, with few<br>exceptions (if our RINOs are feeling spry, they may vote against the<br>candidate, but that's not enough to stop this train from rolling), and<br>she will be confirmed.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>***Is there anything Amy Coney Barrett might say in her SCOTUS<br>confirmation hearings that would change any senator\'s mind about how to<br>vote?***<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
