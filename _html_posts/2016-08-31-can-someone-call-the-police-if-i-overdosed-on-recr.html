In fact, we<br>prefer you call. This gets both medical professionals to your location<br>quickly to keep you alive until you can get to a hospital, as well as<br>law enforcement personnel to investigate the consumption of illegal<br>substances.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
