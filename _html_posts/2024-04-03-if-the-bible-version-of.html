<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, He has already revealed Himself. Just look around you. God<br>has plainly revealed Himself through His creation.<br><br>> For since the creation of the world God\'s invisible qualities---his<br>> eternal power and divine nature---have been clearly seen, being<br>> understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.<br>> --- Romans 1:20<br><br>This is an example of "special revelation" --- God revealing His<br>invisible qualities through His creation. He has also revealed Himself<br>through what we call "general revelation," which is the evidence of God<br>in the majesty of creation, such as the human body, nature, and the<br>governing of the universe.<br><br>So He has already revealed Himself.<br><br>But, I bet you're wondering, why doesn't He just do more? Like why<br>doesn't he write "I exist, FFS" on the clouds, or come floating down on<br>a huge cloud zapping evil with His lightning bolt fingers and with<br>awesome rock riffs playing in the background? I mean, then He would<br>eliminate all doubt and everyone would believe! Right?<br><br>Right?<br><br>Well, not exactly.<br><br>First, *even with that awesome entrance,* there would be plenty who<br>would still not believe. Why? For many, the problem is not God's<br>revelation. The problem is that they *don't want to believe*.<br>Believing, for them, would cause them to have to change their entire<br>lifestyle, and they are too comfortable in that lifestyle and simply<br>want to keep it.<br><br>Second, God wants you to choose Him *freely* and without coercion.<br><br>> if you're not willing to accept Christianity, then you're free to<br>> reject it. This freedom to make choices---even the freedom to reject<br>> truth---is what makes us moral creatures and enables each of us to<br>> choose our ultimate destiny.<br>><br>> This really hits at the heart of why we exist at all, and why God<br>> might not be as overt in revealing Himself to us as some would like.<br>> For if the Bible is true, then God has provided each of us with the<br>> opportunity to make an eternal choice to either accept Him or reject<br>> Him. And in order to ensure that our choice is truly free, He puts us<br>> in an environment that is filled with evidence of His existence, but<br>> without His *direct* presence---a presence so powerful that it could<br>> overwhelm our freedom and thus negate our ability to reject Him. In<br>> other words, *God has provided enough evidence in this life to<br>> convince anyone willing to believe, yet He has also left some<br>> ambiguity so as not to compel the unwilling.* In this way, God gives<br>> us the opportunity either to love Him or to reject Him without<br>> violating our freedom. In fact, the purpose of this life is to make<br>> that choice freely and without coercion. For love, by definition, must<br>> be freely given. It cannot be coerced.<br>><br>> That's why C. S. Lewis wrote, "the Irresistible and the Indisputable<br>> are the two weapons which the very nature of \God's\ scheme forbids<br>> Him to use. Merely to over-ride a human will (as His felt presence in<br>> any but the faintest and most mitigated degree would certainly do)<br>> would be for Him useless. He cannot ravish. He can only woo."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
