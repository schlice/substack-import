There is no sound logic which says that we *shouldn't* make<br>    something illegal because someone may break the law, and harm<br>    themselves in the process. Whether or not someone chooses to break<br>    the law is not a factor in whether or not we make laws, or repeal<br>    laws. You could literally say this about any law. *We shouldn't make<br>    bank robberies illegal, because people will still rob banks and they<br>    could die in the process.* If a law is worth having, it's worth<br>    having *despite* the people who may choose to violate it.<br>2.  Technology has advanced significantly since *Roe* was decided.<br>    Vacuum aspiration using suction curettage has made abortions much<br>    safer for the woman than they were just a few decades ago. We also<br>    have chemical abortifactents which can induce contractions in the<br>    uterus, expelling the fetus "naturally." Even unlicensed medical<br>    practitioners who know how to operate the suction curette can do so<br>    with much more safety than before.<br>3.  But even with safer forms of abortion, the images of "back-alley<br>    abortions" using coat hangers and the like are mostly fiction. There<br>    were anecdotal examples of it, but they were strikingly rare. What<br>    would likely happen if *Roe* were overturned and a state made<br>    abortion illegal is that there would be some doctors who chose to<br>    violate the law anyway. By the way, the same thing happens with<br>    guns. When someone is a prohibited purchaser, one of the largest<br>    sources of illegal guns is through properly licensed FFL dealers who<br>    simply "look the other way" and fail to file the appropriate<br>    background check. They "lose the paperwork" on that purchaser.<br>    Similarly for abortion, a doctor may tell a woman that he won't do<br>    it himself, but he will refer the patient to a doctor who will.<br>    Either that, or he will simply give the woman<br>    [prostaglandin(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fad65f&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} suppositories and she<br>    will do it herself.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
