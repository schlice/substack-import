<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In almost every jurisdiction I know of, you are assigned a date. You<br>show up on the date.<br><br>Perhaps there is a jurisdiction in which you can show up anytime within<br>the two weeks around your assigned date, but I struggle to see how they<br>could then be assured that they would have enough jurors in the pool on<br>any given day.<br><br>If you can't show up on your assigned day, contact the clerk of the<br>court's office, and they can assist you with re-scheduling due to<br>hardship. But in most cases, it has to be a genuine hardship. Legally,<br>your employer is required to give you the time from work and legally<br>cannot fire you for going to jury duty. Your summons is sufficient<br>evidence for your employer that you're not making excuses.<br><br>In our county, we have a "one day, one trial" system wherein just<br>appearing in the jury pool on your assigned date, even if you are not<br>selected for trial, fulfills your requirement for the year. When they<br>have selected all of the juries for the day, they let everyone go, and<br>you are done for the year.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
