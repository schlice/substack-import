<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A few other points that haven\'t been brought up yet:<br><br>There are over 300 million guns in the United States.<br><br>This means that there are roughly enough guns that every man, woman, and<br>child in the United States can all possess one. Or, even if we stopped<br>selling new guns in the United States today, there would be enough guns<br>available to continue to meet the needs of everyone who wanted one for<br>the next hundred years or so. Guns are durable, simple machines. They<br>last for a very long time when well-maintained. Replacement parts are<br>easily obtained and they are relatively easy to repair.<br><br>**It\'s distasteful to suddenly turn millions of Americans into<br>criminals overnight.**<br><br>Banning guns would turn millions of law-abiding gun owners into<br>criminals. What are they to do with all these guns? Should we implement<br>a buyback program? Will you buy these guns at fair market value? Who<br>will pay for that? Paying fair market value for guns would be an<br>*astronomically expensive* proposition, and we can\'t even agree how and<br>to what extend we should be paying for other people\'s healthcare; I\'m<br>not really into paying more taxes so the government can collect and<br>destroy guns. It just doesn\'t make fiscal sense.<br><br>**While media coverage may indicate otherwise, there isn\'t as much gun<br>violence as there may appear to be.**<br><br>It seems like every time you turn around, there\'s another news story of<br>some crazy person shooting up a building. Discounting the incidents of<br>terrorism (which needs to be handled differently), it still appears that<br>there is lots of violence out there, and it involves guns.<br><br>The prevailing thought seems to be that if you remove the guns, you<br>remove the violence.<br><br>*This simply is not true.*<br><br>People have shown that they have a great propensity for violence, and<br>the presence or absence of a gun does not change that. If someone wants<br>to kill, there are any number of ways he or she can accomplish that. A<br>gun simplifies the task, but it also limits the killer to killing<br>*individuals*, not true \"mass killings\" like we\'ve seen in other<br>countries. Australia has found that arson has become a popular tool for<br>killing many people on a large scale. So while they may have fewer<br>incidents, each one kills more per incident than our shootings in<br>America. And in comparison to the total population, their rate of<br>killings is on par with ours.<br><br>Making guns *illegal* won\'t make guns *disappear.*<br><br>We\'ve tried that before. Remember what happened with Prohibition? We<br>made alcohol illegal. Did it go away? Hardly. It actually encouraged<br>criminal activity and spurred the creation and enhancement of the black<br>market. Has making drugs illegal been any more successful? We spend<br>*billions* on the War on Drugs, militarize our police forces, and<br>incarcerate more people in state and federal prisons on drug charges<br>than for any other crime.<br><br>Ultimately, the gun is not the problem<br><br>The gun is an easy target for ire. It is the only tool available that is<br>purpose-built to kill. By demonizing the gun, we symbolically say that<br>we, as a society, will not tolerate killing.<br><br>But is that the right thing to do?<br><br>Today, on this day, millions of law-abiding Americans have used hundreds<br>of millions of guns to do *absolutely nothing*. They have not killed<br>anyone. They have not used their guns to inflict violence or terror on<br>anyone. The majority of those guns have sat idly in gun safes. Some of<br>those Americans even *carry* their guns in public, legally, and even<br>concealed, and you probably walked by one of them and didn\'t even know<br>it. Did it harm you? Not in the slightest. Again, you probably didn\'t<br>even know.<br><br>It goes contrary to the fundamentals of individual freedom on which this<br>country was founded to say that an activity that does not impact you in<br>the slightest should be penalized.<br><br>In fact, you may find yourself to be the beneficiary of their carry if<br>they use their weapon to stop a criminal, even if a shot is never fired.<br>This happens *every day* in the United States, but you\'ll never hear<br>about it on the evening news because it\'s not sensational enough to<br>sell airtime. Would you rather delegate the responsibility of your own<br>safety (which is your responsibility) to someone else? The police,<br>perhaps? Not I. When seconds count, the police are only minutes away.<br>They can\'t be responsible for my safety.<br><br>The gun is a tool. We should only outlaw a tool of killing when we can<br>say that there are no circumstances, ever, in which it is acceptable to<br>kill, or when I can safely and effectively defend myself from someone<br>with a gun, with another equally-effective tool, that will not kill.<br>Since we cannot say that, the gun is still a viable tool.<br><br>We need to focus more on the person who believes that it is acceptable<br>to use a gun in offense, rather than in defense. There are many<br>reasons why this happens. Mental illness has become a national epidemic,<br>and a mentally unstable individual with a gun can cause serious damage.<br>Radicalized religious zealots will take lives in the name of their<br>religion, and with this country\'s freedom of religion, we have very<br>little means to stop them. Until we can tackle these problems, the gun<br>is way down there on the list of priorities to address.<br><br>Especially when the right to own a gun is written into the Constitution.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
