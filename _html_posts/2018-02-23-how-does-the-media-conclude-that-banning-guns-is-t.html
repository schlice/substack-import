<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How does the media conclude that banning guns is the answer, while<br>ignoring the massive disparities in health care and minimum wage between<br>nations they claim are a success and the USA?**<br><br>The media has been corrupted. They no longer deliver the news. They<br>deliver *opinion*, thinly disguised as journalism (in some cases, there<br>is no attempt at thin disguises even made). This is true regardless of<br>what side of the aisle you fall on (either all the mainstreams and CNN<br>on the left, or Fox News and conservative talk radio on the right).<br>Finding actual journalism usually means coalescing various sources of<br>"news" and forming your own opinion about what really happened. Actual<br>journalism is difficult to find anywhere.<br><br>Therefore, the media concluded that banning guns is the answer for two<br>reasons:<br><br>1.  It's the platform position of the political left<br>2.  It gets more eyeballs on their screens for longer than discussing<br>    actual statistics and disparities in mental health care and minimum<br>    wages around the world. It's inflammatory.<br><br>Mainstream media is hemorrhaging viewers daily. They know it. But<br>they've fully thrown in with the left; they're in the tank for all<br>things Liberal. They can't back out now and start practicing "real"<br>journalism, or the scant few viewers they have left will abandon them.<br>As far as viewership, they simply have decided to do more with less by<br>hanging on to that position for dear life.<br><br>With the internet gaining prominence over broadcast television for the<br>delivery of news and entertainment, it probably doesn't matter much<br>anymore. "Mainstream" media is on its last legs.<br><br>We're witnessing the death throes of an industry. They won't be able to<br>re-tool themselves in time; they can't make the elephant dance. This is<br>their final opus.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
