<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You have a lot of people telling you "because the Bible says so!" While<br>that's true, it's very unhelpful, isn't it.<br><br>You also have a lot of people telling you "they're all cults, especially<br>those Christians. It may be the biggest cult in the world, but it's<br>still a cult." That's not helpful, either.<br><br>What you really asked is, "With all the religions out there, how can<br>Christians know that they possess the one true religion?"<br><br>While it's a really difficult question, it's not a difficult answer, but<br>it does require quite a bit of explanation, so I'll apologize in advance<br>for the length of this answer. But serious questions deserve serious,<br>well-reasoned answers, wouldn't you say?<br><br>My friends at<br>[gotquestions.org(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c2491a&url=http://gotquestions.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container} have done an<br>outstanding job of encapsulating all of the logic surrounding how we<br>know a creator God exists, and that the creator God who does exist is<br>the God of the Bible. I'll start with their work, and I'll add to it.<br><br>> There is no doubt that the number of different religions in the world<br>> makes it a challenge to know which one is correct. First, let's<br>> consider some thoughts on the overall subject and then look at how one<br>> might approach the topic in a manner that can actually get to a right<br>> conclusion about God. The challenge of different answers to a<br>> particular issue is not unique to the topic of religion. For example,<br>> you can sit 100 math students down, give them a complex problem to<br>> solve, and it is likely that many will get the answer wrong. But does<br>> this mean that a correct answer does not exist? Not at all. Those who<br>> get the answer wrong simply need to be shown their error and know the<br>> techniques necessary to arrive at the correct answer.<br>><br>> How do we arrive at the truth about God? We use a systematic<br>> methodology that is designed to separate truth from error by using<br>> various tests for truth, with the end result being a set of right<br>> conclusions. Can you imagine the end results a scientist would arrive<br>> at if he went into the lab and just started mixing things together<br>> with no rhyme or reason? Or if a physician just started treating a<br>> patient with random medicines in the hope of making him well? Neither<br>> the scientist nor the physician takes this approach; instead, they use<br>> systematic methods that are methodical, logical, evidential, and<br>> proven to yield the right end result.<br>><br>> This being the case, why should theology---the study of God---be any<br>> different? Why believe it can be approached in a haphazard and<br>> undisciplined way and still yield right conclusions? Unfortunately,<br>> this is the approach many take, **and this is one of the reasons why<br>> so many religions exist.** That said, we now return to the question of<br>> how to reach truthful conclusions about God. What systematic approach<br>> should be used? First, we need to establish a framework for testing<br>> various truth claims, and then we need a roadmap to follow to reach a<br>> right conclusion. Here is a good framework to use:<br>><br>> 1.  Logical consistency---the claims of a belief system must logically<br>>     cohere to each other and not contradict in any way. As an example,<br>>     the end goal of Buddhism is to rid oneself of all desires. Yet,<br>>     one must have a desire to rid oneself of all desires, which is a<br>>     contradictory and illogical principle.<br>> 2.  Empirical adequacy---is there evidence to support the belief<br>>     system (whether the evidence is rational, externally evidential,<br>>     etc.)? Naturally, it is only right to want proof for important<br>>     claims being made so the assertions can be verified. For example,<br>>     Mormons teach that Jesus visited North America. Yet there is<br>>     absolutely no proof, archaeological or otherwise, to support such<br>>     a claim.<br>> 3.  Existential relevancy---the belief system should address the big<br>>     questions of life described below and the teachings should be<br>>     accurately reflected in the world in which we live. Christianity,<br>>     for example, provides good answers for the large questions of<br>>     life, but is sometimes questioned because of its claim of an<br>>     all-good and powerful God who exists alongside a world filled with<br>>     very real evil. Critics charge that such a thing violates the<br>>     criteria of existential relevancy, although many good answers have<br>>     been given to address the issue.<br>><br>> The above framework, when applied to the topic of religion, will help<br>> lead one to a right view of God and will answer the four big questions<br>> of life:<br>><br>> 1.  Origin -- where did we come from?<br>> 2.  Ethics -- how should we live?<br>> 3.  Meaning -- what is the purpose for life?<br>> 4.  Destiny -- where is mankind heading?<br>><br>> But how does one go about applying this framework in the pursuit of<br>> God? A step-by-step question/answer approach is one of the best<br>> tactics to employ. Narrowing the list of possible questions down<br>> produces the following:<br>><br>> 1.  Does absolute truth exist?<br>> 2.  Do reason and religion mix?<br>> 3.  Does God exist?<br>> 4.  Can God be known?<br>> 5.  Is Jesus God?<br>> 6.  Does God care about me?<br>><br>> First we need to know if absolute truth exists. If it does not, then<br>> we really cannot be sure of anything (spiritual or not), and we end up<br>> either an agnostic, unsure if we can really know anything, or a<br>> pluralist, accepting every position because we are not sure which, if<br>> any, is right.<br>><br>> Absolute truth is defined as that which matches reality, that which<br>> corresponds to its object, telling it like it is. Some say there is no<br>> such thing as absolute truth, but taking such a position becomes<br>> self-defeating. For example, the relativist says, "All truth is<br>> relative," yet one must ask: is that statement absolutely true? If so,<br>> then absolute truth exists; if not, then why consider it?<br>> Postmodernism affirms no truth, yet it affirms at least one absolute<br>> truth: postmodernism is true. In the end, absolute truth becomes<br>> undeniable.<br>><br>> Further, absolute truth is naturally narrow and excludes its opposite.<br>> Two plus two equals four, with no other answer being possible. This<br>> point becomes critical as different belief systems and worldviews are<br>> compared. If one belief system has components that are proven true,<br>> then any competing belief system with contrary claims must be false.<br>> Also, we must keep in mind that absolute truth is not impacted by<br>> sincerity and desire. No matter how sincerely someone embraces a lie,<br>> it is still a lie. And no desire in the world can make something true<br>> that is false.<br>><br>> The answer of question one is that absolute truth exists. This being<br>> the case, **agnosticism, postmodernism, relativism, and skepticism are<br>> all false positions.**<br>><br>> This leads us to the next question of whether reason/logic can be used<br>> in matters of religion. Some say this is not possible, but---why not?<br>> The truth is, logic is vital when examining spiritual claims because<br>> it helps us understand why some claims should be excluded and others<br>> embraced. Logic is absolutely critical in dismantling pluralism (which<br>> says that all truth claims, even those that oppose each other, are<br>> equal and valid).<br>><br>> For example, Islam and Judaism claim that Jesus is not God, whereas<br>> Christianity claims He is. One of the core laws of logic is the law of<br>> non-contradiction, which says something cannot be both "A" and "non-A"<br>> at the same time and in the same sense. Applying this law to these<br>> claims of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity means that one claim is<br>> right and the other is wrong. Jesus cannot be both God and not God.<br>> Used properly, logic is a potent weapon against pluralism because it<br>> clearly demonstrates that contrary truth claims cannot both be true.<br>> This understanding topples the whole "true for you but not for me"<br>> mindset.<br>><br>> Logic also dispels the whole "all roads lead to the top of the<br>> mountain" analogy that pluralists use. Logic shows that each belief<br>> system has its own set of signs that point to radically different<br>> locations in the end. Logic shows that the proper illustration of a<br>> search for spiritual truth is more like a maze---one path makes it<br>> through to truth, while all others arrive at dead ends. All faiths may<br>> have some surface similarities, but they differ in major ways in their<br>> core doctrines.<br>><br>> The conclusion is that you can use reason and logic in matters of<br>> religion. That being the case, pluralism (the belief that all<br>> truth claims are equally true and valid) **is ruled out because it is<br>> illogical and contradictory to believe that diametrically opposing<br>> truth claims can both be right.**<br>><br>> Next comes the big question: does God exist? Atheists and naturalists<br>> (who do not accept anything beyond this physical world and universe)<br>> say "no." While volumes have been written and debates have raged<br>> throughout history on this question, it is actually not difficult to<br>> answer. To give it proper attention, you must first ask this question:<br>> Why do we have something rather than nothing at all? In other words,<br>> how did you and everything around you get here? The argument for God<br>> can be presented very simply:<br>><br>> - Something exists.<br>> - You do not get something from nothing.<br>> - Therefore, a necessary and eternal Being exists.<br>><br>> You cannot deny you exist because you have to exist in order to deny<br>> your own existence (which is self-defeating), so the first premise<br>> above is true. No one has ever demonstrated that something can come<br>> from nothing unless they redefine what 'nothing' is, so the second<br>> premise rings true. Therefore, the conclusion naturally follows---an<br>> eternal Being is responsible for everything that exists.<br>><br>> This is a position no thinking atheist denies; they just claim that<br>> the universe is that eternal being. However, the problem with that<br>> stance is that all scientific evidence points to the fact that the<br>> universe had a beginning (the 'big bang'). And everything that has a<br>> beginning must have a cause; therefore, the universe had a cause and<br>> is not eternal. Because the only two sources of eternality are an<br>> eternal universe (denied by all current empirical evidence) or an<br>> eternal Creator, the only logical conclusion is that God exists.<br>> **Answering the question of God's existence in the affirmative rules<br>> out atheism as a valid belief system.**<br>><br>> Now, this conclusion says nothing about what kind of God exists, but<br>> amazingly enough, it does do one sweeping thing---it rules out all<br>> pantheistic religions. All pantheistic worldviews say that the<br>> universe is God and is eternal. And this assertion is false. So,<br>> **Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and all other pantheistic religions are<br>> ruled out as valid belief systems**.<br>><br>> Further, we learn some interesting things about this God who created<br>> the universe. He is:<br>><br>> - Supernatural in nature (as He exists outside of His creation)<br>> - Incredibly powerful (to have created all that is known)<br>> - Eternal (self-existent, as He exists outside of time and space)<br>> - Omnipresent (He created space and is not limited by it)<br>> - Timeless and changeless (He created time)<br>> - Immaterial (because He transcends space)<br>> - Personal (the impersonal can't create personality)<br>> - Necessary (as everything else depends on Him)<br>> - Infinite and singular (as you cannot have two infinites)<br>> - Diverse yet has unity (as all multiplicity implies a prior<br>>   singularity)<br>> - Intelligent (supremely, to create everything)<br>> - Purposeful (as He deliberately created everything)<br>> - Moral (no moral law can exist without a lawgiver)<br>> - Caring (or no moral laws would have been given)<br>><br>> **This Being exhibits characteristics very similar to the God of<br>> Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, which interestingly enough, are the<br>> only core faiths left standing after atheism and pantheism have been<br>> eliminated.** Note also that one of the big questions in life<br>> (origins) is now answered: we know where we came<br>> from.\[1\](#kEndK){#cite-kEndK .citation_link}<br><br>So we've narrowed down the fact that a Creator God exists, and the God<br>of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity matches the creation, as a<br>reflection of the Creator. But which religion is correct?<br><br>It turns out that the Christian God of the Bible matches all of the<br>characteristics we just listed: He is supernatural (Genesis 1:1),<br>powerful (Jeremiah 32:17), eternal (Psalm 90:2), necessary (Exodus 3:14)<br>omnipresent (Psalm 139:7), timeless/changeless (Malachi 3:6), immaterial<br>(John 5:24), personal (Genesis 3:9), necessary (Colossians 1:17),<br>infinite/singular (Jeremiah 23:24, Deuteronomy 6:4), diverse yet with<br>unity (Matthew 28:19), intelligent (Psalm 147:4-5), purposeful (Jeremiah<br>29:11, Psalm 19:1-4), moral (Daniel 9:14), and caring (1 Peter 5:6-7).<br><br>I know this was long, but take the time to pore through it. It's<br>logical, and the only time I discussed the Bible was when I compared the<br>creator God (which we proved exists) to the remaining monotheistic<br>religions to find out which one describes the God who actually created<br>us.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-kEndK){.citation_index} [[With all of the different<br>religions, how can I know which one is<br>correct?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ef455f&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/correct-religion.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
