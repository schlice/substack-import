<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can sue anyone for anything. The question becomes whether or not you<br>might be successful.<br><br>And in this endeavor, you would not be successful.<br><br>First, you said it's a HIPAA violation, and then you said it's a<br>Constitutional violation. It is neither.<br><br>HIPAA is a set of rules that binds your doctor and your healthcare<br>providers, and governs what they can do with your protected health<br>information, and how they have to protect it and what they need to do to<br>share it.<br><br>Businesses can make any rules they choose to discriminate which<br>customers may enter their establishment, unless those discriminations<br>violate existing laws. For example, you cannot discriminate by age, sex,<br>national origin, color, or religion, as those are protected by Federal<br>law. States may add additional characteristics (some states add sexual<br>orientation for example).<br><br>But if I wanted to say that everyone must wear jacket and tie to enter<br>my business, I can do that, so long as I do it to everyone who enters my<br>business.<br><br>If a business says that only vaccinated people may enter their facility,<br>so long as the business is not violating state law by doing so (and if<br>the business is in Florida, they would be), they can do just that. They<br>can demand your vaccination card to enter or remain in the facility, and<br>they can kick you out if you don't show it to them.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>A Texas restaurant owner kicked me out for refusing to show my<br>vaccination card? How can I sue him for violating HIPPA laws and<br>requiring all customers be vaccinated when it's unconstitutional?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
