<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Could Trump theoretically retain power if the final outcome is<br>genuinely too close to call?**<br><br>1.  I hate that term, "retain power." The head of the Executive Branch<br>    is not a king, nor is he a dictator. There is actually very little<br>    "power" in the office beyond the power of persuasion.<br>2.  No, "power" cannot be "retained" if the outcome is too close to call<br>    because a Presidential election is not "one big election," but 51<br>    separate state elections. Those 51 elections provide *electoral<br>    votes* which are counted to determine who wins the Presidency. The<br>    only time an election is "too close to call" is if one candidate<br>    does not achieve the required 270 electoral votes to win. Remember,<br>    the end of the previous President's term is 12:00 PM on January<br>    20, 2021. If the current President was not re-elected, that is<br>    officially when he leaves office.<br>3.  The Constitution is very clear about exactly what will happen in the<br>    event that one person does not achieve 270 electoral votes: a<br>    *contingent election* held in the House of Representatives:\<br>    \<br>    *"Pursuant to the 12th Amendment, the House of Representatives is<br>    required to go into session immediately after the counting of the<br>    electoral votes to vote for president if no candidate for the office<br>    receives a majority of the electoral votes. In this event, the House<br>    is limited to choosing from among the three candidates who received<br>    the most electoral votes. Each state delegation votes en bloc, with<br>    each state having a single vote. A candidate is required to receive<br>    an absolute majority of state delegation votes (currently 26 votes)<br>    in order for that candidate to become the president-elect. The House<br>    continues balloting until it elects a president. As a consequence of<br>    the state delegation voting method, the party that holds the<br>    majority in the House could still lose the contingent election if<br>    the minority party holds the majority of state<br>    delegations."*\[1\](#cqGfc){#cite-cqGfc .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-cqGfc){.citation_index} [[Contingent election -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=795d2c&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingent_election){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
