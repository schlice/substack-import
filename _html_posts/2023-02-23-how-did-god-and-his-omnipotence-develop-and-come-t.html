<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You've got a lot of words here, but the basic gist of your question is:<br>Where did God come from?<br><br>However, God is *eternal*. Logically, something that is eternal has<br>no beginning and no end. Therefore, it is illogical to ask where God<br>came from, because He did not come from anything. He always existed.<br><br>Here's the problem we're running into.<br><br>*Time* is a concept which is part of our universe. When God created our<br>universe, He created everything we know: time, space, and matter. But in<br>order to *create* these things, He must exist *outside* of these things.<br>He is not bound to our concept of *time*. There is no "before" or<br>"after" for God. For God, everything is now. The past is now. The<br>present is now. The future is now. He exists outside of time because He<br>created time. You can't create something while you are a part of that<br>thing, or you would have to create yourself, and that is analytically<br>false.<br><br>Therefore, God always existed. He existed before anything else existed,<br>and He will exist after everything else is gone. His existence is not<br>relatable to our concept of time. In order for God to have "spawned,"<br>there would have to be a "before" when God did not exist, and an "after"<br>when God existed. But God is not bound by concepts like "before" or<br>"after" as those are only relevant when you are bound by a universe in<br>which time is a thing.<br><br>Tough concept to wrap your brain around, but there it is.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
