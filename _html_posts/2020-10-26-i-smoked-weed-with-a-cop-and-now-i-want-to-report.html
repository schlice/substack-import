<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I smoked weed with a cop and now I want to report him. Why should I<br>not do it?**<br><br>Your motives are suspect. You participated in this illegal act with the<br>person you are reporting. This places you in exactly the same legal<br>trouble that it places him. You realize that you must confess to<br>breaking the law in order to "out" this officer. If you are both<br>punished, who do you think will be treated better?<br><br>What are you hoping to gain from this? You think he will be fired? You<br>don't control that, only the department does. So you get convicted and<br>he doesn't lose his job. Maybe he gets a reprimand. If he gets enough of<br>those, it might impact his promotions, or maybe even his job, but not<br>necessarily for a one-time mistake. Some departments have a<br>zero-tolerance policy on marijuana, but some may not.<br><br>And it's your word against his. Many people wrongly blame the police<br>when they are caught after doing something wrong. People wrongly hold<br>grudges and try to "get back" at the police for having the audacity of<br>pointing out that actions have consequences. So the department may not<br>be likely to value your word over the word of their officer, who they<br>vetted and trust.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
