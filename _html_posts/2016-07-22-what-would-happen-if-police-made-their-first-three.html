title: '"What would happen if police made their first three shots non-lethal and loaded
  them with rubber bullets? It seems like most bad shootings are one or two shots.
  In cases where police have to actually stop a threat, they just keep firing anyways."'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is, again, another attempt to absolve criminals of poor behavior by<br>removing lethal force from the police arsenal.<br><br>By "dumbing down" the gun and making it do something which you think is<br>"non-lethal," you think you can solve the problems of people being<br>stupid.<br><br>The gun is lethal force. The officer uses lethal force when he<br>reasonably believes he or the public is at risk of death or grave bodily<br>harm.<br><br>As long as his belief is reasonable based on the circumstances and the<br>facts at hand, the officer is justified in using deadly force.<br><br>What if he's in a gunfight? An armed suspect is firing on him? His gun<br>is loaded with rubber bullets! It's like bringing a wet noodle to a gun<br>fight. Now you've actually hurt the officer.<br><br>We need better/more advanced/more accurate less-than-lethal options. We<br>don't need to dumb down the gun. The officer is supposed to be smart<br>enough to know when to use the gun and when not to. When the officer<br>reasonably believes his life is in danger or he is at risk of grave<br>bodily harm, his use of force is justified.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
