<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You are only liable if an *agent* of your organization does something in<br>your name. So if the counter clerk at McDonald\'s orders 200,000 buns<br>instead of 2,000, you are liable for that order, as the clerk is an<br>agent of the company.<br><br>If a *non-agent* does something on your behalf, you are not liable. So<br>if a hacker hacks your site and pretends to be you, you are not<br>responsible for what that hacker does.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
