<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The logic begins and ends with the fact that Jesus is God.<br><br>Once you establish that Jesus is God, you can make the next logical<br>step, which is "Whatever Jesus (who is God) says is true."<br><br>Then, you can make the *next* logical step, which is to note that Jesus<br>said that He is the only way to God (or more specifically, eternal life<br>with God in heaven).<br><br>Therefore, Christians think only Jesus can lead to God because Jesus<br>(who is God) said that He is the only way.<br><br>> *"Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me.<br>> In my Father\'s house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have<br>> told you that I go to prepare a place for you?*  *And if I go and<br>> prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to<br>> myself, that where I am you may be also. And you know the way to where<br>> I am going." Thomas said to him, "Lord, we do not know where you are<br>> going. How can we know the way?" Jesus said to him, "I am the way, and<br>> the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through<br>> me." --- John 14:1--6 ESV*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
