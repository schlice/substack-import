<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>God communicates His Word to us in a variety of ways we call<br>"revelation."<br><br>One type of revelation is that which is clearly seen independent of any<br>type of scripture. Theologians call this revelation of God *natural* or<br>*general revelation.* So when I use logical proofs to prove the<br>existence of God, without ever referencing the Bible, this is an example<br>of general revelation. God communicates about His nature...through<br>nature. The natural law indicates the natural law giver. The fact that<br>we have a conscience (we know right from wrong without ever having been<br>taught) also is a form of general revelation.<br><br>But could God give us *more* information? Sure, nature speaks clearly to<br>the understanding that a supernatural creator exists. But how could God<br>reveal Himself so that we could get a more detailed understanding of<br>what His ultimate purpose is for us?<br><br>Couldn't he appear personally to each one of us? He could, but that<br>might interfere with our free will. C. S. Lewis has some great insights<br>on this topic. In his *Screwtape Letters*, Screwtape, the senior demon,<br>writes the following to his disciple Wormwood:<br><br>> You must have wondered why the Enemy \God\ does not make more use of<br>> His power to be sensibly present to human souls in any degree He<br>> chooses and at any moment. But you now see that the Irresistible and<br>> the Indisputable are the two weapons which the very nature of His<br>> scheme forbids Him to use. Merely to over-ride a human will (as His<br>> felt presence in any but the faintest and most mitigated degree would<br>> certainly do) would be for Him useless. He cannot ravish. He can only<br>> woo.<br><br>In other words, God's visible presence would be so overpowering as to<br>overwhelm our free will and coerce us to believe in Him. Clearly, He has<br>not chosen the option of face-to-face interactions with every person on<br>the planet. So perhaps He has chosen a more subtle method of<br>communication. (In fact, the Bible says God is not always as overt as we<br>would like him to be \Isa. 45:15\.) Perhaps God has manifested Himself<br>in some way to a select group of people over many centuries and inspired<br>them to write down what they witnessed and heard from Him.<br><br>Written language is a precise medium of communication that can easily be<br>duplicated and passed on to succeeding generations, yet it also can be<br>easily ignored by those who freely decide that they don't want to be<br>bothered with God. So a book would work as a valid but not overpowering<br>means of communication from God.<br><br>This is what we call *special revelation*: the revelation of God through<br>Scripture. Scripture as a means of communicating God's Word fulfills His<br>requirements of easy, precise duplication, but easy rejection by those<br>who exercise their free will in order to ignore God.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
