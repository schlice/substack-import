<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It is Congress' job to write laws. This means that both Houses of<br>Congress (the House of Representatives and the Senate) must agree on a<br>bill before it can be sent to the President to become law.<br><br>There is no *requirement* for the Senate to act on every bill sent to<br>them by the House. Similarly, the Senate can propose legislation, and<br>there is no *requirement* for the House to take up that legislation.<br><br>But if there is currently a deficit in processing bills between the<br>houses, it is in the Senate. There are literally *hundreds of bills*<br>which are awaiting action by the Senate, but because of its current<br>level of dysfunction, it is simply not getting bills passed.<br><br>At some point, some serious rules changes will need to take place in the<br>Senate to get moving on some of this legislation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
