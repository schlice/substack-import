<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do you need consent to post a picture of someone?<br><br>*(US answer only)*<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends." And mostly it<br>depends on where the photographer is, and where the subject is.<br><br>In most public places in the US, "if you can see it, you can shoot it<br>(with your camera)." If the person is in public and so are you, you can<br>take a picture of that person and do whatever you like with it,<br>including posting it online.<br><br>Regardless of what you do with it, you still cannot intentionally lie<br>about someone. So if you take a picture of a woman and you post it to<br>"naziwomen.com" (I don't know if that's a real website, and I'm not<br>looking it up either), and that photo causes that woman to lose her job,<br>you can be sued for libel.<br><br>You also can't earn any money off of the photo. If you try to sell the<br>photo, you need consent from every person pictured.<br><br>Note that this doesn't eve talk about restrictions about where the<br>person is physically located (i.e. in a space in which they believe they<br>have a reasonable expectation of privacy). There are also other<br>restrictions which are dependent on the location of the subject or the<br>location of the photographer, so know before you shoot.<br><br>But *in general*, if you take a picture of a person, and both you and<br>the subject are in appropriate public places, you can do anything you<br>like with that photo, including posting it online. Be sure you know what<br>you're doing before posting though.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is legal information, not legal advice.

This answer is for GENERAL INFORMATIONAL<br>PURPOSES ONLY. If you ignore this warning and convey confidential<br>information in a private message or comment, there is no duty to keep<br>that information confidential or to forego representation adverse to<br>your interests. Seek the advice of a licensed attorney in the<br>appropriate jurisdiction before taking any action that may affect your<br>rights. If you believe you have a claim against someone, consult an<br>attorney immediately, otherwise there is a risk that the time allotted<br>to bring your claim may expire.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to legal questions are intended third<br>party beneficiaries under Quora\'s* [[*Terms of<br>Service.*](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for<br>everyone.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
