<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Before we can answer this question, we have to figure out what morals<br>are and whether or not God can be morally wrong.<br><br>So what are morals? In short, morals are the definition of right and<br>wrong, good and evil. But in order to answer the question about whether<br>or not God can be morally wrong, we must figure out where the standard<br>of right and wrong, good and evil comes from.<br><br>There must be a single, unchanging source of morality in order to be<br>able to equally apply it to everything, including God. If you're going<br>to judge God by what you know to be morals, you have to have a single,<br>unchanging standard of morals *outside of yourself* which applies to<br>everyone, including God.<br><br>And that is where you run into a problem.<br><br>**What meaningful standard can exist as a source for moral truth other<br>than God?**<br><br>In other words, apart from God, it is impossible to have truly<br>objective, universally-applied morality. To be meaningful, morality has<br>to be *grounded.* In other words, morality has to be based on some<br>unchanging standard. Human concepts such as "suffering" or "human<br>flourishing" are not objective. There is no rational reason for opinions<br>or subjective ideas to be the source of moral reasoning.<br><br>So, the first problem with asking whether or not an omnipotent God can<br>do anything immoral is that *meaningful moral claims require God to<br>exist in the first place*. **Labelling anything "good" or "evil"<br>requires assumptions that lead inevitably to God.**<br><br>\<br><br>This leads us directly into the next question about whether or not God<br>can be morally wrong. In order to answer this, we must consider the<br>first point, that morals themselves come from God. God must exist in<br>order to have morals in the first place, because when God created us, he<br>imbued us with morals.<br><br>Note that He did not imbue *Himself* with morals. He imbued *us*, His<br>creation, with morals. We are moral because He made us moral.<br><br>God exists *outside of* morality because He created morality.<br><br>Therefore, God cannot be moral or immoral, ethical, or unethical. He<br>created those things and are not limited by them. His actions are not<br>subject to morality.<br><br>If you look at God's actions and view them as either moral or immoral,<br>you are using the standards He gave you and you are trying to judge<br>actions which are not inherently moral or immoral. God's actions are<br>beyond morals, but you are trying to wrongly judge God's actions using<br>moral standards.<br><br>In other words, as an entity outside of the universe, He is not under<br>the moral law, as He created the moral law. His actions are therefore,<br>*de facto*, moral.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
