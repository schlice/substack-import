<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Since this question was posted into the "Christians and Christianity"<br>Space, it's no surprise that you'll find that I am a Christian.<br><br>As for the second part of your question, you're going to have to define<br>"understanding and accepting" others' beliefs. Because in modern<br>parlance, the implications of what you are asking are different than<br>what the actual words mean.<br><br>So let me try to answer these questions and we'll see if we can answer<br>what you were trying to ask.<br><br>- Understanding other beliefs: I do try to understand what others<br>  believe. I've taken not only college-level courses on great religions<br>  of the world, but in my study of apologetics, I learned a great deal<br>  about what others believe. I'm always willing to hear them explain<br>  what they believe, though, as belief is a very powerful motivator in<br>  people\'s' lives.<br>- Accepting the beliefs of others: This is where the water gets muddied.<br>  Do you mean "accepting the fact that they believe something and<br>  allowing them to live as they choose, in their belief" or do you mean<br>  "accepting that their faith is just as valid as mine?" I have a<br>  feeling you mean the second, because I have no problem accepting that<br>  people don't all believe as I do, even though I do not accept their<br>  beliefs as valid. As a Christian, **I do not believe that everyone<br>  else's religion is right**. In other words, I do not believe that they<br>  will be able to gain salvation using their faith.<br><br>(As a Christian, I also recognize that there is a not-unfounded fear<br>that those who believe their religion is the right one will be<br>intolerant of other beliefs.)<br><br>The sort of "new-age, everyone sees the same god differently" mindset is<br>a favorite of Americans who want to be "inclusive." This sentiment is<br>often illustrated by a parable which has become a favorite amongst<br>university professors: the parable of the six blind men and the<br>elephant. Each blind man feels a different part of the elephant and<br>reaches a different conclusion about the object in front of him. One<br>grabs a tusk and says, "This is a spear!" Another grabs the tail and<br>says, "This is a rope!" Still another hugs the leg and says, "This is a<br>tree!" while another feels the ear and says "This is a fan!" The one who<br>grabbed the trunk says, "This is a snake!" while the one leaning against<br>the body says, "This is surely a wall!" The blind men are said to<br>represent the various religions of the world, as each man came to a<br>different conclusion about what they were sensing. No one religion, we<br>are therefore told, has *the* truth. Religions are all just "different<br>paths up the same mountain."<br><br>In America, we're all told that "truth in religion" is an oxymoron.<br>There is no one truth in religion. It's all just a matter of taste, or<br>opinion. I like Christianity, you like Islam. Perhaps Judaism works for<br>you, or Buddhism. Everybody plays, everybody wins! And you can't judge<br>me for what I believe!<br><br>But there are some problems with this approach.<br><br>Firstly, *they can't all be right* because *they all believe different<br>things, and some of those beliefs are mutually exclusive.* For example,<br>some religions believe that the universe had a beginning (Christians,<br>Jews, Muslims), while others believe the universe did not have a<br>beginning and is eternal (Hindus, New Age). But these two claims are<br>*mutually exclusive*; they can't both be true. Only one can be true.<br>Either the universe had a beginning, or it did not. By investigating the<br>history and the nature of the universe, we can determine which one is<br>most likely true, and which one is more likely false.<br><br>Secondly, *we have the capability to see the truth in religion.* Back to<br>the elephant parable, we were told that no one has the full perspective.<br>Like each blind man, no one religion has *the* truth. However, there is<br>one person who has a full view of the entire situation: ***the person<br>telling the parable.*** He appears to have a complete, objective<br>perspective of the entire situation, because he can see that the blind<br>men are actually touching an elephant. In other words, *he wouldn't know<br>that the blind men were wrong unless he had an objective perspective of<br>what was right.*<br><br>We, too, have the ability to see truth in religion, but often we are not<br>*actually blind;* we are *willfully* *blind.* We simply do not want to<br>see the truth, because the truth will convict us. But if we stop hiding<br>behind our fear and these self-defeating arguments like "truth cannot be<br>known," we can see the truth as well.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What religion do you belong? And as a member of that particular<br>religion, how would you make yourself more open in terms of understading<br>and accepting the beliefs of other people?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
