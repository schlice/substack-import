<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I will only add that when you tell him to go jump in a<br>lake, tell him that if he ever makes contact with you again, you\'ll go<br>immediately to the school and report him. Teachers making passes at<br>students is not looked upon with great kindness in the legal system,<br>because he is a teacher. He is in \"a position of trust\" and doing what<br>he did is very, very bad. For him. He will lose his job and be publicly<br>shamed, even if he never touched you. So the potential is there for his<br>life to be severely ruined. That should be enough incentive for him to<br>never speak of it again.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
