I've checked the settings on iOS 10's<br>Facebook Messenger and there is no option to turn off receiving calls<br>using iOS CallKit, which integrates VoIP applications with Apple's Phone<br>app.<br><br>Your only option is to uninstall Facebook Messenger.<br><br>Alternatively, you could contact Facebook and ask them to add an option<br>to use a different VoIP application instead of CallKit.<br><br>But they won't.<br><br>They don't want to. They want a VoIP call using Messenger to look<br>exactly like a phone call. That's the whole point. Notice that the only<br>difference between a cellular voice call and a Facebook Messenger call<br>is the text below the caller's name. That's intentional. The more used<br>to it you get, the easier it will be to start offering paid services to<br>you, and the less you'll use your cellular network for actually making<br>voice calls.<br><br>I also checked Android's version of Messenger and the preferences look<br>identical. I assume that there may be an app which can intercept a VoIP<br>call and send it to another VoIP app on a rooted Android phone, but I am<br>unaware if any exists.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
