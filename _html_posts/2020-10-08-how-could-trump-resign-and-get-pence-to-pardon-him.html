<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How could Trump resign and get Pence to pardon him like people are<br>suggesting, if he has not been formally charged of any crimes yet? Can<br>Pence write a blanket pardon for any crimes Trump may have committed?**<br><br>Clearly, the people who are telling you this are *presuming* that Trump<br>committed a serious crime, is aware that he has done so, and is just<br>waiting until they catch up with him.<br><br>A presidential pardon can cover "unspecified crimes" over a period of<br>time. Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon in this way after he resigned.<br>So people are looking at that bit of history and are saying that if<br>Trump did something serious, he should resign and allow Pence to pardon<br>him. In that way, he couldn't be prosecuted under Federal law.<br><br>*(Clearly, and it should go without saying, these people are actually<br>less interested in protecting Trump from Federal prosecution, and are<br>more interested in Trump resigning. Sounds like the frenzied hysteria of<br>a Never Trumper.)*<br><br>However, pardons are only at the Federal level. Trump could still be<br>prosecuted at the state level (and New York has shown that it is<br>completely willing to prosecute him).<br><br>Also, if it is shown that Pence engages in a corrupt bargain or bribery<br>in the pardoning of Trump, he could be impeached and removed from office<br>himself for that action. Remember, pardons are criminal, impeachments<br>are political.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
