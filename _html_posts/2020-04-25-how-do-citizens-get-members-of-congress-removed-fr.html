<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How do citizens get members of Congress removed from office?<br><br>The ballot box.<br><br>Either every two (for the House) or every six (for the Senate) years,<br>your members of Congress are up for election. Vote them out. Replace<br>them with someone who actually represents your interests.<br><br>The Constitution does not allow for citizen removal of any person<br>elected to federal public office. It was considered in 1787 for<br>inclusion into the Constitution, but it did not appear in the final<br>document. Some states have stated their right to recall a member from<br>Congress, but it has never been tested by the Supreme Court, so its<br>constitutionality still stands in question.<br><br>Therefore, if you think this was an oversight, the way to fix it is a<br>Constitutional amendment. Good luck getting a supermajority of Congress<br>to Constitutionally authorize more oversight into their job performance.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
