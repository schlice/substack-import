<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Trump says, \"Mexico continues to make billions on not<br>only our bad trade deals but also relies heavily on the billions of<br>dollars in remittances sent from illegal immigrants in the United States<br>back to Mexico (\$22 billion in [[2013<br>alone](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ed5ebd&url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2014/08/02/remittances-to-mexico-up-73-pct-in-1st-half-2014/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="foxnews.com"}]{.qlink_container})... Mexico must pay for the<br>wall and, until they do, the United States will, among other things:<br>impound all remittance payments derived from illegal wages.\"\<br>\<br>The \"among other things\" part will become very important, because<br>impounding remittance payments from illegal wages continues to get<br>harder and harder as more illegal payments are sent via untraceable<br>Bitcoin payments. There are even services that allow payments via<br>Bitcoin to be paid out at Mexican ATMs, and the recipient is paid in<br>pesos. \1\\<br>\<br>I only find the plan dubious because while Trump claims that \$22<br>billion is the amount of remittances back to Mexico from illegal<br>immigrants, that figure is incorrect. \$22 billion is *all* remittances<br>from the US to Mexico, not just from illegal workers.\<br>\<br>And it is *pittance* when compared to the reported \$64 billion that<br>Mexico\'s drug cartels make in the drug trade to the US alone.\2\\<br>\<br>If the wall stops that money, there\'s no way Mexico would contribute<br>anything to help cut off their own money. Fine, lose the portion of the<br>\$22 billion that comes from illegals (even if it\'s fully 2/3 of that,<br>which it\'s not, but estimate \$15 billion), as long as their drug trade<br>routes remain open, go for it.\<br>\<br>\1\ [[Donald Trump's plan to pay for Mexico border wall has a tech<br>problem](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ae48f3&url=http://fortune.com/2015/08/17/donald-trumps-plan-to-pay-for-mexico-wall-has-a-tech-problem/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="fortune.com"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>\2\ [[Latin American Herald<br>Tribune](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d0d382&url=http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId%3D342471%26CategoryId%3D14091){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="laht.com"}]{.qlink_container}]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
