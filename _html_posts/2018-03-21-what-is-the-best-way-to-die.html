<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How can you kill yourself without a gun?<br><br>Ask the Japanese. They have a high rate of suicide and a very low rate<br>of gun ownership.<br><br>Since it's not my idea of a fun evening to give anyone ideas about how<br>to kill themselves, if you are truly interested, use Google to search<br>for "suicide in Japan."<br><br>And if you happen to be a person who is contemplating taking their own<br>life but you don't have access to a gun, don't. Just don't. As the box<br>on this page states, "There is help." If you are seriously considering<br>suicide, please use the resources in that box (country-specific<br>resources are listed).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
