Why not just have a public ceremony<br>and avoid the marriage license?**<br><br>Recognition by the state. When you are not legally married, you are<br>considered to be "domestic partners" as far as the state is concerned.<br>When you are legally married, there are some advantages that come with<br>that status. Here are a few things you may not have thought of:<br><br>> You'll qualify for an estate tax marital deduction. When one<br>> spouse dies, his or her estate passes to the surviving spouse,<br>> tax-free. That's not true for domestic partners, and even though the<br>> federal exemption is fairly high---currently \$5.34 million---the<br>> exemption in some states is low enough to catch even moderate estates.<br>><br>> You'll qualify for the gift tax marital deduction. As long as your<br>> spouse is a U.S. citizen, you can make tax-free gifts of any amount to<br>> him or her. "Unmarried couples may be surprised to find out that they<br>> owe gift taxes as a result of making gifts or supporting each other,"<br>> says Paul Jacobs, a financial planner and chief investment officer of<br>> Palisades Hudson Financial Group in Atlanta. "The maximum annual<br>> tax-free gift that you can give someone is currently \$14,000."<br>><br>> **You can roll over a deceased spouse's IRA to the surviving spouse's<br>> IRA**. If your significant other dies with an IRA and you aren't<br>> married, you'll have to start taking distributions immediately,<br>> regardless of your age. "A surviving spouse has the option to roll<br>> over the IRA into his or her own IRA, which makes it possible for a<br>> younger surviving spouse to postpone minimum distributions until age<br>> 70 and a half," says Susan Green, an associate financial advisor at<br>> Wescott Financial Advisory Group in Philadelphia.<br>><br>> You can contribute to a spousal IRA. If you are domestic partners<br>> and you don't work, you can't contribute to an IRA for retirement<br>> savings, since you have no earned income. However, "if you're married<br>> and you have a working spouse and a non-working spouse, the<br>> non-working spouse can use the working spouse's income to qualify for<br>> IRA contributions," says \[Allen Falke, a business, trust and estate<br>> attorney with Mirick O'Connell in Worcester, MA\].<br>><br>> You can receive survivor's benefits from a pension plan. If your<br>> spouse is lucky enough to have a pension, and they've elected to have<br>> survivor's benefits, you will continue receiving pension benefits<br>> after he or she dies. "The benefits are the biggest thing," says Ted<br>> Toal, a financial planner with Rockwood Wealth Management in<br>> Annapolis. "Especially for those who are older."<br>><br>> You can receive Social Security benefits. "Spouses have the option<br>> of filing for a spousal benefit, which gives them the potential to<br>> collect up to 50% of the other spouse's benefit amount," says Michael<br>> Lynch, vice president of strategic markets for Hartford Funds in<br>> Radnor, PA. There is also the possibility for a larger benefit upon<br>> the death of a spouse, he says. Imagine, for instance, that you are<br>> collecting \$1,000 a month in Social Security benefits and your spouse<br>> is collecting \$1,200 a month. If your spouse dies, you could start<br>> collecting survivor benefits of \$1,200---a \$200-per-month increase.<br>> As a domestic partner, you have no such option.<br>><br>> You'll save on health insurance. "Usually plans for one plus a<br>> spouse are cheaper than if you each have your own plan, even if it's<br>> an employer sponsored plan," Toal says. This is especially helpful if<br>> one of you doesn't have access to insurance through your employer---if<br>> you're self-employed, for instance.<br>><br>> You have an advantage if your spouse is incapacitated. If your<br>> significant other is in a car crash, you may have more difficulty<br>> seeing him or her at a hospital if you aren't a blood relation or a<br>> legal spouse. And if a judge has to name someone to make healthcare or<br>> financial decisions on behalf of your partner, you may be overlooked<br>> in favor of a parent or sibling if you aren't married. "What if the<br>> parents of the other person don't like the significant other?" Toal<br>> says. "They will be in court battling for control of everything."<br>><br>> You have more protection if your spouse dies. "If one passes away<br>> without a will, the state is going to dictate where your assets go,"<br>> Toal says. If your significant other still has parents and siblings in<br>> the equation when that happens, they may receive assets over a<br>> nonrelated boyfriend or girlfriend.\[1\](#qXjLQ){#cite-qXjLQ<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-qXjLQ){.citation_index} [[11 Things You Never Thought Of<br>When You Decided Not To Get<br>Married](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d77d80&url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateashford/2014/09/26/deciding-not-to-get-married/%23836ce6dedf35){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="forbes.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
