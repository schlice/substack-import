<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do the majority of gun owners support some form of background checks,<br>safety and training instruction, testing, permits, documentation of<br>transfer/sale, registration and/or psychological evaluations as a<br>condition of firearm purchase or ownership?**<br><br>*As a condition of firearm purchase or ownership?* No. There are no<br>rights which should be subject to conditions. The whole purpose of the<br>Amendment is to prevent government infringing on the right to "keep and<br>bear" arms. Infringing on the right can only be done in the least<br>restrictive way to accomplish a compelling state interest, and none of<br>those things can be proven to further a compelling state interest. The<br>state must also do so in the least restrictive way possible, and forcing<br>tens of millions of Americans to do all that stuff is arguably (and<br>clearly) not the least restrictive way to accomplish whatever compelling<br>state interest such tasks purport to accomplish.<br><br>*As a condition of carrying a firearm in public?* Yes, **with<br>caveats.** The right to keep the public safe is why the state would want<br>to do all of those things. Before you can do any of those things,<br>however, you have to be able to articulate what compelling state<br>interest is served by doing any one of those things:<br><br>- background checks<br>- safety and training instruction<br>- permits, which may include safety and instruction, and testing<br>- documentation of transfer/sale<br>- registration of firearms<br>- psychological evaluations<br><br>If you cannot articulate clearly (and include clear evidence which<br>shows) that a compelling state interest is served by doing those things,<br>and that doing this to all gun carriers is the least restrictive way to<br>accomplish that interest, you can't do it. That's why we have what we<br>have, and we don't have what we don't have. It's not because of any<br>collective laziness or NRA pushback that we don't have these so-called<br>"good things." It's because they either don't accomplish what the<br>proponents believe they accomplish, or it's not done in the least<br>restrictive way possible to the right upon which you are encroaching.<br><br>Also, be aware that as a condition of carrying a firearm in public<br>(either openly or concealed), most jurisdictions do many of these<br>things.<br><br>I'm also not going to go into each one of these; they've all been pretty<br>well drilled to death here on Quora; search around on each individual<br>item and you'll find some pretty lengthy discussions about whether we<br>should or should not do it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
