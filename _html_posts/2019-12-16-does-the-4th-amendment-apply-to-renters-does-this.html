Does this only apply to home<br>owners?**<br><br>The 4th Amendment protects citizens, keeping them secure from<br>unreasonable search in their "persons, houses, papers, and effects."<br><br>Your "house" is your domicile, wherever you live, be it a rented<br>apartment, townhome, condo, or single family home. Own or rent, the 4th<br>Amendment applies.<br><br>Clearly if you rent, there are certain things your landlord has the<br>right to do, such as access your apartment for maintenance with the<br>proper notification. But that doesn't constitute a government agent<br>performing an unreasonable search.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
