<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, this is a specific legal question which is not allowed<br>under Quora policy. But I think the points you raise are important, so<br>I'll see what I can hit within the confines of the policy. Keep in mind<br>that this is not legal advice; if you have legal questions, including<br>"do I have a case" type questions, find a disability attorney in your<br>area. There are numerous websites which can help you locate an attorney<br>who specializes in ADA cases.<br><br>*Is there any way to legally collect on this?*<br><br>There is always a way. The question always remains just how successful<br>you will be, and you have an uphill climb ahead of you. You are going to<br>have to prove that you had the exact same job performance as your<br>contemporaries, you were equally rated, and you were equally regarded,<br>but for some unknown reason, you didn't get \ raises \| promotions \<br>and they did. Also, there needs to be something that tells you that they<br>specifically did not pay you more because you had a disability. Were you<br>passed over for promotions? Did you not get assignments because they<br>believed you couldn't handle it because of your disability? Did they<br>ever say as much? Did anyone else at the company besides your<br>supervisor(s) know about this treatment?<br><br>You start that process with your local EEOC (Equal Employment<br>Opportunity Commission) who will review your case and clear you to file<br>a lawsuit. They will issue you a "Notice of Right to Sue" which means<br>you can proceed with a lawsuit. Your attorney will assist you with all<br>aspects of your claim, including your EEOC filing.<br><br>*What is the statue* \sic\ *of limitations?*<br><br>Depends on the claim. Remember that the whole purpose behind statutes of<br>limitations are to prevent stale claims. Memories get fuzzy, details<br>become less clear, and people generally forget things, making witnesses<br>harder and harder to find, and less reliable. Title I complaints<br>(employment discrimination) must be filed with the U.S. Equal Employment<br>Opportunity Commission (EEOC) within 180 days of the date of<br>discrimination, or 300 days if the charge is filed with a designated<br>State or local fair employment practice agency. Individuals may file a<br>lawsuit in Federal court only after they receive a \"right-to-sue\"<br>letter from the EEOC. Charges of employment discrimination on the basis<br>of disability may be filed at any U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity<br>Commission field office. Field offices are located in 50 cities<br>throughout the U.S. and are listed in most telephone directories under<br>\"U.S. Government.\" You said you were involved in potential<br>discrimination "several years ago," so it's likely that you cannot<br>proceed with your particular case.<br><br>You can see this process in action today, as Disney is being sued by the<br>families of autistic children over their new Disability Access System<br>(DAS) which replaced the Guest Access Card (GAC) system which was widely<br>abused. The Florida Commission on Human Relations (FCHR) ruled that<br>Disney did not provide appropriate accommodations and that the families<br>could proceed with their lawsuit, which has already been ruled in<br>Disney's favor at the municipal court level. The attorney for the<br>families is appealing. Most recently in the news, another family of an<br>autistic child was cleared by FCHR to be added as a plaintiff to the<br>lawsuit. The new Disability Access System, while providing some<br>accommodation to disabled guests, provides less accommodations than the<br>former system, and provides little to no assistance to autistic families<br>who still have to struggle with meltdowns because of the extended wait<br>times. This is incongruent with the provisions of ADA which require all<br>public facilities provide reasonable accommodations to their guests.<br><br>On a related but side note, I would also note that it provides little<br>assistance to those of us with MS, as the heat of the day saps our<br>energy, effectively cutting our day short. Without the assistance<br>provided by systems like GAC, my family enjoys a full day, while I enjoy<br>2/3 of a day. I will also note that a very friendly Guest Relations cast<br>member at Hollywood Studios assisted me on my last trip, providing me<br>with two additional Fastpass+ passes for each day of my trip which,<br>combined with my existing pre-selected Fastpass+ passes and my DAS<br>return times, really helped me enjoy my time much more. Plus, some<br>smarter scheduling of my time helped me to avoid the heat of the<br>afternoon (when lines are longest anyway).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Do-individuals-labeled-with-disabilities-get-paid-less/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
