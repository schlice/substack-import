<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My lease states \"The landlord may enter the apartment to provide<br>services, inspect, repair, improve or show it.\" Is that technically<br>saying they can enter whenever they want without prior notice?**<br><br>There is generally more in the lease than just that.<br><br>Generally, the lease document will go on to describe when and how the<br>landlord gains entrance into the apartment, as in something like *the<br>landlord will contact the tenant and provide a minimum of 24 hours<br>notice of entry for any purpose* or wording like that.<br><br>Keep reading your lease and see if you can find the language which<br>discusses when they will enter. See if there's a tenant's rights group<br>in your area or legal aid which may be able to help you review the<br>lease.<br><br>If worse comes to worse, talk to your landlord. They're usually not<br>jerks (though sometimes, everyone can be a jerk. Just ask my wife...).<br>Tell them that you have no problem if they come in whenever they need to<br>in order to do all of those things, but you'd like just a little bit of<br>advance notice and can they do that. I suspect they'll tell you their<br>current procedure and maybe can work with you to ensure that you get<br>advance notice before they come in. Advance notice is standard practice<br>for apartment complex management and maintenance.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is legal information, not legal advice. This answer is not<br>a substitute for professional legal advice, nor is it a solicitation to<br>offer professional legal advice. This answer does not create an<br>attorney-client relationship. This answer is for GENERAL INFORMATIONAL<br>PURPOSES ONLY. If you ignore this warning and convey confidential<br>information in a private message or comment, there is no duty to keep<br>that information confidential or to forego representation adverse to<br>your interests. Seek the advice of a licensed attorney in the<br>appropriate jurisdiction before taking any action that may affect your<br>rights. If you believe you have a claim against someone, consult an<br>attorney immediately, otherwise there is a risk that the time allotted<br>to bring your claim may expire.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to legal questions are intended third<br>party beneficiaries under Quora\'s* [[*Terms of<br>Service*](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being<br>isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I<br>wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is<br>un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m<br>wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,<br>not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me "ackshually,<br>you're wrong," don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put<br>anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed<br>by a block and a mute. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
