<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What if Donald Trump lies about something that gets our country into a<br>war and he acts like it the truth instead of a lie (just like he is<br>doing about everything else)?**<br><br>It's really not conceivable that the President could blatantly lie about<br>something and that lie would be believed by so many people that it would<br>actually start a war. Such a scenario is not outside the realm of<br>possibility, but in reality, it's so unlikely that such a thing could<br>actually happen that it's really inconceivable.<br><br>(Sorry, I hear *Princess Bride* in my head any time I type<br>inconceivable, so give me a second to compose myself)<br><br>Now on to the second part of your question: **Can Congress protect our<br>country from our President's mouth and tweeting?**<br><br>The short answer is no. The reason: the 1st Amendment.<br><br>> *Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech.*<br><br>Congress cannot stop someone from saying or tweeting anything they like.<br><br>However, if someone lies, in their speech (slander) or in their tweets<br>(libel), we have laws which can take care of that.<br><br>And if those lies are damaging enough, the House of Representatives<br>*can* vote to impeach the President.<br><br>But that's not enough. The Senate must see fit that those impeachable<br>offenses are so damaging that the President cannot remain in office to<br>complete his term, and they must have a trial and vote to remove him<br>from office.<br><br>And even then, the President is still a private citizen and can<br>still speak and tweet to his heart's content (unless Twitter decides to<br>ban him). So even then, Congress can't protect the country from Donald<br>Trump's mouth and Twitter account.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
