<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So in one of those bizarre "well, when you put it *THAT* way"<br>moments, the left once again tries to normalize their abhorrent behavior<br>by plastering over it with polite words.<br><br>They call it "transgender health care." Sounds innocuous enough.<br><br>What it *actually* involves is surgically removing the healthy<br>genitalia of minors, which are still required by their still-developing<br>bodies in order to properly develop. No amount of cross-gender hormone<br>therapy will restore that normal bodily growth. In just the same way<br>that we can't combine chemicals in a test tube and create life, we can't<br>use plastic surgery and hormone injections to make a male into a female.<br><br>Until those bodies have fully developed, removing their functioning<br>genitalia will cause massive health issues down the road. Brittle bone<br>disease, osteoporosis, and anorgasmia, as well as needing to take<br>hormone therapy for the rest of their lives (which is known to cause<br>cancer) is the life they have to look forward to.<br><br>And you can, with a straight face, describe this as *health care?*<br>In case you have forgotten the very beginning of the Hippocratic Oath,<br>it begins, "First, do no harm."<br><br>Well, when you put it *THAT* way...<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
