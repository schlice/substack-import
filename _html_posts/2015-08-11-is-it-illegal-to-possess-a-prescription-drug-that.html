<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In most places in the United States, it is illegal to<br>possess a prescription medication which has not been prescribed to you.<br>In most states, the charge is unlawful possession of prescription<br>medication. The charge is much more serious if the medication is a<br>controlled substance.\<br>\<br>Whether or not you *do* get charged will depend on circumstances,<br>such as what the drug is, who it was prescribed to, and the<br>circumstances under which it came into your possession. For example, if<br>you drove your grandmother to the hospital and the police find her<br>medicine in your car, you won\'t likely be charged. However, if her<br>prescription is for painkillers and you get stopped and you are under<br>the influence, you can get charged with DUI and unlawful possession<br>and/or use of prescription medication.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
