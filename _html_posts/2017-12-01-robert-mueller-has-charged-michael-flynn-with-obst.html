<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is how a Federal fishing investigation works:<br><br>- Cast your net far and wide, and see who gets caught up in it.<br>- Get the closest person to the target you can get, and charge him with<br>  whatever sticks.<br>- Tell him that if he cooperates and tells you what he knows about your<br>  actual target, you'll let him off easy.<br><br>Flynn is being charged with the "Martha Stewart" crime (lying to a<br>Federal agent) because that's all they have on him that will stick. It's<br>insignificant only in its importance, not in its consequences. With the<br>number of lying charges they had on Flynn, he could have faced a maximum<br>of 60 years (or the rest of his natural life) in Federal prison.<br><br>Instead, he pled guilty and will face somewhere between 6 and 12 months<br>in prison.<br><br>The obvious question, of course, is what did he have to give up in order<br>to get that plea deal? Did he have to give up anything at all?<br><br>The interesting point is that the lies that he told were about a<br>conversation he had with the Russian ambassador after the election. The<br>lies themselves weren't even related to the election. It was about a<br>conversation related to the sanctions the US was going to be placing on<br>the Russians for perceived interference in the election.<br><br>But to answer the question, how far this goes is yet to be seen. Did<br>they give him a plea deal just to show the nation that the investigation<br>yielded some fruit, even though it's not exactly what they were looking<br>for? Or is this part of something bigger?<br><br>Additionally, another question which is not being asked: Flynn was<br>caught in a lie because the NSA had recorded his phone conversation with<br>the Russian ambassador. How did the government get the warrant to tap<br>Flynn's phone? From where did they get the information needed to procure<br>that warrant? Did it come from the unlawful "unmasking" of information<br>from unrelated foreign operative recordings? This is something which, to<br>the best of everyone's knowledge, has yet to be investigated.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
