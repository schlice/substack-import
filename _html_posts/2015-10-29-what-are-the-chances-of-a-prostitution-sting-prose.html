<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Assuming the situation happened \*exactly\* as you<br>described, nothing illegal happened.\<br>\<br>Prostitution involves an agreement to exchange money for sex. If no<br>money physically changed hands, and no money was ever discussed,<br>mentioned, hinted around, or anything else, this wasn\'t prostitution,<br>it was a hook-up.\<br>\<br>Now, if there was any mention of \"how much this was going to cost\" or<br>\"I do X for \$100\" and then you make an overt act to begin the<br>transaction (getting undressed will do nicely), it\'s prostitution.\<br>\<br>The difference is whether or not money was ever<br>mentioned.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
