<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, doctors can choose to refuse to prescribe medications based on<br>insurance reasons. You do not have a right to a particular medication.<br><br>However, this scenario is unlikely.<br><br>More likely than not, the doctor will not know what your insurance<br>covers and what it does not. They may advise you that a particular<br>medication has no generic substitute, and if you fill it and your<br>insurance *does not* cover it, you may be on the hook to pay for it, and<br>name-brand medications are not cheap. But usually, doctors are unaware<br>of what your insurance will cover and what it will not.<br><br>In general, doctors will prescribe you the medication you need and leave<br>it up to you and your insurance provider to figure out how to pay for<br>it. They may be able to give you some samples of the medication to cover<br>you in the interim, until you and your insurance company can come to<br>some agreement on how to pay for it.<br><br>Usually, it is the *insurance company* which will refuse to pay for a<br>medication your doctor prescribes. Your insurance company believes it<br>can *second-guess* the doctor and claim that there may be similar<br>medications (usually which have lower-cost generics) which will work<br>just as well.<br><br>The disconnect here is between your doctor and the insurance company.<br><br>When this happens, your doctor will need to *justify* his or her choice<br>of medication. Perhaps that medicine was prescribed because the generics<br>unacceptably react with other medications you are taking, or the<br>alternatives are unsuitable for one reason or another.<br><br>But I'm getting too far into the weeds.<br><br>To answer your question, it is legal for doctors to not prescribe a<br>medication if your insurance company will not cover it, and there are no<br>laws which protect you in that circumstance. But this scenario is highly<br>unlikely. Most commonly, your doctor will prescribe your medication and<br>your insurance company will either simply refuse to pay for it, or will<br>advise your doctor to prescribe a lower-cost alternative, usually a<br>medication which has a generic equivalent, to save money.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional medical advice.
