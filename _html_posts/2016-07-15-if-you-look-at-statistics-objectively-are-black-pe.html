<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: **That's not a fair statistical analysis to make because<br>people are not shot by police simply because they are a certain race,<br>regardless of their percentage in the population.**<br><br>Longer answer: You certainly can do a statistical analysis and compare<br>the probability *per capita* of being shot by police based on the number<br>of people shot by police of that race and then comparing that to the per<br>capita number of that race in the population. What you would find is<br>that Native American people are shot at the most alarmingly high rate<br>per capita, followed by Hispanics, blacks, and then whites. This is<br>solely because of their percentages in society.<br><br>But that doesn't tell the whole story.<br><br>In order to see who gets shot and why, you have to determine why people<br>get shot in the first place, and how many people of each race ***are<br>doing the things that would lead them to get shot.*** A more accurate<br>statistic is what percentage of each race *per capita* are committing<br>violent crimes which might lead them to be shot by police.<br><br>There are indeed statistical outliers in every group, but for the most<br>part, people get shot because they do things that lead police to shoot<br>them. They are usually involved in violent crimes. They usually respond<br>to the police with violence instead of compliance. And when you look at<br>those statistics, you might see some useful trends.<br><br>But it's considered taboo in today's society to talk about the reasons<br>why certain people act the way they do, and whose fault that is. It's<br>easiest to blame the police because they're on the other side of the<br>gun, but that doesn't tell the whole story either.<br><br>And to be fair, it's an answer for a different question than what was<br>posed here.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
