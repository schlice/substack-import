<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If we consider the historical value of the statues, and the educational<br>value they still possess, then the statues should not be destroyed. They<br>should be carefully removed and relocated to a more appropriate<br>location, such as a memorial section in a park, or a museum.<br><br>Perhaps pieces with more artistic value should be relocated to museums,<br>but I assume that each city possessing one of these statues should do<br>with it as is appropriate, but I hardly think that destroying all of<br>them *en masse* is appropriate.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
