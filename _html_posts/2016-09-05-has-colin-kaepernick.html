<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Working a football game is not a required duty of police officers. It is<br>an *additional duty* which takes place during their off-hours (i.e.<br>like overtime), one that full-time police officers are paid extra to<br>perform (also like overtime). They can choose to either work or not work<br>an additional duty.<br><br>There is no hostility when an officer chooses to not work an additional<br>duty. If the department cannot provide that service, the stadium will<br>have to seek security services from another agency, or from a private<br>security contractor (at an additional cost).<br><br>The only hostility may take place if command staff chooses to order<br>officers to work the additional duty, at which point it changes and is<br>no longer an additional duty.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
