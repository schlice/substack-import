<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>NORAD does not have a "secret mission." [[NORAD's<br>website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2b65ac&url=http://www.norad.mil/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="norad.mil"}]{.qlink_container} spells out pretty clearly<br>what they do.<br><br>There were also a number of TV documentaries, like this one...<br><br>[https://youtu.be/mUDMQbNkeLo(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=612316&url=https://youtu.be/mUDMQbNkeLo){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>or [[this<br>one](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c30842&url=http://www.history.com/shows/modern-marvels/season-3/episode-9){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="history.com"}]{.qlink_container} which detail the history,<br>construction, and modern use of the facility.<br><br>The only big difference which none of the TV shows captured: in 2006,<br>primary day-to-day operations were moved from NORAD to nearby Peterson<br>AFB, where the NORAD Headquarters building sits. The correlation center<br>comm lines and data processing are still performed within the Mountain,<br>and the facility remains active with a skeleton crew as well as comm,<br>facilities, and technical support personnel, and sits ready as an<br>alternate facility.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
