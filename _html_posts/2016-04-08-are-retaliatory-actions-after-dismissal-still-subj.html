<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, there is little information to go on, but let\'s try to<br>dissect this clearly hypothetical example, because if this was about a<br>real person and someone\'s real legal trouble, we wouldn\'t be able to<br>answer it under Quora\'s TOS.<br><br>*Employee dismissed in 2013 after reporting ethics issues,*<br><br>So employee was dismissed as reprisal for reporting ethics issues.<br>Reprisal should also be unlawful under the company\'s policies, and<br>employee should be able to sue the company for reprisal and get lost<br>wages and other compensation<br><br>*however retaliation continued for the next 2.5 years.*<br><br>How does retaliation continue for 2.5 years after an employee is<br>terminated? Were there harassing phone calls, or did the company have<br>reason to contact the employee? Were there letters mailed, or did the<br>company have reason to reach out to the former employee via postal mail?<br>The employee can sue the company separately for this retaliation, since<br>he is no longer an employee and should therefore have no reason to<br>interact with the former company. If the company reasonably believed<br>there was cause to contact the employee, then there is legitimate reason<br>for attempted contact to continue. You would have to show clear<br>malicious intent for a retaliation claim to be substantiated.<br><br>The statements about whether or not arbitration is still required is a<br>point of fact to be determined by a judge. If the judge finds that the<br>2011 agreement is a continuation of the 2009 agreement, then both are<br>still in force. If the judge finds that the 2011 agreement is a<br>*wholesale replacement* of the 2009 agreement, then litigation will be<br>allowed. There will have to be a determination hearing to find out if<br>arbitration is required or not.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
