<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [I agree with<br/>[Geoffrey(https://www.quora.com/profile/Geoffrey-Reemer)]{.qlink_container}<br/>on this, but let me add some legal background around why not.\<br/>\<br/>Even though they may be convicted felons, they are still citizens of the<br/>Realm and still retain the very large majority of rights simply by their<br/>status as a citizen. They already have certain rights curtailed while<br/>they are incarcerated. They are \"wards of the state\" while they are<br/>incarcerated, and it is the responsibility of the state to provide them<br/>a violence-free living facility. In this case, the state failed to keep<br/>him safe.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
