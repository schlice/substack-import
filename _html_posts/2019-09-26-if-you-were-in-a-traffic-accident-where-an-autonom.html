So<br>currently if someone had their Tesla on autopilot and caused an<br>accident, you sue the driver, even if the driver was not physically<br>controlling the vehicle.<br><br>In the future, driverless vehicles will have to become far more robust<br>before we will ever let them out on the roads. Vehicles must learn to<br>communicate with each other, and any disconnected vehicles will be<br>avoided like the plague. We will have to determine how to determine<br>fault when driverless vehicles are part of auto accidents before we let<br>them on the roads. Once we do this, we'll be able to successfully find<br>fault when a driverless vehicle is involved in a crash.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
