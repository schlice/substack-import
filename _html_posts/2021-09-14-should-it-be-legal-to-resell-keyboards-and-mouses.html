<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So long as any resale of any product is allowed, the answer is yes.<br><br>The typical type of private sale is called an "as-is" sale. Unless prior<br>arrangements are made, this is the condition of sale that is assumed.<br>This is because private sellers are not held to the same standards as<br>retailers. For example, if you private sell a car, the seller is not<br>required to ensure the car passes a state inspection before selling it.<br>The seller is also not required to sanitize the inside of the car before<br>selling it, considering what sorts of behaviors may go on in the back<br>seat of said car.<br><br>Therefore, if you buy a used keyboard, It is up to you to sanitize the<br>equipment after you buy it; there is no sanitization standard for any<br>private sale.<br><br>*Caveat emptor.*<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Should it be legal to resell keyboards and mouses knowing its a 99%<br>probability it was used by someone who masturbated and then touched it<br>during and after and most likely never fully sanatized it, leaving<br>genital fluids which may contain sickness?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
