<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My neighbor is parking his four cars in front of my mailbox, and the<br>post office has threatened to fine me. What can I do?**<br><br>Despite what others have said, the correct answer is "it depends."<br><br>In general, it is not illegal to park in front of a mailbox *unless*<br>your city has made it illegal to do so. Therefore, technically it's not<br>illegal for them to park where they are.<br><br>Frustrating matters is the fact that USPS, while they can't fine you,<br>can skip delivery to repeatedly obstructed mailboxes. The theory is that<br>having to have the carrier get out of the mail truck for every<br>obstructed mailbox hinders their efficiency, and everyone gets their<br>mail late.<br><br>When on-street parking is allowed *and* your city does not have laws<br>against parking in front of mailboxes, you should do a few things:<br><br>1.  Notify USPS that it is not your car blocking your mailbox. This way,<br>    they won't stop delivery to your box. If they really think they can<br>    fine someone for parking in front of a mailbox (which is interesting<br>    since they're not the local parking authority, that's the local<br>    city), tell them to fine the owner of the car, not the owner of the<br>    mailbox.<br>2.  Place a note on the offending car reminding them that the Post<br>    Office requires a clear 30 foot approach in order to safely deliver<br>    mail, and asking if they can park in a safer spot.<br><br>If your city does have parking restrictions related to on-street<br>mailboxes, notify your city's parking enforcement division, or your<br>local police department's code enforcement division.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
