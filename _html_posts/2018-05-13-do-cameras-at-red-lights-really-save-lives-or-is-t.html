Responsible drivers save lives.<br><br>The goal is to get people to stop running red lights. The way to do<br>that, cities reason, is to monitor the intersection 100% of the time.<br>Since we can't do that with people, we do it with technology. If there<br>is an intersection where red light runners are a problem, we install<br>cameras to try to stop people from running red lights. If we can get<br>people to change their behaviors, we might save lives.<br><br>Is this a flawed theory? Possibly.<br>[Kurt(https://www.quora.com/profile/Kurt-Hyllested-Sr)]{.qlink_container}<br>answered that studies have shown that red light cameras do not increase<br>safety. This was from an anecdotal study in the 90's where drivers were<br>asked about red light cameras at intersections. They said that the<br>cameras increased their anxiety, causing them to speed up to get through<br>the light, or slam on their brakes to avoid a ticket. This was construed<br>to mean that safety in intersections was either unchanged, or made<br>worse, by the presence of the cameras. This prompted many cities to shut<br>off their cameras.<br><br>The IIHS (the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety) did its own study.<br><br>> The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety looked at 14 cities that<br>> ended their red-light camera programs between 2010 and 2014.<br>> Researchers compared the annual crash rates in those cities with those<br>> of 29 others in the same regions that continued using red-light<br>> cameras.<br>><br>> The numbers tell a sobering story. In those cities that turned off<br>> their cameras, the rate of fatal crashes involving a driver who sped<br>> through a red light was 30 percent higher per capita than if the<br>> cameras had remained functional, according to the research. The<br>> overall fatal crash rate at signalized intersections in those cities<br>> was likewise 16 percent higher per capita.<br>><br>> From the time they went into operation through 2014, red-light cameras<br>> across all 79 large U.S. cities included in the study saved nearly<br>> 1,300 lives, IIHS concluded.<br>><br>> \"This study confirms that cameras reduce fatal crashes and for the<br>> first time quantifies the effect that ending these programs has on<br>> safety,\" IIHS President Adrian Lund said.\[1\](#IlohM){#cite-IlohM<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>So do red light cameras really save lives? Apparently, it's still up for<br>debate.<br><br>Kurt was absolutely right about making money, though. In many cities,<br>the cameras cost nearly as much as the revenue made from them. The<br>programs are barely self-sustaining. They're certainly not the cash cow<br>that some people make them out to be.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-IlohM){.citation_index} [[They may be annoying, but<br>red-light cameras save lives:<br>IIHS](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=47de2a&url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/27/they-may-be-annoying-but-red-light-cameras-save-lives-iihs.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cnbc.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
