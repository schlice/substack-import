<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, *Roe* is dead and is not coming back. *At best*, we<br>pass a national law mandating a minimum amount of time a state must<br>permit elective abortions, but we're years away from that happening.<br><br>As for the sex strike, here's an analogy.<br><br>The police don't care that you use Waze to mark their locations. They<br>also don't care that you use CB radios or your Escort radar detectors to<br>notify you that a police officer is clocking traffic. That's because,<br>despite the naysayers who believe that the police are just out to make<br>money, the police perform traffic patrol to keep speeds down. Similarly,<br>notifying you that there is a police officer on the side of the road<br>naturally slows traffic. So by doing so, we actually accomplish the<br>original goal of traffic safety.<br><br>Similarly, like the last time that abortion promoters said that they<br>were going on a sex strike, perhaps they don't realize that not everyone<br>will participate. Only the people who planned on having irresponsible<br>sex, and even if they do use protection, not taking responsibility if<br>they are the 1% who gets pregnant even though they did so. And by<br>responsibility, I only mean hosting that baby for 9 months and then<br>giving it up for adoption. No one is telling you that you must become a<br>mother. Just don't kill babies. Anyway, this accomplishes the goal of<br>the pro-life movement: reducing unwanted pregnancies which would result<br>in abortions.<br><br>I see no issue here.<br><br>As for Ashley Madison and Tinder, the hook-up culture is going to have<br>to rethink how it works. I can't see the hook-up culture going away any<br>time soon, but depending on which state you live in, you may have to<br>make some changes to how you do what you do.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Now that all the abortion promoters and feminist activists are going on<br>a sex strike until Rowe v. Wade is restored, how soon will Ashley<br>Madison and Tinder go out of business?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
