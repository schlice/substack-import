<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Driving is a privilege. Gun ownership is a right. You can impose harsher<br>sanctions, but note you are not restricting *everyone's* driving<br>privilege, just the person who drives drunk. Have you noticed that when<br>you pass laws about driving, it doesn't impact the good drivers? Only<br>the drunks lose their license. Why do you insist on removing guns from<br>everyone? If we have an increase in drunk drivers, will you take cars<br>away from everyone? Your stance on guns is illogical, especially when<br>driving is a privilege and gun ownership is a right.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-caliber-of-tragedy-would-have-to-take-place-for-gun-advocates-to-change-their-mind-about-gun-control/answer/Anthony-Zarrella<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
