<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It really depends on how you generate a valuation. If you are looking at<br>nothing more than the value of physical assets owned, airlines are far<br>more valuable, as their assets are worth far more than the assets owned<br>by WhatsApp.<br><br>But how do you value a software service provider? By number of users?<br>Delta Air Lines, [[the world\'s largest<br>airline](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a2ac2e&url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2015/06/worlds-largest-airlines){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="economist.com"}]{.qlink_container}, carried 129.4 million<br>passengers last year. WhatsApp has approximately 500 million users, so<br>by sheer user volume alone, WhatsApp has five times more visibility than<br>Delta Air Lines.<br><br>In October of 2014, Facebook acquired WhatsApp for \$21.4 billion<br>dollars. Delta Air Lines may have gross revenue of \$40 billion, but<br>they only have [[a net<br>income](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1e1b5c&url=http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/dal/profile){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="marketwatch.com"}]{.qlink_container} of \$4.5 billion. So in<br>terms of valuation, WhatsApp is clearly valued more (and has a higher<br>income potential) than Delta Air Lines.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
