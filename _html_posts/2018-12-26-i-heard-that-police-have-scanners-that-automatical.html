Or can you change<br>plates?**<br><br>(This bit was added)<br><br>No, this is illegal. Any treatment or covering you add to a plate to<br>obscure it from any automated systems is illegal, just as it is illegal<br>to drive with incorrect number plates.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
