<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Hawaii has some reasonably tough gun laws. Here are some of the<br>highlights:<br><br>- Residents of Hawaii must get a permit for ***each individual firearm<br>  acquisition***. You must apply to the county chief of police before<br>  every firearm transaction and receive a permit before you can purchase<br>  or otherwise acquire a firearm. You must have training and<br>  qualifications which compare with what most other states have for<br>  concealed carry.<br>- Every legally-owned firearm in Hawaii must be registered.<br>- Safe storage requirements are in place. Every firearm must be safely<br>  stored when not in use.<br>- Hawaii is a "may issue" state for concealed carry.<br>- There is no open carry in the state.<br>- Magazines have a 10-round limit.<br>- Hawaii does have a Castle Doctrine and stand-your-ground laws.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
