How do we make<br>sure that happens whether impeached or not?**<br><br>When Trump leaves office, he will be a regular (former President)<br>citizen. If he is not tried for a crime, and you want to ensure that<br>he is "punished," you can punish him in the same way any other<br>businessman who owns businesses gets punished:<br><br>in the wallet.<br><br>Don't ever visit a Trump-owned property. Don't go to a Trump-owned<br>casino. Don't spend money on anything with the Trump name on it (as most<br>of the real estate with Trump's name on it is done through licensing<br>agreements). Boycott anything Trump-related, and tell as many people as<br>you possibly can to do the same. Be sure you know who owns every casino<br>and property you visit, and avoid Trump properties, despite the fact<br>that you might want to visit there anyway.<br><br>[[List of real estate owned by Donald Trump -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d8a03a&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_things_named_after_Donald_Trump%23Real_estate){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
