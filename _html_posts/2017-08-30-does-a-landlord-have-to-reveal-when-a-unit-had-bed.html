<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>[[In most<br>states](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4bceec&url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/state-bedbug-laws.aspx){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ncsl.org"}]{.qlink_container}, landlords do not need to<br>report if a unit has been treated previously for bed bugs.<br><br>So how do you know if a unit has had bed bugs before? You can check with<br>the current tenants, or check with neighbors.<br><br>You can also straight up ask the landlord if the unit ever had problems<br>with bed bugs. Landlords need to answer you truthfully, because ***if<br>they lie to you*** and the unit subsequently gets bed bugs and you find<br>out it's been a recurring problem, you have a few options which you can<br>pursue with a lawyer, such as withholding rent payments, or suing the<br>landlord for damages. These remedies are legally tricky and carry some<br>risk, so *make sure you consult with a housing attorney in your area<br>before you do any of these.*<br><br>\<br><br>*These statements are information only, not legal advice. I'm not a<br>lawyer; I only play one on the Internet.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
