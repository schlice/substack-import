<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Police are not there to incriminate you, per se. They're nearly<br>universally not there to falsely accuse you. But **police are there to<br>find a person who fits the facts, arrest that person, and make it<br>stick.** That's their job. Their job is not to believe you or not<br>believe you. Their job is not to find the truth. Their job is to find a<br>person who fits the facts they have and build a case against that<br>person. If police are talking to you, it's because they are trying to<br>find a person who fits the facts and build a case against them, and you<br>might just be that person, despite what they tell you.<br><br>To that end, ***police WILL use EVERYTHING you say against you,<br>regardless of how innocuous you think it is.***<br><br>And the things you think are completely inconsequential could provide<br>the police the reasonable suspicion they need to start looking in to you<br>as a suspect. Even if you are completely innocent and you say nothing<br>but the truth, you will always give the police something that they can<br>use to help them convict you.<br><br>Here's a little tidbit that may help you: you cannot give the police any<br>information that would *help* you at trial. The Federal Rules of<br>Evidence \ยง801(d)(2)(a)\ explains what evidence can be used against<br>you. It's interesting to note that your words can be used *against* you<br>but never *for* you. In order to use what you said to the police *for*<br>you, you'd have to put the police officer on the stand and have him<br>relay the conversation (which benefits you), but he can't, because it's<br>*hearsay*. It is for that reason alone that there is never benefit to<br>you from talking to police.<br><br>Even if you do tell the truth but the police have bad evidence or<br>unreliable evidence, and it contradicts what you said (which happens<br>to be the truth), they can use the contradiction to presume you are<br>lying and incorrectly look at you as the suspect.<br><br>Additionally, even if you are completely innocent, it is very difficult<br>to tell the same story twice in exactly the same way, which may make you<br>look like you are changing your story, and provide evidence to the<br>police to look into you further.<br><br>Professor James Duane was a former defense attorney turned law professor<br>and is an outspoken voice on police interactions. When you ask about<br>"don't ever talk to police," Professor Duane is always mentioned first.<br>He has even written a book about it, titled [[*You Have the Right to<br>Remain<br>Innocent*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a75900&url=https://www.amazon.com/You-Have-Right-Remain-Innocent/dp/1503933393){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}. Here's a few videos of him<br>if you want to learn more:<br><br>[https://youtu.be/-FENubmZGj8(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1a433e&url=https://youtu.be/-FENubmZGj8){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>[https://youtu.be/d-7o9xYp7eE(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d890f6&url=https://youtu.be/d-7o9xYp7eE){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>One of the things Professor Duane points out in that second video (I<br>know it's 45 minutes, but it's worth every second) is part of the<br>opinion from *Ohio v. Reiner:* "\O<br>e of the Fifth Amendment\'s basic<br>functions is to protect innocent persons who might otherwise be ensnared<br>by ambiguous circumstances. Truthful responses of an innocent witness,<br>as well as those of a wrongdoer, **may provide the government with<br>incriminating evidence from the speaker\'s own mouth**."<br><br>TL;DR: The Fifth Amendment exists so that you can never be forced to<br>be a witness against yourself. Don't be a willing witness against<br>yourself. If the police ask you questions, don't talk to them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
