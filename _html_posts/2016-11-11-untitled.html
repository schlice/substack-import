<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Holly, your best course of action at this point is to retain the<br>services of a real estate attorney in your area who is experienced with<br>HOA law.<br><br>[[Find Local Homeowners Association Law Attorneys or Law<br>Firms](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=faca30&url=http://www.lawyers.com/homeowners-association-law/find-law-firms-by-location/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="lawyers.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Specifically on Quora, you have moved into an area we call a "specific<br>legal question" and while we want to help if we can, once we move out of<br>the realm of a general legal question and into "I have this issue" sorts<br>of questions, you're better off talking to someone who knows not only<br>local real estate law in your area, but the specifics of HOAs where you<br>live and how your state handles them.<br><br>HOAs are treated differently in different states. Some states can work<br>with HOAs, others attempt to oppose them at every turn. You will be best<br>served by speaking to a lawyer in your area. Here in Colorado, the<br>legislature likes HOAs but the courts do not. It's tricky navigating the<br>legal landscape when dealing with HOAs. Your best bet is to find a good<br>real estate attorney with HOA law experience.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Are-there-legal-supports-against-an-HOA-that-holds-back-services-for-one-unit-owner/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
