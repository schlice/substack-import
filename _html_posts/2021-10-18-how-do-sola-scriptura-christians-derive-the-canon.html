<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Every Christian tradition which uses the Bible as a basis uses a<br>different version. My Bible has 66 books in it: 39 in the Old Testament<br>and 27 in the New Testament. This is often referred to as the "canon" of<br>Scripture, or the "rule" or the "collection" of books that Christians<br>believe belong in the Bible. Catholics and Orthodox religions include a<br>group of books in their bibles referred to as the Deuterocanonical books<br>("second canon") or, as the Protestants call it, the "Apocrypha."<br><br>But that still begs the question: *how do you know that your list of<br>books is the right one?* This is probably the most convincing argument<br>against *sola scriptura* which exists today. Catholics go even further<br>and state that at the Council of Trent, they *infallibly* established<br>the canon, including the Deuterocanonical books, as being authoritative.<br>How do they know that *their* canon is *infallible*? I, unlike the<br>Catholics, don't believe that there is an infallible human authority<br>which determined the canon of the Bible. But I do believe that *the<br>books themselves*, as written, are *inerrant* and *infallible*. No one<br>seriously argues that point, regardless of translation or version.<br><br>So, at best, since it was people who have determined the list of books<br>in the Bible, we have a *potentially* *fallible* list of *infallible*<br>books, a claim echoed by R. C. Sproul\[1\](#LscTO){#cite-LscTO<br>.citation_link} and others many years ago. The list was defined by<br>humans, so the possibility of fallibility will naturally also exist.<br>Every Christian tradition must accept this, including the Council of<br>Trent Catholics. So the question remains: how can I still profess<br>*sola scriptura* **when I can't even be infallibly sure what books<br>belong in the Bible?**<br><br>But that begs another question (which will help us answer the first):<br>***do you need infallible certainty in something in order to believe<br>it?***<br><br>The classic example of not needing an infallible certainty in order to<br>believe something is this: I believe that the sun is going to rise<br>tomorrow. Now, do I have an *infallible* *certainty* that it will? No, I<br>do not. Some astrological phenomenon could occur which causes the earth<br>to stop rotating. Or we could get hit by an asteroid, or the sun could<br>suddenly go out. But what is the *probability* that any of these things<br>would happen? It's super low, isn't it? But regardless, I don't have an<br>*absolute, infallible certainty* about the sun rising tomorrow.<br><br>But that doesn't mean that I have an excuse to believe that the sun will<br>not rise tomorrow. Because the probability of the sun not rising<br>tomorrow is so infinitesimally low, I can pretty much bank on the fact<br>that it will.<br><br>The same holds true for our determinations of canon. Just because there<br>exists the possibility that we are wrong (our fallibility) does not<br>provide us an excuse for unbelief. We must look at how probable it is<br>that we are wrong.<br><br>So: are we arguing the difference between books which would make or<br>break our belief? Would the addition or the subtraction of a book cause<br>the whole to change its meaning? Would any book of the Bible become<br>uninterpretable with or without the Deuterocanonical books? The short<br>answer is no.<br><br>So, now we get to the big bad question: ***does our belief change<br>because a small group of books is either included or excluded from a<br>particular reading of the Bible?* That answer is no**.<br><br>Therefore, because the probability is so low as to be non-existent that<br>it makes any substantive difference to the foundation of our faith, we<br>can still claim *sola scriptura*. We acknowledge that we have a<br>*fallible* collection of *infallible* books. While the possibility<br>exists that we may be wrong, what is included in our collection of<br>beliefs is so similar throughout the Christian traditions as to be<br>insignificant when it comes to our core beliefs, our "profession of<br>faith." So we can still, rightly, claim *sola scriptura,* even with<br>these differences in our *admittedly* *fallible* understandings of<br>inclusion or exclusion.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How do sola scriptura Christians derive the Canon of the Bible?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-LscTO){.citation_index} [[R.C.
