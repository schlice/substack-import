<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes.<br><br>*Every Christian has their own "brand" of Christianity*, because every<br>Christian has a unique and individual relationship with God. No two<br>Christians worship, pray, or believe exactly the same.<br><br>And for the ancillary issues, that's really not too terrible. So long as<br>the core beliefs are all there, we can discuss and debate the rest, in a<br>healthy, affirming way (an art form that this generation seems to have<br>lost).<br><br>And *some Christians conform completely to every doctrine of their<br>denomination.* Some, however, do not. Would it surprise you to learn<br>that, in any one given Christian church, only about *half* of the<br>congregants are saved? You probably didn't expect to hear that!<br><br>The truth is, despite how hard we try, not all congregants are walking<br>together in lock-step. It would be nice if every single Christian in<br>that room completely conformed with every doctrine of the denomination,<br>*for their sakes, not ours*. We will still be preaching the Gospel and<br>praising God whether they are saved or not. We hope that our prayers and<br>our songs penetrate those stubborn minds and turn those people to Christ<br>so that they too can be saved. That is our great desire.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
