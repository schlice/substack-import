<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [First, you have to expound a little.\<br>\<br>What kind of door are you looking to control? Car door? House door?\<br>\<br>Second, there aren\'t many controllers that open and close a door. Some<br>more modern cars have power doors and power liftgates that will open and<br>close on their own, but generally you\'ll only find that on the<br>liftgate, or the side sliders on a minivan. Driver/passenger doors are<br>manual.\<br>\<br>So first, you need to identify what you\'re trying to<br>open/close/lock/unlock.\<br>Second, those functions need to have a powered method by which they can<br>peform those functions.\<br>Finally, you can wire in your Arduino into the control lines for those<br>devices.\<br>\<br>I suggest Raspberry Pi.
