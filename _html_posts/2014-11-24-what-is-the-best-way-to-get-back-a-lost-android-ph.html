<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You\'re not likely to get it back.\<br>\<br>However, your only real chance is to notify your carrier of the theft.<br>They will flag the IMEI (the phone\'s serial number) in their system,<br>and anyone trying to re-activate that phone with a new SIM will be<br>denied, and the phone will be retained until the police arrive.\<br>\<br>The carrier will give you a printout showing that the phone has been<br>flagged stolen and will contain the same IMEI. Take that report to your<br>local police station and file a stolen property report. If the phone is<br>activated, the thief can be arrested if he is found in possession of the<br>phone with the matching IMEI.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
