<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Within United States law, if I am witness (innocent bystander rather<br>than accomplice) to a murder whereby my intervention may have prevented<br>the murder, cloud I be found culpable of any charges?**<br><br>There is only one instance in which you can be charged, and that is if<br>you have an affirmative duty to protect the person who was murdered.<br>This primarily applies to the police in the United States, but could<br>also apply where persons are under your specific protection (such as a<br>security guard, a bodyguard, etc).<br><br>In general, the police do not have a specific duty to protect any one<br>person, unless special circumstances exist (such as that person is in<br>custody), or the police caused the conditions which resulted in an<br>increased risk of harm to that person.<br><br>So for example, if you are a police officer and you have arrested<br>someone, and you leave that person temporarily unattended, and that<br>person is murdered, you can be held responsible in that specific case.<br><br>Beyond that, in general, citizens in the United States do not have a<br>duty to protect anyone from anything, especially not the harmful actions<br>of a third party. We only have a duty to protect others from our own<br>actions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
