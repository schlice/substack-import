<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Terror groups never really achieve what they set out to<br>do.\<br>\<br>ISIS\' stated goal is to turn the world into an Islamic caliphate. Now,<br>you know as well as I do that this will never happen. The US will never<br>allow it. Democrats, while sometimes appearing sympathetic to ISIS\'<br>cause, will never allow the US government to be supplanted by an Islamic<br>caliphate. Republicans, while sometimes appearing weak-wristed on the<br>Constitution, will also, similarly, never allow this to happen. Despite<br>the political differences between Democrats and Republicans, they both<br>love their country, and will fight tooth and nail to preserve it. And<br>quite frankly, the US has the best military in the entire world, bar<br>none. No one comes close. China is starting to amass quite an army, but<br>they are technically inferior.\<br>\<br>Their mode of operation is terror strikes, which while they are annoying<br>and sometimes downright sickening in terms of the depths of depravity of<br>human character to which they will sink (i.e. burning children alive in<br>cages), will never bring about social or political change. Even though<br>it appears that sometimes we do, it is our stated policy that we will<br>never give in to the demands of terrorists.\<br>\<br>So why would you want to align yourself with an organization that has<br>absolutely zero chance of achieving its stated goals? If your<br>organization has a primary mission that is unachievable, you are nothing<br>more than a noisemaker; a rabble-rouser. Nothing to be taken seriously.<br>Yes, their actions are quite egregious sometimes, but they are but<br>\"sound and fury, signifying nothing.\"\<br>\<br>And should they attempt an attack on the US government, on US soil, that<br>kills a lot of people, that they actually claim responsibility for, they<br>will face swift and decisive destruction. If they hide in caves, then we<br>will declare war on, and wipe off the face of the map, any country<br>harboring them (as that country thereby becomes an enemy combatant).<br>Mark my words: World War III will be fought primarily in the Middle<br>East, as the terrorists become more emboldened, until they finally<br>\"awake the sleeping giant.\" When we bring our entire arsenal to bear<br>on ISIS and any country that doesn\'t immediately turn them over to us,<br>we will have World War III, as nations either align with us or align<br>against us.\<br>\<br>It will be long. It will be bloody. But we will prevail. We have<br>prevailed for almost 240 years. And we will continue to<br>prevail.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
