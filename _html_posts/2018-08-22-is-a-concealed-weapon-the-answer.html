<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is a concealed weapon the answer?<br><br>It depends on the question.<br><br>If the question is, "How can I *(meaning me specifically)* best defend<br>and protect my own family?" then it is absolutely the answer. I have the<br>training and the requisite mindset and demeanor to handle the<br>repercussions of using a firearm in self-defense (or in defense of<br>another) and I'm fully prepared to face the gravity of that decision.<br><br>If the question is "What's your favorite ice cream flavor?" then it is<br>definitely not the answer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
