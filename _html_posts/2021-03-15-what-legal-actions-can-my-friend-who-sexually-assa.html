Sexual assault is a crime.<br><br>Then, after the police charge him, feel free to dish on social media.<br>Just make sure everything you say is 100% true and verifiable. But<br>remember: everything you say can be used against you in court, even if<br>you haven't been Mirandized.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
