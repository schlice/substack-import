<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Note 4 already runs on the T-Mobile network. If the phone runs on<br>the AT&T network (which it does), it runs on the T-Mobile network. They<br>both use GSM networks, and any phone of the Note's build quality will<br>use multiple GSM frequencies, and both carriers use multiple GSM<br>frequencies.<br><br>You could unlock an AT&T Note 4 and use it on the T-Mobile network if<br>you have one.<br><br>HOWEVER<br><br>You can't use a Verizon Note 4 on the T-Mobile network, as Verizon's<br>phones are CDMA and T-Mobile's phones are GSM. The tech is totally<br>different. Not only do GSM phones have a different wireless radio, CDMA<br>phones are not SIM card capable. GSM phones use SIM cards, so it's more<br>than just changing a radio.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
