<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'll echo what [[Paul<br>Harding](https://www.quora.com/profile/Paul-Harding-14)]{.qlink_container}<br>said, but add a little bit of the law behind it so you understand why<br>this is.<br><br>- There are no provisions in the law which allow you to disobey the<br>  lawful orders of a peace officer in the course of his duty.<br>- Whether or not the police officer was acting lawfully or whether or<br>  not the police officer was correctly enforcing the law are matters of<br>  fact to be determined by a judge or a jury. No one on the street<br>  has the authority to determine whether or not a police officer is<br>  acting lawfully.<br><br>Knowing these two facts (you never have the right to disobey a peace<br>officer who is acting lawfully, and whether or not the officer is acting<br>lawfully is up to a judge to decide), on the street, ***you must presume<br>the officer is acting lawfully and you must obey the police officer's<br>lawful orders. How do you know the orders are lawful? They come from a<br>lawfully-appointed police officer doing his job.***<br><br>Now some of you are going to cite the times that people disobeyed the<br>police, were arrested, and were later found to have been innocent. You<br>can certainly go this route, but as the OP asked, ***you can be arrested<br>for failing to follow a lawful directive***. You may be found to be<br>completely innocent, but the onus now falls on you to prove that the<br>officer was not acting lawfully, and you are doing so from a<br>respondent's position instead of from a complainant's position.<br><br>Remember, the directive is not lawful because the officer is correctly<br>interpreting the law, **the directive is lawful because it was given by<br>a lawfully-appointed police officer**. The officer can even be legally<br>wrong, and you still have to follow the order or face charges for<br>failing to follow a lawful directive.<br><br>Now, on to the service dog. The ADA allows law enforcement and providers<br>of public accommodation to ask two questions of any owner of a service<br>animal in a public place:<br><br>1.  Is this a service animal trained to assist with a disability as<br>    recognized by the ADA?<br>2.  What specifically is this service animal trained to do?<br><br>Service animals in-training are usually given the same deference as<br>actual fully-trained service animals, but they do not need to be. The<br>general standard is that if a service animal is going to be in a place<br>where people are, it must act with the same decorum as you would expect<br>of a person. Therefore, it cannot be a nuisance, it cannot publicly<br>urinate or defecate in that space, it cannot bother or annoy other<br>patrons, and it cannot bark incessantly. Service dogs do not do any of<br>these things unless it is part of their training and they are responding<br>to an emergency situation. For example, I know of a diabetic service dog<br>which alerts if its owner is going into a diabetic attack, and will bark<br>without stopping if its owner loses consciousness until its owner sits<br>up again. I know of one incident in which this happened, and the dog<br>responded exactly as it was trained to do, and it saved the woman's<br>life.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
