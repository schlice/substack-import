<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If there is no current registration, then the compiance<br>numbers cited are just guesstimates. It\'s because it is estimated that<br>there are about 1 million assault weapons in New York state, and only<br>about 44,000 registrations took place.\<br>\<br>I think the state is going to have a very hard time enforcing such a<br>provision, and it will only be used as a hammer when weapons are found<br>(i.e. this weapon is not properly registered under state law). How can<br>you enforce such a provision? Go door-to-door? Search every home in the<br>state? Not without probable cause and a warrant.\<br>\<br>So yes, this sounds like a clear case of civil disobedience, and I think<br>the state is going to be hard-pressed to get a provision like this<br>strengthened.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
