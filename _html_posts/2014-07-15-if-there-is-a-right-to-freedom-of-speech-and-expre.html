<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Why can\'t you yell \"fire\" in a crowded movie theater if<br/>there is no fire? Just because you have free speech doesn\'t mean you<br/>have an unfettered, unrestricted right to say anything you want at any<br/>time and for any conceivable reason.\<br/>\<br/>We tend to forget that every right we have in this country comes with an<br/>associated responsibility. You have the right to free speech, but you do<br/>not have the right to harass or intimidate with your speech. You have<br/>the responsibility to use your speech responsibly.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
