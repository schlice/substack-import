Instead<br>of going to the alarm they saw my son sitting in his truck, stopped and<br>arrested him. Can police stop to talk to my son on private property<br>which are gated apartments?**<br><br>It sounds like you're trying to build a case that the only reason the<br>police were "allowed" to be in the common area was to respond to the<br>alarm, and therefore they had no authority to effect the arrest since<br>they were not "allowed" to be there for anything other than the narrow<br>reasoning of "responding to an alarm."<br><br>Unfortunately, this is faulty logic.<br><br>Firstly, police have as much right to be in the common areas of<br>apartment complexes as any other guest of a resident. Responding to a<br>911 call gives them the immediate authority to enter the common area<br>uninvited, as it is not considered "private." The only private property<br>in an apartment complex is the interior of an individual apartment. You<br>cannot keep the police out of the common area any more than you can keep<br>guests of a tenant, or even prospective tenants, out of the common area.<br>The police have even more right to be in the common area than a<br>prospective tenant. Common areas are not governed by the same privacy<br>rules as the interior of an apartment, because of the tenet of<br>"reasonable expectation of privacy." Do you have the same expectation of<br>privacy in the common area as you do inside your apartment? The<br>reasonable person says no.<br><br>Secondly, the police can stop and question anyone they choose, at any<br>time they choose, so long as they were legally present in a location<br>(and again, common areas are not private in the same way that the<br>interior of a home is private) and they saw something which they<br>reasonably suspected was criminal activity. They only need to have<br>reasonable suspicion to do so, and they must be able to articulate that<br>suspicion to a judge during arraignment. At worst, they may have<br>violated department policy if they did not first respond to the alarm.<br>At best, they may have seen something that was a *higher priority* than<br>the alarm, and they handled that *first*. But neither of those<br>circumstances are a violation of law, and neither invalidate the arrest.<br><br>Finally, if there was cause for concern that the police were not acting<br>lawfully, the defense attorney will bring it up at trial.<br><br>Instead of searching the Internets for exclusionary evidence, work with<br>the defense attorney instead.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
