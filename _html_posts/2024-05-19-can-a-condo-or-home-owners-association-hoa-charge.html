<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer, as with all specific behaviors by any one HOA, can only be<br>determined by reviewing the Governing Documents of that Association.<br>Some HOAs may have the authority to issue some fines without notifying<br>anyone of a violation.<br><br>However, in most cases, I believe this to be highly unlikely. In most<br>cases, the HOA gives the resident *multiple, varied* opportunities to<br>remedy the violating condition. They do this primarily through letters<br>and emails, but the Governing Documents can specify other approved<br>methods of contact.<br><br>It is generally only after a few warnings (and an opportunity to address<br>the Board personally at a Board meeting) that a fine will be issued.<br>Some fining processes are so involved and convoluted (I'm looking at<br>you, Florida) that it's very, very difficult to get any sort of fine<br>added to any homeowner's ledger sheet at all. This, of course, is done<br>in the name of protecting homeowners from out-of-control Boards. But the<br>opposite effect happens too: it's nearly impossible for the Board to<br>actually issue any fines because the process is so onerous.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
