There is nothing<br>involving the law, or the courts, related to an impeachment proceeding.<br>There is no legal jeopardy for anyone for following or not following<br>Senate rules.<br><br>Senators who violate their oaths in the Senate can be investigated by<br>the Senate Ethics Committee and can be reprimanded.<br><br>Recall that the oath (written by the Senate) says that they will do fair<br>and impartial justice under the Constitution and the law. While Senators<br>can never be completely impartial, they can at least approach whatever<br>they are presented with with objectivity. Senators are elected officials<br>and they work for the people who elected them. To that end, they are<br>never impartial, so the oath is a little disingenuous in that regard.<br>The Senate should think about changing the verbiage of that oath.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
