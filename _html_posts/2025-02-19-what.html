<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, they are not above the law. But they know that they're never going<br>to be called out on it, as it is "technically" not a Constitutional<br>rights violation. While using their foot to keep your door open is<br>"technically" an entry into your home, they don't actually "enter" your<br>home. So at best, it's a legal gray area.<br><br>(EDIT) Some states have actually legislated this already, defining when<br>someone "enters" the home. For every state which has passed this<br>legislation, "breaking the plane" of the door constitutes "entry" into<br>the home. So in those states, sticking a foot in the door would be an<br>unlawful entry without exigent circumstances or a warrant.<br><br>So for the states which do not have this protection, how do you prevent<br>this? How can you legally protect yourself?<br><br>There are a number of ways to combat this type of activity.<br><br>- The one I like the best is *installing a screen door.* I can open<br>  my main door and leave my screen door closed. I can talk to the<br>  officer through my screen door without ever going outside or leaving<br>  an open path. Now, they cannot legally open your screen door, but you<br>  can still have a full conversation right through it. Besides, there<br>  are a number of benefits to having a screen door on your entry door.<br>  The one I specifically use is this one:<br><br>[https://www.lowes.com/pd/LARSON-\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6ce2b4&url=https://www.lowes.com/pd/LARSON-Tradewinds-Fullview-White-Full-View-Aluminum-Storm-Door-Common-36-in-x-81-in-Actual-35-75-in-x-79-75-in/50375000){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="lowes.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>- In conjunction with this, ***install security cameras which can see<br>  your front door***. And if it is at all possible, *make sure you<br>  install them high enough that they can't be reached from the ground<br>  without a ladder*. Officers have been known to cover security cameras<br>  when they arrive on your front porch, and *some of this activity is<br>  actually department policy.* They will actually stand in front of your<br>  doorbell camera to block that, so you can't rely on any camera which<br>  is physically at body level.<br>  - At the same time, if a police officer is talking to you at your<br>    door, *record them with your phone*. They have body cams, you<br>    need your own. You should always have two recordings going, your<br>    phone and your cameras. Maybe find a way to clip your phone to your<br>    shirt so that you can start a recording and then leave it to record.<br>    I was just poking around on Amazon, and I found this:<br><br>[[Amazon.com: Ghostek UNIVERSAL HOLSTER with 360-Degree Swivel Belt Clip<br>and Built-In Kickstand Designed to Fit Any Phone or Case up to 3.7-IN<br>Wide with Rubberized Sides to Keep Your Device Secure (2nd-Gen) (Black)<br>: Cell Phones &<br>Accessories](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ae41ac&url=https://www.amazon.com/Ghostek-UNIVERSAL-360-Degree-Kickstand-Rubberized/dp/B0BDTB5W3J){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>- - *(NOTE: This isn't an endorsement of this product, and there's no<br>    affiliate link here, but this is at least one product you can use to<br>    clip any phone to your shirt so you can have your own "body cam.")*<br>- Finally, if the police do manage to get a foot in the door, you must<br>  verbally tell them that you do not consent to any searches and, if<br>  they are questioning you, **you are under no obligation to talk to<br>  them**, and we recommend that beyond identification, you don't talk to<br>  them at all. That is the default position. Exercise your right to<br>  remain silent.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
