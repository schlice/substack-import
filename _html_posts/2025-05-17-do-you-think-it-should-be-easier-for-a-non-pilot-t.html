<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Herein lies the problem. You\'re never going to know that there is a<br>medical emergency, because the flight deck is locked from the inside.<br>Nobody is ever going to know that there is a medical emergency on the<br>flight deck, if both the pilot and the co-pilot are incapacitated. By<br>the time the rest of the flight crew realizes that there is a medical<br>emergency on the flight deck, the plane has already crashed.<br><br>This is why we have both a pilot and a co-pilot. Bear in mind, the<br>co-pilot is fully certified and capable of flying the aircraft all by<br>himself. The only thing he lacks is the hours needed to be considered a<br>pilot.<br><br>Take, for example, the Lufthansa plane which recently had a mid-air<br>medical issue on the flight deck. The pilot stepped out of the flight<br>deck to go to the washroom, and while he was there, the co-pilot passed<br>out. The pilot tried to regain access to the flight deck by calling the<br>co-pilot, and when that failed, the pilot entered the emergency override<br>code on the keypad outside of the flight deck door. At that time, the<br>copilot regained consciousness. The co-pilot was diagnosed with a<br>neurological condition and lost his pilot\'s license.<br><br>But the likelihood of both the pilot and the co-pilot suffering medical<br>emergencies at exactly the same time? Not very likely.<br><br>So do we really want to make it easier for average passengers to land a<br>commercial jumbo jet? No, that\'s an expenditure that really doesn\'t<br>pay dividends. We already have sufficient "two in the box\" redundancy<br>on the flight deck.<br><br>This is a solution in search of a problem.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
