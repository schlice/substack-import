<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'ll add the Military Police perspective.\<br>\<br>As Tim and Chris mentioned for police officers, military police must<br>also write pages of reports if a bullet is fired outside of the range.\<br>\<br>However, military police are issued weapons, magazines and bullets at<br>the beginning of each shift. Each bullet is stamped with a lot number.<br>These bullets *cannot* be fired unless you are shooting at someone,<br>on duty, for an authorized reason. These bullets are delivered to the<br>range at the end of their useful life, to be fired during normal range<br>operations. They are then replaced with new, stamped, bullets, and the<br>lot numbers issued are recorded when a military police officer checks a<br>weapon out of the armory.\<br>\<br>Accordingly, at random intervals, military police will be required to<br>block their ammo when they turn in their weapons at the end of a<br>shift. You are presented with an appropriatelly-sized 1x6 piece of wood<br>(colloquially known as *the block*) with either 30 holes or 120 holes,<br>depending on what weapon you were carrying (a military police officer<br>carrying an M9 carried two 15-round magazines holding a total of 30<br>rounds or an officer carrying an M-16 carried four 30-round magazines<br>for a total of 120 rounds). You must remove every round from your<br>magazines and place them nose-down in the block. The block of ammo is<br>then inspected by the armorer, and you will be held accountable for any<br>rounds that are not part of the same lot number that you were issued at<br>the beginning of your shift. Once your lot numbers were confirmed, you<br>had to re-load your mags. I was a SRT (Security Response Team) team<br>leader, and routinely carried an M-16. *Huge pain in the butt.*\<br>\<br>Of course, that didn\'t prevent you from buying your own ammo, emptying<br>your mag into your pocket, loading the mag with your own ammo and firing<br>them off, re-loading the government ammo in the mag and going on about<br>your day. Of course, this was illegal according to regulation, and<br>anyone found doing this would face severe penalties under<br>UCMJ.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
