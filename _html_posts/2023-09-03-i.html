<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When I left the Catholic church, I first became a United Methodist. The<br>Methodist church (at the time) was very rote and formulaic with their<br>services, but still espoused the Nicene Creed, so the transition away<br>from Catholicism was actually fairly easy.<br><br>But as others have said, just be ready for other Protestants to have<br>mixed (sometimes visceral) reactions to Catholic doctrines and<br>teachings. You can remind them that you don't believe those things,<br>hence the reason you left, so that they might settle down with that.<br><br>Other than that, know that you are doing what you are doing because<br>something told you that Catholicism is not what you believe. Follow that<br>truth. Study the Bible. Deepen your relationship with God. Create that<br>*personal* relationship that is not stressed in the Catholic church. And<br>remember that rituals don't save you. Eating or drinking doesn't save<br>you. Only repentance and belief in Christ saves you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
