<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I keep getting mail for someone that does not live in my home. I have<br>written \"return to sender\" on every mail piece but a lot of the<br>companies just resend the mail. Is there anything I can do to stop this<br>mail?**<br><br>Yes!<br><br>When writing "Return To Sender" stops working, or the senders won't stop<br>sending you mail, you have a number of options.<br><br>Your first option is to visit your local Post Office branch and fill out<br>a change of address card for them. You can't use the online form<br>because that requires a forwarding address. Simply fill out their name<br>and your address and then indicate "Moved, No Forwarding Address." Sign<br>it yourself, then write "Form filled in by current resident, \[your<br>name\], agent for the above." That last part is important, since you are<br>not the actual person in question. Hand the card to the postal worker,<br>or directly to the postmaster if you must. This should get the bulk of<br>the mail returned at the post office, before it ever gets to you.<br><br>If the problem is related to junk mail, you can address the issue<br>with the [[Direct Marketing<br>Association](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=716e0e&url=http://thedma.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="thedma.org"}]{.qlink_container} and sign up for their Mail<br>Preference Service.<br><br>> The DMA purposefully obfuscates how to sign up for it (and be warned,<br>> half of the links on their own site are circular or just don\'t work),<br>> but it\'s pretty simple. You can either register for an account and<br>> pay \$5 at<br>> [DMAChoice.org(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=66cfe2&url=https://www.dmachoice.org/index.php){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="dmachoice.org"}]{.qlink_container} to \"manage\" your bulk<br>> mail (which includes the option to stop it entirely) or you can send a<br>> letter/postcard to *Mail Preference Service, Direct Marketing<br>> Association, PO Box 643, Carmel, NY 15012-0643*. Include \"Activate<br>> Mail Preference Service\" in your note, and the other person\'s name,<br>> and your full address. Each request has to come from a single<br>> individual---just for kicks, make sure the letter is certified,<br>> preferably with return receipt, so they know that you know they got<br>> it. Each request is good for five years, after which it\'ll have to be<br>> renewed (hopefully everyone\'s records will be updated by<br>> then).\[1\](#WZrQn){#cite-WZrQn .citation_link}<br><br>If this doesn't work either, you can file a complaint with the<br>Postmaster at your local post office. Do this by writing a letter and<br>handing it to the Postmaster, or you may need to set up an appointment<br>to talk to them. You can file a [[Prohibitory<br>Order](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2c9a7b&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibitory_Order){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} against the mailer, which<br>if it is approved, would make it illegal for them to send you mail.<br><br>Also keep in mind, don't throw the person's mail away (unless it's just<br>junk mail). If it looks important, do continue to mark RTS on it and put<br>it back in your outgoing mail. I'm sure you'd want someone to do the<br>same for you if your mail was being incorrectly forwarded.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-WZrQn){.citation_index} [[How Can I Stop Getting Mail<br>Addressed to Someone<br>Else?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cc9250&url=https://lifehacker.com/how-can-i-stop-getting-mail-addressed-to-someone-else-1444875925){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="lifehacker.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
