The ATF was also the target of such criticism, being<br>accused of going after relatively minor gun charges while leaving the<br>"big fish" to operate freely. To counter this idea, **Project<br>Gunrunner** was born. The idea was to allow southern states to illegally<br>sell firearms to straw buyers so that they could track the guns to<br>Mexican drug cartel leaders and arrest them. The program hoped to block<br>the flow of firearms from the United States into Mexico by catching<br>straw purchasers in the US. One operation under the program was titled<br>Operation Fast and Furious when one of the straw purchasers they<br>were tracking was found to be a member of a car club.<br><br>They allowed over 2,000 firearms to "walk" under the program. They<br>eventually recovered 710 of those firearms. They did arrest a few straw<br>purchasers, but the firearms never made it up to big Mexican drug cartel<br>leaders, and none were ever arrested.<br><br>Worse, the guns found their way back into the United States. Guns from<br>the program were found on both sides of the US-Mexico border, being<br>responsible for the deaths of at least 150 Mexican civilians and a US<br>Border Patrol agent (Brian Terry).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
