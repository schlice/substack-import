<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Overhyped when compared to what?<br><br>The problem is that any comparison you do (Apple to PC, Apple to<br>Android, etc) is an apples-to-oranges comparison.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Let's take just one comparison to start with: Apple to Android.<br><br>Apple is a hardware company which produces a piece of specialized<br>smartphone hardware. They also make *value-added software* to run on<br>their specialized hardware.<br><br>Android is a software package produced mostly by Google and is<br>designed to run on many different hardware platforms.<br><br>You can't compare Apple to Samsung, because Samsung, while they do make<br>very good hardware, does not produce software to run on their hardware.<br>And no, you cannot compare TouchWiz to iOS, as TouchWiz is nothing more<br>than an overlay to Android, where iOS is a fully-encapsulated operating<br>system designed to exploit every single feature of Apple's hardware.<br>Android could never hope to accomplish such complete utilization of all<br>features of every piece of hardware on which it runs, as it is designed<br>to run on so many.<br><br>Let's look at Apple vs Microsoft.<br><br>Apple is a hardware company which also produces *value-added<br>software* to run on its hardware.<br><br>Microsoft is a software company, and its software is designed to run<br>on many different hardware platforms.<br><br>Starting to see the difference?<br><br>Apple charges premium prices for its hardware, and either bundles its<br>software or sells it for a nominal fee (Microsoft Office retails for<br>over \$100, while iWork can be purchased for roughly \$30, IIRC. Updates<br>to Microsoft Windows are well over \$100, while updates to OS X are<br>anywhere between free and \$30).<br><br>Apple makes money producing quality hardware, and then supplying the<br>software to run that hardware. Note that Apple's EULA also restricts the<br>running of that software on any other hardware other than Apple-branded<br>hardware. Microsoft makes money selling software, and doesn't really<br>care what hardware platform you run it on.<br><br>\<br><br>Now, of these two configurations, which one do you think will give you<br>the better overall user experience? The hardware designer that provides<br>value-added software, or the software designer who doesn't really care<br>what platform you run your software on?<br><br>Apple and \<everyone else\> are in two totally opposed universes.<br><br>TL;DR: There is no comparison.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
