<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Trump is accusing many Hispanics of having fraudulent birth<br>certificates and is refusing to renew their passports. Isn\'t the burden<br>of proof on him, and isn't this a violation of the due process clauses<br>of the Constitution\'s 5th and 14th Amendments?**<br><br>The State Department isn't changing its policy or the implementation of<br>its policies. This policy started under the Obama administration.<br><br>The official policy targets people whose birth certificates show they<br>were delivered by midwives near the southern border. Midwives have<br>historically been a very large source of fraudulent birth certificates,<br>claiming a child was born in the United States when they were actually<br>born in Mexico.<br><br>When the State Department sees a passport application from someone born<br>in the Rio Grande Valley accompanied by a birth certificate issued by a<br>suspected midwife, or applications which come from people who have both<br>a US and a foreign birth certificate, they often ask for supporting<br>information (which is very common in passport applications). In this<br>case, the supporting information may be information about your<br>childhood: what neighborhood you lived in as a child, what elementary<br>school you attended.<br><br>Denials are not a Constitutional rights issue. The rights protected<br>by the Constitution are *natural rights*, they exist simply because you<br>are human. You do not have a "right" to a passport. You must be a US<br>citizen in order to receive a passport, and you must establish positive<br>proof that you are a US citizen. It is not unconstitutional to prove<br>that you are a citizen by birth.<br><br>This problem is not an easy one to solve. It is nearly impossible to<br>tell if the birth certificate itself is fake, as they were all issued by<br>the state of Texas decades ago. It falls to supporting documentation to<br>help prove you were born in the United States, and not in Mexico.<br>Additionally, the midwives who issued fake birth certificates also<br>issued thousands of real ones, so it's nearly inevitable that some<br>actual US citizens are going to be swept up in the process. And<br>sometimes, you'll find the case of a US citizen who was denied a<br>passport because their supporting documentation didn't hold up to State<br>Department scrutiny. And once the media finds one or two of those,<br>[[they turn the issue into a<br>shitshow](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fe77bd&url=https://www.texastribune.org/2018/08/29/us-denying-passports-americans-along-border-throwing-their-citizenship/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="texastribune.org"}]{.qlink_container}. However, most of the<br>denials are reversed when supporting documentation is provided, and the<br>rest go to court and most are found in favor of the petitioner.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
