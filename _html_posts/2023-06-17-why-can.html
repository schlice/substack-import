<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm afraid that you're not quite understanding rights when you say that<br>you have a "right" to die.<br><br>Life is an *unalienable* right in the United States. That word<br>*unalienable* has a special definition. It means that no one can take<br>that right from you, not even you. *Even if you wanted to divest<br>yourself of your right to life*, you cannot do it. Your right to life<br>is, therefore, unalienable.<br><br>So do you have a "right" to die? In the United States, if you die<br>naturally, no one is charged with a crime, or violation of a law. But<br>anyone hastening a death or contributing to a death, *including you*,<br>could be subject to the law (depending on the action and the location).<br><br>This is why a terminally ill patient who can no longer sustain his own<br>life is never *killed*. They are only *removed from life support* and<br>are allowed to die naturally.<br><br>Big difference.<br><br>You may be *allowed* to die naturally, but you do not have "the right to<br>die," implying that you have the right to do anything you like in order<br>to make yourself die.<br><br>\<br><br>Beyond the legality of a "right to die" in the United States, asking the<br>question "why can't I just die" means you have a *desire* to die, but<br>your body will fight to stay alive, regardless of what you think you<br>want. So you can't "just die" as if your body is trying to die but some<br>external action is seemingly preventing you from naturally dying. I'm<br>pretty sure you are not a terminally ill patient typing on Quora with<br>your mind.<br><br>You are, instead, probably a person who has a *desire* to die and is<br>wondering why people won't let you.<br><br>And if that is the case, there is help.
