<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In many jurisdictions in the United States, while speed cameras may be<br>legal under state law, they are not used for general traffic monitoring.<br>They are used in very specific situations, such as school zones (which<br>are universally 20 mph) and some states will use them in construction<br>zones.<br><br>States vary on the legality of automated speed enforcement systems. **18<br>states and the District of Columbia** have passed laws that permit the<br>use of speed cameras. 9 states have passed laws that prohibit the<br>use of speed cameras. But even in the states where it is legally<br>permitted, it is generally seen as government overreach when they are<br>used for completely autonomous speed monitoring and ticketing.<br><br>Unlike in the UK, the US was founded on a healthy distrust of<br>government. Government only has the authority which it has been given in<br>the Constitution and nothing more. Americans, as a group, are generally<br>very wary of government overstepping its Constitutional bounds. We are<br>completely disinterested in having government tell us what is "for our<br>own good."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
