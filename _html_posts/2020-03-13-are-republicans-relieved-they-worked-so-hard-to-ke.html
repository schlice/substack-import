<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Are Republicans glad they worked so hard to keep President Trump in<br>office so that he could spectacularly bungle the government response to<br>Coronavirus?**<br><br>There are simply so many incorrect assumptions in this question that<br>it's hard to keep up:<br><br>1.  Republicans didn't have to lift a finger to keep Trump in office.<br>    Democrats are so spectacularly incompetent that they couldn't even<br>    impeach and remove from office when they had all the evidence right<br>    there in front of them. Democrats in the House can't find their own<br>    ass with two hands and a map.<br>2.  Trump's quick action in closing the border to inbound persons from<br>    China was the single biggest factor in the slower than average rate<br>    of infection in the United States, so "spectacularly bungle the<br>    government response" is *just slightly* inaccurate. To be fair, he<br>    did make some mistakes, and he did misspeak (on more than one<br>    occasion) but overall the Federal response has been pretty good. He<br>    can do more, and should do more (and every expert has unanimously<br>    said so), but what he has done to date really can't be accurately<br>    characterized as a "spectacular bungle."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
