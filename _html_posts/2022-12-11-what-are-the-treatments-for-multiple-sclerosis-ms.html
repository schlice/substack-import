<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Please note that we are discussing medications for MS, but treating the<br>disease is a holistic endeavor. There is far more than just medications<br>to "managing" the disease. For more information about managing MS, take<br>a look at [[all of the resources on the National MS Society's<br>website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1591de&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}. Medications are<br>just one part of that.<br><br>\<br><br>Currently, the best way to slow down the progression of the disease is<br>to use one of the approved MS therapy drugs. All of the therapy drugs do<br>the same thing:<br><br>- They slow the progression of the disease<br>- They increase the time between relapses<br>- They make relapses less severe and decrease the duration of relapses<br><br>The differences between the drugs have to do with the following:<br><br>- They have different levels of efficacy<br>- They have different methods of delivery<br>- They have different side effects<br><br>The drugs are delivered by one of three methods: *injection* (either<br>subcutaneous \SC\ or intra-muscular \IM\), *infusion*, or *oral*.<br>Between them, they have different *efficacies* (how well they work), and<br>they absolutely have different side effects. For example, the<br>injectables and the infusion drugs have better efficacy than the oral<br>drugs, but the oral drugs are easier to take (a daily pill, usually).<br>But these are all *high-risk medications*, as they can produce some<br>pretty serious (and in some rare cases, life-threatening) side effects.<br><br>And while for many people it's not an issue, for some it may be: the<br>drugs are also very costly, and some insurance plans may approve one<br>drug and not another.<br><br>A good list of MS therapy drugs can be found at the National MS<br>Soceity's website:<br><br>[https://www.nationalmssociety.or\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5c1ebd&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Medications){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Bottom line: talk with your neurologist about the treatment options<br>available in order to figure out which one is right for you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
