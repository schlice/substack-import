<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Now that the conspiracy between Trump and the Russians is revealed,<br>why is not a second impeachment forthcoming?**<br><br>You have to ask yourself this question: why now?<br><br>Why is all of this information coming to light now? Why wasn\'t any of<br>this information given to Robert Mueller during the Russia collusion<br>probe?<br><br>To answer that question, look at who this revelation would benefit the<br>most.<br><br>- *Who is putting this revelation forward?* Julian Assange.<br>- *Who benefits the most by this revelation?* Julian Assange.<br><br>So, is it more likely that Trump has engaged in a massive conspiracy<br>with Russia to hack the 2016 election, or is it more likely that Julian<br>Assange will say anything and everything that he possibly can in order<br>to prevent himself from being extradited to the United States?<br><br>If you have two explanations for a thing, and one explanation is wildly<br>out there, and one explanation is more likely, it is usually the more<br>likely explanation that is the correct one.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
