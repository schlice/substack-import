<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you pay for your health insurance out of your paycheck, then why<br>does your employer have any right telling you what services/medicine you<br>can get?**<br><br>Because you don\'t pay for all of your health plan.<br><br>In fact, you only pay for a very small portion of the cost of your<br>health plan. Your employer pays for the bulk of your plan. Your monthly<br>cost plus your copays and your coinsurance costs still don\'t add up to<br>even more than half of the total cost of your insurance plan.<br><br>Your employer pays for most of it, which is why it is offered as a<br>benefit to you. To that end, they can determine what services they will<br>cover.<br><br>To be clear, no one is telling you what services or medicine you can<br>get. If you can get it, you can get any service or medicine (some<br>require prescriptions and some require referrals). They are only telling<br>you which ones they will help pay for. You are free to get any other<br>service on your own, and pay the full retail cost out of your own<br>pocket.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
