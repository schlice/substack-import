<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the appropriate course of action to take after legally<br>shooting someone in self defense?**<br><br>First of all, this is a tragic, but incredibly rare case of a<br>perfect storm of problems.<br><br>- The homeowner did not disarm himself<br>- The homeowner was deaf and could not hear police verbal commands<br>- The person who called 911 (the homeowner's wife) failed to inform them<br>  that the homeowner was deaf. She also failed to inform the dispatcher<br>  that the situation was resolved and that there was no further<br>  shooting.<br><br>So while terribly tragic, it's unlikely that something like this could<br>happen to you if you defend yourself.<br><br>When police arrive, they have no idea what they're walking into.<br>They only know that there was a B&E (breaking and entering) with shots<br>fired. Are they walking into an active shooter scenario? Is there still<br>an active shooter present? Without context, they could be walking into<br>either the aftermath of a shooting, or an active shooting itself. So<br>since they don't know, they go in on high alert. They find an armed man<br>refusing to disarm (they, of course, don't know he's deaf). The man<br>refuses to follow verbal commands (of course he does, he can't hear<br>them), and apparently at one point makes a move which the officer<br>perceives to be threatening. The tragedies keep on coming.<br><br>So how do you make sure that you stay alive after you shoot someone in<br>self-defense? Well first of all, if you're deaf, try to have someone<br>hearing intercede on your behalf with the police. When lives are on the<br>line, it's probably your best option.<br><br>For everyone else:<br><br>*(and before we start, let's also narrow the scope down to a similar<br>scenario to the one asked: shooting an intruder in your own home)*<br><br>- If you are still holding a conscious suspect at gunpoint, **be<br>  prepared to put that gun down as soon as the police arrive.** If the<br>  suspect is unconscious, take this time to unload and lock open<br>  your firearm. You want the magazine out and the slide locked back. For<br>  revolvers, you want all the bullets out and the cylinder open. For<br>  shotguns, you want all ammunition out and the slide open. Lay the<br>  weapon down, out of everyone's reach. Ideally, the officers entering<br>  the home should reach your firearm first before they reach you.<br>- Have someone call 911. Answer all the dispatcher's questions, and<br>  **stay on the phone with the dispatcher until police arrive and the<br>  dispatcher tells you you can hang up.** Ensure the dispatcher knows<br>  that you are either holding someone at gunpoint or that the intruder<br>  has been disabled and the gun has been unloaded.<br>- When police arrive, **face away from the officers, raise your empty<br>  hands high, get down on your knees and interlock your fingers on top<br>  of your head.** Do this without being told. Don't worry, you'll be<br>  told anyway, but this is literally the only move you should be making.<br>  You will be detained, and you may quite possibly be placed in<br>  handcuffs. Remember that this is for everyone's safety, so don't freak<br>  out too badly. Believe me, even being in handcuffs *in training* is<br>  still scary, so I know that being in handcuffs will be incredibly<br>  frightening. You have to use logic to overcome the emotional response<br>  that you will no doubt have.<br>- Explain you are the homeowner/shooter, you were in fear for your life<br>  (or for someone else's life) and you fired on an intruder.<br><br>And that's it. Try not to say too much more. Identifying information<br>would be helpful (driver's license), but again, that's about all you<br>should be saying. They shouldn't be asking you much more other than<br>questions about securing the scene, as in "are there any more guns<br>around." If they start asking you more about what happened, simply say,<br>"I think it's best that I leave the rest of the details out until I've<br>had a chance to talk to my lawyer." This does not mean you are guilty of<br>any crimes. It just means that you know that in order to protect all of<br>your rights, you need an attorney, and the police are not there to set<br>you free. They are there to enforce the law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
