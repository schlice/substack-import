When the<br>elected representatives of the people fail to adequately represent the<br>people, the people retain the right to not vote for them again, and they<br>peacefully leave office. They don't get to stay in power forever. They<br>only get to stay in power as long as the people continue to vote for<br>them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
