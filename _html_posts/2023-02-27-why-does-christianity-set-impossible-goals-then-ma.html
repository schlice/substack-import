<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You make it sound like the "goals" were written by the people who<br>established the Christianity religion to try to force an agenda or<br>something.<br><br>The goals you're talking about were established by God. Jesus talked<br>about them in the Sermon on the Mount. Here's just a few examples:<br><br>> "You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'You shall<br>> not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' But I<br>> tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be<br>> subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister,<br>> 'Raca,' is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, 'You fool!'<br>> will be in danger of the fire of hell.<br>><br>> \...\<br>><br>> "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But<br>> I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already<br>> committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you<br>> to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to<br>> lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into<br>> hell. And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and<br>> throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than<br>> for your whole body to go into hell." --- Matthew 5:21--22,27--30 NIV<br><br>*WHAT???* If I'm angry with my brother, I'm going to hell? If I even so<br>much as *look* at a woman lustfully, I'm going to hell? And now He's<br>talking about self-mutilation??? No one can meet these standards!<br><br>And that's exactly the point.<br><br>No one can meet these standards. *On their own*. Without God, no one can<br>meet these standards. Christ gives us a way out, because on our own,<br>we're doomed. God's standards are just too high for us to achieve<br>without His grace and forgiveness.<br><br>Then you said that we "feel guilty" for not reaching them. And that's<br>true too. Our sin convicts us. We do feel bad about sin. It's part of<br>the process. It helps us understand when we have done something wrong<br>and we need forgiveness. In time, we learn to recognize the signs<br>*before* we sin. But it is a process; it's not instantaneous. The<br>process of *sanctification* is the process by which we are made, over<br>time, to be more like Christ.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
