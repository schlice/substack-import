<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Assault and battery are two separate offenses. But you don't get<br>"charged" with assault and battery, you get "sued" for assault and<br>battery.<br><br>Criminal assault includes both the assault (the threat of physical harm)<br>and the battery (the actual physical harm). "Assault" and "battery" (in<br>the jurisdictions which have these torts) are *civil* crimes, and so you<br>can be sued separately for assault, or for battery, or for both together<br>(which is where the term "assault and battery" comes from).<br><br>Remember, these crimes are state-level crimes, and they are not defined<br>equally across all of the states. This definition is only applicable to<br>the states which have assault and battery as separate torts, and don't<br>call their criminal assault crime "assault and battery."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
