<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [First of all, definitely take the deal, and don\'t worry<br>about the fact that you\'re going to impact the timeline and the future<br>to which she is returning will be radically different because of your<br>2050 laptop.\<br>\<br>You won\'t really be able to use the 2050 laptop in 2015, because none<br>of our infrastructure is tailored to support technology which hasn\'t<br>been built yet. So instead, you\'re going to take the 2050 laptop to<br>really smart computer people and sell it for almost as much as the<br>first-gen iPad Pro in the future, if not more. The tech guys will<br>dissect it and learn all sorts of new stuff about how to make<br>better/faster/smaller computers today. We will use that technology today<br>to make computers better. This will alter the future of computing, and<br>the future to which the time traveler returns will be very different<br>from the one she left, because computers have taken a giant leap<br>forward.\<br>\<br>(EDIT) I like what [[Mil<br>Ford](https://www.quora.com/profile/Mil-Ford)]{.qlink_container} said.<br>Figure out who made the chips and the computer. They\'re probably the<br>next Apple. Invest heavily in them while they are start-ups. Become<br>independently wealthy by 2050.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
