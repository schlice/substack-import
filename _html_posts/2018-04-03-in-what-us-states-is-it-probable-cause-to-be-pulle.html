<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In what US states is it probable cause to be pulled over for bearing a<br>Colorado license plate?**<br><br>None. Simply having an out-of-state registration does not constitute<br>reasonable suspicion for a traffic stop. Remember, officers need<br>reasonable suspicion for a stop, and probable cause for an *arrest*.<br><br>Now, if the officer patrols the same area routinely, and sees the same<br>vehicle with the same out-of-state registration for three months, this<br>would be reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle. New state residents<br>are required to register their vehicles generally within 60 days of<br>moving in to the state, so seeing the same out-of-state registration for<br>three months would cause suspicion.<br><br>Just as one example of an exception to the registration requirement:<br>military members stationed at a military facility are not automatically<br>state residents unless they choose to change their state of permanent<br>residency. This means they can retain their resident status in their<br>home state, even while stationed in another state. They can maintain<br>their home state driver's license, and their home state registration.<br>They can pay taxes in their home state instead of the state where they<br>are stationed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
