<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If Trump exhorts violence after he leaves office, will he be open to<br>federal prosecution?**<br><br>If by "exhorts violence" you specifically mean "inciting violence," then<br>any American citizen can be charged with this, even a former President.<br><br>However, that's a pretty high bar to meet. The standard the courts use<br>is called "imminent lawless action." This standard was developed in a<br>Supreme Court case called *Brandenberg v. Ohio*, and has come to be<br>known as the "Brandenberg test."<br><br>Under the imminent lawless action test, speech is not protected by the<br>First Amendment if the speaker intends to incite violence that is both<br>imminent and likely.<br><br>Imminent violence means violence in the very near future, or at least a<br>specified time. The imminence piece has been tested several times, and<br>making speeches calling for violence at some unspecified future time<br>does not amount to imminence, and therefore does not fall outside of<br>First Amendment protection. Likelihood has also been tested. Simply<br>calling for violence is protected by the First Amendment, It has to be<br>"likely" that violence would be triggered by the speech before it might<br>lose that protection.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
