<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You do not have the right to never be offended.<br><br>Lewis Napper, who ran for the Senate in Mississippi against Trent Lott,<br>penned a piece called the "Bill of No Rights" after listening to Hillary<br>Clinton on the radio in 1993. It is so commonsense and cool, I'll quote<br>it here. Take note of Article II.<br><br>Note that Lewis' website no longer exists. This piece was scoured from<br>Web Archives.<br>[Snopes(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=430a72&url=https://www.snopes.com/language/document/norights.asp){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="snopes.com"}]{.qlink_container} has an active page about it.<br><br>> We, the sensible of the United States, in an attempt to help everyone<br>> get along, restore some semblance of justice, avoid any more riots,<br>> keep our nation safe, promote positive behavior and secure the<br>> blessings of debt-free liberty to ourselves and our great-great-great<br>> grandchildren, hereby try one more time to ordain and establish some<br>> common sense guidelines for the terminally whiny, guilt-ridden<br>> delusional, and other liberal, commie, pinko bedwetters.<br>><br>> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that a whole lot of people<br>> were confused by the Bill of Rights and are so dim that they require a<br>> Bill of No Rights.<br>><br>> ARTICLE I<br>><br>> You do not have the right to a new car, big-screen color TV or any<br>> other form of wealth. More power to you if you can legally acquire<br>> them, but no one is guaranteeing anything.<br>><br>> ARTICLE II<br>><br>> You do not have the right to never be offended. This country is based<br>> on freedom, and that means freedom for everyone \-- not just you! You<br>> may leave the room, turn the channel, express a different opinion,<br>> etc., but the world is full of idiots, and probably always will be.<br>><br>> ARTICLE III<br>><br>> You do not have the right to be free from harm. If you stick a<br>> screwdriver in your eye, learn to be more careful, do not expect the<br>> tool manufacturer to make you and all of your relatives independently<br>> wealthy.<br>><br>> ARTICLE IV<br>><br>> You do not have the right to free food and housing. Americans are the<br>> most charitable people to be found, and will gladly help anyone in<br>> need, but we are quickly growing weary of subsidizing generation after<br>> generation of professional couch potatoes who achieve nothing more<br>> than the creation of another generation of professional couch<br>> potatoes.<br>><br>> ARTICLE V<br>><br>> You do not have the right to free health care. That would be nice, but<br>> from the looks of public housing, we\'re just not interested in public<br>> health care.<br>><br>> ARTICLE VI<br>><br>> You do not have the right to physically harm other people. If you<br>> kidnap, rape, intentionally maim or kill someone, don\'t be surprised<br>> if the rest of us get together and kill you.<br>><br>> ARTICLE VII<br>><br>> You do not have the right to the possessions of others. If you rob,<br>> cheat, or coerce away the goods or services of other citizens, don\'t<br>> be surprised if the rest of us get together and lock you away in a<br>> place where you still won\'t have the right to a big-screen color TV<br>> or a life of leisure.<br>><br>> ARTICLE VIII<br>><br>> You do not have the right to demand that our children risk their lives<br>> in foreign wars to soothe your aching conscience. We hate oppressive<br>> governments and won\'t lift a finger to stop you from going to fight<br>> if you\'d like. However, we do not enjoy parenting the entire world<br>> and do not want to spend so much of our time battling each and every<br>> little tyrant with a military uniform and a funny hat.<br>><br>> ARTICLE IX<br>><br>> You do not have the right to a job. All of us sure want you to have<br>> one, and will gladly help you along in hard times, but we expect you<br>> to take advantage of the opportunities in education and vocational<br>> training laid before you to make yourself useful.<br>><br>> ARTICLE X<br>><br>> You do not have the right to happiness. Being an American means that<br>> you have the right to pursue happiness \-- which, by the way, is a lot<br>> easier if you are unencumbered by an overabundance of idiotic laws<br>> created by those around you who were confused by the Bill of Rights.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
