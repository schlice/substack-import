Would it have any kind of<br>legal consequence?**<br><br>The answer, as with all legal questions, is "it depends."<br><br>Not all states criminalize sex where both participants are underage.<br>California and Michigan both do. In both states, both participants would<br>be guilty of underage sex with a minor.<br><br>But that is the exception rather than the rule. The general purpose of<br>statutory rape laws is to protect minors who cannot legally consent to<br>sex from adults who can. Therefore, most states, when faced with this<br>situation, would choose to not prosecute two minors.<br><br>In some states, there are "close in age" laws which require that the two<br>participants be a certain number of years apart in age before statutory<br>rape kicks in. These are commonly called "Romeo and Juliet" laws. In<br>those states, if one participant is 18 and the other is 17, they would<br>not be charged. However, if one was 17 and the other 25, the 25 year old<br>would likely be charged.<br><br>Finally, some states have no protections and no laws surrounding two<br>underage participants, and they struggle with how to handle it.
