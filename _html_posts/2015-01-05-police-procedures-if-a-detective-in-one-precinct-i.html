<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If the murders all happen within the jurisdiction of a<br>single agency (i.e. NYPD), and the agency is large enough to be<br>subdivided into precincts, the murder would be handled by the<br>specialized unit which handles murders: homicide. The specialized<br>departments are not subdivisions of the agency by geography; they cover<br>the entire agency.\<br>\<br>What becomes interesting is when a murder investigation crosses agency<br>borders, and even states. My dad was a detective in a precinct in Nassau<br>County, a suburb of New York on Long Island. He was a \"squad<br>detective\" which means he was a detective for the precinct, handling<br>local cases within the precinct which required detectives, but were not<br>part of a specialized detective unit (i.e. homicide, vice, SVU, etc).<br>While sitting on the \"squeal desk\" which is little more than a<br>rotating assignment to determine who gets assigned new incoming cases,<br>he caught a murder. Because the murder was his case, he was TA\'d<br>(temporarily assigned) to Homicide to work the murder. It was a very<br>long murder case which took months to investigate. The suspect traveled<br>up and down the East coast, committing murders along the way. New York<br>remained primary on the case, and when the suspect was eventually<br>arrested in Florida, dad flew down there to pick him up and extradite<br>him back to New York to stand trial.\<br>\<br>New York remained primary, as I recall, because the suspect had killed<br>more people in New York than anywhere else that he had visited. But he<br>worked with the detectives in every jurisdiction in which crimes were<br>committed. They all had claims on the suspect, as the suspect had<br>committed murders in all of those locations. But usually the<br>negotiations to determine who will be the primary prosecution for the<br>case occurs between the District Attorneys of the counties in which the<br>crimes took place. The DAs look at their evidence and decide amongst<br>themselves based on many factors (who has the strongest case, who is<br>willing to extradite, where is public outcry the greatest, who has the<br>laws to get the outcome the people want, etc).]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
