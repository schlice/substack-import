<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Until the minor turns 18, everything that happens to that<br>minor is the responsibility of the parent or legal guardian. Minors<br>cannot legally consent (or decline to consent) to any medical<br>procedure.\<br>\<br>This is because a minor is almost universally considered to be unable to<br>make well-reasoned decisions for himself/herself before age 18. Some may<br>be able to, most can\'t.\<br>\<br>Therefore, since a baby can\'t make a reasoned decision about what<br>happens to its own body, it\'s up to the parent/guardian to make that<br>decision for him.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
