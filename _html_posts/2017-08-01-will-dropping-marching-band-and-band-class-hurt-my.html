<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is "it depends."<br><br>Take a look at the [[Academy Admissions<br>website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60e33c&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container}. There's a<br>truckload of information on that site which explains how the admissions<br>process works. It says:<br><br>> *To gain admission to the United States Air Force Academy, you must<br>> strive to supply your best possible performance regarding each<br>> admissions requirement and at each application step. Your performance<br>> on all admissions factors combine to create your overall competitive<br>> standing amongst prospective students, or cadets, and may lead to an<br>> offer of appointment to the Academy.*<br>><br>> *A Selection Panel, composed of a cross section of senior Academy<br>> staff, reviews each completed admissions file according to our<br>> admissions guidelines. The quantitative admissions factors reviewed by<br>> the panel are your Weighted (Objective) Composite score, which is<br>> derived from your Academic Composite and Extracurricular Composite<br>> scores. The panel also evaluates qualitative components of your<br>> application to assess each candidate's motivation and potential for<br>> success at the Academy and future performance as an Air Force officer<br>> of character.*<br>><br>> *It is in this qualitative review that Character Assessment items such<br>> as your writing sample and Academy Liaison Officer Interview as well<br>> as your Fitness Assessment and everything else in the admissions file<br>> is considered in evaluating the "whole person." The assignment of a<br>> Selection Panel Rating to each file is the final step in the selection<br>> process and occurs as soon as your file is complete (note that your<br>> Medical Evaluation and your Nominations can still be pending). Your<br>> Selection Panel Rating combines with your other scores to derive your<br>> Selection Composite score.*<br>><br>> *Your scores are used to derive your overall competitive standing<br>> amongst applicants. Note that strong academic qualifications alone are<br>> not enough to make you competitive for appointment to the Academy.<br>> Conversely, if your academic qualifications are not extremely high,<br>> you may have the potential to become competitive through the remaining<br>> qualifying factors. The relative weighting of the scores that go into<br>> your overall competitive standing are:*<br>><br>> - *Academic Composite: 50%*<br>> - *Extracurricular Composite: 20%*<br>> - *Selection Composite: 30%*<br>><br>> *After review of the entire file, the selection panel will also make a<br>> qualitative/holistic recommendation on admission. This recommendation<br>> is considered along with the Selection Composite, the needs of the Air<br>> Force and any legislative requirements in selecting individuals for<br>> appointment.*<br><br>If you haven't done so, review that website. Check out the<br>[[Extracurriculur<br>Composite](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b8d301&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/the-application-process/extracurricular-activities/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} and what goes<br>into it. You may be able to drop band and still be okay in terms of your<br>EC score.<br><br>This would be a perfect question to ask your ALO. What, you don't have<br>an ALO yet? An ALO is an Admissions Liaison Officer who will guide<br>you through the entire admissions process. Check the [[ALO<br>Locator](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3baf43&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/outreach-programs/find-your-admissions-liaison-officer/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} on the admissions<br>website to find your ALO.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
