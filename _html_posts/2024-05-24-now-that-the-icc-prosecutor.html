<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br>has issued \[a request<br>for\] an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu, what will be the<br>possible outcomes? \Edited by moderator\]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In most cases, nothing.<br><br>If the warrant is granted, Netanyahu will not turn himself over. Israel<br>is not a party to the ICC (neither is Russia, China, or the US, by the<br>way). But *in theory,* if Netanyahu were to travel to one of the 124<br>countries that did sign on to the ICC, they would have to arrest him and<br>extradite him to the court for trial, which is in The Hague. Doing so<br>would be a politically fraught move and we wonder if it would actually<br>happen. I bet Netanyahu wouldn't tempt fate though, and would just steer<br>clear of those countries.<br><br>Israel can send a delegation to the ICC to challenge the charges against<br>Netanyahu, and they may do that.<br><br>The move would also weaken the ICC in the eyes of the world, as it would<br>put Netanyahu on par with other world leaders who have open arrest<br>warrants from the ICC against them, such as Russian President Vladmir<br>Putin, and the late Colonel Muammar Gaddafi of Libya. Putin faces an<br>arrest warrant for the unlawful deportation and transfer of children<br>from Ukraine to Russia. Before he was killed by his own people,<br>Gaddafi's arrest warrant was for murder and persecution of unarmed<br>civilians. While it may not be attractive company for Netanyahu, the<br>circumstances are vastly different. The perceived equation by the ICC<br>won't be looked at favorably on the world stage.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
