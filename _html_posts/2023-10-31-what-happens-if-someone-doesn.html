<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The homeowner would receive a communication from the HOA advising them<br>that they missed a dues payment. This would be through whatever<br>communication method was agreed upon by the homeowner and the HOA, and<br>is authorized in the Governing Documents and state law. It could be a<br>letter in postal mail, or it could be email.<br><br>If they do not pay, they will continue to accumulate late fees along<br>with the past due dues, and the HOA will continue to try to communicate<br>with the homeowner, at this point usually trying multiple communication<br>methods (phone calls, paper letters, emails, etc).<br><br>When the unpaid dues plus late fees go on long enough (or when they<br>exceed state-mandated minimums), the account gets turned over to the HOA<br>attorney to attempt to collect. The attorney will continue to tack on<br>the late fees as well as the past due dues, but they will also add<br>attorney's fees on to that total.<br><br>When the unpaid dues plus late fees plus attorneys fees goes on long<br>enough (or when the amount exceeds state-mandated minimums), the<br>attorney can place a lien on the property for the amount of the unpaid<br>money.<br><br>Once they've all had enough, they can foreclose on that lien and sell<br>the house out from under the homeowner to collect what they are owed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
