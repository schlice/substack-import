<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Legally, there is no distinction. "Driving" is a colloquial term for<br>"operating a motor vehicle," which is the technical and legal term.<br><br>The person operating the motor vehicle is legally known as the "driver"<br>and the other people inside the car are known as "passengers." But<br>"driving" is nothing more than a colloquial term for what the operator<br>of the vehicle does.<br><br>We tend to say that a person is "driving a car" when they are operating<br>it, and the passengers are "riding in a car" when they are simply in the<br>other occupant positions which are not the driver's position. But the<br>person sitting in the operating position causing the car to move under<br>its own power is the "driver" and is "operating a motor vehicle."<br><br>In all states in the United States, you must be licensed to operate a<br>motor vehicle. Colloquially, you must be licensed to drive a motor<br>vehicle.<br><br>It is only sovereign citizen types who try to draw a distinction between<br>"driving" and "operating a motor vehicle." In reality, there is no legal<br>distinction in any state law of which I am aware.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
