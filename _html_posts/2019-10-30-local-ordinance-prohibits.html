<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Local ordinance prohibits \"habitual dog barking\". I have talked with<br>the owners (per recommendation) and correctly documented cases where the<br>barking woke me up, startled me, etc. Should I have my neighbor\'s dogs<br>taken away from them? Or?**<br><br>Contact your local police department's Code Enforcement division, and<br>let them handle it. It's not for you to "have your neighbor's dogs taken<br>away from them" since local law generally does not include that as a<br>punishment for violating noise ordinances, or for habitual dog barking,<br>unless some form of animal abuse or cruelty is involved.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
