<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can I legally have a ring doorbell installed outside of my apartment<br>door if I have other neighbors?**<br><br>Yes you can! If you can look out of your peephole and see your<br>neighbors, you can install a Ring cam and see them, too.<br><br>But I wouldn't install a standard Ring cam, because it risks damaging<br>the door or siding. You'd have to get permission for that, and there's<br>no guarantee they'd let you.<br><br>However, Ring to the rescue!<br><br>[[Video Doorbell for<br>Peepholes](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f4aa01&url=https://smile.amazon.com/Ring-Peephole-Cam-doorbell-installation/dp/B07WHMQNPC){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>This device is a Ring Peephole Camera. It replaces the existing peephole<br>in your apartment door. No drilling required, no damage to the door.<br>Instructions and tools are included which assist you with removing your<br>existing peephole and replacing it with the Ring peephole cam.<br><br>The Ring Video Doorbell for Peepholes has the following features:<br><br>- Upgrade your door's peephole with a 1080p HD video doorbell that<br>  enables you to see, hear, and speak to visitors from anywhere.<br>- Get alerts on your phone, tablet, and PC when anyone knocks on your<br>  door, presses the doorbell button, or triggers the motion sensors.<br>- Peephole Cam is easy to install and comes with all the tools you need<br>  to replace your peephole in under 5 minutes; no wiring or drilling<br>  required.<br>- Connect your Ring camera with Alexa then enable announcements to be<br>  alerted when motion is detected. Talk to visitors through compatible<br>  Echo devices by saying "Alexa, talk to the front door".<br>- Adjustable Motion Detection lets you easily adjust the built-in motion<br>  sensors to focus on and detect what's important to you.<br>- Always know when you have a delivery and tell the courier to place<br>  your packages in an ideal location.<br>- Includes Theft Protection: if your Peephole Cam gets stolen, we'll<br>  replace it for free.<br>- Oh, and it still functions as a standard peephole.<br><br>Two great things to point out: Door Knock detection, and Theft<br>Protection. Door knock detection means that if someone ignores the<br>camera and just knocks on your door (no one has ever used the knocker on<br>my peephole in my apartment), the Ring cam will still notify you that<br>someone is knocking on your door. Additionally, you still have motion<br>alerts for the Amazon drivers who just drop a package on your doorstep<br>without knocking (happens all too frequently).<br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE: As always, check your lease agreement to see what is<br>allowed and what is not. Most lease agreements allow you to make<br>modifications as long as you can revert the changes when you leave, and<br>the modification does not damage the facility or you will be liable for<br>the repair cost. In my last complex, we could change out our deadbolt<br>and replace it with a smart deadbolt if we chose, but we'd have to put<br>it back when we were done, and the landlord would still need a key. We<br>could also change out our peephole if we wanted to, with the same<br>caveats. Our maintenance guys were cool too; when I changed out my<br>peephole, the door paint was off underneath. They gave me a small<br>container (less than a pint) of door-colored paint to touch up the spots<br>around the original door knocker/peephole that I removed. No damage,<br>door looked great, happy happy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
