<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is it the police are permitted to take people\'s lives? It is not<br>the job of the police to inflict punishment on people.**<br><br>*(US answer only)*<br><br>Because in the United States, police officers have the same right to<br>self-defense as any citizen does.<br><br>Despite what you see in the media, police in general are not just out<br>there indiscriminately killing people. Police, on average, kill about<br>1000 people per year, the vast majority of those people are armed, and<br>nearly all of them pose a threat to the officer of death or grave bodily<br>harm.<br><br>Remember, just because a person is not armed with a weapon does not mean<br>that they do not pose a risk of death or grave bodily harm to the<br>officer.<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being<br>isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I<br>wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is<br>un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m<br>wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,<br>not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,<br>you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.<br>Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be<br>followed by a block and a mute. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
