<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The problem with your question is that you are both asking a question<br>and making a statement at the same time.<br><br>It's like the prosecutor asking the defendant, "When did you stop<br>beating your wife?"<br><br>Literally, the only thing you can conclusively say about Christianity is<br>that it is the *largest* religion in terms of followers, with 31% of<br>the world's population, or 2.382 billion. The next most populous<br>religion is Islam with 24.9% of the world's population, or 1.907<br>billion.<br><br>Calling it "the superior religion" is a matter of opinion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
