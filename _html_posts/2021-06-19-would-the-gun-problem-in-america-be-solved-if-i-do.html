<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Nope.<br><br>Because there is always *that person* who won't participate.<br><br>And then *he's the only one with a gun, because you voluntarily decided<br>to disarm yourself.*<br><br>At this point, there is no one fix that will "solve the 'gun problem' in<br>America" (if you even believe that America has a "gun problem") because<br>there are simply too many guns out there. Literally, there are almost<br>400 million guns in the US alone. Just having you and I voluntarily<br>disarm won't solve anything.<br><br>It might make *you* feel better, but if that's all it takes, then *you*<br>can voluntarily choose to disarm yourself, and leave me to my choices,<br>since my choices don't impact you in the slightest.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Would the gun problem in America be solved if I don\'t carry a gun and<br>you don\'t carry a gun?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
