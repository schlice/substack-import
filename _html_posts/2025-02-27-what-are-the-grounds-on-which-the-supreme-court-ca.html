<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Silly question by the silly Quora Prompt Generator. Silly silliness.<br><br>*Nixon v. US* ruled that the courts have no jurisdiction over the<br>impeachment process, primarily because impeachments are a *political*<br>process, not a *legal* process.<br><br>I can understand why the confusion sometimes happens. When a President<br>is tried in the Senate, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presides<br>over the trial. And it does give the appearance of being very<br>*legal-esque,* what with a prosecutor and a defense, and the<br>Constitution calling it a *trial*. But make no mistake, impeachment is<br>nothing more than a political process to remove an elected official from<br>office.<br><br>And while impeachment is reserved for "high crimes and misdemeanors,"<br>which certainly reads like the accused violated laws (and up until<br>Trump's impeachment in his first term, it was), the accused does not<br>need to actually violate a law in order to be impeached. Just ask Trump.<br>In fact, it was another former president, Gerald R. Ford, nearly a half<br>century ago, while he was still in the House during his 1970 attempt to<br>impeach U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, who said "\a<br><br>impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of<br>Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history." Ford<br>later became vice president and then president after President Richard<br>Nixon resigned rather than face impeachment himself.<br><br>So given that there is no clear delineation of what is impeachable and<br>what is not, it becomes clear that the impeachment process is entirely<br>political, and not judicial. Therefore, the courts have no jurisdiction<br>over the impeachment process.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
