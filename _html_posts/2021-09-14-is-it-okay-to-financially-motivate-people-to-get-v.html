<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer to whether or not it is okay depends on how you go about<br>motivating people to get vaccinated.<br><br>For example, it is perfectly acceptable to offer financial *incentives*<br>to get vaccinated. If you want to offer someone a \$100 gift card to<br>your local retailer to get the jab, this is perfectly acceptable.<br><br>But if your definition of financial motivation includes whether your<br>vaccination status determines whether or not you get to keep your job,<br>we have now moved into an area which I would consider to not be<br>acceptable. If it is legal to be unvaccinated, it should be legal to<br>allow you the choice to remain unvaccinated. If social distancing and<br>masks work, then your employer should force you to do those if you<br>choose to remain unvaccinated, and if it at all possible, they should<br>isolate you from other employees.<br><br>If a company, for example, wants to offer you a discount on your health<br>insurance premiums if you are vaccinated, this is perfectly acceptable.<br><br>Similarly, it would also be acceptable, but not advisable, for a company<br>to raise health insurance premiums for those who are unvaccinated. This<br>particular route of financial motivation tends to ignore the fact that<br>natural immunity following infection is a valid form of immunity.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it okay to financially motivate people to get vaccinated against<br>Covid-19?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
