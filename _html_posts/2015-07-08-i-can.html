<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You have what\'s called a [[foot<br>fetish](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5bffc2&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_fetishism){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}.\<br>\<br>First of all, it\'s not abnormal. It\'s not gross. It\'s a fetish. Some<br>guys are boob guys (I\'m a boob guy). Some guys are butt guys. You\'re a<br>foot guy.\<br>\<br>But just because I\'m a boob guy doesn\'t mean I don\'t consider a woman<br>as a whole, or only talk to her because she has attractive boobs (notice<br>I said \"attractive:\" not all boobs are attractive, and bigger is not<br>necessarily better). It\'s just a part of the female anatomy that I<br>happen to really (really) like.\<br>\<br>Please don\'t feel bad about your fetish. Elvis Presley was a foot guy;<br>[[Quentin<br>Tarantino](https://www.quora.com/topic/Quentin-Tarantino-3)]{.qlink_container}<br>is also a foot guy.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
