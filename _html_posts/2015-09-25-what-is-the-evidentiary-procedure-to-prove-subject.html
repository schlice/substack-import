There is<br>only evidentiary procedure to prove objective intent.\<br>\<br>In contract law, subjective intent will only prevail over objective<br>intent if that personal meaning was known to the other party. Hidden<br>beliefs or reservations are usually not taken into account when the<br>other party knew what the intent was.\<br>\<br>Usually, the objective intent (such as a signed contract) will prevail.\<br>\<br>*Updated question: What is the evidentiary procedure to prove subjective<br>intent in Criminal Law?*\<br>\<br>The \"reasonable person\" standard is what is normally used in most<br>court systems in the world to determine intent.\<br>\<br>See [[Intention (criminal<br>law)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bc482d&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention_%2528criminal_law%2529){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} for more<br>information.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
