<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Since the commonly suggested remedy to criminal activity is more law<br>enforcement, would it be appropriate to allow properly trained concealed<br>carry licensed individuals to be considered volunteer law enforcement<br>officers?**<br><br>The answer is yes. Although we don't call them volunteer law enforcement<br>officers. We call them Auxilliary Police or Reserve Deputies.<br><br>We have them today. Here's [[a job<br>description](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=596b88&url=https://www.epcsheriffsoffice.com/sites/default/files/assets/Documents/Volunteer/Reserve_Deputy.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="epcsheriffsoffice.com"}]{.qlink_container} for a Reserve<br>Deputy in El Paso County, Colorado.<br><br>The problem: we don't have enough of them.<br><br>We have a very limited number of Reservists in each class. Out of 100 or<br>so applicants for a particular class (we can only hold one or two per<br>year), after testing and background checks and interviews and all of the<br>other evaluations, we end up with about 12 Reserve Deputy Designees in a<br>class.<br><br>The Reserves get about 300 hours of training before being sworn. This<br>includes 50 hours of firearms, 40 hours of driving, 40 hours of arrest<br>control, and the rest is classroom time and other training activities.<br>This is on par with full-time deputies in terms of content, but<br>abbreviated to match the job description. The difference: since<br>Reservists are volunteer and have full time jobs, they do their training<br>during nights and weekends. The training, therefore, takes about five<br>months.<br><br>It's not an easy program, and it's most certainly not for everyone, but<br>it does exist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
