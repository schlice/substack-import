<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it true that if you are a student at a military academy but<br>discovered that you would rather be commissioned to a different branch<br>(e.g. you are at USNA but you want to go to the USAF), you can simply<br>choose to switch? Don\'t you need approval**?<br><br>There is indeed a program by which cadets at one military academy can<br>"cross-commission" to another military branch. Each service has its own<br>process by which cadets can be commissioned in another military branch,<br>but there is usually a one-for-one swap between the services, and it<br>must be approved by both services (the gaining and losing service).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
