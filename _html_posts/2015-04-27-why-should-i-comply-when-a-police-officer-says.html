<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The law requires that you comply with the lawful<br>directives of a peace officer. There isn\'t one single jurisdiction I<br>know of that doesn\'t have a law which requires you to comply with the<br>lawful directives of the peace officers in that jurisdiction.\<br>\<br>So why should you comply? Because it\'s against the law to not comply.<br>That\'s the simplest reason. If you fail to comply, you can be charged<br>with a crime and you can go to jail. I think that\'s a pretty simple and<br>direct reason right there, and it alone should be reason enough.\<br>\<br>If you should need more reasons, here are some other reasons why it\'s<br>in your best interest to comply:\<br>]<br><br>1.  Officers would order you to the ground because there is an ongoing<br>    situation in which the officer determines he needs to place you in<br>    *the position of disadvantage.* In order to neutralize a perceived<br>    threat (and it only needs to be his perception of a threat, not<br>    yours), he can order you to move to a position in which you are no<br>    longer a threat. This can both eliminate you as a threat, and make<br>    obvious those who are still a threat (i.e. the ones still standing).<br>    So if you want to remain the focus of the officer\'s undivided<br>    attention, remain standing when you are told to get down.<br>2.  How quickly you comply determines your *level of compliance* in the<br>    eyes of the officer. I can guarantee you that for most peace<br>    officers, you will be treated with the same level of respect and<br>    compliance you show the officer. There are always exceptions, but<br>    for the vast majority of peace officers out there, you will be<br>    treated with the same level of respect that you show. Understand<br>    that these situations are volatile and require the highest level of<br>    compliance to ensure everyone\'s safety.<br>3.  If you have issues with the way an officer conducts himself/herself<br>    during an incident, you have many legal remedies to deal with that.<br>    NOT ONE of those remedies takes place at the scene. Your best rule<br>    of thumb: do what you are told to do and then report the officer\'s<br>    behavior later on.\<br><br>I just read an article in a police magazine (online) which posted a<br>video of an officer who hesitated when he was confronted with a<br>life-and-death situation. This officer could have been the most recent<br>death in an officer-involved shooting. In this particular situation, the<br>mentally-unstable individual suddenly and inexplicably became compliant<br>and was safely taken into custody. Would the officer have been<br>completely within his rights to shoot the suspect? Absolutely. Would the<br>officer have faced the numerous questions about whether or not he should<br>have? Most likely. Did the most recent uptick in scrutiny of<br>officer-involved shootings play into his decision to not shoot? We<br>don\'t know the answer to that. Will this indecision because of<br>increased scrutiny cost an officer his life in the future? Probably. And<br>that trend is worrying.\<br>\<br>This is why officers *need* your complete, immediate compliance with<br>their directives. *It will save lives, and NOT just yours!*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
