<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Good luck lying to the police about your identity. Report<br>back to us after you try it (and after you get out of jail).\<br>\<br>For everyone else, lying to the police about your identity is illegal.<br>The crime is called obstruction of justice in most jurisdictions,<br>but it does have a few other names. Ask any lawyer in any district<br>attorney\'s office if you believe my statements may be in error.\<br>\<br>The police can (and often do) jail suspects who refuse to provide their<br>real identities. Once incarcerated, they can use all of your personal<br>effects confiscated from you to attempt to determine your true<br>identity.\<br>\<br>So like I said, go ahead and try to lie to the police about your<br>identity. Let us know how that works out for you.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-it-illegal-to-cyberbully-people/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
