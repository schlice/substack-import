<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is local or state law enforcement allowed to listen to your<br>conversations and read your text messages on your phone without you<br>knowing it?**<br><br>Yes.<br><br>In order to do this, they must have a *warrant*. And in order to get a<br>warrant, they must have enough probable cause to convince a judge that<br>they need to listen to your conversations and read your text messages in<br>order to get the evidence they need to send you to jail.<br><br>Not even the cell phone companies will allow them to listen to your<br>phone calls or read your text messages unless they produce that warrant.<br>If they are conducting targeted investigations, sometimes they will use<br>a StingRay interception device, but those are more rare. Routinely, they<br>will go to the phone company with their warrant.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
