<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Nobody can justify their belief without evidence. Belief without<br>evidence is what we call "blind faith."<br><br>That said, your "for instance" is not an example of belief without<br>evidence. You are under the mistaken impression that the only type of<br>evidence which is relevant is scientific evidence. In other words,<br>the only type of evidence you're looking at is evidence which can be<br>proven with an experiment: something you can see, hear, touch, etc.<br><br>But that's a bit illogical, no? If God exists, then He is necessarily<br>immaterial, as He created the material, and so can't be a part of it.<br>Therefore, you're not going to find material evidence of God. You're not<br>going to find God's footprint, or one of God's hairs.<br><br>However, there is more evidence than just physical evidence.<br>*Philosophy* is the realm where we deal with understanding truths<br>beyond the physical. But this isn't the "philosophy" which deals with<br>people's opinions. This is the "philosophy" which is *finding the truth<br>through logic, evidence, and science.*<br><br>And using *those* proofs, we can prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that<br>a creator God exists.<br><br>So there's plenty of proof out there. The disconnect is whether or not<br>you will actually *accept* the evidence provided.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
