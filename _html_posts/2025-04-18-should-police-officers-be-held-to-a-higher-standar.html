<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No. They should be held to the same standard as anyone else with a<br>firearm. Either change the standards for everyone, or change them for no<br>one.<br><br>There is nothing special about a police officer's firearms that<br>distinguishes them from the firearms of any other citizen. Even their<br>rifles which may even be fully automatic, are not firearms which cannot<br>be owned by any civilian (at great cost, but still possible).<br><br>Everyone needs to practice good firearms safety at home, and the level<br>of security within the home needs to be tailored to the people in that<br>home who have access to those firearms.<br><br>Nothing special here for police officers.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
