<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**When the ACA went before the Supreme Court, the court ruled that<br>Congress can govern individual health actions because of their economic<br>consequences. What stops Congress from regulating any choice because of<br>the economic consequences?**<br><br>In actuality, the Court did not find what you state. Quite the opposite,<br>actually. In *National Federation of Independent Businesses v. Sebelius<br>(2012)*, the court found that the individual mandate, which required all<br>persons to buy health insurance or pay a penalty, was outside of<br>Congress\' powers under the Commerce Clause. Therefore, the economic<br>consequences of *not buying health insurance* was not something that<br>Congress was authorized to control using the Commerce Clause as<br>justification.<br><br>SCOTUS *did* find, however, that the individual mandate *was*<br>Constitutional under Congress' *taxation powers*. SCOTUS used the<br>oft-cited "if it walks like a duck" logic to support their findings:<br><br>- The penalty was collected by the IRS<br>- The penalty was calculated on an IRS Form 1040<br>- The penalty was paid along with taxes, on Tax Day<br>- Congress can, and does, frequently use taxes to control public<br>  behavior<br><br>See where this is going?<br><br>While the government could call the individual mandate a "penalty" if<br>they chose, the Court determined that it was actually a tax, and<br>therefore was Constitutional under Congress' taxation authority. In<br>other words, it's collected by the IRS, it is collected on Tax Day, it's<br>reported on your 1040, so you can call it a penalty if you want, but<br>it's really a tax.<br><br>So to answer the second part of your question:<br><br>**What stops Congress from regulating any choice because of the economic<br>consequences?**<br><br>Nothing. They just do it with taxes under their taxation power, not with<br>"penalties" under the Commerce Clause.<br><br>Take, for example, cigarettes. Congress has imposed *massive* taxes on<br>tobacco and tobacco products in order to discourage their use. States do<br>this too: most states have a higher tax on drinks which contain refined<br>sugar than on other drinks. Governments do this to attempt to regulate<br>behavior when it is in the public interest to do so. But it happens all<br>the time, just not in the way you're suggesting.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
