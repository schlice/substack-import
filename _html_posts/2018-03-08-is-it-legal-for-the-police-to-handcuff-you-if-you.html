<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it legal for the police to handcuff you if you are not yet placed<br>under arrest or if there is no evidence to justify an arrest?**<br><br>Absolutely. There is a difference between being "detained" and being<br>"under arrest."<br><br>They will usually also say something along the lines of, "You are not<br>under arrest, I am merely detaining you for your safety and for mine<br>while I \<*go do x y and z over there and can't watch you\>*. Now sit<br>right here and don't move."<br><br>Handcuffs do not imply "arrest." They do imply "detention." Those two<br>words mean different things.<br><br>For example, while you're handcuffed and you can't leave, can the<br>officer ask you questions without Mirandizing you? The answer is no,<br>because it would be considered "custodial interrogation," and you would<br>need to be informed of your Miranda rights before being questioned.<br><br>So while you may be "detained," which simply means you are not free to<br>leave, you are not "under arrest," which means the officer has<br>reasonable suspicion to believe that you committed a crime, and you are<br>being detained for that crime.<br><br>**TL;DR: Courts have ruled that it is legal to handcuff you while you<br>are detained, even if you are not under arrest.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
