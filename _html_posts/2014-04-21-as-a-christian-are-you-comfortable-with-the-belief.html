<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Larry\'s answer is superb. Rather than mess with the<br/>beauty of it, I\'d like to re-phrase the whole \"fires of Hell\" thing.<br/>I believe that a fair definition of Heaven is \"living immersed in the<br/>full grace, love, and presence of God\" and Hell is \"living in the<br/>absolute void and absence of God and His love.\"\<br/>\<br/>Heaven would be like having all of your senses immediately multiplied<br/>tenfold and getting seven or eight new senses, and Hell would be like<br/>living in an empty apartment, having all of your senses immediately<br/>dulled, and losing your hearing too. No sunlight, just a single<br/>lightbulb in the ceiling. No windows, no tech, no nothing. Forever<br/>alone. Can you live that way? Certainly you can, but it\'s no way to<br/>live. You will find that living in the absence of God\'s love is<br/>torture. You may as well be on fire.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
