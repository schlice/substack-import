Do I open fire since I fear for my life?**<br><br>The first part of the sentence ("As a white female police officer") is<br>completely irrelevant. Let's just replace that with, "As a citizen of<br>the United States," because that's the only qualification that matters.<br><br>Now as for the rest, it depends on which state you're in. For most<br>states with a strong "Castle Doctrine," the answer is you confront the<br>individual with the threat of deadly force. If they don't comply, you<br>use whatever force you must to stay safe.<br><br>Does your state have a strong Castle Doctrine?
