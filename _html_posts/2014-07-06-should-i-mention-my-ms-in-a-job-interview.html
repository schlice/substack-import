<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Legally, you are under no obligation to reveal your<br/>medical condition to your prospective employer until you require<br/>accommodations. At that point, you will be telling them you have a<br/>disability and what accommodations you need and as long as they are<br/>reasonable, there should be no problem. Reasonable accommodations are<br/>ones that can be provided without undue fiscal stress on the employer or<br/>modifying the requirements of the job. For instance, if you require that<br/>you have to only work 2 hours a day, that would be an unreasonable<br/>accommodation because there is a good chance you would not be getting<br/>the job done. You can miss work for doctor\'s appointments incident to<br/>your disability, but if you miss work so much that your job is not being<br/>accomplished, this accommodation could become unreasonable.\<br/>\<br/>The Americans with Disabilities Act is very clear about this point. Your<br/>employer is only allowed to ask you whether or not you can<br/>\"\...complete the essential functions of the job with or without<br/>reasonable accommodations\" to wit you can answer yes or no. They cannot<br/>dig any further. For instance, if the job requires that you stand for 8<br/>hours a day and you can\'t do that, your medical condition may make you<br/>ineligible for that job. If the job requires that you be able to lift<br/>100 pounds and you can\'t do that, your medical condition may make you<br/>ineligible for that job. The employer is required to state up-front the<br/>physical requirements of the job, and you are required to tell them<br/>whether or not you can do them, yes or no. Additionally, they are<br/>allowed to do pre-employment testing of these requirements. Your medical<br/>history and current medical treatments are also confidential and are not<br/>allowed to be released to your employer without your consent.\<br/>\<br/>And by the by, there is nothing \"wrong\" with you. You have a<br/>disability. Doesn\'t mean you can\'t do the job. Ultimately, that\'s all<br/>that matters.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
