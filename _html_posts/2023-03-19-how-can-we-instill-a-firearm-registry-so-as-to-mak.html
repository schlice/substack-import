<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You\'ll have better luck deleting the Constitution and installing a<br>monarchy. But let\'s review anyway.<br><br>To implement a firearms registry, you\'ll need to first repeal federal<br>law: the Firearm Owner's Protection Act of 1986, which prohibits the<br>Federal government from maintaining a national firearms registry.<br><br>But before you repeal the law, you\'ll need to explain the benefit of<br>such a registry. You\'ll need to show how such a registry would prevent<br>crime.<br><br>Finally, you\'ll have to identify all the current gun owners without<br>violating their rights. Good luck getting them all to come forward<br>voluntarily. There are some records of some gun purchases from FFLs who<br>went out of business and turned their Form 4473s over to the ATF, but<br>that only shows the first registered owner of record. If the gun was<br>sold privately since then, there would be no record of where it went.<br>Similarly, if the gun was lost or stolen, those records would also be<br>useless.<br><br>The truth of the matter is that very few criminals who use guns bought<br>them legally. The vast majority of criminals bought their guns from<br>unscrupulous FFLs who "conveniently lose paperwork," or guns illegally<br>transported and sold with no paperwork at all. Some crimes are committed<br>with legally purchased firearms which have been stolen, and a registry<br>still does no good in this case. Finally, nearly all of the mass<br>shooters who were mentally unstable passed all background checks.<br><br>And what sort of \"monitoring\" would you find acceptable? A drone that<br>follows a gun owner around 24x7? That doesn\'t seem a little intrusive<br>to you?<br><br>And that doesn\'t even address why you think conservatives are<br>overwhelmingly criminals. I\'d love to see your statistics on that. I<br>think that says more about you than about criminals.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
