They are not bound by time and space, as we are. We<br>are bound by time and space. We have the ability to "re-think" our<br>decisions, because we have been given *time* to do so.<br><br>Angels, being spiritual beings and not being bound by space and time, do<br>not have this luxury. When an angel rejects God, it is a definitive,<br>complete rejection of his sovereignty. There's no going back from that<br>decision, and they wouldn't want to, anyway.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>According to the Bible, why can\'t Satan and the fallen angels repent<br>and be forgiven by God like human sinners can?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
