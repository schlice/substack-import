<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**So the Republican heavy Supreme Court just blocked the release of<br>parts of the Mueller report until after the election. Why could that<br>be?**<br><br>Ignoring the bias in your question (as if the election is why they<br>decided as they did), that's actually what exactly did not happen.<br><br>In fact, SCOTUS issued a *temporary* stay on the order to release the<br>grand jury material from Mueller's special counsel investigation until<br>June 1 (hardly past the election), to give the White House and the DOJ<br>time to file a full appeal. The DOJ argued that they would suffer<br>"irreparable harm" if the documents were released before they had an<br>opportunity to file their appeal.<br><br>The short timeline indicates that the justices are going to decide,<br>during this term, whether or not they will take up the case.<br><br>And if they do, during this term, it will take *months* for them to<br>render a decision, which will actually mean that the documents will not<br>be released until after the election\[1\](#bkSpf){#cite-bkSpf<br>.citation_link}.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen.
