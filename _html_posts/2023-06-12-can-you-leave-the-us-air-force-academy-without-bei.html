<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is "it depends."<br><br>You can generally leave within the first two years of Academy education<br>with no repercussions. You can also keep whatever college credits you<br>earned, fully transferable to any accepting civilian university. And so<br>long as you were "in good standing" while a cadet (i.e. no outstanding<br>disciplinary issues, etc), you should still be able to re-enlist in the<br>Air Force as an enlisted airman, attend civilian university and<br>participate in the ROTC program, or attend civilian university and go to<br>OTS. You can't stay in the military after leaving USAFA, but if you left<br>within the first two years and were in good standing, you should be able<br>to re-enlist.<br><br>Once you begin the first day of your third academic year (what is<br>referred to as your "junior year" in civilian colleges, called your<br>"second class" year at USAFA, as you are members of the "second class"),<br>you begin to accrue "Active Duty Service Commitment." This means that<br>*you will owe the military time (or in some cases, money¹) to repay your<br>education.* The amount of time you will be required to serve is<br>dependent on how long you remain at the Academy. If you do not graduate,<br>you will have to serve your commitment as an enlisted member.<br><br>TL;DR: If you leave within the first two years, you will not remain in<br>the military, but you can re-enlist after you leave. If you leave within<br>the last two years, you will be enlisted when you leave, and your active<br>duty service commitment will depend on how long you were at USAFA<br>following the first day of academics in your junior year.<br><br>\<br><br>¹ The only time you must *pay out* your time in cash is if you are, for<br>some reason, ineligible to serve as an enlisted member. For example, if<br>you were convicted of a crime and dishonorably discharged (which<br>includes disenrollment from USAFA), you would not be able to enlist or<br>re-enlist, so you would have to pay back your time in money rather than<br>in service. If you were disenrolled from USAFA for a USAFA-specific<br>reason (i.e. an honor violation), you would still be eligible to serve<br>as an enlisted member.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
