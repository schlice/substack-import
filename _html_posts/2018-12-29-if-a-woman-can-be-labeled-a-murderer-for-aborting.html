  pollute our environment, peddle oxycontin, and shoot unarmed civilians?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>While I can appreciate what you\'re trying to do, this entire question<br>is a logical fallacy called a false equivalence. The things you are<br>trying to compare are not even remotely similar.<br><br>Good try, but I\'m not taking the bait.<br><br>I will tell you that even those who you label killers can really only<br>kill someone who is alive. And if there is no sign of life in that<br>zygote (no brain activity, no heartbeat) is it really anything more than<br>*potential* life? In a balanced position, aborting that zygote would not<br>equate to murder.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
