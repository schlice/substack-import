<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you sue for wrongful accusation of theft, slander, and public<br>embarrassment?**<br><br>In the United States, you can sue anyone for anything.<br><br>The question is: what is your chance of winning?<br><br>In this case, it's not great.<br><br>Generally, you have to show that you were *harmed* by the action, and<br>emotional harm is not enough to substantiate a slander charge. For<br>example, if the wrongful accusation cost you your job, you can sue for<br>slander. Wrongful accusation is not a cause of action, but would be part<br>of a slander charge. Public embarrassment is not a cause of action, but<br>it can be used to show the personal effect the slander had on you. It<br>could go to show the emotional distress the slander placed on you.<br><br>Also remember: truth is always a defense of a slander charge. If the<br>defendant can show proof of his allegation in any way, he will not be<br>found liable for slander.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
