<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Basically, it's up to the individual. There will be some experimentation<br>(i.e. trial and error) you will have to go through to find the right<br>balance of exercise which produces minimal fatigue.<br><br>The guideline is that if your fatigue lasts longer than two hours<br>following your workout, your workout was probably too intense. Try to<br>scale back next time, either a shorter time, lower frequency, or a<br>less-intense workout. Use the Perceived Exertion scale to monitor your<br>workouts. The PE scale is a 0--10 scale which helps you determine how<br>hard you are working before, during, and after your workout. Warm-up and<br>cool-down should be at a 1--2 RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion), and your<br>exercise should be at a 3--5 RPE.<br><br>Try to avoid exercising during the hottest part of the day. You might<br>also consider something that automatically battles heat while you<br>exercise, like aquatics. Aquatics can give you a great cardio workout<br>while automatically reducing body heat, thus reducing fatigue.<br><br>Finally, there are some lower-intensity workouts that people with MS may<br>find extremely useful, like yoga and tai chi. These exercises can aid<br>balance and coordination, also extremely beneficial for the MS<br>patient.\[1\](#qwWZv){#cite-qwWZv .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-qwWZv){.citation_index} [[Benefits of an Exercise<br>Program](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2b14d5&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/For-Professionals/Clinical-Care/Managing-MS/Intro-to-MS-for-Fitness-Professionals/Module-3){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
