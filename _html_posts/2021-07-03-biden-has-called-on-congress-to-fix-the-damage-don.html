<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When Congress passes a law, they may have an intention in mind. They may<br>wish the law to do a certain thing, or have a certain effect.<br><br>But when it gets through the various writers and legal staff and<br>everyone else who writes, reviews, and approves the law, it may not say<br>exactly what they intended it to say.<br><br>So let's look at the ruling and what it means.<br><br>> \"\N\either Arizona's out-of-precinct rule nor its ballot-collection<br>> law violates ยง2 of the \Voting Rights Act\,\" Justice Samuel Alito<br>> wrote in the court's opinion, in which he was joined by Chief Justice<br>> John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett<br>> Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.<br>><br>> The court noted that Arizona law \"generally makes it quite easy for<br>> residents to vote.\" Discussing the out-of-precinct rule, Alito noted<br>> that the state \"made extensive efforts\" to alleviate burdens by<br>> sending notices to all registered voters when precinct locations are<br>> changed and by requiring election officials to send out sample ballots<br>> to each home with a registered voter that includes a notice of the<br>> proper polling location. The court also pointed out that the Arizona<br>> secretary of state\'s office sends pamphlets with polling information,<br>> and that voters can look online or call to find out their precinct<br>> location.<br>><br>> \"Having to identify one's own polling place and then travel there to<br>> vote does not exceed the \'usual burdens of voting,\' Alito wrote.<br>> \"On the contrary, these tasks are quintessential examples of the<br>> usual burdens of voting.\"<br>><br>> In discussing the ballot harvesting law, the Supreme Court recalled<br>> the district court\'s findings. The lower court found that the DNC did<br>> not provide any records of how many people had previously relied on<br>> third parties to deliver their ballots before the practice was made<br>> illegal, nor had they provided statistics of what percentage of this<br>> group were minorities.<br>><br>> Alito also mentioned how the lower court said that \"none of the<br>> individual voters called by the plaintiffs had even claimed that the<br>> ballot collection restriction \'would make it significantly more<br>> difficult to vote.\"\"<br>><br>> The court stated that the plaintiffs in the case \"were unable to<br>> provide statistical evidence\" that the law even had a disparate<br>> impact on minorities, and that they only had witnesses testifying that<br>> people in disadvantaged areas were more likely to use third parties,<br>> and that minorities are disproportionately living in such areas.<br>><br>> \"As with the out-of-precinct policy, the modest evidence of racially<br>> disparate burdens caused by HB 2023, in light of the State's<br>> justifications, leads us to the conclusion that the law does not<br>> violate ยง2 of the VRA,\" the court said.\[1\](#usMYb){#cite-usMYb<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>Arizona passed several new laws, one which required "provisional<br>ballots" to be completely disregarded if they were submitted to the<br>wrong precinct, and another which made it a felony to submit another<br>person's ballot (with limited exceptions). The court found that neither<br>of these two laws violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.<br><br>If Biden and Congress were actually trying to make it legal to submit<br>provisional ballots in whatever precinct you wanted, rather than your<br>home precinct, and if they didn't want it to be a felony to submit<br>someone else's ballot for them, they should have written the law to say<br>that. However, as Section 2 is written today, and in accordance with<br>today's ruling, these things do not constitute a denial or a limiting of<br>voting rights based on race, color, or membership in a language minority<br>group.<br><br>Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which was initially adopted as an<br>enforcement mechanism for the 15th Amendment's guarantee that the right<br>to vote cannot be abridged "on account of race, color, or previous<br>condition of servitude," allows voters to seek judicial relief if they<br>believe that a state or local government has denied or limited their<br>voting rights on the basis of their race, color or membership in a<br>language minority group. As amended in 1982, Section 2 now provides that<br>a voting process or requirement that *results in* the abridgment of the<br>right to vote on account of a voter's race, color or language minority<br>status is unlawful, whether or not an intent to discriminate can be<br>proven.\[2\](#JRWpz){#cite-JRWpz .citation_link}<br><br>TL;DR: Congress can go back and amend Section 2 if they actually<br>wanted to make the law act in the way they desire. But as the law is<br>written today, the claim that Arizona's voter laws discriminate based on<br>race was not upheld.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Biden has called on congress to fix the damage done by the Supreme Court<br>voting right's decision.
