<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'m assuming you\'re talking about a national border and<br>not a state border. State borders do not have border patrols.\<br>\<br>As long as the checkpoint is run by USCBP, they can place the actual<br>checkpoint wherever they like. You\'d assume that they place it<br>somewhere near the actual border, but it doesn\'t have to be directly at<br>the border, it can be several miles in-country. They can have multiple<br>checkpoints (at the border and further in-country), and all of this is<br>Constitutional.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
