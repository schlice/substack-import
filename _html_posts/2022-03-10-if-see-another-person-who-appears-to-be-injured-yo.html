<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Before you call 911, you should assess the situation yourself. From your<br>question, you made it seem like you saw something and you immediately<br>called 911 without ensuring that the person actually needed medical<br>attention.<br><br>But if you actually assessed the situation by talking to the victim, and<br>if you determined, *to the best of your non-doctor's opinion*, that the<br>person needed an ambulance, call an ambulance. Even if it turns out<br>that they didn't need medical attention, you still did your due<br>diligence, and as far as you could see, medical attention was needed.<br><br>You can't be faulted for honestly, truthfully believing that medical<br>attention was needed. You're not a doctor. You're not expected to know<br>precisely whether or not medical attention was needed. You assessed the<br>situation to the best of your ability and you made a judgement. ***This<br>will never be faulted***.<br><br>A false alarm would occur if you either did not assess the situation, or<br>you assessed the situation, *determined that an ambulance was* *not*<br>*needed,* but you called one anyway.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If see another person who appears to be injured, you call 911 for an<br>ambulance, and they turn out to not have anything wrong with them, is<br>that considered a false alarm?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
