<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>For completeness, the relevant phrase in the 5th Amendment states: "nor<br>shall private property be taken for public use, without just<br>compensation." Article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights<br>says, "(1) Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in<br>association with others. (2) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his<br>property."<br><br>There is no contradiction here. The UDHR says that no one shall be<br>arbitrarily deprived of his property. *Arbitrary* means "based on<br>random choice or personal whim, rather than any reason or system." We<br>have a system by which we compensate individuals when private property<br>must be taken for public use. It is a system of just compensation, as<br>required in the 5th Amendment. And the land must be taken for "public<br>use," not at random, or for personal desires.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
