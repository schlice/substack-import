<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The delay doesn\'t constitute a violation of due process<br>(either 5th Amendment or 14th Amendment). Due process says that no<br>person can have his or her rights removed without due process of the<br>law. Puerto Rico becoming a state or not does not remove any rights that<br>citizens of the terrirtory already have.\<br>\<br>It seems that the US government has been more than willing to respond to<br>whatever Puerto Rico has wanted to do with their territory, since the<br>60s. And finally, in 2012, Puerto Rico has requested to become a state.\<br>\<br>The last time we have had a state join the union was in 1959 (Hawaii). I<br>don\'t suspect it will be a quick process, but I suspect it will<br>happen.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
