<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [So you may have noticed that Quora added a big box to your<br>question. Your question contained the word \"suicide\" so you got a big<br>splash box.\<br>\<br>You should definitely take that advice. Encourage him to talk to<br>someone.\<br>\<br>You should also learn the warning signs of an impending suicide.\<br>]<br><br>- Watch for him giving prized possessions away and putting financial<br>  affairs in order.\<br>- Watch for a noticeable mood change, as if a big burden has been<br>  lifted. This may mean he has made the tough decision to end his life.<br>- Listen to his speech. If he sounds like he is calling people to say<br>  goodbye, this is an additional warning sign.<br><br>If you ever feel he is a danger to himself, don\'t hesitate. Call 911<br>right away.\<br>\<br>I should also add that I can appreciate what [[Bill<br>Boland](https://www.quora.com/profile/Bill-Boland-2)]{.qlink_container}<br>shared, and so I feel I would be remiss if I don\'t mention that he is<br>in a very bad place right now, and while this is his decision to make, I<br>don\'t believe that suicide is ever the answer. I believe that all lives<br>have value, and that all lives can be lived in a way that continues to<br>value the life that is yet to be lived.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
