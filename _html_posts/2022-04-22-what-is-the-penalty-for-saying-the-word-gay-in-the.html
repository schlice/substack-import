<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Nothing, because there is no law against saying the word "gay."<br><br>Don't believe everything the liberal sphere tells you.<br><br>"Don't Say Gay" is a fabrication. Completely made up.<br><br>Our friends at The Tampa Bay Times explained it:<br><br>> The bill as originally filed prohibited school districts from<br>> encouraging "classroom discussion" about sexual orientation or gender<br>> identity in "primary grade levels." Opponents of the bill interpreted<br>> that provision to be a ban on speaking about LGBTQ topics in<br>> classrooms and started using the "don't say gay" moniker.<br>><br>> The bill's sponsors, Sen. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, and Rep. Joe<br>> Harding, R-Williston, amended the bill in the hopes of making it clear<br>> it would only be restricting lessons related to those subjects.<br>> Conversations between students and teachers about, for example, a<br>> child's two mothers, would still be allowed under the bill, the<br>> sponsors said.<br>><br>> But the nickname stuck.\[1\](#jWYTB){#cite-jWYTB .citation_link}<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What is the penalty for saying the word gay in the state of Florida?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-jWYTB){.citation_index} [[The 'don't say gay' bill<br>DeSantis just signed,<br>explained](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c950c4&url=https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2022/03/28/the-dont-say-gay-bill-desantis-just-signed-explained/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="tampabay.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
