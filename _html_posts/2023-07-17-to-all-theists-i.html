<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You didn't ask a question there, did you...<br><br>But if you were hoping for fainting and pearl-clutching from those<br>uppity church-goers, you're not going to get it.<br><br>News flash: we're all sinners. You're not special.<br><br>We've sinned, just like you. Out of your list of "sins," as a matter of<br>fact, the only one I haven't done is wipe my ass with pages I ripped out<br>of a Bible (ouch, but any port in a storm, I guess). And unsurprisingly,<br>I'm still here, too.<br><br>Our sins don't condemn us to an early death. Our righteousness doesn't<br>guarantee us a good life.<br><br>In fact, none of what we do in this life (except for being healthy)<br>makes for a longer or a shorter life. God doesn't "strike you down"<br>because you're a sinner.<br><br>What He *does* do is hope that you'll reconsider, so that you can be<br>welcomed into the *next* life.<br><br>Now, if you don't care about the next life, if you're only interested in<br>*this* life, and then when you die, you die permanently, then you can<br>just stop reading here. If you believe that when you die, there is<br>nothing left, then that's what will happen to you.<br><br>But have you ever asked yourself the question, *is there something<br>more?* Have you ever been leaving your job, sitting in traffic, looking<br>at all the cars and wondering *is this it? Is this all there is to<br>life?* If you have ever thought about this, you may want to consider<br>what those theists have to say.<br><br>But we're not going to bother unless you ask, because you sound a bit<br>hostile. You sound a bit intentionally defiant. And that's okay. You can<br>live exactly as you live and have a fine life. *But that'll be the end<br>of it*.<br><br>In other words, if you want an eternity, you have to choose it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
