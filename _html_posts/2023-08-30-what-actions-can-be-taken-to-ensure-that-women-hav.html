<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The *Dobbs* decision validated that abortion is not a Federal issue and<br>it is not a Constitutional right. Therefore, rightly, abortion is a<br>state's rights issue. You simply cannot ensure that all women<br>have access to safe and legal abortions. Full stop.<br><br>You can ensure that you live in a state which has added a right to<br>abortion into its state constitution. According to a July 2022 report,<br>10 states have state constitutions that protect abortion rights and<br>access. These states\' high courts have recognized that their state<br>constitutions protect abortion rights.<br><br>Beyond that, you can champion abortion rights in the other forty states<br>which do not have abortion rights enshrined in their state<br>constitutions. There are many groups which are actively working to<br>modify laws in those remaining states. You can look to contribute to<br>their efforts in some meaningful way. I would suggest you look at such<br>groups as Planned Parenthood and NARAL.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
