<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No. He didn't *assault* a nurse. He *arrested* a nurse.<br><br>If he was taught this particular facet of evidence handling (i.e. when<br>he can and can't force the hospital to give him a blood sample), **he<br>should lose his job because he didn't know the law, and conducted an<br>unlawful arrest.**<br><br>If he was never taught this (I can't imagine he wasn't, but it's not my<br>place to not give him the benefit of the doubt), then he should be<br>placed on administrative duty, re-trained, and assigned appropriately<br>after review by senior staff. However, because of the publicity this<br>case has generated, it's likely he'll be quietly retired instead.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
