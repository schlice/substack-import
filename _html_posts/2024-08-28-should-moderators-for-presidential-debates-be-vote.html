<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, I don't think so. I think it is sufficient that both parties agree<br>to the terms of the debate.<br><br>Personally, I'd like to see multiple debates in multiple formats (town<br>hall, Lincoln-Douglas, etc.) to truly assess the candidates. But it's<br>unlikely that the parties will agree to that. These debates are hardly<br>debates anyway (for any of you who have been in the NSDA, you know<br>exactly what I'm talking about).<br><br>*(And I'm old enough to have been in the NSDA back when it was called<br>the NFL, the National Forensic League, and I could truthfully say that I<br>was in the NFL)*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
