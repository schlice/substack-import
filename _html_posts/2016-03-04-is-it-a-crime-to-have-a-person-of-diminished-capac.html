<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>(Question was edited)<br><br>It is only a crime to have a person sign a power of attorney when they<br>have diminished mental capacity if the recipient of such power intends<br>to use it to criminal ends; i.e. to defraud the assignor. If it is done<br>to facilitate decision making by a spouse when the other spouse begins<br>to lose mental capacity due to disease or defect, it is probably not<br>criminal. Most generally, if the power is assigned to a spouse, the<br>marital contract takes over, as the spouse would be the beneficiary of<br>the marital assets should the assignor pass. So the PoA doesn\'t pose<br>any real additional risk to the financial situation if the recipient of<br>the power is a spouse.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
