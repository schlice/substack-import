<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are many rights not stated in the Bill of Rights. They are the<br>rights that the framers did not feel were necessary to explicitly call<br>out as things that are absolutely sacrosanct; the government many not<br>infringe on these rights.<br><br>The thing about the Constitution is that if it's *not* listed in the<br>Bill of Rights, it's not a right which cannot be infringed by the<br>government. While the UN has compiled a listing of "universal human<br>rights," these are not listed in our Constitution. Why? The Universal<br>Declaration of Human Rights tells governments how they should act. The<br>Bill of Rights tells government how it should not act.<br><br>Remember that the whole purpose of the Constitution was to limit the<br>reach of government. Government is only authorized to perform certain<br>tasks, and those tasks are spelled out clearly in the Constitution.<br>Still, the states were concerned that the government would overstep its<br>bounds (they were right) and attempt to take authority which was not<br>specifically authorized for them to take. So they required a *specific<br>listing* of rights which were so important to them, and were the main<br>reasons they wanted to make a new government apart from England in the<br>first place, that they created the Bill of Rights to spell those out.<br><br>Even though the Constitution specifically limits the government's power,<br>they still wanted a listing of items which the government could not do.<br>The main body of the Constitution tells the government what it is<br>allowed to do; the Bill of Rights tells the government what it is<br>not allowed to do.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
