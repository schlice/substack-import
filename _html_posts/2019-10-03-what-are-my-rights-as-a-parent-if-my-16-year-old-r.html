That means you have the responsibility to<br>do what is best for them, even if they refuse.<br><br>You may want to talk to the doctor about the side effects and see if<br>there are some interventions you can add to assist with "how it makes<br>them feel," but ultimately it will do them more harm to not take the<br>meds than to take them.<br><br>I fully understand how these medications make people feel (as I have<br>felt it myself), but it's important to understand that these medicines<br>are the lesser of two evils, and it's definitely something that you as a<br>parent must do.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
