<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *If you do what you've always done, you'll get what you've always<br>> gotten. --- Tony Robbins*<br><br>Presidents have been getting away with more and more these days, because<br>no one is stopping them.<br><br>In 2012, former President Obama said, more than 20 times, that he<br>did not have the authority to suspend deportations through executive<br>order. Some of his quotes from that time:<br><br>- "because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed. \[...<br>  Those\] laws on the books by Congress, are very clear in terms of how<br>  we have to enforce our immigration system."<br>- "I'm not a king, \...\ I'm not the emperor of the United States,"<br>- "There is a path to get this done and that is through Congress,"<br><br>Then he did it anyway.<br><br>In 2019, former President Trump tried to get funding for his border<br>wall, and Congress would not provide it. In a desperate attempt to do<br>what he wanted anyway, he found an "emergency provision" that allowed<br>him to re-appropriate certain money that had already been allocated by<br>Congress to the wall...by declaring a national emergency at the southern<br>border. And he took \$6.5 billion from the Treasury. "The president's<br>declaration is a grotesque abuse of power," said Elizabeth Goitein,<br>co-director of the Brennan Center's Liberty & National Security Program.<br>"Emergency powers are for emergencies, not for circumventing the will of<br>Congress on questions of policy."\[1\](#qWXJb){#cite-qWXJb<br>.citation_link}<br><br>After watching two former presidents get away with violating the law<br>without consequence, Biden believes that he can do it as well. He<br>"double, triple, quadruple checked" whether or not he had the power to<br>implement yet another eviction moratorium without Congress. As he<br>suspected, he did not.<br><br>Then he did it anyway.<br><br>His defense? \"I can\'t guarantee you the court won't rule that we<br>don\'t have that authority but at least we\'ll have the ability to, if<br>we have to appeal, to keep this going for a month-at least. I hope<br>longer.\"\[2\](#hQEsY){#cite-hQEsY .citation_link}<br><br>In other words, I know it's illegal, because I double, triple, quadruple<br>checked, but since it's going to take you guys so long to bring charges<br>against me that I'm just going to do what I want and screw the law.<br><br>But why is this worse than what Trump did? Trump took \$6.5 billion.<br>Biden has now taken **between 100 and 200 times that<br>amount.**\[3\](#XMplJ){#cite-XMplJ .citation_link} Trump found a<br>"legal loophole" by declaring a national emergency. The unethical part<br>was declaring the national emergency *after* Congress denied his funding<br>request. Biden, on the other hand, is intentionally doing something he<br>knows is illegal, because he looked it up. He's simply relying on the<br>fact that prosecutions take time so he can unlawfully funnel money to<br>the places he wants it to go, with the full knowledge that even if a<br>court finds that his money-transfer program is illegal, the money's<br>already gone. The best the court could do is to tell him to stop. There<br>are, he posits, no other ramifications.. That's not a "legal loophole,"<br>that's bald-faced theft.<br><br>Presidential violations of law continue to happen, and they keep getting<br>worse.<br><br>Congress should have impeached Obama when he did it. Congress should<br>have impeached Trump when he did it. If Congress allows this violation<br>to stand, what laws can we pass restricting the President's actions that<br>will ever be able to stand? The President will exercise unlimited<br>authority with no consequence. If we continue allowing these<br>presidential violations of law, we will have to live with the system<br>that we get --- a president who is far more powerful than the<br>Constitution ever intended...and we won't be able to stop him.<br><br>**TL;DR: Congress should impeach Biden for one of the most egregious<br>violations of Article II of the Constitution that we have ever seen in<br>this country.**<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If Republicans win the House, and perhaps the Senate, should they<br>impeach Joe Biden?
