<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can\'t \"forget the Constitution.\" All laws are based off of the<br>Constitution, the \"supreme law of the land.\" Police departments are<br>developed, equipped, and funded through force of law. So \"forgetting\"<br>the Constitution is not feasible.<br><br>If you have an expectation that your police department is going to<br>defend you from crime, you may need to reset your expectations. If you<br>wanted a police department that was there to defend you and not just<br>enforce the law, you\'d have to pay *much* higher taxes, because<br>you\'d need approximately 50 times the officers than you have now. Then,<br>and only then, might the police be of sufficient numbers to defend you<br>against crime, and between you and me, that looks too much like a police<br>state for my taste.<br><br>Remember the old saying: *when seconds count, the police are only<br>minutes away.*<br><br>Based on the legal definition of a police force as \"law enforcement\"<br>and not a \"public defense force,\" the police are not required to<br>protect you from crime. It would be logistically impossible to<br>expect that the police will defend you from crime.<br><br>The simple fact is that the police can\'t get to you fast enough to<br>prevent crime from happening. It is up to you to safeguard yourself<br>and your family. If you are unable or unwilling to do so, you should<br>move to a gated community, a condominium building with private security,<br>or hire your own private security. The law says that the government<br>can\'t deny you life, liberty or property without due process, but the<br>law doesn\'t say that you have the right to government aid, even when<br>that aid would safeguard your life, liberty or property, the very same<br>rights the government is not allowed to take from you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Does-a-police-officer-have-an-obligation-to-rush-to-your-rescue/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
