<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's not. The TLDR here is that it's not about what clothing matters to<br>God. It's about what clothing matters to you when you go to worship<br>a holy God.<br><br>Honestly, these days, we understand that a church is just a group of<br>people. The church building rarely is a traditional church building any<br>more. Heck, my church meets in the local high school auditorium.<br>Probably half of the men in attendance go in shorts.<br><br>I just never felt comfortable wearing shorts in church. I'm aware that's<br>just a function of my upbringing. I did it a few times in Florida, but I<br>always wore clean dress-style shorts with a polo shirt and clean<br>sneakers or deck shoes, and it was always on a weekend that I wasn't<br>serving. But Florida was the exception, and even when church got out at<br>10:30 am, it could be well over 90 degrees F. So I allowed myself to go<br>in shorts occasionally. Otherwise, I'll wear a polo shirt and<br>comfortable pants or jeans, and sneakers or Gatsbys or Ropers with them.<br>Our pastors very rarely wore slacks, they were usually in clean jeans<br>and Gatsbys or sneakers. If they were preaching, in my old church they'd<br>wear a sport coat or blazer, but that's about as dressed-up as they got.<br>Some women wore dresses and heels, and some wore slacks, and some wore<br>jeans and tennis shoes.<br><br>Honestly, no one cares what you wear. God certainly doesn't care what<br>you wear. Heck, even the Bible talks about not adorning yourself with<br>fancy clothes in order to attract attention, so it's more about making<br>yourself feel comfortable than about dressing in a specific way.<br><br>Look, there is nothing wrong with dressing up if it makes you feel<br>comfortable. These days though, if I'm wearing a button-down shirt, it's<br>a Hawaiian shirt.<br><br>(EDIT) I want to make sure I'm covering all the bases. There are solid<br>arguments on the other side for why we wear nice clothes to church, so I<br>wanted to add a more centrist opinion I found at one of my *absolute<br>favorite* sources for all things Christianity:<br>[GotQuestions.org(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=62e533&url=https://gotquestions.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container}. If you haven't<br>checked them out, you should. Anyway, here's what they said about the<br>subject, and it is a very balanced view:<br><br>> It is good for us to ponder why we wear what we do. Genesis 35:1-3 may<br>> shed some light on the subject. \"Then God said to Jacob, \'Go up to<br>> Bethel and settle there. Build an altar there to honor Me. That's<br>> where I appeared to you when you were running away from your brother<br>> Esau.\' So Jacob spoke to his family and to everyone who was with him.<br>> He said, \'Get rid of the strange gods you have with you. Make<br>> yourselves pure, and change your clothes. Come, let's go up to Bethel.<br>> There I'll build an altar to honor God. He answered me when I was in<br>> trouble. He's been with me everywhere I've gone.\'\"<br>><br>> It is possible that as Jacob began this faith-journey to Bethel with<br>> God, he recognized how much God had done for him, and how much he<br>> needed God! His response was to take everyone with him on this<br>> faith-journey, so they could experience God for themselves. \"Get rid<br>> of the strange gods you have with you. Make yourselves pure\" implies<br>> the need to be united in \"coming clean\" before God. \"For all have<br>> sinned\...\" (Romans 3:23). Many then had \"household idols\" with<br>> them that they depended on, as well as God. They did not trust God<br>> alone. \"Change your clothes\" implies a change of heart toward sin.<br>> It was to be a reflection of what had taken place on the \"inside.\"<br>><br>> We would all benefit from a \"spiritual bath\" to confess and get rid<br>> of sin before we go to church. This is making ourselves pure. For some<br>> people, clean is their \"best.\" For others, their heart tells them<br>> that wearing their best is showing God His value to them. For still<br>> others, there needs to be a caution that their best isn't merely<br>> showing off.<br>><br>> It is always the heart God is looking at, rather than the exterior.<br>> However, what we wear to worship our holy, pure God may be an<br>> indication of where our hearts are. If you have never considered it<br>> before, ask yourself, \"Does it matter to me how I look when I am<br>> going to worship the King of Kings and Lord of Lords? More<br>> importantly, does it matter to Him?\" We must all be the judge of that<br>> for ourselves. It's a personal choice, keeping in mind that having a<br>> proper attitude toward God Himself is important preparation for<br>> worship at church.\[1\](#tFNNG){#cite-tFNNG .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-tFNNG){.citation_index} [[Why do we have to dress up nice<br>for<br>church?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=37ee24&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/dress-up-church.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
