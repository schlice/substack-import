<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>BLUF: *Drinking alcohol is fine.* *Getting drunk* *is not.*<br><br>Alcohol, by itself, is not sinful. Drinking alcohol is sometimes seen in<br>the Bible as a positive thing. Ecclesiastes 9:7 says, "Drink your wine<br>with a merry heart." Psalm 104:14-15 states that God gives wine "that<br>makes glad the heart of men." Amos 9:14 discusses drinking wine from<br>your own vineyard as a sign of God's blessing. Isaiah 55:1 encourages,<br>"Yes, come buy wine and milk..." And yes, Jesus turned water into wine.<br>Was He sinning then?<br><br>What the Bible warns against is *drunkenness* (Ephesians 5:18). The<br>Bible condemns drunkenness and its effects (Proverbs 23:29-35).<br>Christians are also commanded to not allow their bodies to be "mastered"<br>by anything (1 Corinthians 6:12; 2 Peter 2:19). Scripture also forbids a<br>Christian from doing anything that might offend other Christians or<br>encourage them to sin (1 Corinthians 8:9-13). All told, it would be<br>extremely difficult for any Christian to say that his drinking which<br>results in drunkenness is done "to the glory of God" (1 Corinthians<br>10:31).<br><br>Another practical consideration for the people of Biblical times: water<br>was often not sanitary. People often drank wine because the fermentation<br>process killed the bacteria in the water.<br><br>Drinking alcohol by itself is not sinful. It is drunkenness and addition<br>to alcohol that Christians must absolutely stay away from.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
