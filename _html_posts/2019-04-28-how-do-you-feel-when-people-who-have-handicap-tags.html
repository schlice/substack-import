We have so many laws in<br>this country, I'm not completely certain that I don't violate laws that<br>I'm completely unaware of.<br><br>It upsets me when people do this *deliberately*, knowing what the law is<br>and intentionally violating it. It takes up a spot for someone who<br>probably truly needs it, and it's just another example of the selfish<br>"it's-all-about-me" attitude people tend to have these days.<br><br>If you are aware of this, you should report it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
