title: '"Both Testaments of the Bible demands not to marry a unbeliever, who is called
  Belial (2 Cor 6:15). Can a Bible-believer say that s/he has not drifted away from
  the faith when s/he intentionally selects a unbeliever over believers as the spouse?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Be sure to not take this passage out of its context:<br><br>> Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what<br>> fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has<br>> light with darkness? And what accord has Christ with Belial? Or what<br>> part has a believer with an unbeliever? And what agreement has the<br>> temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God.<br>> --- 2 Cor 6:12--16 NKJV<br><br>First, the unbeliever is not called Belial in the passage. The<br>unbeliever is *equated* with Belial, another name for Satan<br>(interestingly only being used here in this passage). The reason that<br>the word Belial is used here is because, while it is supposed to<br>ultimately represent Satan, what it actually represents is<br>"worthlessness," "vileness," and "wickedness.\" Its use here is to<br>stress Satan's deep-seated wickedness: \"the one who is utterly<br>worthless because he is vile.\" It is the opposite of the person of<br>Christ, and therefore should be thought of as the adversary. But, in<br>context Belial represents all unbelievers, just as all believers are in<br>Christ.<br><br>The whole point of this passage is the *comparison of opposites,* and<br>the imagery is that of oxen on a yoke.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-d4f13fcedd30b08f07c53e1f2e111552){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-d4f13fcedd30b08f07c53e1f2e111552" master_w="470"<br>master_h="275"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>In order for the team to make progress, they have to pull in the same<br>direction. Imagine what would happen if these two were *pulling in<br>opposite directions*. They wouldn't get very far, would they.<br><br>The same goes for a Christian being "yoked" to a non-Christian. How<br>could a Christ-follower be united in any meaningful way to a non-Christ<br>follower? Unbelievers are still under the authority of "the god of this<br>age" who has blinded their minds "so that they cannot see the light of<br>the gospel that displays the glory of Christ, who is the image of God."<br>(2 Cor 4:4 NIV). When you are "yoked" in marriage, how is it possible<br>that a believer and an unbeliever could ever "pull in the same<br>direction?" One of them would have to change course. Not only that, but<br>the believer and the unbeliever have completely different eternal<br>destinies. How could you ever walk the same direction in your marriage?<br>You'll always be walking on different paths.<br><br>Perhaps you are banking on the fact that one of you will alter course<br>later in life. I won't say that this is not possible, because it does<br>happen. But Paul warns against this, because as I mentioned, one of you<br>is going to have to change direction, and Paul warns that it may be the<br>believer.<br><br>Does the passage *demand* that you *not* marry an unbeliever? No, it<br>does not. Instead, it *warns* the believer not to marry an unbeliever<br>because of the potential eternal consequences of doing so.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
