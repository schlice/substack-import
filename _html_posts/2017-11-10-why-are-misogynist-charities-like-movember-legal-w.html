<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>1.  It's because of a misunderstanding of what misogyny is. Misogyny<br>    specifically means "a hatred of women." There is no evidence that<br>    either the charity, or its members, hate women.<br>2.  It's also because, while abhorrent and horribly misguided, misogyny<br>    is not illegal, so even if the charity was misogynist (which it is<br>    not, see #1), it is not illegal. There is no law requiring charities<br>    to address men's and women's issues equally.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
