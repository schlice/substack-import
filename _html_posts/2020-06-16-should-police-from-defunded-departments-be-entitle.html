<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should police from defunded departments be entitled to career<br>retraining funds and programs? To which fields of employment does your<br>average officer have transferrable skills?**<br><br>Of course they should, just as any person whose company goes out of<br>business should. For what reason would you deny them access to such<br>programs?<br><br>Police officers have many transferrable skills. They could do direct<br>transfers into private security (which is what will replace police if<br>you do manage to get rid of them---police for the rich, none for anyone<br>else). They could transfer into corporate security offices. They could<br>do armed courier jobs. There\'s lots of possibilities.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
