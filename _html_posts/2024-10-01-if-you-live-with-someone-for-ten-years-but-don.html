<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer, as with any legal question, is "it depends."<br><br>In a very small handful of states, there is what is known as "common law<br>marriage." In the few states that allow it, common law marriage is a<br>legally recognized marriage that occurs when a couple agrees to be<br>married and lives together without having a formal ceremony or obtaining<br>a marriage license.<br><br>Just living together is not enough. You have to live *as if you are<br>married.* You agree to be married. You tell everyone (friends, family,<br>acquaintances, etc) that you are married.<br><br>There are only eight states which recognize some form of common law<br>marriage:<br><br>- Colorado: Common law marriage contracted on or after Sept. 1,<br>  2006, is valid if, at the time the marriage was entered into, both<br>  parties are 18 years or older, and the marriage is not prohibited by<br>  other law ([[Colo. Stat.<br>  §14-2-109.5](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=311178&url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/colorado/){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="lexisnexis.com"}]{.qlink_container})<br>- Iowa: Common law marriage for purposes of the Support of<br>  Dependents Chapter (Iowa Code §252A.3) Otherwise it is not explicitly<br>  prohibited ([[Iowa Code<br>  §595.1A](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=86069d&url=https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/ico/section/2014/595.1A.pdf){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="iowa.gov"}]{.qlink_container})<br>- Kansas: Common law marriage will be recognized if the parties are<br>  18 or older and for purposes of the Divorce and Maintenance Article,<br>  proof of common law marriage is allowed as evidence of marriage of the<br>  parties ([[Kan. Stat.<br>  §23-2502](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c5ea06&url=http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2013_14/statute/023_000_0000_chapter/023_025_0000_article/023_025_0002_section/023_025_0002_k/){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="kslegislature.org"}]{.qlink_container}; [[Kan.

Stat. §40-1-403)<br>- New Hampshire: Common Law Marriage: \"persons cohabiting and<br>  acknowledging each other as husband and wife, and generally reputed to<br>  be such, for the period of 3 years, and until the decease of one of<br>  them, shall thereafter be deemed to have been legally married.\"<br>  ([[N.H. Stat.<br>  §457:39](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=58b2ff&url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/XLIII/457/457-39.htm){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="state.nh.us"}]{.qlink_container})<br>- South Carolina: allows for marriages without a valid license<br>  ([[S.C. Stat.<br>  §20-1-360](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d1f356&url=http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t20c001.php){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="scstatehouse.gov"}]{.qlink_container})<br>- Texas: Common Law Marriage in specific circumstances ([[Tex.<br>  Family Law<br>  §1.101](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=09cb8c&url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/FA/htm/FA.1.htm%231.101){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="state.tx.us"}]{.qlink_container}; [[Tex.

There is no<br>standard for people who are just living together. You probably haven't<br>combined financial accounts, so you get the stuff you brought into the<br>common household (as they do), and then for the stuff you acquired while<br>you were together, you see who actually bought it, and they get it.<br><br>I suppose that's one of the downsides of not being married.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
