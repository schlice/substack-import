<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It depends on the payment processor the HOA uses. Not all payment<br>processors take credit cards. Usually, the credit card company charges a<br>fee to the payment processor, and that just gets passed back on down the<br>line to the consumer. Not all payment processors like to offer credit<br>cards, because they would then have to charge a fee to do so.<br><br>However, here's a life hack for you: you can use<br>[Plastiq(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=69c1dc&url=https://www.plastiq.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="plastiq.com"}]{.qlink_container} or<br>[Melio(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9ae99a&url=https://www.meliopayments.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="meliopayments.com"}]{.qlink_container} (not sponsors) to<br>basically pay almost anyone, using a credit card, even if they don't<br>accept credit cards. But be cautious when doing this. Plastiq, for<br>example, will charge you 2.85% of your charge in fees, so if you're<br>paying a \$200 HOA bill, you'll pay an extra \$5.70 in fees. And if you<br>can't pay your credit card bill in full, you'll pay interest on all of<br>that, which can add up quickly. Also, while most credit cards will<br>charge this as a purchase, some may charge this as a "cash advance," so<br>you won't have the 30 day leeway before interest starts.<br><br>You can add a debit card to Plastiq, but why would you pay the 1% fee to<br>do that when you could just cut your own check or probably pay with<br>eCheck or ACH or wire transfer?<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What don\'t HOA\'s take automatic payments on credit cards?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
