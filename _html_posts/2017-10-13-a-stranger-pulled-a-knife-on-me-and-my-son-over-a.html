<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The charge in most jurisdictions is "brandishing a weapon," but if you<br>didn't call the police right away, I doubt they will charge the<br>individual now. You can always feel free to call the police department<br>(non-emergency number, please) and ask to speak to an officer about the<br>situation.<br><br>You can also sue for assault, as brandishing a weapon is also an assault<br>in tort. Check with a lawyer on this one.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
