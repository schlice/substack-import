Is this<br>burglary?**<br><br>Technically, burglary is knowingly entering or unlawfully remaining on<br>someone else\'s property with the intent to commit a crime (other than<br>trespass).<br><br>If you form the intent to commit a crime (in this case, theft) *after*<br>you enter the property, it is not burglary.<br><br>So the answer is this is not burglary. It is trespass and theft, but not<br>burglary.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
