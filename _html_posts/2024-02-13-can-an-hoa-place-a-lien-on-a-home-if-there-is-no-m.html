<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The lien isn't placed on the mortgage. The lien is placed on the<br>property, and uses the value of the real property to recover the money<br>they are owed.<br><br>When the property is sold, the proceeds are used to first pay off the<br>HOA, and then the remainder goes to the (now former) owner.<br><br>If this happens to you, you have already been in a very long fight with<br>the HOA who has fined you (or to whom you have failed to pay your dues<br>or other fees). Hopefully you have already retained an attorney to help<br>you in your fight, but if you haven't, now's a really good time to do<br>it.<br><br>You'll really only get out of it with an attorney, as the lien (and<br>imminent foreclosure) is being handled by the HOA's attorney. Perhaps<br>you can work out a payment plan to pay what you owe. Or perhaps you want<br>to sue, because the original fine or fee was improper, or violated the<br>Association's own rules. But either way, the only way to handle it is<br>with a lawyer.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
