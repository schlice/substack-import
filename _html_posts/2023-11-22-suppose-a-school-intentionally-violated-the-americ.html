<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Americans with Disabilities Act is a law related to employment. So a<br>school violating the Act is one which would be denying a teacher<br>accommodations in employment, or rejecting an applicant to become a<br>teacher due to a disability.<br><br>Employers who knowingly violate the ADA can face the following<br>consequences:<br><br>- Fines: up to \$75,000 for the first violation, and up to \$150,000 for<br>  the second and subsequent violations.<br>- Lawsuits. The Department of Justice may sue employers who fail to<br>  comply with ADA.<br><br>(EDIT) You may be thinking of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act,<br>also known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).<br>This section of law says that schools must provide an equal education to<br>all students, regardless of disability. Violations of this law could<br>result in fines up to \$10,000 and compensatory education funded by the<br>subject school.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
