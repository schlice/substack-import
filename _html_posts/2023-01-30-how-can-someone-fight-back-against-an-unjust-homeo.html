<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If the fine you have received is in violation of local ordinances or<br>laws, feel free to retain an attorney and file suit against the HOA.<br><br>But you didn't say "illegal" or "unlawful." You said "unjust." Usually,<br>when people say this, it's because they simply disagree with what the<br>HOA believes, and therefore it is unjust.<br><br>If you can show proof of selective enforcement (i.e. two homeowners<br>violating exactly the same rule in exactly the same way, and a fine is<br>issued to one and not the other), you can absolutely file suit. That's a<br>dangerous situation for the HOA, because they could potentially lose the<br>ability to enforce *any* rules.<br><br>You should know, however, that usually what the HOA does is perfectly<br>legal and legally supportable. In the vast majority of cases, the<br>Governing Documents exist, you have them, they establish the HOA's<br>authority, and the HOA is acting within its authority. The fact that you<br>don't like the rules, or you don't agree with the rules, or you think<br>the rules are unjust, do not usually constitute enough legal authority<br>to prevail in a lawsuit.<br><br>Bottom line, if you think you have a case, contact a local lawyer in<br>your area who specializes in HOA law.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
