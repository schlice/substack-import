<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The folks over at<br>[EveryCaller.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=316146&url=http://everycaller.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="everycaller.com"}]{.qlink_container} are working on porting<br>their popular Call Control system for mobiles to a small device that you<br>would put in-line to your home phone. They are calling it [[Call Control<br>Home](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7efa5a&url=http://www.callcontrolhome.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="callcontrolhome.com"}]{.qlink_container} and it isn\'t yet<br>shipping (because they are working on crowdfunding it). But as far as<br>technology, this is the way to go.\<br>\<br>If you\'re a Linux junkie and you like open-source stuff, take a look at<br>setting up an<br>[Asterisk(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=531c6c&url=http://www.asterisk.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="asterisk.org"}]{.qlink_container} PBX in your home. I know<br>what you\'re thinking: \"A PBX? In my house?\" It does sound a little<br>weird, but you get all kinds of cool features, like multiple mailboxes,<br>extensions for family members, etc. And it\'s open-source. But what\'s<br>most important here is that Asterisk hooks in to the public real-time<br>spam databases on the Internet (like the one at EveryCall) and can block<br>spam callers real-time.\<br>\<br>Legally, it\'s a bit harder. If you haven\'t done so already, you should<br>get on the [[National Do Not Call<br>Registry](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=de6d4a&url=https://www.donotcall.gov/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="donotcall.gov"}]{.qlink_container} and once you\'re on that,<br>within a month, you should get fewer spam calls. If you continue to get<br>spam calls after being on the registry for a month, you can contact your<br>state\'s Attorney General\'s office (usually they have a website for<br>reporting spam callers) and provide as much information as you can. If<br>they get enough complaints, they can initiate legal action under the<br>spam calling laws.\<br>\<br>Here\'s a little sneakier way to handle spam callers:\<br>\<br>When a robodialer calls, press the button that indicates you\'re<br>interested and you\'ll get routed to a live person. Tell the person that<br>this is a business line, please don\'t contact us. If you happen to<br>start getting calls for business services, tell them that your number is<br>residential. They seem to respect that boundary, even when they have<br>little respect for the \"please don\'t contact me\" or \"please remove<br>me from your lists\" requests. Hey, if things are bad, it\'s worth a<br>try.\<br>\<br>If you have a traditional landline, some carriers have \"No<br>Solicitation\" services which play a pre-recorded message when anyone<br>calls. The message says something along the lines of \"You have reached<br>a number which does not accept solicitations. If you are a solicitor,<br>hang up now. If not, please stay on the line.\" If they stay on, then<br>your phone rings. You can program some phone numbers to blast right past<br>the message (like your family\'s cell phones).\<br>\<br>Don\'t forget that some solicitation calls can\'t be blocked; for<br>example, you can\'t stop getting calls from any business with whom you<br>have transacted within the last 6 months. You also can\'t stop political<br>survey calls, or research study calls.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
