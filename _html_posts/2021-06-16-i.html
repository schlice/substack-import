<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You said you are 15, so your medical decisions are currently under the<br>control of your parents unless you are an emancipated minor.<br><br>Your doctor checks your genitals to ensure that you are developing<br>correctly and that nothing appears out of the order. They physically<br>check your testicles to look for signs of testicular cancer (which is<br>something [[you should start doing<br>yourself](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a16ab6&url=https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/tse.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="kidshealth.org"}]{.qlink_container}, get into the habit<br>now). They check for [[inguinal<br>hernias](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=248475&url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inguinal-hernia/symptoms-causes/syc-20351547%23:~:text%3DAn%2520inguinal%2520hernia%2520occurs%2520when,hernias%2520do%2520not%2520cause%2520pain.){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="mayoclinic.org"}]{.qlink_container} by placing a finger next<br>to your genitals (at the crook of your leg and torso) and asking you to<br>cough. An inguinal hernia would be easy to feel pulsing when you cough.<br>These are all standard checks that a doctor would perform during an<br>annual well-patient checkup, and it's not at all abnormal.<br><br>But even for us adults doing an annual checkup, they don't "make you get<br>naked." At best, they ask you to drop your pants under a sheet, which<br>they reach under to work with.<br><br>You should know that it only gets worse the older you get. Once you<br>cross 40, they start checking your prostate, and that check is done via<br>a digital rectal exam. After age 50, they start checking regularly for<br>colon cancer.<br><br>Anyway, if you are uncomfortable with any of these checks, you should<br>discuss that with your parents. If there is really an area of concern<br>there, your parents can help you have the discussion with your doctor.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I\'m a guy and 15 and getting a yearly checkup. I\'m very healthy. Would<br>they make me get naked and look at my dick for some reason if there is<br>nothing wrong with it? Can I refuse?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
