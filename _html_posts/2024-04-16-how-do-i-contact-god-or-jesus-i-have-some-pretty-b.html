It sounds like you've been hurt, and it<br>sounds like you believe that God abandoned you.<br><br>First of all, we hear you. We don't know what your pain is, but we<br>can appreciate the fact that you have it, and it's very personal to you.<br>We get it, and you might be surprised to hear that we all grieve with<br>you.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-213a1f3df956b9a99e8009ae0e5c9dd7){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-213a1f3df956b9a99e8009ae0e5c9dd7" master_w="640"<br>master_h="425"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(Image courtesy*<br>[*Anja*(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=66b7e7&url=https://pixabay.com/users/cocoparisienne-127419/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="pixabay.com"}]{.qlink_container} *at*<br>[*Pixabay*(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b0cafa&url=https://pixabay.com/photos/woman-train-train-compartment-3478437/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="pixabay.com"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br>Next, let's address the elephant in the room: why didn't God help you?<br>It doesn't make sense, right? If this so-called God is so omnipotent and<br>omnipresent, why doesn't He stop bad things from happening? It seems all<br>so pointless.<br><br>First of all, it's the existence of the question which proves the<br>existence of God (i.e. in order to know that something is bad, you must<br>have some knowledge of what is good), but we'll put that answer aside<br>for now.<br><br>For now, let's just phrase your ultimate question in another way: **why<br>do bad things happen to good people?**<br><br>First of all, **if you believe that somehow God is obligated to explain<br>Himself to us, you ought to do a better job reading the Bible**.<br>Proverbs 25:2 says, "It is the glory of God to conceal a matter." Isaiah<br>45:15 says, "Truly You are a God who hides Himself." First Corinthians<br>2:11 says, "No one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God."<br>Deuteronomy 29:29 says, "The secret things belong to the Lord our God"<br>(NKJV). Ecclesiastes 11:5 says, "As you do not know the path of the<br>wind, or how the body is formed in a mother's womb, so you cannot<br>understand the work of God, the Maker of all things." Isaiah 55:8--9<br>says, "'For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My<br>ways,' declares the Lord. 'As the heavens are higher than the earth, so<br>are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts higher than your<br>thoughts.'"<br><br>It appears as if the Bible is telling us we don't have the capacity to<br>understand God's infinite mind or the plans He has for us. It's<br>*arrogance* for us to believe we have the ability to understand the mind<br>of God. It's like you standing over a pregnant mother's womb and trying<br>to explain what life is like on the other side, in such a way that the<br>baby in the womb would understand. That baby simply doesn't yet possess<br>the capacity to understand. Paul told the believers in Corinth, "Now we<br>see but a poor reflection; then we shall see face to face. Now, I know<br>in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known" (1 Cor.<br>13:12). Paul was basically saying that we may not ever gain full<br>understanding while we are alive on earth, and we probably need to learn<br>to accept that.<br><br>We simply don't know what God's plans are right now, and we may never<br>know until we're standing face to face with Him and can ask. God doesn't<br>often reveal His plans to us, so we must continue to live in this state<br>of less-than-complete understanding, but knowing that God will keep His<br>promises in the end.<br><br>Secondly, **no one ever said that being a Christian would mean a<br>problem-free life**. If you've ever looked into any of the lives of the<br>great men and women of the Bible, their lives were not the most<br>glamorous. Look at Joseph. His brothers and sisters hated him so much,<br>they sold him into slavery. When in Egypt, he was thrown in prison,<br>falsely accused of rape, and threatened with execution. During the<br>entire ordeal, there is no indication in the Bible that God explained<br>His plan to Joseph. He was simply expected to live out his life in<br>less-than-complete understanding, as you and I are. *What pleased God<br>was Joseph's faithfulness when nothing else made sense*. Stephen was<br>stoned because he proclaimed God's name. James was put to death with a<br>sword for his faithfulness. Paul was persecuted, stoned, flogged, and<br>beheaded in a Roman prison. During their lifetimes, they never knew<br>God's great plan for them. Jesus said that life wouldn't be easy. He<br>said, "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace.<br>In this world, you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome<br>the world" (John 16:33).<br><br>Throughout the Bible, it tells us not only that bad times can happen,<br>but that we should *expect* bad times to come because they will. Yet<br>somehow, we still expect God to take away all of our problems,<br>spearheading our walk through life with his massive cosmic leaf-blower,<br>clearing our path of any trials, hardships, or pain. This causes a great<br>deal of anxiety, even among long-time faithful, **because life is<br>hard.**<br><br>The Bible tells us to not worry so much about trying to understand or<br>make all the pieces fit together. "Trust in the Lord, lean not on your<br>own understanding" (Prov. 3:5). We are not told to not try to<br>understand, just don't "lean on" your understanding, which means don't<br>make it an ultimatum. Leaning is that pesky desire for answers---or<br>else! "God, you'd better explain yourself, or I'm outta here!" Or as you<br>put it, "I have some pretty bad question for them, I also hate them deep<br>down my heart, I hate them at the point I would refuse go heaven if it<br>means they\'re there, they left me for die." That would be "leaning" on<br>your own understanding, and we are admonished against that.<br><br>So what does this all mean? Basically, expect trouble in life, and<br>expect that there will be situations we do not understand. **Faith is<br>the point at which logic stops making sense**. We must have faith that<br>God will keep His promises, and that everything we go through in this<br>life has a purpose, even though our minds do not have the capacity to<br>understand it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
