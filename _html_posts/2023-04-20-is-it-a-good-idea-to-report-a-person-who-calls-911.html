<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The nice thing about such a person is that they *self-report*.<br><br>When you call 911, the police will indeed find out why you called. And<br>if you make frequent calls with no emergency, you could be charged with<br>misuse of the 911 system.<br><br>In Florida, Misuse of the 911 System is a 1st degree Misdemeanor,<br>meaning up to one year in jail and up to a \$1,000 fine for the first<br>four offenses. One example of a Florida Misdemeanor Misuse of 911 case<br>was a 29-year old Tampa man who called 911 asking the operator for sex.<br>According to the police report, a man called 911 because he ran out of<br>minutes on his phone plan, and 911 was the only free number he could<br>call. He then proceeded to ask the operator about her clothing and her<br>body parts, making obscene remarks about the operator and about<br>masturbation. 15 minutes later, the police arrived at his house and<br>arrested him for misuse of 911. Due to his criminal history, he was<br>taken to jail and held on a \$1,500 bond.<br><br>At the fifth offense, the crime is increased to a 3rd degree Felony,<br>carrying a jail term of up to five years and a fine of up to \$5,000.<br>One example of a Florida Felony Misuse of 911 case is a man who called<br>the Manatee County Sheriff's Office 18 times over a period of two<br>months. His calls were all made to accuse a Deputy Sheriff who lived in<br>his neighborhood of allegedly making out with a prostitute who lived<br>across the street from him. Since the number of calls exceeded four, he<br>was charged with Felony Misuse of 911 and taken to jail.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
