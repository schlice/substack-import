<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a police officer knocks on my door (for whatever reason), I answer<br>it, and in plain view he sees illegal weapons or contraband, can he<br>arrest me?**<br><br>Yes. This is called the "plain sight" exception to the 4th Amendment<br>restriction against unreasonable search.<br><br>If you have illegal anything in plain sight (meaning the officer did not<br>have to move anything or touch anything in order to make it visible),<br>the officer is then allowed to confiscate that evidence and arrest you<br>for its possession, as well as use it as probable cause to conduct a<br>further search.<br><br>You should also note that smelling marijuana in most states is called<br>the "plain smell" exception, and works exactly like the "plain sight"<br>exception. This is true in your car as well. If the officer smells<br>marijuana or alcohol in your car, that provides the probable cause to<br>search your car.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
