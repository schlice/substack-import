<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**A detective knocked on Ann's apartment and asked Ann for a statement<br>about an acquaintance. Ann said she'll get back to them and took their<br>card. It's been 5 days. Are they going to come back and talk to Ann or<br>did it blow over?**<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>It depends on how badly the police need her testimony, and how much<br>their case hinges on learning what she knows.<br><br>It also hinges on how closely Ann is tied to the actions of this<br>acquaintance. Are they asking about something that Ann and the<br>acquaintance may have done together, or something that the acquaintance<br>did and that Ann may have direct knowledge of? If so, the police may be<br>back, and this time, they may ask Ann to come down to the station and<br>give a statement.<br><br>If, however, they merely know that Ann and her acquaintance are just<br>friends, and they are hoping that the acquaintance told Ann something,<br>then not getting Ann's testimony may not bother them too badly.<br><br>To that end, if the acquaintance didn't tell Ann anything, she should<br>tell the police as much so that they do leave her alone. They may be<br>hanging on to some false hope that Ann can help them make their case if<br>they don't hear anything from her. Ann would remain on the list of<br>possible corroborating sources, and if they start running into dead<br>ends, they may try to run down those possible sources.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
