<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would Trump be devastated if it becomes blatantly obvious to him that<br>he is the most unpopular president ever?**<br><br>I was unaware that the Office of the President was actually cover for a<br>popularity contest. Hmm, I'm going to have to go away and rethink my<br>life now.<br><br>But before I go, the presidency is not a popularity contest. Popularity<br>does not make someone effective at their job.<br><br>As a commander, it was nice to be liked, but unnecessary. It's more<br>important that my orders be followed than I be friends with everyone.<br>You're never going to make everyone happy. It reminds me of this quote,<br>attributed to the poet John Lydgate and later adapted by President<br>Lincoln:<br><br>"You can please some of the people all of the time, you can please all<br>of the people some of the time, but you can't please all of the people<br>all of the time".<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
