<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes. Lucifer is a created being.ยน He was created as an angel. He has the<br>most beautiful singing voice which has ever existed. But instead of<br>using that voice to praise God, *he wanted the praise for himself*.<br>Lucifer wanted to be worshipped like God. He was also very jealous of<br>God's penultimate creation: man. He wanted to be God's ultimate<br>creation.<br><br>So he, and about a third of the angels with him, rebelled against God.<br>There was a great battle, and Lucifer and the angels who followed him,<br>were cast out of heaven. Jesus said, "I saw Satan fall like lightning"<br>describing the time that he was cast out of heaven (Luke 10:18).<br><br>Today, Lucifer and his followers (who are now known as "demons") roam<br>the earth causing chaos and sowing dissent, all with the goal of<br>*separating man from God*.<br><br>But Lucifer isn't omniscient. He's not omnipresent, either. He can't<br>hear your thoughts or your prayers. But he can influence you. He can<br>whisper in your ear, in words which sound *exactly like you* in your own<br>mind. He can make you believe something so strongly that you're certain<br>that it must be your own desire that you came up with yourself. All with<br>the goal of leading you into *sin*, which separates you from God.<br><br>\<br><br>ยน The story of Lucifer's fall can be found in Isaiah 14:12-15 and<br>Ezekiel 28:12-19<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
