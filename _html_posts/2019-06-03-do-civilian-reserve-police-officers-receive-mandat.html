<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do civilian reserve police officers receive mandated training before<br>being allowed to act like police officers and carry a badge?**<br><br>Reserve police officers (often called Auxilliary police officers) and<br>Reserve Deputy Sheriffs are indeed fully trained exactly as their<br>full-time counterparts. They are certified by the State's POST (Peace<br>Officers Standardization and Training) Board, and their training is<br>legitimate and legal under State law. Once they have received<br>appropriate training in accordance with POST standards, they are sworn<br>and badged. In Colorado, POST recognizes a Reserve Deputy Sheriff as a<br>unique law enforcement category with its own training path, comprising<br>over 300 hours of classroom instruction (all completed nights and<br>weekends), 50 hours of firearms, 40 hours of driving, and 40 hours of<br>arrest control.<br><br>Also, to clarify your question, when a Reservist is working, he or she<br>is a full law enforcement officer, able to perform all the duties and<br>responsibilities of any law enforcement officer of his grade and rank.<br>When they are not working, they are civilians.<br><br>How do licensed police officers feel about reserves?<br><br>When I was going through training, I'd run into deputies in the station<br>house. They'd recognize my uniform as a trainee and ask about why we<br>were training at night, and I'd mention that we were a class full of<br>Reservists. To a man, they'd all say something like "wow, that's cool<br>what you guys do, we really appreciate your help" and words to that<br>effect. They know we're out there doing the job just like they are, but<br>we're not getting paid for it. They appreciate us.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
