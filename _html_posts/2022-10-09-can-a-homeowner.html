<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The short answer is yes.<br><br>The longer answer is that the HOA must put a *lien* on the house for the<br>amount of the unpaid dues, fees, fines, or anything else the homeowner<br>owes. Once the lien is attached, the homeowner no longer deals with the<br>HOA, but with the HOA's attorney, and the attorney's fees also get added<br>to what the homeowner owes. The attorney *may* work out a payment plan<br>with the delinquent homeowner. Note that I said *may*, they are under no<br>obligation to do so.<br><br>Once the amount of the unpaid money reaches a specific level (varies by<br>state), the attorney (as proxy for the HOA) can foreclose on the lien,<br>sell the property and collect their unpaid money from the proceeds.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can a homeowner\'s association (HOA) foreclose on a property if the<br>owner has not paid HOA fees or fines, and the property is paid off?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
