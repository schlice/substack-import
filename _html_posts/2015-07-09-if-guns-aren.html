<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Your comparison is logically incorrect, which is why you<br>found a dichotomy where there is none.\<br>\<br>\"Guns don\'t kill people, people kill people.\"\<br>\"Guns are the best deterrent against bad guys.\"\<br>\<br>These are not diametrically opposed statements. The first statement<br>shows that there has to be a will behind the gun in order to take a<br>life. A person has to choose to take a life. The gun is just a tool. The<br>gun is very efficient at its job, which is taking lives. But the gun<br>does not take a life on its own: someone with a will to take a life must<br>make the gun do its job.\<br>\<br>The second statement does not oppose the first; it states another fact,<br>except you have an incomplete thought, which may be where your confusion<br>lies. The whole thought is: \"The best deterrent against a bad guy<br>with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\" This thought simply puts<br>into more simple language the common law principle of meeting force with<br>equal force. If you are being presented with deadly force, the best<br>deterrent is someone else wielding deadly force.\<br>\<br>These two statements are not diametrically opposed, so there is no<br>dichotomy.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
