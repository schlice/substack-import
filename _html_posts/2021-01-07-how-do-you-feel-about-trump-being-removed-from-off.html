<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do you feel about Trump being removed from office? Schumer is<br>calling for him to be removed.**<br><br>Senator Schumer knows how to remove Trump from office. His branch is<br>part of the process to do it.<br><br>That process is *impeachment*.<br><br>If the Senator from New York believes that Congress should act, he<br>should call his colleague over in the House of Representatives, Speaker<br>Nancy Pelosi, and push her to draft Articles of Impeachment.<br><br>He's done this before, just two years ago, in fact. His memory isn't so<br>bad that he doesn't remember.<br><br>But he also knows that there's no way in the seven levels of Hell that<br>they'll be able to get it done in two weeks. Congress can't even<br>formulate a coherent thought in two weeks, let alone impeach and hold a<br>trial in that amount of time.<br><br>At the very least, Congress should do what they can: they should<br>*censure* the President so that it is in writing that they disagree<br>with his behavior. That's literally the best they will be able to<br>accomplish before he leaves office, thanks to the voters.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
