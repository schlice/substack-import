<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>For starters, like [[Luke<br>Hayter](https://www.quora.com/profile/Luke-Hayter)]{.qlink_container}<br>said, keep your nose clean. But just because you may have gotten<br>yourself into some minor teenage trouble, don\'t think you\'re<br>immediately disqualified. Everyone understands you\'re a teenager and<br>you\'ll do stupid teenage stuff. *Consistently* doing the same<br>stupid stuff would be a red flag. Doing something stupid *and learning<br>from it* is normal.<br><br>At your age, I\'d suggest you do the best you can in school, be involved<br>in sports teams or pursue a workout schedule to maintain physical<br>fitness, and be an example in your community and in your home life. Be a<br>leader.<br><br>If you go to college first, I\'d suggest a Criminal Justice degree or<br>something along those lines.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
