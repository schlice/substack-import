<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Moving slowly and methodically, carefully sweeping for IEDs, and taking<br>the occasional hits in the vehicles designed to take the hits.<br><br>I would strongly suggest looking up a TV show which ran on G4 called<br>"Bomb Patrol: Afghanistan". I'm sure you can find reruns or possibly<br>full episodes online. The description for the show reads:<br><br>> *This documentary series, narrated by actor Josh Duhamel, follows an<br>> eight-man unit from the U.S. Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal,<br>> otherwise known as EOD, during the unit\'s five-month campaign in<br>> Afghanistan. The EOD is the world\'s premier combat force for<br>> countering improvised explosive devices, weapons of mass destruction<br>> and other types of weaponry. The program highlights all aspects of the<br>> unit\'s deployment \-- from the life-or-death missions to humorous,<br>> lighthearted moments shared by the<br>> brothers-in-arms.*\[1\](#ptvGX){#cite-ptvGX .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ptvGX){.citation_index} [[bomb patrol afghanistan - Google<br>Search](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6976b9&url=https://www.google.com/search?q%3Dbomb%2Bpatrol%2Bafghanistan){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
