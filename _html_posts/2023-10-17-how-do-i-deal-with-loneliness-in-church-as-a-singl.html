<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's 2023. Have you tried [[Christian<br>Mingle](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=81c10f&url=https://www.christianmingle.com/en-us){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="christianmingle.com"}]{.qlink_container}?<br><br>In all seriousness, have you noticed that **churches have gotten away<br>from singles groups?** There are lots of reasons for this, and I'm sure<br>if you asked your church why they don't have a singles group, they'd<br>tell you why.<br><br>Deep down, I think part of the problem is that Christians (wrongly) have<br>an *expectation* that couples are married. There is a concomitant stigma<br>placed on singles in a church, as if something must be *wrong* with<br>them. Therefore, church singles groups feel very...desperate. As if they<br>*need* to be married in order to be accepted.<br><br>And some church singles groups may give off the unspoken message that<br>your life is not meaningful unless you're married. Just look at some of<br>the titles of singles group study topics I found online:<br><br>- Discovering God's Plan for You as a Single<br>- Finding Contentment as a Single Person<br>- How to Know Your Purpose as a Single<br><br>I'm certain that the churches in these cases were well-meaning, but the<br>unintended implication in these titles is that people who are married<br>have a greater calling in life than those who are single. This<br>implication causes many Christian singles to believe they are<br>*insufficient* as a single person.<br><br>It\'s natural for singles to desire to be married, especially in a<br>Christian context. But it\'s also important not to make this the central<br>motivation of our lives. Instead, we should learn to be content in our<br>circumstances and find joy in each day. I think we need to find a<br>balance between seeking a spouse and waiting for God to bring the right<br>person into our lives.<br><br>The search for a spouse should always begin with prayer. When we take<br>pleasure in knowing Him and we trust Him with our future, He will put<br>His desires on our heart. In the context of a spouse, that means<br>desiring the type of spouse that He would desire for us. Doing this<br>means accepting His will for our lives. Whatever He says is best for us<br>is what we should want.<br><br>When we live in the peace of God's love for us, we can be happy in<br>whatever season we find ourselves in. A person who lives joyfully and<br>with God's purpose is *naturally* attractive! When you live this way,<br>you will naturally attract people to you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
