<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Legal rights just protect people from themselves. What do you think?<br><br>While I'm not about doing your homework for you, I can at least provide<br>a cogent answer.<br><br>*That is exactly the opposite of good law*.<br><br>The entire existence of law allows human beings to live together without<br>their individual rights infringing on each other. Laws which do nothing<br>other than protect you from you makes bad law. It's the "nanny state"<br>mentality. You can't have a 32 ounce soda because sugar is bad for you.<br>You must wear a helmet when you ride a bicycle or a motorcycle because<br>you could fall off and injure your brain. And when you're a passenger in<br>a car, you have to wear a seatbelt because you could die if you don't.<br><br>By the way, I get the arguments about the cost to the public from<br>obesity, and the incremental cost to the public from those without<br>health insurance, and the possibility that you could become a missile<br>within a car and impact the driver in a crash. But those are not the<br>reasons given when passing these laws, which makes those arguments<br>*incidental*, not *primary* drivers of those laws.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
