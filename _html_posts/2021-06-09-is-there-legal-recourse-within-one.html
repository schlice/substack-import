<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Generally, no. Amazon is a privately-owned business, and as such, they<br>have the right to control who participates in their online community and<br>who does not. You do not gain or lose anything by being permitted to<br>review products on their website.<br><br>They also are under no obligation to tell you what you may or may not<br>have done wrong when writing reviews on their site.<br><br>If you can articulate some form of loss that you have suffered due to<br>not being allowed to review products, then perhaps you can hire an<br>attorney and file a lawsuit claiming damages.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is there legal recourse within one\'s own state if Amazon blocks<br>reviews? Maybe with the attorney general? They suspended me without<br>specific explanation and are preventing legitimate reviews from being<br>heard. This used to be called fraud.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
