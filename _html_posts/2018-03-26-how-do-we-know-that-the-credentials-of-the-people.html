<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do we know that the credentials of the people who answer these<br>questions are legit? I could easily say that I was a professional<br>psychiatrist et. al. What do you all think?**<br><br>You don't.<br><br>Originally when Quora was founded, that was the idea. Credentials would<br>be verified, and you would know that you were getting answers from<br>people who were legitimate.<br><br>However, that model was deemed to be too unworkable. It was supplanted<br>by, and eschewed in favor of, the upvote system.<br><br>- An upvote is given for *high-quality content*, not for content<br>  with which you personally agree.<br>- A downvote is given for *low-quality content.*<br><br>Additionally, if content is factually incorrect, the content can be<br>reported to Quora Moderation for removal.<br><br>The idea is much more akin to the way many individual editors make<br>Wikipedia a quality product. Many individual upvoters validating the<br>quality of the content make it valuable. It's often confused with the<br>"like" system that everyone knows from Facebook: popular content gets<br>"liked," but there's no "dislike" button in Facebook. There's a downvote<br>button in Quora. That's because the upvote system is unlike the<br>likes system in that you don't upvote answers or comments with which<br>you agree. You upvote answers or comments which are *accurate, and<br>high-quality.*<br><br>Finally, you cited "professional psychiatrist" as something you could<br>masquerade as while answering. **Understand that answers given on Quora<br>are not professional advice.** Lawyers who answer on Quora are not<br>providing legal advice. Doctors who answer on Quora are not providing<br>professional medical advice. Answers provided on Quora are for *general<br>informational use only*. If you need a psychiatrist, you should go see<br>one. You shouldn't be asking random strangers on the Internet about your<br>psychological issues.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
