<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>God's mind is infinite, and God does not dwell in spacetime, like we do.<br>In order for God to "change His mind," He would have to exist in one<br>state of mind "before" He changed His mind (which already, He can't do),<br>and then He would have to learn of something He didn't know before<br>(which He also can't do because He knows all) and then He would have to<br>use that "new information" to do something differently.<br><br>So God doesn't "change His mind." But God does take our free choices<br>into consideration when He made plans for how everything would unfold<br>for all eternity.<br><br>This is challenging concept to wrap our brains around, because we are<br>constrained by life inside of spacetime. But let's try a few scenarios<br>to see if we can understand it somewhat (if not completely):<br><br>Let's say that Dave's wife has cancer. **Dave prays fervently for his<br>wife to be healed** of the cancer, and Dave gets his whole church to do<br>the same. Dave knows that God may not choose to heal his wife, but he<br>demonstrates his faith in God and recognizes God's power to heal his<br>wife. He requests that God would heal his wife and extend her life if<br>God is willing to do so. **Let's say that God chooses to heal Dave's<br>wife in response to the prayer** of Dave and the others in his church.<br><br>Now, on the one hand, God eternally knew that He was going to allow<br>Dave's wife to have cancer and **He eternally knew that He would heal<br>Dave's wife. But, on the other hand, we must not forget that God<br>also eternally knew that Dave would freely choose to pray fervently for<br>the healing of his wife, and God eternally knew that He would respond to<br>that prayer**.<br><br>In this way, God allowed for Dave to make the free choice to pray<br>fervently for the healing of his wife, which He already knew would<br>happen, and knowing that it would happen, God already planned for all of<br>eternity to heal Dave's wife in response to that free-choice prayer. So<br>in a way, God already knew that Dave would pray to heal his wife, and so<br>He took those prayers into consideration when He determined what would<br>happen to this universe and everything in it from all of eternity.<br><br>Now, let's say that God eternally knew that Dave would *not*<br>pray for his wife to be healed. If Dave and the others chose not to<br>pray for his wife because they believed that prayer would do no good<br>because God's plans are already fixed, then God would have eternally<br>known that, and He would have taken that into account in His plans for<br>how the world would unfold. In this case, God's eternal plan may, or may<br>not, have included healing Dave's wife at all. But, as it is, **God<br>eternally knew that Dave *would* pray for his wife, and so (from<br>eternity past) God took this into account in His plans**.<br><br>So, even though God eternally knows what He is going to do about<br>everything (unlike humans who decide things as we go), He also eternally<br>knows what we humans will freely choose to do at our moment of choice<br>(including our prayers), and He incorporates our free choices into His<br>eternal plans for us. However, like we already mentioned, our prayers do<br>not cause God to "change His mind." God's decision to answer Dave's<br>prayer was already made, and the course of action God took was also<br>already eternally chosen, based on Dave's decision (at the moment of<br>choice) to pray fervently for the healing of his wife.<br><br>So God's actions are known from all eternity, but our decisions are made<br>on the fly, and we don't know what we will choose at that moment. But<br>God, being omnipotent, sees all spacetime as "now." The past is now. The<br>present is now. The future is now. When God made His plans for how<br>everything would turn out, He already took into consideration what we<br>were going to freely choose, and He used those free choices to determine<br>how the universe would unfold, which He already knew for all eternity.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
