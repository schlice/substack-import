<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, I respect Justice Stevens for his work.<br><br>However, some of his statements in his article are incorrect at best,<br>and intentionally inflammatory at worst.<br><br>For example, he states the following:<br><br>> *For over 200 years after the adoption of the Second Amendment, it was<br>> uniformly understood as not placing any limit on either federal or<br>> state authority to enact gun control legislation. In 1939 the Supreme<br>> Court unanimously held that Congress could prohibit the possession of<br>> a sawed-off shotgun because that weapon had no reasonable relation to<br>> the preservation or efficiency of a "well regulated militia."*<br><br>This is incorrect. The court in *US v. Miller* (which is a case we<br>generally do not like to cite because Miller nor his counsel was present<br>to defend himself) did not hold that a sawed-off shotgun had no<br>reasonable relation to the preservation of a "well-regulated militia"<br>which implies that the right guaranteed in the Second Amendment is<br>inextricably tied to militia service, which has always been untrue. The<br>court *actually* held that a sawed-off shotgun could be regulated<br>because *it was not in common use in the military*. *Miller* imposed the<br>"common use" test that we use today.<br><br>But "common use" is not all we look at when we discuss firearms, because<br>clearly, fully-automatic M-16s and M4s are in "common use" in today's<br>military, and those items are also restricted from civilian ownership.<br>So clearly there is more than just "common use."<br><br>He goes on to say:<br><br>> *In 2008, the Supreme Court overturned Chief Justice Burger's and<br>> others' long-settled understanding of the Second Amendment's limited<br>> reach by ruling, in District of Columbia v. Heller, that there was an<br>> individual right to bear arms.*<br><br>He's not only being deceitful here, but he's performing an activity<br>known as "revisionist history." If anything, *Heller* corrected some of<br>the incorrect interpretations of the Second Amendment being a collective<br>right and cemented the traditional, natural-rights based understanding<br>that the Second Amendment is actually an individual right, as it was<br>intended to be.<br><br>There was no long-settled understanding of anything related to the<br>Second Amendment, and *Miller* certainly didn't confer any idea that gun<br>ownership was only relegated to service in a "well regulated militia" as<br>he likes to believe. If that were the case, 44 state constitutions would<br>have had to be re-written because they all guarantee their citizens the<br>right to keep and bear arms while not serving in an organized state<br>militia. Indeed, even Federal law would have needed to be overturned, as<br>it classifies all citizens as members of the unorganized militia. Notice<br>that Federal law was *not* repealed, even after *Miller. Nothing* is<br>ever "long-settled" when it comes to the SCOTUS.<br><br>Then he goes on to say<br><br>> *Overturning \DC v. Heller\ via a constitutional amendment to get<br>> rid of the Second Amendment would be simple and would do more to<br>> weaken the N.R.A.'s ability to stymie legislative debate and block<br>> constructive gun control legislation than any other available option.*<br><br>So the question remains: *Is repealing the Second Amendment simple?*<br><br>To answer that question, we first need to answer the question of how you<br>repeal a Constitutional amendment. So how do you do it? *You must pass<br>another amendment to overturn the Second Amendment.*<br><br>There are two ways to draft an amendment to the Constitution:<br><br>1.  Two thirds of Congress can pass a Bill of Amendment (that means you<br>    need a supermajority in both houses of Congress)<br>2.  Two thirds of the states can vote to call a Constitutional<br>    Convention to draft and approve an Amendment. This is sometimes<br>    called an "Article V Convention" since Article V of the Constitution<br>    authorizes it.<br><br>Note that in the entire history of our nation, an Article V Convention<br>has never been called. Apparently, it's easier to get a supermajority of<br>Congress to pass a Bill of Amendment than it is to get two thirds of the<br>states to call for an Article V Convention.<br><br>So that's a pretty big hurdle in and of itself to overcome: you'd have<br>to get two thirds of Congress to approve an Amendment which repeals the<br>Second Amendment. And thanks to the direct election of Senators, every<br>single Member of Congress is directly beholden to the people, so they<br>will all only vote as the people want them to vote. So if there's no<br>supermajority of American citizens who want to repeal the Second<br>Amendment, Congress certainly won't pass a Bill of Amendment which does<br>just that.<br><br>But let's assume that somehow, you can get a supermajority of Congress<br>to pass a Bill of Amendment which repeals the Second Amendment. You<br>still have to *ratify* the amendment before it becomes part of the<br>Constitution. Ratification requires three fourths of the State<br>legislatures (38 states) to vote to ratify the amendment for inclusion<br>into the Constitution. Therefore, you have to have a majority of<br>legislatures in 38 separate states (not just New York, California,<br>Illinois and Massachusetts) vote to repeal the Second Amendment by<br>ratifying a new amendment. A second method of ratification is [[state<br>ratifying<br>conventions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b151fc&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_ratifying_conventions){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, which have been used<br>only one time in US history: to ratify the 21st Amendment.<br>Interestingly, the 21st Amendment was the Amendment which repealed the<br>18th Amendment, which introduced Prohibition.<br><br>Does that sound "simple" to you? I believe Justice Stevens' definition<br>of "simple" is much different than mine is, as well as his<br>interpretation of SCOTUS' legislative history.<br><br>None of this says anything at all about how you can get 300 million guns<br>out of the hands of citizens when you do repeal the Second Amendment.<br>Can you simply make all guns illegal to possess? Article 1 Paragraph 9<br>of the Constitution prohibits Congress from passing any laws which apply<br>*ex post facto* and Article 1 Paragraph 10 applies the same restriction<br>on the states. Can you do a buyback? The Fifth Amendment requires you to<br>pay fair market value for the guns. You think the government has enough<br>money to pay fair market value for 300 million guns? They couldn't print<br>money fast enough! I mean, if it was so "simple" to repeal the Second<br>Amendment, you may as well repeal Article 1 paragraphs 9 and 10 so you<br>can make possession of a gun a crime, and repeal the Fifth Amendment as<br>well so you can avoid having to pay fair market value for any<br>now-illegal guns you seize.<br><br>And what if people simply don't turn the guns in? You need warrants<br>before you can search people's homes. You'd next have to repeal the<br>Fourth Amendment as well as the Fifth Amendment so that you can bust<br>into every home in America without a warrant and attempt to seize the<br>guns. If I was an active cop at that time, I'd certainly not volunteer<br>to do that.<br><br>I suppose, alternatively, you could then repeal the Posse Comitatus Act<br>and force the military and the National Guard to do it, but by that<br>point, you've destroyed enough of the Constitution that you've then<br>simply guaranteed the next Civil War.<br><br>**TL;DR: There is absolutely nothing simple at all about repealing the<br>Second Amendment, and it's only the beginning of the troubles that doing<br>so would cause.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
