<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's not "contradictory." It's "illogical." It's what we call "blind<br>faith." Nevertheless, millions of believers who have been believers<br>their whole lives have believed without understanding *why* they believe<br>or *what* they believe and if there is any good evidence to support<br>their belief. That doesn't invalidate their belief (they believe the<br>right thing, and it matches what they know in their heart), but it's<br>still blind faith.<br><br>This is where the discipline of *apologetics* comes into play.<br>Apologetics is the discipline of defending religious doctrine through<br>systematic argumentation and discourse. The word "apologetics" comes<br>from the Greek ἀπολογία, which translates to "speaking in defense."<br><br>Despite what most people think about apologetics, that those of us who<br>practice it are just out to prove everyone wrong, we apologists are<br>actually here to prove ourselves *right*, to ourselves. We'd love to<br>impart some knowledge along the way, but apologetics allows us to<br>worship *better*.<br><br>The Great Commandment in Christianity is to love the Lord your God with<br>all your heart, all your soul, all your strength, and most importantly<br>in this context, all your mind. How do you love God with your mind?<br>You prepare yourself to answer questions of faith, like why do you<br>believe what you believe.<br><br>> *All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for<br>> reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the<br>> man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work. --- 2<br>> Timothy 3:16-17 (ESV)*<br><br>Apologetics helps the godly man to be "equipped" to do the work of God.<br>Our men's Bible study was titled "Equippers" for this reason.<br><br>TL;DR: It is possible to have belief alone without evidence. It<br>doesn't discount the belief and it doesn't minimize the faith. But the<br>faith could be *so much deeper* if the believer understood the why's<br>and how's behind what they believe.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
