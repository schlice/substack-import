Why do<br/>they choose schools? Movie theaters? Because while they are insane, they<br/>are not stupid. They want the biggest \"bang for their buck\" (no pun<br/>intended) with the least possibility of dying before they kill as many<br/>people as possible. So they go to the places that are most likely to<br/>meet the least armed resistance and kill the most people.\<br/>\<br/>So again: if you were going to go commit a mass murder, which one of<br/>those two establishments would you commit your crime at?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
