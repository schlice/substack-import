Maybe just scale back your Quora usage a bit, so you have more<br>time to go off and do more "meaningful things."<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Should a 15-year-old impulsive sensitive unkind ADHD diagnosed girl like<br>me quit Quora and do meaningful things instead?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
