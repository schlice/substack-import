<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'m with [[Bryan<br>Todd](https://www.quora.com/profile/Bryan-Todd)]{.qlink_container} on<br>this one. I strongly disagree with the Pope and his position on people<br>who manufacture weapons.\<br>\<br>**TL;DR: The Bible is full of references showing us when it is<br>appropriate to take a life, and that God expected us to be armed to meet<br>threats to ourselves and our families.**\<br>\<br>The weapon is a tool. Yes, it is a tool designed to kill, but as we all<br>know, killing is allowed in certain circumstances. We refer to this as<br>the natural law, or natural rights. Killing is different from murder.<br>Murder is the unlawful taking of a life, while killing is the lawful<br>taking of a life.\<br>\<br>But what does the Bible say about killing? There were times that God<br>told His people to go to war. God never tells His people to sin, so<br>therefore going to war and killing is not sinful in and of itself. There<br>are many examples in the Bible where soldiers are not rebuked for being<br>soldiers and taking lives on the battlefield.\<br>\<br>The Bible also says you shall not murder. Some translations say you<br>shall not kill, but most Bible scholars believe the translation of the<br>Hebrew word for \"kill\" means the unlawful taking of a legally innocent<br>life.\<br>\<br>Also, in Leviticus, God differentiates the lawful taking of a life and<br>the unlawful taking of one:\<br>\<br>*Leviticus 24*\<br>*15 Say to the Israelites: "Anyone who curses their God will be held<br>responsible;* *16 anyone who blasphemes the name of the Lord is to be<br>put to death. The entire assembly must stone them. Whether foreigner or<br>native-born, when they blaspheme the Name they are to be put to death.<br>17 Anyone who takes the life of a human being is to be put to death."*<br>(NIV)\<br>\<br>The Bible shows that blasphemy is a crime punishable by death, and \"the<br>entire assemby\" is to carry out the punishment and kill the blasphemer.<br>Again, God does not tell His people to sin, so the killing of the<br>blasphemer is not a sin.\<br>\<br>Probably the most interesting passage relating to killing is in Exodus:\<br>\<br>*Exodus 22*\<br>*2 If a thief is caught breaking in at night and is struck a fatal blow,<br>the defender is not guilty of bloodshed; 3 but if it happens after<br>sunrise, the defender is guilty of bloodshed. Anyone who steals must<br>certainly make restitution, but if they have nothing, they must be sold<br>to pay for their theft.* (NIV)\<br>\<br>God isn\'t making the difference in the hour (you can only kill during<br>the day), but our ability to determine the intent of the \"thief.\" At<br>night, it\'s dark and you can\'t tell whether or not the thief is<br>intending to do you harm. During the day, you can. So if you kill the<br>thief during the day, when you could tell the level of harm that was to<br>come to you (and the thief did not intend to hurt you, just take your<br>stuff), you must be held to account for that killing. So what we see<br>here is that God says that we must make the effort to determine the<br>threat to ourselves, and if there is no threat to us or to our family,<br>killing is not justified.\<br>\<br>It also goes on to say that the thief doesn\'t get to go free here.<br>Anyone who steals must certainly make restitution, so the thief is to be<br>apprehended and turned over to the authorities for punishment and<br>restitution, but not killed.\<br>\<br>Jesus even told His disciples to be armed:\<br>\<br>*Luke 22*\<br>*35 Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you without purse, bag or<br>sandals, did you lack anything?" "Nothing," they answered. 36 He said to<br>them "But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you<br>don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one. 37 It is written: 'And<br>he was numbered with the transgressors'; and I tell you that this must<br>be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its<br>fulfillment." 38 The disciples said, "See, Lord, here are two swords."<br>"That's enough!" he replied.* (NIV)\<br>\<br>Jesus expected His disciples to be armed because there was a threat<br>coming. He also showed that he expected the threat to be bad enough that<br>you\'d \"sell your cloak\" to buy one. Your cloak was the Swiss Army<br>Knife of the time. It was a coat, a bedsheet, a pillow, a blanket, or a<br>tent. It was one of the most important garments you could own. And Jesus<br>said that a sword was so important that you should sell your cloak to<br>get one.\<br>\<br>Verse 38 shows us that Jesus expected us to arm for the threat at hand.<br>Two swords was enough. Enough for what? To meet the threat that He knew<br>was coming. We arm to meet the threat.\<br>\<br>These Bible passages show us that God expected us to arm to protect<br>ourselves. These form the basis of the natural law we talk about,<br>showing that we have a natural right to self-defense. The Bible is the<br>source for this natural law, as all authority is granted by God.\<br>\<br>The Pope\'s view of weapons manufacturers, therefore, is not aligned<br>with the Bible\'s teachings about self-defense and<br>killing.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
