<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Hello, thank you for the A2A.<br><br>First of all, people with pacemakers are not at increased risk of their<br>pacemaker malfunctioning after being hit with a Taser. Studies have been<br>completed which proved that the Taser does not adversely affect<br>pacemakers or ICDs.\[1\](#hWUTP){#cite-hWUTP<br>.citation_link}\[2\](#PesrW){#cite-PesrW .citation_link}<br><br>However, they probably have some underlying problem with their heart<br>(which is why they have a pacemaker in the first place). And Tasers<br>can affect your heart if you have an underlying heart condition.<br><br>There really isn't any practical clothing which can stop the barbs from<br>penetrating. They are very good at penetrating even thick layers of<br>clothing. Unless it's the middle of winter and you're in heavy coats and<br>many layers, the dart will probably penetrate.<br><br>Your best possible defense could be chain mail, but it's really heavy<br>and impractical to wear on a regular basis.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-hWUTP){.citation_index} [[Do electrical stun guns<br>(TASER-X26) affect the functional integrity of implantable pacemakers<br>and defibrillators? -<br>PubMed](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=63a3a4&url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17491105/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nih.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-PesrW){.citation_index} [[TASER is safe for<br>pacemakers](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=551e54&url=https://www.policeprofessional.com/news/taser-is-safe-for-pacemakers/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="policeprofessional.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
