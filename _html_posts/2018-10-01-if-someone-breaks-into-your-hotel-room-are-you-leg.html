<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If someone breaks into your hotel room, are you legally allowed to use<br>a gun in self defense (in the US)?**<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>There are two main things which determine whether or not you can have a<br>gun in your hotel room:<br><br>- Gun carry laws in the state in which you are in<br>- The rules of the specific hotel<br><br>If the hotel does not allow you to keep your legal firearm with you in<br>your room, they had better provide adequate security, as hotels have in<br>the past paid high monetary penalties when "inadequate security" caused<br>guests to be attacked in their properties.<br><br>But even if you have a gun in your hotel room, regardless of whether or<br>not the state or the hotel allows you to have it there, the question<br>asked if you can use it for self defense. The answer is that **in nearly<br>every state, if you are in fear for your life, you can employ whatever<br>force you have at your disposal, including deadly force, to safeguard<br>your life.** Even in "duty to retreat" states, there's only one entrance<br>into your hotel room and it's highly unlikely you can escape from that<br>room.<br><br>So to answer (and qualify) the question: if someone breaks into your<br>hotel room and you are in fear for your life, you can use whatever<br>force you have at your disposal, up to and including deadly force, to<br>protect your life.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
