It\'s not even a violation of UCMJ to publicly announce your<br>opinion.<br><br>It may be a policy violation to speak on behalf of the Air Force when<br>you are not authorized to do so, but that still doesn\'t rise to the<br>level of a crime.<br><br>Since it\'s not illegal to be openly gay, not is it illegal to have an<br>opinion about SRS, neither qualify as a reason to relieve a decorated<br>officer from her job.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
