<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would it help or hurt Donald Trump if he testified at his second<br>impeachment trial?**<br><br>Neither.<br><br>No one in the Senate uses that trial to change their opinions. The trial<br>is for your benefit, and the benefit of the media.<br><br>I'm ready to make a wager for you right now: I already knew that the<br>Senate would vote to grant themselves the authority to hold the trial,<br>somehow usurping the authority of the Judiciary and declaring that the<br>trial is constitutional (which they are not allowed to do). At best,<br>they can declare that they have the authority to try a former president,<br>which is in essence what they have done, even though (as Trump's<br>attorneys argued) it amounts to a *Bill of Attainder* and is thus<br>unconstitutional.<br><br>So you'll find a number of Republicans who do not vote to convict simply<br>because they too believe that it is unconstitutional.<br><br>But what you will not find is 67 Senators to vote to convict. I<br>predict that regardless of the "evidence" presented in the "trial," you<br>will not find 67 Senators to vote to convict Trump.<br><br>So because it will neither help nor hurt the President's case for him to<br>speak, he will not.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
