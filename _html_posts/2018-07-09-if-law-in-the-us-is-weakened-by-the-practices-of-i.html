<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If law in the US is weakened by the practices of imprisoning migrants<br>without due process and stripping them of their children, what is to<br>stop the government from doing it to legal American citizens?**<br><br>What do you mean, what's to stop the government from doing it to<br>American citizens? We already do. Every day. We strip children from<br>people without due process.<br><br>It's called what happens when you get arrested.<br><br>Whether you're illegally entering the country at the border, or whether<br>you just got arrested on a drug charge, we strip your children away.<br>That's the law.<br><br>It doesn't weaken US law. It shows that we are *enforcing* US law. If<br>Congress is so keen on not taking children from their parents, Congress<br>should change that law (which was affirmed by the courts, by the way).<br><br>But what would you have law enforcement do instead? Build *Mommy and Me*<br>jails? Family prison? Certainly don't want to strip people of their<br>children, so they all go to jail! Sounds fair to me.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
