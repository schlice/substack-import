<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So let's assume a few things:<br><br>1.  You have a valid marriage license, fully executed, issued by your<br>    state.<br>2.  Your wife became pregnant through consensual sexual intercourse<br>    before you were married.<br><br>Your rights are no different than the hetero couples where this happens.<br><br>There are a few natural problems with this scenario. In a hetero<br>marriage, when a baby is born "into the marriage," it is assumed that<br>the man is the father until that assumption is challenged. However, in<br>your specific case, you are clearly not presumed to be the father.<br>Nevertheless, the father still has to come forward and file a petition<br>to establish a Parent Child relationship before any of his rights will<br>be recognized, and his responsibilities kick in.<br><br>As responsibilities go, he will have to pay child support and provide<br>health insurance or reimburse you for it. He would also be on the hook<br>for college expenses, as well as the child having a claim on his estate.<br><br>As far as rights are concerned, depending on how long it takes for the<br>father to step forward, he may not be granted visitation, and<br>considering that the child was born into your marriage, the court will<br>look askance at disrupting that relationship.<br><br>If the father files a petition to establish a parent child relationship,<br>you should immediately engage the services of a qualified attorney in<br>your area, especially one who specializes in family law.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What are my rights as a same sex female couple if my wife got pregnant<br>during our Engagement through natural conception from a fling. We are<br>married and the baby was born into the Marriage I signed the birth<br>certifiacte.?<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice.
