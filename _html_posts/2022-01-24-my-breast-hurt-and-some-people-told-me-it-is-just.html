<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sounds like you are younger and still developing.<br><br>There are lots of reasons for breast pain, and most of them are quite<br>benign. In your case, it probably has much more to do with hormones than<br>anything else. Hormones are the number one reason women experience<br>breast pain. The changes in estrogen and progesterone in your body cause<br>reactions in breast tissue, which can sometimes make them sore.<br><br>There are some other things which can be causing your breast pain:<br><br>- An injury that you may have forgotten about, either on your breast or<br>  in your chest wall (like a pulled muscle)<br>- An unsupportive bra. While you are still growing, you need to make<br>  sure that you're wearing a supportive bra. Otherwise, the ligaments<br>  which connect the breast tissue to the chest may become overstretched<br>  and painful by the end of the day. Make sure your bra is the correct<br>  size and provides you with good support.<br>- Medication. If you're on certain medications, breast pain can be a<br>  side effect. Check with your pharmacist to see if any of the<br>  medications you may be on can cause breast pain as a side effect.<br>- A cyst. Be careful to watch for lumps in your breasts while you're<br>  growing. If you find any, talk to your parents right away.<br><br>The big takeaway: the vast majority of breast pain is transient (i.e.<br>goes away on its own) and is not dangerous. If you have breast pain that<br>continues, nothing makes it better (warm compress, showers, Tylenol), or<br>gets worse, or is accompanied by lumps in your breasts, please see your<br>doctor.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>My breast hurt, and some people told me it is just growing. Is there a<br>way to make them stop hurting? Is rubbing them with lotion masturbation?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
