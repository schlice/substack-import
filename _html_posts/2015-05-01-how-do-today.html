<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The technology does not yet exist to be able to scan<br>multiple image sources real-time, do image recognition to convert the<br>image of a license plate to a recognizable number, and then parse that<br>through a database of wanted plates.\<br>\<br>That technology is not too far off. If you\'ve not yet heard of \"big<br>data,\" it\'s okay, that sort of technology is currently only bandied<br>about in IT circles. It\'s the technology that allows a company like<br>Gilette to monitor the live Twitter feed and watch for the tweet where a<br>guy says he\'s on a business trip and he forgot his razor. The system<br>recognizes this and replies to his tweet with a coupon for a new Gilette<br>razor. That sort of technology requires massive computing power, and<br>technology that can take very large quantities of unordered data and<br>make sense out of it.\<br>\<br>Police departments don\'t have the budget for that kind of tech.\<br>\<br>They use, as [[Alex<br>Kutz](https://www.quora.com/profile/Alex-Kutz)]{.qlink_container} said,<br>the radio. It\'s called a BOLO (which stands for \"Be On the LookOut\")<br>and they are sometimes distributed during shift change briefings, or<br>over the radio or the MDT.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
