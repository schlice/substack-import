<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I'm wanting to join the Air Force and wondering if anyone knows how<br>to. When you get your pilot slot, how do you get the B-2 Spirit Bomber<br>as your aircraft?**<br><br>Since I not only joined the Air Force, but I served my time and got out,<br>I think I qualify as "knowing how to."<br><br>First, let's address how to join if you want to be a pilot. In order to<br>be a pilot, you must be a commissioned officer. Commissioned officers<br>come from three commissioning sources: the Reserve Officer Training<br>Corps (ROTC), Officer Training School (OTS), or the US Air Force Academy<br>(USAFA). ROTC is a program you attend while in college. You gain your<br>military training while you are pursuing your undergraduate degree. When<br>you graduate, you get your Bachelor's degree and a commission in the Air<br>Force. OTS is a program for those who already have their Bachelor's<br>degrees. It is an intensive three month program which takes people and<br>trains them to become Air Force officers. Graduates from OTS are<br>commissioned into the Air Force. The US Air Force Academy in Colorado<br>Springs, Colorado is one of our nation's service academies. It requires<br>acceptance into the school as well as a nomination by a Congressman, the<br>Vice-President, or the President.<br><br>By far, the option chosen by most people (simply based on volume) is<br>ROTC. I would definitely look into ROTC. Here's a great website to get<br>you started:<br><br>[[Home \| U.S. Air Force<br>ROTC](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6dcace&url=https://www.afrotc.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="afrotc.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Even if you think you want bombers now, thinking about which airframe<br>you want to fly is putting the cart WAY before the horse. Worry about<br>becoming a commissioned officer first, and then worry about getting into<br>pilot training. Lean on your advisers and instructors for guidance on<br>what you need to do in order to maximize your chances for being<br>selected.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
