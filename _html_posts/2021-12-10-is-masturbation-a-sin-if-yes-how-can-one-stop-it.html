<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So since you asked a question about religion, it only makes sense that<br>your answer come from a religious point of view. It literally makes no<br>sense for atheists to answer religious questions. It's illogical.<br><br>The Bible does not speak directly about masturbation. But there<br>certainly are principles in the Bible which apply.<br><br>> Everything that does not come from faith is sin ([[Romans<br>> 14:23](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a0b342&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%252014.23){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br><br>This passage tells us that everything we do that is not done faithfully,<br>anything we do that does not honor God, is sinful.<br><br>Whoa, so like, lots of my thoughts and deeds are sinful.<br><br>We are sinful creatures. We try to be good, but because we are human, we<br>have a sinful nature. We are only *saved* by the grace of God, but<br>that's another topic. Let's stick to the sin for the moment.<br><br>> So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the<br>> glory of God ([[1 Corinthians<br>> 10:31](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a808a1&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%252010.31){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br>><br>> Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is<br>> in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you<br>> were bought at a price. Therefore, honor God with your body ([[1<br>> Corinthians<br>> 6:19--20](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=223f78&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%25206.19%25E2%2580%259320){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br><br>Our bodies have been redeemed and belong to God. Everything we do with<br>our bodies should be to God's glory. If we are not glorifying God with<br>something that we do, it can be sinful.<br><br>> The fruit of the Spirit is . . . self-control ([[Galatians<br>> 5:22--23](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=54e527&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gal%25205.22%25E2%2580%259323){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br><br>One of the fruits of the Spirit is self-control. Masturbation is almost<br>always a sign of a *lack* of self-control. Masturbation is often driven<br>by *lust,* which in biblical times was defined as a lack of<br>self-control, or a lack of restraint. Lust is desire without restraint,<br>and oftentimes, when people masturbate, it is out of a lack of<br>restraint.<br><br>So, *can* you masturbate in a way that includes a clear mind,<br>self-control, and a heart towards God? The best we can say is<br>*possibly*. But masturbation is a slippery slope at best. At worst, it<br>can lead to lustful thoughts, a lack of self-control, thinking of other<br>people besides your spouse, and possibly use of pornography, all of<br>which would be a *sinful* form of masturbation. Believers must be very<br>cautious that their minds and hearts are in a right orientation if they<br>choose to partake, in just the same way that they can sin in any number<br>of normal, natural ways, if the heart and mind are not in a right<br>orientation.<br><br>TL;DR: Since the question was specifically related to sin, the<br>answer is that in many cases, masturbation can be sinful.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is masturbation a sin? If yes, how can one stop it?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
