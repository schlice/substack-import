<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In the state of Colorado, can a 19-year-old possess a handgun and have<br>it transferred to his name?**<br><br>A lot of answers here, most of which are technically inaccurate. I'll<br>answer as a Colorado resident.<br><br>Colorado law says no one under 18 may possess a handgun. There is no<br>minimum age under Colorado law to possess a long gun. Federal law says<br>you must be 21 to purchase a handgun, and 18 to purchase a long gun.<br>Colorado follows Federal law for purchasing; there are no additional<br>state requirements.<br><br>Therefore, you can take possession of a handgun at age 18.<br><br>Check with your duty station regarding storage of personal firearms.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
