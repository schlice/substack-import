<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I\'m reasonably certain that not all police dogs are named \"Bach.\"<br><br>I am certain that you\'re reading too many of [[Rick<br>Bruno](https://www.quora.com/profile/Rick-Bruno-1)]{.qlink_container}\'s<br>answers and you are suffering from the \"statistics of small numbers\"<br>logical fallacy. Because everything you have read (on Quora) is Rick\'s<br>answers about his own police dog who was named Bach, you have drawn the<br>(mistaken) conclusion that all police dogs are named Bach.<br><br>Rick\'s next police dog (IIRC) after Bach retired was named Zeke, so<br>that alone confirms that not all police dogs are named Bach.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
