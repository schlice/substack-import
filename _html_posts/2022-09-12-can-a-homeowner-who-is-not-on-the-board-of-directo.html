<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>Some HOAs have in their Governing Documents binding arbitration clauses.<br>If yours does, then as a homeowner, you can sue, but you will have to go<br>to binding arbitration rather than court.<br><br>And since lawsuits are usually between a homeowner and the HOA (of which<br>Board members and the management company are a part), it doesn't make<br>sense that only the Board or the management company could sue the HOA.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
