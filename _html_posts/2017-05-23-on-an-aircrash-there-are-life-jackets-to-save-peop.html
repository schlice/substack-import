<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you land on the ground, you don't need the life jacket.<br><br>If you make an emergency landing on the wheels, the doors are equipped<br>with emergency slides to get you to the ground. On water, those<br>emergency slides would double as life rafts.<br><br>If you make a crash landing not on the wheels, and you can walk<br>away, feel free to take the life jacket with you as a souvenir. Tell<br>them I said so.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
