It's worse for me or you,<br>specifically.<br><br>But it's best for *us*.<br><br>That's the very nature of compromise. Both sides give a little bit of<br>what they don't want to give to reach a consensus. Neither side wants to<br>give up what they do, but they do it for the sake of compromise.<br><br>And that's why bipartisan legislation *seems* worse for me than the<br>original partisan bill which gave me everything I wanted.<br><br>But while it may not check 100% of all my boxes, it works for<br>*everyone*, which is why it is a bipartisan consensus bill.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
