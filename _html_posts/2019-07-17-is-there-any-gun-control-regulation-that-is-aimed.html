<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there any gun control regulation that is aimed at the people<br>committing the crimes rather than someone who lawfully owns a gun? If<br>so, what is it?**<br><br>No, there isn't. There isn't because it's not politically expedient to<br>do so. It's much easier to curtail lawful gun owners than it is to<br>target criminals. You can write new laws to curtail gun owners; you<br>can't really write new laws to curtail criminals, because we already<br>have laws against committing crimes. That's why they are criminals: they<br>have broken existing laws.<br><br>To that end, *all* laws are targeted at people committing crimes,<br>because you have to commit a crime before the law's effects are felt by<br>you. Lawful gun owners get upset when *new laws* target them and *create<br>crimes* where there was no crime previously (i.e. banning a certain<br>design of firearm).<br><br>You've probably already heard something along the lines of, "we don't<br>need new laws, we should be enforcing the laws we already have." Well,<br>that's a convenient trope, but what does it mean?<br><br>Here's an example of what it means: **gun crimes are prosecuted far less<br>than other crimes.**<br><br>Why is this? Because gun crimes are often used as bargaining chips in<br>negotiations over what to charge. Prosecutors will often negotiate down<br>or completely waive the gun charges in order to get a guilty plea on<br>another charge. "Take a guilty plea on the robbery 2 and I'll plead the<br>gun charge down to a misdemeanor menacing charge." Criminals do this<br>too: "Drop the gun charge and I'll plead to the robbery and give you my<br>boss and his boss."<br><br>This kind of thing happens ALL. THE. TIME. And this results in criminals<br>knowing that using a gun in the commission of a crime means nothing to<br>the police or to prosecutors. Laws are only as strong as their<br>enforcement.<br><br>So the first thing we need is mandatory charging of all gun crimes.<br>If you commit a crime with a gun, you must be charged with that gun<br>crime. No plea bargaining of gun crimes.<br><br>Secondly, we need to remove the incentive for judges and juries to<br>lessen the sentences on people convicted of using a gun in a crime. If<br>we are to get tough on criminals using guns to commit crimes, we<br>need to show it. We need **mandatory sentences for using guns as part of<br>the commission of a crime.**<br><br>Right now, there is very little disincentive to criminals for using a<br>gun in the commission of a crime. They know that even if they do get<br>caught, they won't likely face much time for using a gun. They can even<br>likely plead it away themselves.Once criminals start learning that if<br>you are caught using a gun in a crime, you're automatically going to<br>jail for X years, do not pass Go, do not collect \$200, then criminals<br>will be far less likely to use a gun to commit a crime.<br><br>And it is up to states to do this, as most are prosecuted under state<br>law. It's up to states to actually start *being tough* on gun crime<br>instead of just *talking tough*.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
