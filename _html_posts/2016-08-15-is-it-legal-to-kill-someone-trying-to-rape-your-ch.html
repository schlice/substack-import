<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The laws vary by state, but in most states, if you kill your child's<br>rapist, you will be arrested and charged with murder. Your defense will<br>be that you were using deadly force in defense of others.<br><br>Some states have specific rules specifying the defense you can use when<br>the felony is so egregious that you are allowed to use deadly force to<br>stop it. For example, in Virginia, "stopping a serious felony in<br>progress" is a defense against a murder charge. It is a subset of<br>"defense of others." It must be a "serious felony," which in Virginia is<br>murder, arson, rape, robbery, and burglary, and it must be "in<br>progress," which means interrupting the criminal while in the course of<br>the act, not catching him before he does it. Note that in Virginia,<br>there does not need to be a victim within eyesight in order to apply;<br>you don't have to know that someone is asleep upstairs when you catch<br>the burglar pouring gasoline in the basement.<br><br>States have different rules for defining a "serious felony," but in all<br>cases, you would be arrested and charged, and the fact that you were<br>acting in defense of others would be a defense to the murder charge. In<br>all states, you would have to be able to clearly articulate that you<br>were in fear of the child's death or serious bodily harm, and you acted<br>accordingly.<br><br>So to answer your question, no it is not "legal" to kill someone trying<br>to rape your child. You can use the "defense of others" defense to<br>defend yourself against the murder charge that will result from your<br>killing the attacker. This doesn't make it "legal," it makes it<br>"justified."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
