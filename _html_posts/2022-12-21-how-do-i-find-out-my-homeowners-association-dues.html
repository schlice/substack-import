<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The easiest way to find out is to contact your HOA.<br><br>If you don't know how to contact them, contact the people who send you<br>mail on behalf of the HOA. This is usually a **community association<br>manager (CAM)**, a company which provides community association services<br>to the HOA. They do things like, for example, maintaining the systems<br>needed to collect dues from homeowners. They should be able to give you<br>all that information.<br><br>If you can't find either your HOA or your CAM, contact your local<br>government to obtain a copy of the Governing Documents of your HOA.<br>These documents will list the officers and the CAM, which are all<br>required to be on file with the local government.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
