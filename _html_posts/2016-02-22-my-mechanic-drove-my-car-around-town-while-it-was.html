<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When you drop your car off at the shop, you expect them to repair it and<br>then take it for a test drive, so some driving of your vehicle to verify<br>the fixes is expected.<br><br>The question is reasonableness.<br><br>Was the amount of mileage driven \"reasonable\" to verify the repairs<br>performed? Was extra driving required to verify the repairs? The shop<br>owner will likely be able to justify his use of the vehicle in testing<br>his repairs, but it\'s not up to him or you, it\'s up to the court to<br>determine what is \"reasonable.\"<br><br>I would suggest following [[Nick<br>Bauer](https://www.quora.com/profile/Nick-Bauer-10)]{.qlink_container}\'s<br>advice and start by talking to the shop owner. Do not be accusatory in<br>your tone. Show the shop owner the toll receipts, discuss the amount<br>that the vehicle was driven and explain that you don\'t think it was<br>reasonable. If the shop owner agrees with you, you might be able to<br>persuade him to chip in on the cost of your rental car.<br><br>If you are not satisfied after talking to the shop owner, you are<br>certainly within your rights to sue the shop and request reimbursement<br>of your rental car. Depending on how much money you are talking about,<br>this could be handled in small-claims court, without lawyers. But if we<br>are talking larger sums of money, you may need an attorney to assist you<br>with filing your lawsuit.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
