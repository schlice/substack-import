<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> What are genetically incorrect feelings?<br><br>I'm going to assume that a "genetically-incorrect feeling" is another<br>term for what we would call gender dysphoria.<br><br>Gender dysphoria is a term that describes a sense of unease that a<br>person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and<br>their gender identity. In other words, you may have been born a boy<br>(your biological sex) but you may "feel like" a girl, or "identify" as a<br>girl (your gender identity).<br><br>Clearly, this is a disorder in the brain. The debate today centers on<br>how to treat this disorder. There is a growing consensus of people who<br>believe that instead of treating it with medication, therapy and love,<br>we should cater to this disorder by having society accept your gender<br>identity rather than your biological sex. We should further your gender<br>identity by performing plastic surgery to remove your healthy,<br>functioning genitals so that your physical appearance more closely<br>matches your gender identity. However, know that no one can ever make a<br>boy into a girl. No surgery can ever change your gender, because your<br>gender exists all the way down to a cellular level. I think this may be<br>the origin of the term "genetically-incorrect feelings."<br><br>> Did God create them?<br><br>The short answer is no, but that's too simplistic for understanding.<br><br>Of course, God created everything, including us. But when He did, we<br>were created in perfect bodies which did not know sickness, pain, or<br>death. God also created us with *free will*, which is the ability to be<br>moral creatures and choose our own paths in life.<br><br>But at the time of our creation, humans chose *sin*, which is anything<br>that contradicts God's will for us. And when the first sin was committed<br>by disobeying God's commands, our bodies changed. When sin infected our<br>bodies, we now knew pain. We knew suffering. We knew disease, and we<br>knew death.<br><br>Mental issues are part of the disease which now infects our bodies,<br>because we live in a fallen world, in fallen bodies.<br><br>People are quick to reply, "Well God created everything, so He must have<br>created evil" or "God created us evil." God did create everything, but<br>*He did not need to create evil*. Evil is not a thing which can be<br>created. It is a state of being, it is an act in contravention to God's<br>will for us. Evil is a thing you do, not a thing you can touch. For<br>example, you can "make a hole" by digging in the dirt, but you can't<br>have a "hole" without the dirt around it. A hole is merely the absence<br>of dirt. In the same way, evil is not created, it is just the absence of<br>good. Our lives were created; evil is just a description of us choosing<br>to separate ourselves from God.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
