<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**When you are driving, it is illegal to check inside of your car. Can<br>police do an illegal check on your car?**<br><br>First of all, you begin with an erroneous statement. You said that it is<br>illegal for police to check inside of your car. This is incorrect.<br><br>What makes a search legal or illegal is the probable cause upon<br>which the search is based. If the officer has probable cause, he can<br>search your car. He doesn't have to tell *you* what probable cause he<br>has. He only has to tell the judge. He doesn't need your permission.<br><br>Also, you didn't clarify what "check inside of your car" means. Does<br>that mean a search, or does it mean looking through the window with a<br>flashlight? I've been talking about search, but can an officer check for<br>threats by looking in the window? Absolutely. And if he *sees*<br>something illegal while checking for a threat, is that admissible? Under<br>the plain sight doctrine, the answer to that is also yes.<br><br>Finally, you asked the question: **Can police do an illegal check on<br>your car? And the answer to that is yes**, the police can illegally<br>search your car. While it's not a frequent occurrence, sometimes the<br>police do search vehicles illegally.<br><br>But what happens when they do?<br><br>You work with your lawyer, you get the search thrown out, and you walk<br>free. Then if you choose, you sue the department. But that's between you<br>and your lawyer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
