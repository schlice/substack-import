<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Who is responsible for removing members of Congress under Amendment 14<br>article 3? Is it up to each house if Congress or is an independent panel<br>set up to hear and decide the outcome?**<br><br>The 14th Amendment was one of the Reconstruction amendments. Everything<br>in there has an eye toward the Civil War and the Confederacy. Any<br>discussion about "insurrection" were well-understood: section 3 was<br>designed to prevent former US military members, as well as federal and<br>state representatives, who served the Confederacy from serving in public<br>office unless that "disability" was removed by a 2/3 vote of each house<br>of Congress.<br><br>It is up to Congress to determine internally whether or not a member is<br>ineligible to serve under Section 3. The most likely remedy is<br>*expulsion*, which can be accomplished for any reason with a 2/3 vote of<br>that chamber. Expulsion is prescribed in Article I Section 5: \"Each<br>House \of Congress\ may determine the Rules of its proceedings, punish<br>its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of<br>two-thirds, expel a member.\"<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
