<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a US President is found to be unethical and/or immoral during his<br>or her term and steps down as a result of that fact, shouldn\'t that<br>make every bill that he or she signed into law null and void by<br>default?**<br><br>No.<br><br>Here are the primary reasons why:<br><br>1.  There is no Constitutional requirement for a President to be<br>    "ethical" or "moral" while in office.<br>2.  There is no standard for "ethics" or "morality" in the United<br>    States. The only standard we have is the law and the Constitution.<br>3.  Even if a president acted unlawfully, while that president was duly<br>    elected and sworn in, and functioning in his elected role, as long<br>    as he signed legislation in accordance with the law, that<br>    legislation is still valid.<br>4.  There are separate remedies for presidents who act unlawfully, and<br>    even who act "unethically" and "immoraly," if found to have done so<br>    by Congress.<br>5.  Presidents who act unethically and/or immorally (by whatever<br>    standard they are judged) do not change the<br>    legality/ethicality/morality of the laws which they signed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
