<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does Speaker Pelosi's delay in submitting her articles of impeachment<br>to the Senate for certain conditions essentially amount to a 'quid pro<br>quo'?**<br><br>There's plenty of buzzwords you can apply to Pelosi's delay in<br>submitting the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate, but "quid pro quo"<br>is not one of them.<br><br>The most notable and apropos buzzword to apply is **obstruction of<br>Congress**.<br><br>That Pelosi can't fathom her own hypocrisy is what is most telling. Just<br>a few weeks ago, she railed on against President Trump for failing to<br>allow staffers to testify in front of Congress, ostensibly exercising<br>executive privilege without using the word. Predictably, the House<br>impeached him for exercising his authority under the Constitution.<br><br>Then, just a few weeks later, Pelosi decides that it's perfectly<br>acceptable to obstruct the Senate in its trial obligation under the<br>Constitution by failing to deliver the Articles of Impeachment to the<br>Senate because she's dissatisfied with how the Senate plans on<br>conducting its business. She has no Constitutional authority to fail to<br>deliver the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate because she dislikes<br>the Senate rules, or she disagrees with how the trial in the Senate is<br>to take place. The Senate is the sole organization which can conduct the<br>trial, not the House. The House has no authority here. But she has<br>unilaterally decided to gum up the works.<br><br>It's obstruction of Congress, plain and simple.<br><br>McConnell should subpoena the House Manager and force them to deliver<br>the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate floor, and if he/she fails to<br>appear, he should petition the courts to intervene.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
