<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If \"Universal Background Checks\" were to be put in place, what would<br>that mean? Who would do them, what would they be looking for exactly and<br>how much would they cost?**<br><br>In the United States, you can buy firearms from one of two types of<br>individuals: people who buy and sell guns for a living (we'll call them<br>"dealers" for short), and from private individuals who happen to own at<br>least one gun and want to sell it to someone else.<br><br>Currently, if you buy a gun from a "dealer," you already get a<br>background check performed. If you buy a gun from a private individual,<br>in most states there is no requirement to perform a background check.<br><br>In 1994, it was estimated that 60% of firearms purchased were done<br>through a dealer. That means that 40% of firearms purchased were done<br>from private individuals. Those numbers are certain to have changed now,<br>but UBCs would only affect the 40% of firearms transfers which take<br>place outside of the dealer space.<br><br>If you implement "universal background checks," this means that every<br>time a gun changes hands from one person to another, a background check<br>must be performed. Every time, no exceptions.<br><br>So, now to the questions.<br><br>- Who would do them? Under the current system, only dealers have<br>  access to the background check system. Therefore, only a dealer can<br>  perform a background check. So today, if I (not a dealer) wants to<br>  sell you a gun, I just do it. You give me money, I give you gun.<br>  Simple. But if UBCs were implemented, if I want to sell you a gun, I<br>  have to find a dealer with a Federal Firearms License to perform a<br>  background check on you, for a separate fee (which is yet to be<br>  determined, of course). Once I receive word that you are not a<br>  prohibited person (well, on paper, that I'm certain I'll have to<br>  retain for a set number of years), then I can sell you a gun.\<br>  \<br>  Seems simple, but there has to be a reason that this wasn't already<br>  the law, right? We'll discuss that after we answer the questions.<br>- What would they be looking for? The background checks would be<br>  exactly the same as our current background checks look for, just for<br>  more transfer scenarios. They would be looking for felonies (since<br>  convicted felons can't own guns) and adjudicated mental deficiencies.<br>- How much would they cost? We don't know yet, because most FFLs<br>  wrap the cost of doing background checks into the cost of the firearm<br>  sale. Doing a solo background check without a firearms sale is a new<br>  class of transaction for which there is no set pricing. A FFL could<br>  charge \$5 or \$50 or \$100, we simply don't know how much it will add<br>  to the cost of purchasing a firearm. Will it price someone out of the<br>  market? Probably not, but does it make it harder for the poor<br>  (arguably the group which most needs firearms for self-defense) to<br>  afford a firearm? Yes it does. Doesn't this amount to unequal<br>  treatment under the law as defined by the 14th Amendment? Of course it<br>  does.<br><br>Now let's talk about the *practical implications* of this law that few<br>have thought about (or what are also called "the unintended<br>consequences"):<br><br>- I want to gift a rifle to my son. Does he need a background check?<br>- I want to give my firearms to my friend for safe storage because my<br>  house is under evacuation because of a natural disaster. Do I have to<br>  do a background check on my friend before he can take them? (BTW, this<br>  one isn't a hypothetical, it happened to me)<br>- If I'm at the range and I'm shooting with my friend (because I'm<br>  introducing him to the shooting sports), does he need a background<br>  check before he is allowed to pick up my gun?<br><br>Under a Universal Background Check law, all of these unintended<br>consequences become true and require background checks. Any exceptions<br>you place in the law become avenues for uncleared people to receive<br>firearms, so if the checks are to be truly "universal," they must cover<br>all transfer scenarios.<br><br>This, of course, makes the law unnecessarily burdensome to the<br>law-abiding gun owner, which therefore makes it unsuitable to accomplish<br>its intended purpose: to try to prevent criminals from receiving<br>firearms in violation of the law. The law only serves to punish people<br>for failing to follow it later on. So does that help us stop mass<br>shootings? Nope. It only helps us turn ordinary citizens into criminals<br>for failing to follow an administrative procedure. People are still<br>dead. There will just be more people to whom we can point fingers<br>afterwards.\<br>\<br>And when I sell you a gun, how long must I retain paperwork for? And if<br>the person I sell to does something illegal with the gun, are they going<br>to come after me because I sold it? And doesn't this create a *de facto*<br>gun registry, which is a violation of Federal law?<br><br>If you're going to make a law to restrict a Constitutional right, you<br>must do so in the *least restrictive way possible* to the<br>law-abiding, and your law must be *sufficiently narrow* to achieve<br>only your intended goal. Because UBCs are so unnecessarily burdensome to<br>the law-abiding citizen, and they do nothing to actually prevent crime<br>before it happens, they are unworkable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
