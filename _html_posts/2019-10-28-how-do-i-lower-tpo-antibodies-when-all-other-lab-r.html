<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How do I lower TPO antibodies when all other lab results are normal?<br><br>The short answer is: you don't, because it's likely that TPO antibodies<br>are not your biggest problem.<br><br>Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies are a marker for the presence of<br>autoimmune thyroid disease. Blood test results for TPO antibodies [[are<br>positive in 95% of<br>patients](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6516b3&url=https://www.mdedge.com/clinicianreviews/article/72387/endocrinology/thyroid-peroxidase-antibodies){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="mdedge.com"}]{.qlink_container} with chronic lymphocytic<br>thyroiditis, also known as *Hashimoto's disease*, and in 50% to 80% of<br>patients with Graves' disease.<br><br>Hashimoto\'s disease often leads to an underactive thyroid gland, a<br>condition known as *hypothyroidism*. Symptoms of an underactive thyroid<br>include feeling tired, feeling cold when others do not, constipation,<br>weight gain, and heavier-than-normal menstrual periods. Not all patients<br>with Hashimoto's disease develop hypothyroidism.<br><br>Graves\' disease is an immune system disorder that results in the<br>overproduction of thyroid hormones, also known as *hyperthyroidism*.<br>Although a number of disorders may result in hyperthyroidism, Graves\'<br>disease is a common cause.<br><br>Because thyroid hormones affect a number of different body systems,<br>signs and symptoms associated with Graves\' disease can be wide ranging<br>and significantly influence your overall well-being. Although Graves\'<br>disease may affect anyone, it\'s more common among women and before the<br>age of 40.<br><br>In any event, see your doctor to find an explanation for the high levels<br>of TPO antibodies, and be prepared to face a diagnosis of Hashimoto's<br>disease.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
