<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If Trump\'s tweets aren\'t sufficient evidence to prove he\'s unfit to<br>serve as president, what would be?**<br><br>What makes someone "unfit?"<br><br>The Constitution says that in order to be fit to be President, you have<br>to be a natural born citizen and be at least 35 years old, and you must<br>have resided in the United States for at least 14 years. So according to<br>the Constitution, he is fit to be President.<br><br>Beyond what the Constitution says, other levels of "fitness" required<br>include being physically able to execute the duties of the office. To<br>date, Trump is still alive, upright and breathing. He has not lost his<br>faculties to such an extent that his Cabinet would conclude that he is<br>no longer sane, so he is still able to continue as President under the<br>requirements of the 25th Amendment.<br><br>So beyond all of that, what else makes someone fit or unfit to be<br>President? Since there are no laws or regulations, **it's really down to<br>personal opinion as to what constitutes "fitness" to serve as<br>President.**<br><br>Therefore, if you feel the President is not fit to serve, don't re-elect<br>him.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for<br>everyone.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
