<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Could drinking too many sodas or other sweetened beverages each day<br>worsen symptoms for people with multiple sclerosis?**<br><br>The answer to the specific question is no, soda does not make MS worse.<br><br>The answer to the more general question is that soda in general,<br>especially if it is sweetened with sugar, is bad for you.<br><br>The carbonation process creates carbonic acid, which is great for<br>preserving the stuff inside the can, but not the best for the stuff<br>inside your body, let alone the enamel on your teeth. It's also got<br>sugar, which is terrible for you. Liquid sugar is even worse. If you<br>want to get real fat, real quick, soda is a great way to do it.<br><br>Diet or sugar-free soda is better, but watch what it's sweetened with.<br>Aspartame is not terrible, but sucralose isn't great, and neither is<br>saccharin. Stevia is your best bet, but not too many sodas are sweetened<br>with stevia yet.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
