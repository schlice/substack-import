<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a law was passed to NOT allow those convicted of sex crimes<br>committed against children out of prison on parole, would you support<br>it?**<br><br>Let's say I'm drunk. I'm doing the responsible thing by walking home,<br>but maaaaaaaan I gotta pee.<br><br>If you've ever been drunk in your life, you know how it is.<br><br>It's late at night, there's no one around, and hey, you're drunk, so you<br>duck behind a building and you whip it out and take a leak.<br><br>Except that, unbeknownst to your drunk ass, there's a child watching you<br>from a second-story window in the apartment complex next to where you're<br>draining the remains of your beer.<br><br>Oops.<br><br>You get arrested, charged with contributing to the delinquency of a<br>minor, and placed on the sex offender registry.<br><br>While this particular story is made up, stories like this happen all.<br>the. time. I have a real problem with the sex offender registry and how<br>it is handled, but that's an answer to a different question.<br><br>OK, back to today's hypothetical.<br><br>Under your mandatory sentencing rules (you have indeed committed a sex<br>crime against a child), you will spend the whole of your prison sentence<br>in prison. You will not be eligible for parole.<br><br>This is why I have never been in favor of mandatory sentencing. I am in<br>favor of mandatory *charging* (i.e. rules which state that certain<br>crimes cannot be plea-bargained away; if evidence for the charge exists,<br>it must be charged), but sentencing is a very nuanced thing.<br><br>Besides, I'm not sure I understand the purpose of making someone<br>convicted of a sex crime serve his entire sentence in prison without<br>being eligible for parole. Parole is a reward for good behavior while in<br>prison (in most states; in some states, parole is a mandatory part of<br>transitioning back to civilian life). This simply removes the<br>possibility that parole will even be offered, providing even fewer<br>benefits to the con to behave while inside. This really doesn't do<br>anything but hurt the prison system.<br><br>And unless you can show that recidivism is somehow higher among<br>criminals who sexually abuse children than other groups (and especially<br>recidivism *while out on parole*), it's really quite unfair that you<br>would target only those criminals and not other violent criminals.<br><br>I'm not trying to advocate for the literal scum stains who prey on<br>children. I'm simply stating that the punishment doesn't fit the crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
