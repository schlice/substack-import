<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Got 20 day demand to vacate from HOA for me & unapproved renters for<br>criminal activity (didn't know about it) while I was away recovering<br>from injury (I'm 80) in Florida. If I evict renters, can they still<br>evict me? HOA/lawyers won't return my calls**<br><br>[Tara(https://www.quora.com/profile/Tara-Stopka-Perez)]{.qlink_container},<br>thanks for your question, but I really have nothing more to add other<br>than what [[Jay<br>Link](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jay-H-Link)]{.qlink_container} said<br>in his answer.<br><br>It sounds like a really complex situation involving a property you own<br>and some potential violations of your Rules & Regulations regarding<br>renters. But there's a lot of moving parts here, and anything we answer<br>would be unnecessarily confusing and would really do you a disservice.<br><br>I strongly suggest you get in contact with a real estate attorney in<br>your local area who specializes in HOA law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
