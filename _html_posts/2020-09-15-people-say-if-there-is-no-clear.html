<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Wishful thinking.<br><br>If neither candidate gets 270 electoral votes, the House votes for<br>President, and the Senate votes for VP. How that vote is handled is in<br>the Constitution, and it\'s not like a traditional vote in the House<br>either. Each state delegation in the House gets one vote for President.<br>You need to receive votes from a majority of states (26 votes) in order<br>to be elected President. Vice President is elected by the Senate. Each<br>Senator gets one vote, and you need 51 votes to be elected Vice<br>President.<br><br>So no, Nancy Pelosi would not become President on Election Day if<br>neither candidate is the clear winner.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
