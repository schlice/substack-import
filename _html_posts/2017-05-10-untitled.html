<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Awesome comments, thanks for adding them.<br><br>I tend to follow the Mike Rowe School of Trades:<br><br>> Some jobs pay better, some jobs smell better, and some jobs have no<br>> business being treated like careers. But work is never the enemy,<br>> regardless of the wage. Because somewhere between the job and the<br>> paycheck, there's still a thing called opportunity, and that's what<br>> people need to pursue.<br>><br>> [[*Mike<br>> Rowe*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=382d4f&url=https://www.facebook.com/TheRealMikeRowe/posts/938382126171931:0){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="facebook.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>I don't think that any one thing is a panacea in and of itself. But to<br>vaunt one and denigrate the other is a recipe for disaster, and the<br>Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers which show three million unfilled<br>trades jobs (yes, some of which are in unions, which unfairly skew the<br>numbers).<br><br>We need to encourage high school students to pursue whatever will make<br>them happy. If that's a trade, great! If that's a four-year degree,<br>great! But the "college prep" trend which has eschewed the trades as<br>"less than" and has helped to create this problem is worrisome, to say<br>the least.<br><br>And I have to say, I love the community colleges. We have done another<br>smashing job painting *them* as "less than" as well, in favor of the<br>four-year universities. That needs to change as well.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-one-thing-you-regret-doing-or-not-doing-the-most-in-your-life/answer/Matthew-Bates-27<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
