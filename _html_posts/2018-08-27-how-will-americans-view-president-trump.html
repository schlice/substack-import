His brain-mouth connection has nothing in<br>between. He speaks exactly what he thinks.<br><br>On a positive note, at least you never have to wonder what he's<br>thinking.<br><br>However, cooler heads on his staff ensure that appropriate courtesies<br>are followed, and the White House is indeed flying the flag at half<br>staff. As is fully expected.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
