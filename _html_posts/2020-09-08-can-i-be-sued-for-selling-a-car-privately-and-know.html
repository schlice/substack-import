<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can I be sued for selling a car privately and knowing it had issues<br>and didn't mention them but put sold as is in the ad? They seen the<br>check engine light on and even test drove it and still choose to buy it<br>and it overheated after they left**<br><br>Admittedly, this is a little bit of a legal gray area. What the law says<br>you absolutely c*annot* do is misrepresent the condition of the car.<br>If you said that it had no engine issues but it had an engine issue you<br>knew about, that could be considered fraud, and that's a big deal. You<br>could be forced to buy the car back and you might face other legal<br>consequences too. Basically, any false factual statement about the car<br>could be considered fraud.<br><br>For example, if the car was in an accident and it should have been<br>totaled, but you had a guy you know do the repairs without contacting<br>insurance, and then you sell the car and say it was never in an accident<br>because it has a clean CARFAX, that's fraud. However, if it just doesn't<br>run well, even if you say you think it runs well, that's not fraud.<br>Everyone has a different definition of "runs well." Opinions about the<br>car do not constitute fraud, only factual misrepresentation about the<br>condition of the car.<br><br>"As is" simply means you sell it in the condition it is in, you will not<br>warranty the car after it is sold, and it's up to the buyer to decide if<br>they want to accept it in that condition. It also means that once the<br>car is sold, that's it. Your obligation to the car ends at that moment,<br>so long as you didn't *lie* about the car and say that it was in a<br>condition other than it was.<br><br>In this case, the buyer was not unaware that there were issues. They saw<br>the "Check Engine" light before they bought the car, and I presume they<br>spoke to you about the light. Then after that, they bought the car<br>anyway. I have a feeling that's going to be on them, not on you.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice.
