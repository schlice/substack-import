<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can foreigners in the United States of America use the 5th Amendment<br>and the 14th Amendment?**<br><br>Nowhere in the Bill of Rights does it say that the rights apply to<br>"citizens." In most places, it says "the right of the people." Those<br>laws apply to everyone on US soil under the "jurisdiction of the United<br>States." There is some debate on that last part, but indeed, those laws<br>apply to everyone present in the United States.<br><br>Also, everyone has rights. You have these rights because you are a<br>person, created by God. The Constitution simply prevents the government<br>from infringing on those rights. So you can't really "use" the 5th or<br>14th Amendments. You are "protected" by them while you are in the United<br>States, just like any other person.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
