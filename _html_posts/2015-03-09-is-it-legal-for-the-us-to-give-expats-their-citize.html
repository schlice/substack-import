<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The government cannot take away your citizenship, unless<br>you weren\'t a citizen in the first place and were naturalized. It\'s<br>called being \"denaturalized.\" I\'ve heard of lots of federal cases<br>where I thought that US citizens should lose their citizenship, but take<br>heart, the government cannot do this. You can revoke your citizenship,<br>but it\'s a choice you have to make in front of a magistrate in an<br>embassy outside the US, and it is permanent.\<br>\<br>Many US citizens have dual citizenship and they don\'t forfeit their US<br>citizenship because of it. Expats (US citizens living outside of the<br>country) are still subject to some Federal income tax on money they make<br>while living outside of the country; they still file 1040s as well as a<br>bunch of other tax forms. State taxes vary based on state of residency;<br>for example, if you are a New York state resident and you live outside<br>the state, you don\'t pay state income tax (I never paid New York state<br>income tax while I was Active Duty stationed around the country).\<br>\<br>You can lose your citizenship if you were naturalized. You can\'t lose<br>your citizenship if you are born American.\<br>\<br>If you have been paying taxes, you are entitled to the benefits of those<br>taxes, regardless of where you physically live.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
