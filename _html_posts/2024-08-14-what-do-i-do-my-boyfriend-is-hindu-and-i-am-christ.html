<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *He answered, "Have you not read that he who created them from the<br>> beginning made them male and female, and said, 'Therefore a man shall<br>> leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two<br>> shall become one flesh'?" \-- Matthew 19:4--5 ESV*<br><br>You *leave* your respective families and create *your own* family. Your<br>marriage is not about them, it's about you.<br><br>Nevertheless, which wedding you choose, and which family you upset, is<br>less important that which religion you choose. And ultimately, since<br>you are Christian, you have undoubtedly heard about being "unequally<br>yoked," correct?<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-3ca716ced0f4f6da422fde958df62854){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-3ca716ced0f4f6da422fde958df62854" master_w="470"<br>master_h="274"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>A yoke is a wooden structure used to hook two oxen together. This<br>way they can pull a load twice as heavy as one ox could pull. If one ox<br>is significantly stronger than the other, or one ox starts pulling in<br>the wrong direction, they are considered *unequally yoked*, and they<br>don't make much progress.<br><br>Paul makes the same comparison in the Bible:<br><br>> *Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has<br>> righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with<br>> darkness? \-- 2 Cor 6:14 ESV*<br><br>Now I'm not saying that one of you is good and the other is bad, or that<br>one of you is righteous and the other is lawless. But the point still<br>remains. If you marry someone from another religion, you two won't be<br>"pulling in the same direction," so to speak. Uniting a Christian with a<br>non-Christian is going to make for a very difficult marriage.<br><br>So one of you is going to have to change religions. And knowing what you<br>know about how God has saved you, are you really planning on giving that<br>up? Is he planning on giving up his faith?<br><br>TL;DR: I'm not worried about your marriage arrangements or whether<br>or not you upset your respective families. I'm worried about your<br>*soul*. So is God.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
