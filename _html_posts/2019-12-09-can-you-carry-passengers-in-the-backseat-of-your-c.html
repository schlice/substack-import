<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you carry passengers in the backseat of your car with a minor<br>learners permit (Colorado) provided that the person who signed your<br>affidavit of liability and guardianship is in the front seat with you?**<br><br>Short answer: no.<br><br>Longer answer: Colorado's Graduated Driver's License program states that<br>while you have your learner's permit only, you can only drive with a<br>drivers education instructor or any licensed adult over the age of 21.<br>The only exception is when you are actively participating in a driver's<br>education course with the driver's education instructor. Other students<br>similarly licensed may be passengers in the same instructional car.<br><br>The person who signed your DR2460 is the only person who can log the<br>required 50 hours of drive time. That person does not need to be the<br>licensed adult over 21 who accompanies the learner while they drive. The<br>presence or absence of this person does not change the rules about<br>passengers.<br><br>Only after the learner gets the actual license can they carry<br>passengers, and with the following restrictions:<br><br>- You are not allowed to carry a passenger under 21 who is not a family<br>  member until you have had your license for at least six months.<br>- You are not allowed to carry more than one passenger under 21 who is<br>  not a family member until you have held your license for at least one<br>  year.<br>- While you are under 18, you cannot drive between the hours of 12:00<br>  midnight and 5:00 a.m. unless you have held your license for at least<br>  one year.<br><br>So for the first six months, you can only carry passengers under 21 who<br>are family members. For the next six months, you can carry one passenger<br>under 21. Once you have had your license for one year, you can carry as<br>many passengers as there are seat belts.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
