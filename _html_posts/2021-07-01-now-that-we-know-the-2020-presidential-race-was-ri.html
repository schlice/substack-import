<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Even if the Supreme Court rules that the 2020 Presidential election was<br>100% rigged, we won't have a 2021 election.<br><br>The election took place. 50 states and the District of Columbia all had<br>separate elections, and they all certified their results. Congress<br>accepted the certified results of the election, and power transferred<br>hands peacefully, as it has done for over 200 years.<br><br>Since the election was held Constitutionally, the results are permanent.<br><br>If we find concrete evidence that a state's election results were so<br>badly rigged that it would have changed the outcome of the election,<br>then some very pointed looks at that state will start to take place. How<br>were they able to *certify* a state's results with such widespread<br>election tampering? People will be fired. Election processes will be<br>changed. The specific avenues which permitted election tampering will be<br>modified so that they can no longer cause such tampering.<br><br>Some very unusual things happened in the 2020 Presidential election,<br>things that hopefully, are being modified by the states to prevent from<br>occurring in the future.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Now that we know the 2020 Presidential race was rigged, will we have a<br>2021 election?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
