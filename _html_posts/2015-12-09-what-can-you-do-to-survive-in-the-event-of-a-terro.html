<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You do the same thing you would do in any terrorist situation. In order:<br>Run, Hide, and ultimately, Fight. I\'ll explain each in detail.<br><br>Run<br><br>If you have the ability, and you can do so safely, get out. As soon as<br>you recognize that everything is going sideways, get out. Help as many<br>others to get out as you can. Get at least a block away from the<br>location and wait. Police will want to talk to you. When you see them,<br>identify yourself to them, tell them you made it out and you got \<these<br>folks\> out with you and where you made it out from. The more<br>information they have about what is going on in there, and where people<br>are (or are not) holed up will be immensely beneficial.<br><br>Hide<br><br>If you can\'t get out, find a place to hunker down. Find a defensible<br>position with few entries/exits, such as a lavatory, an office, or a<br>small(ish) space. Try to secure that location (i.e. try to barricade the<br>door, if you can). Stay down, stay quiet, and wait for help to arrive.<br>If you have a mobile phone, get on the phone with 911, tell them you\'re<br>holed up inside. They will likely keep you on the phone until police<br>physically arrive in your location. They will want to know what you can<br>see and what you can contribute to the information-gathering function.<br>You won\'t be asked to put yourself in danger, but you will be asked to<br>convey what you can see. Be prepared to move to the next phase.<br><br>Fight<br><br>If the attackers make it to your location, you have to have it in your<br>head that you\'re not going down without a fight. Be prepared to attack<br>anyone who comes in to your defensible space. If you\'re armed, this<br>would be the time to use your weapon. If you\'re not armed, you should<br>arm yourself with whatever you can find: knives, letter openers, broken<br>chair legs, fire extinguishers, etc. Phone handsets make decent<br>bludgeons. Use your environment. Whatever you can get your hands on can<br>become a weapon (so on a side note, gun control is pointless).<br><br>These are things that anyone should consider in any location, not just<br>Grand Central Station. Wherever you are, maintain situational awareness.<br>What\'s going on around you? What\'s going on behind you? Remember,<br>situational awareness doesn\'t mean being paranoid about your<br>environment. It\'s just being *aware* of your surroundings and what is<br>going on around you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
