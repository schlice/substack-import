You can even wear a military uniform if you like. All<br>protected by the 1st Amendment.<br><br>Once you try to wear your uniform into Starbuck's and get 10% off of<br>your latte because you're "military," you've committed fraud.<br><br>In short, so long as you do not financially benefit from your lie,<br>you're allowed to lie about being military.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
