Aside from flight training, are there any real differences?**<br><br>The Marine Corps is actually part of the Department of the Navy, and has<br>always been, since its foundation. Historically, the Marine Corps was<br>founded to serve as an infantry unit aboard naval vessels and was<br>responsible for the security of the ship and its crew by conducting<br>offensive and defensive combat during boarding actions and defending the<br>ship\'s officers from mutiny. With their missions so closely linked, it<br>only makes sense that officers are part of the Navy first, and then<br>disseminate into the Marine Corps after graduation from Annapolis.<br><br>The Air Force became its own service (on par with the Army and Navy)<br>with the signing of Executive Order 9877 and the National Security Act<br>of 1947. This action indicates that the mission of the Air Force was so<br>different from that of the Army that it was deserving of its own<br>service. It was at that time (1947) that the leadership of the new<br>service started work on their next agenda item: their own service<br>academy. It took until the early 1950s before this work was completed<br>and Colorado Springs was chosen to be the home of the Air Force Academy.<br>The first class was already in school at a temporary location at Lowry<br>Air Force Base in Denver by the time the Air Force Academy completed its<br>initial construction phase.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
