<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In a case like this, we\'re talking about *circumstantial<br>evidence*, and where you were found in your car makes a big<br>difference. Sometimes, circumstantial evidence is strong enough to<br>charge you with the crime. Let\'s look at a few possibilities.\<br>\<br>If you\'re at home, on your own property, it\'s unlikely that you\'d be<br>arrested for driving on a suspended license when the officer didn\'t see<br>you drive the car. You live there, so it\'s safe to presume that you<br>could have gotten in and out of the car without driving it.<br>Additionally, you can even drive the car on your own property without<br>violating the law. You only need your license to drive on public<br>roadways.\<br>\<br>Now, if you\'re at a friend\'s house, and you\'re just sitting in the<br>car, listening to the radio with friends, it becomes a little more<br>sketchy. Did a friend drive the car, and now you\'re sitting in the<br>driver\'s seat? It\'s possible. You don\'t live at your friend\'s house,<br>but you\'re with a group, so it\'s fair to say that someone else may<br>have driven the car. If the officer questions others and finds that you<br>did drive the car, you can be arrested on the strength of their<br>testimony.\<br>\<br>If you\'re in the parking lot of a store, sitting in the driver\'s seat<br>of a car that is registered to you, it is a fair presumption to make<br>that you drove the car to that location. You don\'t live there, so you<br>(and your car) had to get there *somehow*. The store is only connected<br>to your property by public roads, and if you\'re there by yourself, no<br>one else drove the car. It\'s safe to make the assumption that you drove<br>the car there, even though no one saw you do it.\<br>\<br>(EDIT) I just read your comment thread, which I really wish you would<br>have posted as additional question details instead of a comment.<br>Nevertheless, the officer *actually observed you driving*. He is<br>also allowed to approach you anywhere and ask you questions. Since he<br>observed you driving on a public road, he can approach you and talk to<br>you *as if* he pulled you over. He can detain you, he can ask for<br>permission to search the car, and he can also call a drug dog to sniff<br>the outside of the car. If the dog hits, it\'s enough for probable cause<br>to search the car, which is a warrantless search.\<br>\<br>Not to mention you confessed to driving on a suspended license and<br>possible drug charges on Quora.\<br>\<br>It\'s time to stop playing around on Quora and use your browser to find<br>a good criminal defense attorney. You\'re going to need<br>one.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
