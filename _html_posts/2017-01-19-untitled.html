<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*The narrative of the gun owner, the story you present to me,- I can't<br>hear anything creative about it. There are no openings. What I hear is<br>"It's my way or the highway.".*<br><br>Please cite a specific example where you have tried to present an<br>alternate opinion in this thread and you have been shut down because a<br>gun owner believe he is right simply because he is a gun owner.<br><br>I will tell you that gun owners know they have the Constitution and over<br>200 years of American history on their side, so they do tend to get a<br>little sure of themselves, but when we have civil discussions, we<br>sometimes have to look past the person and look instead at the policy.<br><br>We actually don't see anything here that you have yet to offer that we<br>can debate about.<br><br>Finally, Quora is not a debate site. It is a question-and-answer site.<br>If you want to debate a topic, perhaps you should visit a different<br>website. Check out a few:<br><br>- [[The Premier Online Debate<br>  Website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c1ec2d&url=http://www.debate.org){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="debate.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br>- [idebate.org(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b5121f&url=http://www.idebate.org){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="idebate.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br>- [[Debate Forum \| Online Debate Community \|<br>  CreateDebate](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=252104&url=http://www.createdebate.com){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="createdebate.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>These are all debate sites, where you can present opinions for or<br>against any one of hundreds of topics.<br><br>Again, *Quora is not a debate site.* It is a question-and-answer site.<br><br>So if it sounds like you're simply getting an *answer* to your question,<br>it's probably because people are trying to answer your question, not<br>debate with you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Gun-owners-in-an-ideal-world-can-you-consider-an-understanding-between-the-anti-gun-position-and-yourself/answer/Mike-S-1686<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
