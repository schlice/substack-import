<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Note: I am not condoning the actions taken by the airline. I am simply<br>answering the question.*<br><br>The crew *had* been asking for volunteers. They were offering \$800, a<br>free night in a hotel if you had to stay another day to catch the next<br>flight, and free meals in-between. The ticket price on that flight was<br>around \$250, so they were offering roughly four times the value of<br>the ticket you paid, and they weren't getting any takers.<br><br>So it's not that they didn't ask before they told people to get off the<br>plane. They did. They had to get a crew into Louisville, or they would<br>have been forced to cancel the flight out of Louisville, which would<br>have inconvenienced far more passengers than the four they were<br>displacing. They made a strategic business decision. Was it worth it? As<br>of right now (11 Apr 17), UAL stock is down 4.4%, representing about<br>\$990 million in lost revenue.<br><br>Also, under normal circumstances, passengers understand that when they<br>receive "crewmember instructions," they are required under Federal law<br>to follow those instructions. Airlines have de-planed passengers before;<br>most passengers tacitly comply, because they understand that you are not<br>"guaranteed" passage on an aircraft. Remember, they needed four<br>seats; three other passengers de-planed as directed! As soon as you<br>refuse to follow a crewmember's instructions, you are a "hazard" and you<br>*should* be removed from the plane. When the passenger chose to refuse<br>to get off the plane, he escalated the situation.<br><br>So let's be fair: when you are told to get off the plane, it's not a<br>directive you have the right to refuse. Once the passenger refused to<br>follow crewmember instructions, it became a law enforcement issue.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
