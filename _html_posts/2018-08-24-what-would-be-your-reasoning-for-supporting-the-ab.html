<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What would be your reasoning for supporting the ability to 3D print<br>your guns, or ghost guns, as the media calls it? I am pro-2a but can\'t<br>see the reasoning behind this specifically as it seems too drastic.**<br><br>The reasoning is simple. **The threat to the 1st Amendment is far<br>greater than the threat posed by a 3-D printed gun.**<br><br>Perhaps at some point in the distant future, you'll be able to print all<br>of the parts for an actual, metallic gun, that will stand up to more<br>than one round being passed through it.<br><br>But current technology does not allow you to print much more than<br>plastic, and those won't stand up to the pressures exerted by a bullet.<br>You might get one or two shots out of it before it explodes.<br><br>You can 3-D print aluminum, but the process is difficult and expensive.<br>You could literally buy ten firearms for the cost of printing the parts<br>for one.<br><br>More importantly, in order to prevent people from 3-D printing guns, you<br>would have to prevent the digital media files from being distributed.<br>And [[digital media files (i.e. code) is free<br>speech.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3f3910&url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/tech/is-code-free-speech/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="pbs.org"}]{.qlink_container} Suppressing speech because we<br>don't like, or fear, the content, poses a greater threat to the 1st<br>Amendment than to your personal safety.<br><br>Let's not forget: you can already build your own guns at home. You can<br>buy a [[80%<br>lower](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3c0480&url=https://www.80percentarms.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="80percentarms.com"}]{.qlink_container} which with a little<br>bit of metal smithing, you can turn into a functional lower (the only<br>part of a semi-automatic rifle considered a "gun"). You can buy all the<br>rest of the pieces online (no permission needed to buy gun parts except<br>for the lower). There: a "ghost gun."<br><br>And you can build a "zip gun" for about \$20 in parts from the hardware<br>store. By the way: if the zombie apocalypse ever comes, find me. I'll<br>build you a really good zip gun for whatever the new currency is in the<br>post-apocalyptic zombie world. I'll be in my doomsday bunker.<br><br>If someone wants to make a gun at home, there are a lot better ways to<br>do it than 3-D printing one.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
