<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Could a long term high functioning alcoholic appeal a DUI on the<br>grounds that their tolerance is so high they are in no way impaired to<br>drive?**<br><br>The problem is that a DUI stop is made on the basis of visually<br>identifying driving impairment. The entire reasonable suspicion case is<br>built on the officer observing driving behavior which indicates<br>impairment.<br><br>Impairment + BAC out of limits = DUI.<br><br>The visualization of the impaired driving is the reasonable suspicion. A<br>failed FST or Breathalyzer and you have probable cause.<br><br>You cannot subsequently make a case that the basis for the stop was<br>unlawful because you are such a high-functioning alcoholic that you're<br>not impaired. The officer observed impaired driving, which is why you<br>were stopped initially anyway. You went on to fail a FST, which if your<br>claim was accurate, you would not do. Your BAC, either read at the<br>roadside or back at the station, would be the nail in the coffin.<br>Regardless of how high functioning and how tolerant you may be, the law<br>does not allow for tolerance. The law says that if you have a BAC over<br>0.08, you cannot drive. No exceptions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
