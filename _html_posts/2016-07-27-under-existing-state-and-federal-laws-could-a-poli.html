<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Question Details:*<br>><br>> *I am a Service Connected Disabled Veteran with multiple deployments<br>> to Iraq and Afghanistan. I am seeking a career in Law Enforcement and<br>> am worried that my VA Disability Rating might be viewed negatively.*<br><br>1.  Your medical records are protected health information (PHI) and<br>    cannot be accessed by anyone without your written consent. This<br>    falls under the federal HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and<br>    Accountability Act) guidelines. No agency has the authority to<br>    override this law. Your VA disability rating is considered PHI.<br>2.  The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) also protects you, as you<br>    are an American and you are disabled. ADA changed how employers are<br>    allowed to screen potential candidates so that persons with<br>    disabilities are not discriminated against. Your prospective<br>    employer is only allowed to list the physical functions required in<br>    the job and then they are allowed to ask you whether or not you can<br>    perform the physical functions listed, **with or without reasonable<br>    accommodations.** You only have to answer yes or no. The employer is<br>    allowed to perform physical testing to ensure you can meet those<br>    standards. So long as you pass the physical test, you can be hired.<br><br>I have personal experience with this, as I too have a service-connected<br>disability and I successfully completed the hiring process for my local<br>Sheriff's Office. You can choose to disclose or not to disclose this<br>information to your prospective employer; you are under no obligation to<br>disclose that information. Your employer may not discriminate against<br>you because you have a disability.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
