<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do you have a positive experience with an HOA?<br><br>*As you can see from my credential, I was President of our Colorado HOA<br>for three years. I also was a Board member for an additional six. I was<br>then a Vice President of our Florida HOA for two years. I don't know if<br>that makes me "biased," but I think it does make me a knowledgeable<br>answerer.*<br><br>Nearly every experience I had with our HOA was positive. We actually<br>started with *no* HOA in our community, and we homeowners opted to form<br>one.<br><br>I know, right? That's totally weird. You mean to say you had no HOA and<br>you *chose* to make one???<br><br>Yep.<br><br>Here's how it happened.<br><br>When our neighborhood was built, the builder tried to make it as easy as<br>possible for us. He and his legal team created a pseudo-HOA, not run by<br>the homeowners, but run completely by a property manager. All we'd have<br>to do is pay the money, and everything would be handled by someone else.<br><br>However, we started asking questions, such as "how much are you paying<br>for snow removal?" "Have you looked at better options for landscaping?"<br>"Are the sprinklers able to be paused during wet weather?" The<br>particular property manager in question not only did not have good<br>answers as to how our money was being spent, he was in some cases openly<br>hostile to our concerns.<br><br>For those of us who cared, that was untenable.<br><br>The neighborhood was still under construction, so we contacted the<br>builder, who owned about 50% of the remaining properties. We told him we<br>wanted more control over how the money was being spent, and he offered<br>to pay the legal fees so that the neighborhood could transition back to<br>a traditional HOA, with a homeowner Board. The builder voted yes for the<br>50% of properties he owned, and we held a few meetings of remaining<br>homeowners at some of our houses, and we got the signatures we needed to<br>make the transition.<br><br>That's not to say our HOA has been perfect. One Board decided that<br>homeowners should not park their cars on the street. We don't own the<br>street, but they decided that anyway (and it's legal). It's probably our<br>most controversial of rules. We've had people join the Board<br>specifically to try to reverse that one rule. When they failed, they<br>left the Board (actually, moved out of the neighborhood).<br><br>I always tried to be very available as HOA president. My email was<br>linked to the HOA email, so my phone received any direct emails, and I<br>tried to respond within a day. For me, I tried to *create* positive<br>experiences with the HOA. Not everyone was perfectly thrilled, but that<br>was my goal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
