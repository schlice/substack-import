Perhaps they feel that there is a cheaper<br>medication which would produce the same results. Your doctor should be<br>fighting for you to try to convince insurance that you need the<br>medication you are trying to get.<br><br>Finally, there are other ways to get your medication paid. In the case<br>of MS, contact your [[local chapter of the National MS<br>Society](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2ebc99&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Chapters){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} who can help<br>direct you to resources which provide assistance for medication costs.<br>Look for an affinity group for your disease to see if there are any<br>assistance programs which can help with medication costs.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
