<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's going to be a very low percentage of time. There are some police<br>duty assignments (usually in plain clothes) that do not require<br>ballistic vests be worn at all, but for most uniformed officers,<br>department policy requires ballistic vests be worn at all times while in<br>uniform.<br><br>Standard ballistic vests for normal duty wear are not designed to stop<br>rifle rounds, since the officers are required to wear them all day,<br>underneath their uniform shirts. It would be extremely uncomfortable and<br>obtrusive to wear metal plating as body armor all day, and it presents<br>that "intimidating" look that the President so dislikes. They therefore<br>wear Level IIIa ballistic vests, which is a soft body armor with<br>included trauma plates, usually rated to stop bullets up to .44 caliber<br>(.44 Mag) in size. Level IIIa ballistic vests will stop nearly all<br>handgun bullets. They won't stop rifle rounds.<br><br>When police go into tactical situations where they know they will face<br>gunfire, they wear Level III body armor. This is much bulkier, and is<br>worn over top of shirts and uniforms. It looks more like traditional<br>body armor, and is rated to stop rifle rounds up to 7.62 mm (.308 cal)<br>traveling up to 2780 ft/sec.<br><br>So officers who were killed in the line of duty:<br><br>- were hit in their ballistic vests using a caliber higher than what the<br>  vest is rated for (i.e. Dallas)<br>- were posted in an assignment not requiring a ballistic vest<br>- were hit in an area not protected by the vest and they succumbed to<br>  their injuries<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
