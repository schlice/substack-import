The military uses rail only sparingly, so a military-only rail route<br>    would be under-utilized.<br>2.  The military can ship things by rail just like everyone else during<br>    peacetime.<br>3.  The military can commandeer rail lines (like they can commandeer the<br>    United States interstate system of roads) during wartime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
