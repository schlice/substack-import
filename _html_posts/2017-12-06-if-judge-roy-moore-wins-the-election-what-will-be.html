<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If Judge Roy Moore wins the election, what will be the impact on<br>women's rights in the USA? Will women keep stepping forward with their<br>accusations?**<br><br>I suspect that the tide of accusers will continue, as more and more<br>women feel empowered to step forward and make their accusations.<br><br>If the state of Alabama chooses to elect Judge Moore, I feel that this<br>will have limited impact on this tide of accusers.<br><br>The question seems to imply that if Moore is not removed from Congress,<br>that women won't feel empowered to step forward with their accusations.<br><br>Which leads me to believe that women *want* to see men lose their<br>jobs and their life's work simply from accusations, and that the "only<br>acceptable outcome" for a man accused of sexual impropriety is to lose<br>his job.<br><br>I submit to you a different tack: instead of this tide of accusers<br>forcing men to lose their jobs, let's do something meaningful: maybe<br>it's time to extend the statute of limitations on rape, or get rid of it<br>altogether. Isn't prosecuting a rape as important to public safety as<br>prosecuting a murder? Maybe it's time to get some meaningful affirmative<br>consent laws passed. Maybe instead of men blathering on about how they<br>respect women, maybe they should really make an effort to ***prove<br>it.***<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
