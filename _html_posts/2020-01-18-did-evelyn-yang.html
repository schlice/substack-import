<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Did Evelyn Yang\'s doctor who assaulted her get a sweetheart deal from<br>the Manhattan DA that gave no jail time and kept him off a public list<br>of sexual offenders?**<br><br>I'm not sure how being a convicted felon, losing your medical license,<br>and being a registered sex offender is a "sweetheart" deal.<br><br>He may have avoided jail time by taking a plea agreement, but "taking a<br>plea" doesn't equate to "a sweetheart deal."<br><br>It's a plea deal. Nobody gets exactly what they want. Plea arrangements<br>are taken because getting the outcome you want in court is not<br>guaranteed, and the possibility exists that a jury may not see it the<br>same way the victim sees it. And sexual assault is most definitely, and<br>especially in the case of an OB-GYN, very difficult to prove.<br><br>The victims are always looking for "someone to pay" for what happened to<br>them. Victims always want to see the maximum amount of jail time. I<br>completely understand this desire for "a pound of flesh" for what<br>happened. But is that really *justice*? Or is that *revenge*?<br><br>Additionally, the DA's office is not charged with "making someone pay."<br>The DA's office is not charged with "getting the maximum amount of jail<br>time." The DA's office is charged with making sure that an alleged<br>aggressor does not have the opportunity to victimize someone else in<br>this way again, and their plea agreement ensures that not only will this<br>man never practice medicine again, he's a convicted felon and will never<br>be in a position of power again. He'll never be hired into any position<br>in which he'll have any position of power over a woman. As a matter of<br>fact, at his age, it's unlikely he'll ever have a meaningful job again<br>for the rest of his life. While his Level 1 Sex Offender status will<br>eventually fall off, he will always be a convicted felon, and he lost<br>his medical license, and won't ever really work again. He won't ever be<br>able to abuse women like this ever again.<br><br>I fail to see how that's a "sweetheart" deal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
