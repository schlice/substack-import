<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with any legal answer, "it depends." If the company wants their money<br>back from you, they will have to file a lawsuit against you, and it will<br>be up to them to prove that you knowingly were involved with fraud in<br>order to recoup their losses.<br><br>**If you had no involvement with any fraud, and had no knowledge of<br>fraudulent activity**, then US law regarding receiving unsolicited<br>merchandise through the mail applies. Whether or not the items made it<br>to your doorstep through fraud is irrelevant to you; you were not<br>involved with the fraud. You simply were the surprise recipient of<br>unsolicited merchandise. If that is truly the case, you are protected.<br>You are not "profiting from fraud" because in order be charged under<br>this statute, you must be involved with the fraud in some way, or have<br>knowledge of the fraudulent activity that led to the unsolicited<br>merchandise arriving at your doorstep.<br><br>If you were involved in some way with the fraud, or if you had<br>knowledge at all of how this merchandise was making its way to you,<br>you are liable. You are responsible for every dime you earned from<br>the sale of the items, and you are responsible for covering the losses<br>the company suffered. You can also likely be charged with mail-order<br>fraud, and the same organizations who would protect you if you were not<br>involved (the USPIS, the state AG, etc) will come after you instead, and<br>you'll face some hefty fines and possible jail time for perpetrating, or<br>participating in, or profiting from, the fraud.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
