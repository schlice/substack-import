<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You'll have the best luck if your phone is from AT&T or T-Mobile, as 90%<br>of the mobile networks in Africa are GSM-based.<br><br>You will need to unlock your phone (you'll probably have to pay to do<br>that, since you, like most people, probably haven't paid off your phone<br>yet. If you did, the carrier will help you unlock it), and then when you<br>arrive in Africa, buy a SIM card which works with the GSM provider where<br>you will be.

Check<br>the carriers in the area you will be staying to see if there is a CDMA<br>carrier. However, Verizon doesn't use SIM cards, so you'll likely have<br>to pay for their International service. Make sure you do, because if you<br>just use your phone without the International plan, you will pay the *a<br>la carte* rates, and those are super expensive.<br><br>Another alternative is renting a cheap phone while you are there. Plenty<br>of providers will rent you a country-specific mobile device with a local<br>number for you to use in-country. Just search up international mobile<br>rental on the Big G..<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
