<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, he's not "in power." He didn't "take power" like a<br>dictator. He doesn't "wield control" like a dictator. Therefore, he<br>can't be "toppled" from power.<br><br>Despite the media's incessant ramblings about Russia, Trump was<br>democratically elected. There is no question about that. He followed all<br>the rules of the election process, and he won. He did not "seize" power<br>unlawfully. He is not holding his office unlawfully.<br><br>So should he be "toppled" from power? What does that even mean? Do you<br>want to storm the gates of the Bastille and drag him to the guillotine?<br>You may *want* to do that, but since the nation's democratic system<br>still appears to be in full working order, perhaps your time would be<br>better spent on working up, oh I don't know, better ideas than the<br>ones he has. He won because people liked his ideas better, not because<br>of racism or xenophobia or Russia or any other excuse you can make. They<br>simply liked his ideas better than hers. Time to get over it and concede<br>that your candidate *sucked*.<br><br>**The truth of the matter is they all sucked. According to the voters,<br>he sucked less.**<br><br>Maybe if you come up with some better ideas, you (or your candidate) can<br>beat him in four years, at which time he will "self-topple" as he<br>voluntarily cedes power to the new winner.<br><br>We have had civil turnovers of power in this country for hundreds of<br>years. In four or eight years, we will have another civil turnover of<br>power.<br><br>He doesn't need to be toppled. He needs to be beaten in the arena of<br>ideas.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
