<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it possible for politicians, presumably on the left wing, to remove<br>the 2nd Amendment from the constitution? I\'m not saying I actually want<br>this, but I\'ve seen many people say there\'s no need for the 2nd<br>Amendment.**<br><br>The process for removing an amendment is in the Constitution. It<br>requires passing another amendment which supersedes the previous one.<br>You must follow the same process for the new amendment as for any new<br>amendment: the proposed amendment must be approved by a 2/3 majority in<br>Congress (both houses), and then must be ratified by 3/4 of the states<br>(38).<br><br>So can Democrats remove the 2nd Amendment from the Constitution? Not by<br>themselves.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
