<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you get a paper check bearing Trump\'s signature, would you<br>consider framing it?**<br><br>I would. Well, I'd take a copy of it and then cash the original.<br><br>But I have no idea why Donald Trump would be paying me. Are you talking<br>about the Economic Impact Payments related to the COVID-19 pandemic? His<br>name will be on the check, right under where it says "Economic<br>Impact Payment". But his signature certainly won't be on it. The<br>Treasury Department will sign the check.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
