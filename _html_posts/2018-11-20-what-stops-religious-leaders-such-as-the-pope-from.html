<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What stops religious leaders such as the Pope from amending the Bible<br>in the same way the Constitution is amended?**<br><br>The fact that the Constitution is a document with a defined amendment<br>process, and the Bible is a collection of the inspired Word of God which<br>is not amended.<br><br>The Constitution is amended by first drafting and passing an Amendment<br>through a supermajority of Congress (2/3 approval in both houses). 2/3<br>of the states can also form a Constitutional Convention to draft new<br>Amendments, but this has never been done in our nation's history. Once<br>the Amendment is written, using whichever means are used, it must be<br>*ratified* by 3/4 of the states. Only then does it become part of the<br>Constitution.<br><br>The Bible has never really been "edited" *per se*. The individual<br>writings which comprise the books of the Bible had previously been<br>duplicated many times over the centuries to prevent them from being<br>corrupted. What *has* happened to the Bible was that it has been<br>*translated*. *Many times**.* As of October 2017 the full Bible has<br>been translated into 670 languages, the New Testament alone into<br>1,521 languages and Bible portions or stories into 1,121 other<br>languages.\[1\](#nNrJZ){#cite-nNrJZ .citation_link} The problem with<br>these translations is that while you'd like to keep a translation as<br>close to the original Greek or Hebrew as possible, some words don't have<br>a one-to-one translation in another language. One notable example is the<br>word *love*. There are *four different words* in Greek to describe<br>different kinds of love: Eros, Storge, Philia, and Agape. English has<br>only one. Another good example is found in the Ten Commandments. The<br>sixth commandment is often translated as "Thou shalt not kill." In<br>actuality, a better translation would be "Thou shalt not *murder*." How<br>do we know this? The Bible actually calls for killing in some places.<br>Justifiable killing is specified in the Bible. Murder, on the other<br>hand, which is killing without justification, is specifically<br>disallowed.<br><br>Can the Bible be "edited" much like the Constitution can be amended? If<br>a book was found to be sufficiently apostolic as to be considered part<br>of the original canon, it might. But the original "canon of the Bible"<br>has been known to be so for thousands of years. Not likely that it can<br>be revised now.<br><br>[[How many times has the Bible been revised and why has it been<br>revised?](https://www.quora.com/How-many-times-has-the-Bible-been-revised-and-why-has-it-been-revised)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-nNrJZ){.citation_index} [[Bible translations -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0905c7&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_translations){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
