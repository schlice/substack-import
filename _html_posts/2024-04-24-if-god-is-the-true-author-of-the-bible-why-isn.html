<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Have you ever seen a movie or a TV show, and right at the very<br>beginning, it says something like, "Inspired By True Events." What does<br>that mean? Does that mean that the story is *exactly what happened*? No,<br>the notice at the beginning tells you that the story is its own, but the<br>*inspiration* for the story, the idea for the story, comes from<br>real-life events. The purpose of the notice is to let you know that<br>while it may resemble the true story, it is only a story "like" the<br>original story.<br><br>It's the same with the Bible.<br><br>God is not the author of the Bible. God is the *inspiration* behind the<br>Bible. God inspired the writers to write (in their own words) the<br>message that He wanted to send. Just like the movie or TV show that was<br>inspired by true events, the Bible is not the actual word of God (unless<br>there are direct quotes). The Bible is *inspired by God*, or more<br>specifically, inspired by the Holy Spirit.<br><br>The word "inspire" means "to breathe life into." God *breathes life*<br>into the words of the author.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
