<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends."<br><br>In most cases in most places around the United States, you are allowed<br>to use a security camera to protect your property, even if it<br>incidentally captures your neighbor's property.<br><br>That word, *incidentally,* means that the capture of the neighbor's<br>property is *incidental* to the capture of your own property. In other<br>words, if the camera is *primarily* capturing your yard, but it is also<br>*incidentally* capturing your neighbor's yard, then that incidental<br>capture is acceptable.<br><br>The only time that it would not be acceptable (and a situation in which<br>local code enforcement might be able to step in) is if your camera is<br>*primarily* capturing the neighbor's yard and only *incidentally* (or<br>not at all) capturing your own yard.<br><br>\<br><br>Now, when it comes to backyards, we get into much different<br>territory. There is, at least, a modicum of privacy expected in a<br>backyard, especially one surrounded by a privacy fence. There is, at<br>least, an expectation that from the ground level, there is limited<br>to no visibility into that backyard.<br><br>Now, if your neighbor has a two-story house, then it's a foregone<br>conclusion that they can see into your backyard. Whether they use their<br>eyeballs from a second-story window or a security camera is irrelevant.<br><br>But if they only have a one-story house, and they have positioned their<br>camera in a high location, now you have to go back to what I said in the<br>first section: it depends on what the camera is *primarily* capturing,<br>and what the camera is *incidentally* capturing.<br><br>\<br><br>So how do you deal with this situation? There are a number of ways to<br>address it. You can install more tall stuff. Install privacy netting<br>over the top of your backyard.<br><br>Or, you could go old school. And by "old school," I mean do what polite<br>society used to do back in the day: *talk to each other*. Express<br>your concern that their security camera may incidentally be looking into<br>your yard and you're not entirely comfortable with that. Maybe assist<br>them with finding a camera location that more directly captures their<br>own yard while maybe seeing less of yours.<br><br>If worse comes to worse, hire an attorney in your area who specializes<br>in civil rights law and privacy matters to send a strongly worded<br>registered lawyer letter telling them that you are threatening legal<br>action if they don't move their camera, and then sue them for violations<br>of your right to privacy in your backyard.<br><br>There are other high-tech solutions you can employ; you can get some<br>really high power infrared floodlights and install them on your house<br>pointed right at their camera. For most surveillance cameras which are<br>tuned to use IR illuminators, any camera looking into your yard will<br>look like they're looking directly into the sun and they won't be able<br>to see a thing. When he asks you to shut them off you can tell him to go<br>kick rocks because you already tried to act neighborly and they didn't<br>listen.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*I am not a lawyer, and this answer is not a substitute for professional<br>legal advice or a solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific<br>facts.
