<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Our department as well does not allow us to receive free<br>items. We would repay someone who paid for our meal, or we would pay<br>someone else\'s meal (we would pay for the meal of active duty military<br>should they be present). We also can\'t accept free items from<br>convenience stores (i.e. that cup of coffee is on the house).\<br>\<br>That said, we can\'t control what we are charged for food/drink; that\'s<br>your business. We just have to pay something.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
