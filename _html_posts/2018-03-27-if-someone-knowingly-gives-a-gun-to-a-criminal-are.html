<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If someone knowingly gives a gun to a criminal, are they accessories<br>to subsequent crimes committed with the gun?**<br><br>In general, no.<br><br>In order to connect the dots back to the person who gave the gun to the<br>criminal, the giver must have specific knowledge that 1. the criminal<br>was not legally authorized to possess the gun, and 2. the criminal was<br>going to use the illegally obtained gun to commit a specific crime. This<br>is a very tough bar to overcome, and it generally does not occur unless<br>the giver is actually criminally complicit in the crime (i.e. the giver,<br>who is legally authorized to buy a gun, is actually a criminal and is<br>part of the plot to commit the crime).<br><br>But in that case, the giver is likely an accessory to the actual crime.<br><br>At worst, generally the giver would only be guilty of violating gun laws<br>(i.e. knowingly transferring a gun to someone who is not legally<br>authorized to possess one). As an example, the person who sold the guns<br>to Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris (the Columbine High School shooters),<br>Mark Manes, was sentenced to six years in prison for providing a handgun<br>to a minor. The man who introduced Klebold and Harris to Manes, Philip<br>Duran, was sentenced to four and a half years for his part in<br>transacting the deal. Neither Manes nor Duran were found guilty of<br>killing anyone, or contributing to their death. Their crimes were<br>related only to gun laws.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
