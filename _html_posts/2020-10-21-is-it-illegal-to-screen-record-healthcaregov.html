If it is not, then there is no need to worry<br>about fair use)*<br><br>In general, *IF* you are capturing your interaction with the website<br>while narrating on top of it for the expressed purpose of *training,* or<br>teaching people how to use the website, this would most likely be<br>considered *fair use*.<br><br>> Fair use is a doctrine that permits limited use of copyrighted<br>> material without acquiring permission from the rights holders.<br>> Examples of fair use include commentary, search engines, criticism,<br>> news reporting, research, teaching, library archiving and scholarship.<br>> It provides for the legal, non licensed citation or incorporation of<br>> copyrighted material in another author's work under a four-factor<br>> balancing test.\[1\](#hzJUZ){#cite-hzJUZ .citation_link}<br><br>The Wikipedia entry discusses a "four-factor balancing test" for<br>determining whether or not your work is covered by fair use:<br><br>1.  The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is<br>    of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;<br>2.  The nature of the copyrighted work;<br>3.  The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the<br>    copyrighted work as a whole; and<br>4.  The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the<br>    copyrighted work.<br><br>Purpose of use. This is pretty easy to define, but the gist of it is<br>related to whether or not your use of the copyrighted material is for<br>*commercial* or *non-profit educational purposes*. The more money you<br>try to make from your use of the copyrighted material, the less likely<br>it will be considered fair use.<br><br>Nature of the copyrighted work. The more factual the copyrighted<br>work is (as opposed to creative), the more likely it will be considered<br>fair use to use it yourself.<br><br>Amount and Substantiality. There's no hard and fast limit on how<br>much of a copyrighted work you can use before you are no longer under<br>the fair use doctrine. But as a general rule, the more you use, the more<br>potential you have for being denied protection under fair use.<br><br>Effect upon Works Value. You shouldn't have to worry about this one,<br>because it is the federal government that runs the website in question,<br>so it is not selling its work. However, if you seek to gain from your<br>work, you may run into a fair use problem. In general, if you use your<br>screen capture to educate, you're likely okay. But the more money you<br>stand to make from your project, the more likely you run into a fair use<br>problem.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is legal information, not legal advice.* *This answer<br>is not a substitute for professional legal advice, nor is it a<br>solicitation to offer professional legal advice.
