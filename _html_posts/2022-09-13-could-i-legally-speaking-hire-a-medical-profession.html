The<br>question isn't also about using your blood for art (although that's an<br>interesting idea with its own challenges --- we'll get there in a<br>minute).<br><br>The big problem you're going to have is how to store your blood.<br><br>In the U.S., the collection, testing, preparation, storage and transport<br>of blood and blood components must comply with FDA regulations and<br>guidance documents. And blood that is not going to be used for medical<br>purposes is considered medical waste and is a biohazard. Blood<br>is a biohazard because it has the potential to carry contagions which<br>can infect others. Therefore, blood must be handled in accordance with<br>its intended use, and storing blood for artistic use is similarly going<br>to be a problem, both legally and practically.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Could I, legally speaking, hire a medical professional to draw my blood<br>so that I can store it and use it for artistic purposes?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
