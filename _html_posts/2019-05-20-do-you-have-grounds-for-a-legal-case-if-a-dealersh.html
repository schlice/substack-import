<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you have grounds for a legal case if a dealership sells you a car<br>that experiences a critical mechanical failure a week later related to<br>an error code that has been cleared in its computer?**<br><br>You might. No one here can tell you whether or not you have a case,<br>because that would be considered *specific legal advice*, and we can't<br>give you that.<br><br>However, car dealerships are required to disclose any and all issues<br>that they are aware of with the vehicle, otherwise it may be considered<br>fraud by non-disclosure. More specifically, dealers are required to<br>disclose anything which might affect the value or desirability of a<br>vehicle, and failure to inform the customer that the vehicle had a<br>pre-existing mechanical issue may be covered, especially if it was the<br>dealership who cleared that code without fixing that issue.<br><br>Contact an attorney in your area who pursues fraud claims. Most of them<br>work on a contingency basis, which means that you can usually retain one<br>with little to no up-front cost (they'll only get paid when they collect<br>for you).<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice. This<br>answer does not create an attorney-client relationship, nor is it a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice. This answer is for GENERAL<br>INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. If you ignore this warning and convey<br>confidential information in a private message or comment, there is no<br>duty to keep that information confidential or forego representation<br>adverse to your interests. Seek the advice of a licensed attorney in the<br>appropriate jurisdiction before taking any action that may affect your<br>rights. If you believe you have a claim against someone, consult an<br>attorney immediately, otherwise there is a risk that the time allotted<br>to bring your claim may expire.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to legal questions are intended<br>third-party beneficiaries with certain rights under Quora\'s* [[*Terms<br>of Service*](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
