<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Piggybacking on Steve\'s answer, Dick met an Israeli tank<br/>driver named Moshe Yanai, who had a great idea for an integrated cached<br/>disk array, and the Symmetrix was born. For more than 20 years,<br/>Symmetrix has been the gold standard by which other disk arrays are<br/>measured. The design has been refined and improved over the years (most<br/>recently incorporating a Direct Matrix architecture, eliminating the<br/>delay in the data busses), but it still remains the uncontested champion<br/>of the storage array world.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
