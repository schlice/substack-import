<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Voting should be restricted to US citizens.<br><br>ID should be mandatory to enforce this.<br><br>\<br><br>This shouldn't even be a question. The people who are citizens of the<br>United States should be the people who determine the direction and<br>leadership of the United States, not just someone visiting on hoiday, or<br>someone on a student visa, or someone who may have crossed the border<br>illegally, or someone awaiting an asylum hearing, or any other<br>classification of person lawfully or unlawfully present in the United<br>States.<br><br>The only people who should vote are citizens. It's one of the<br>privileges of being a citizen.<br><br>\<br><br>Since people seem to not care about our laws, then unfortunately we must<br>resort to voter registration and identification to prove that you're at<br>the right voting place, and you are registered to vote, and you are the<br>person you claim you are.<br><br>Government identification isn't a big lift. You require government<br>identification for so many different things in life in the United States<br>that it's actually challenging to live *without* it. And yes, it is<br>absolutely true that some people do not have state issued ID cards or<br>driver's licenses. But that number is *vanishingly rare*.<br><br>I could set up a help booth and literally give assistance to anyone who<br>doesn't have an ID card, and I guarantee I could make it happen one way<br>or another. There are so many provisions to get ID cards to people that<br>there is virtually no way that it can't be done.<br><br>The trope that requiring ID is discriminatory has absolutely no basis in<br>reality.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
