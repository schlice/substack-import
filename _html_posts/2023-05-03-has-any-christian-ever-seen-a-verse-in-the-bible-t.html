<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The simple answer is yes, God's love for humans is unconditional.<br><br>Here's how we know: ***God always initiates love; His love is never a<br>response to us.*** That is precisely what makes it unconditional. If His<br>love was in response to us, that would mean that we would have to *do*<br>something to earn His love or to merit it. We would somehow have to<br>become *worthy* to receive His love. Or in different terms, we'd have to<br>get clean before we take a shower, or we'd have to get well before we<br>see the doctor.<br><br>But that's not the Biblical message. The clear message of the Gospel is<br>that God, motivated solely and unconditionally by His love, moved to<br>save people from their sin.<br><br>We can see it clearly in 1 John 4:9--10:<br><br>> This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son<br>> into the world that we might live through him. This is love: not that<br>> we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning<br>> sacrifice for our sins<br><br>In other words, we can love Him because *He loved us first.*<br><br>You can also see it in Ephesians 2:4--5:<br><br>> But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made<br>> us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions---it is<br>> by grace you have been saved<br><br>We were dead in our sin. And when you're dead, you have no<br>capability to initiate *anything*. It is only God's great love for us<br>that *made us alive* with Christ. We were dead; we alone could do<br>nothing. It is only God's love that could place us in a position to<br>which we could accept His saving grace.<br><br>\<br><br>Now, don't be confused by this. Just because His love is unconditional<br>(meaning we don't have to do anything to earn His love) does not mean<br>that He saves everyone.<br><br>> And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into<br>> eternal life. --- Matthew 25:46<br><br>It also does not mean that God will never discipline His children.<br>Ignoring God's love and rejecting the gift of His son will subject us to<br>His eternal wrath.<br><br>> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness<br>> and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the<br>> truth. --- Romans 1:18 ESV<br><br>Yes, God loves all of humanity. But he loves Christians in a different<br>way than he loves non-Christians. Christians are *saved* because they<br>believe in Christ. God's unconditional love for all people *should*<br>motivate a person to belief in Christ.<br><br>TL;DR: Salvation is *conditional*. God's love for us is *not*.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
