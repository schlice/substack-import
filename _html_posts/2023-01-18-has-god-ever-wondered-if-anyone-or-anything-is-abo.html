<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In order for God to "wonder" something, there would have to be a time<br>when God did not know something, then God would have to "wonder"<br>something, and then God might have a different answer after the<br>wondering.<br><br>However, *God is not subject to time*, so there is no "before the<br>wondering," there is no "time of wondering" and there is no "after the<br>wondering." There just is. For God, all is now. The past is now. Now<br>is now. The future is now.<br><br>Additionally, God cannot "wonder" in the way you are positing because<br>that would indicate that there is something that God does not know, and<br>then He ponders it.<br><br>This is the danger when we think of God using man's physical<br>limitations. God cannot wonder in this way because doing so subjects God<br>to the limitations of time and limited knowledge. God is not limited in<br>either way.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Has God ever wondered if anyone or anything is above him?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
