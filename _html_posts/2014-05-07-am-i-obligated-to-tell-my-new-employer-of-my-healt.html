<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Since you have indicated that you are in the US, the<br/>predominating law is the Americans with Disabilities Act, which controls<br/>how employers hire and what questions they are allowed to ask you<br/>regarding the work.\<br/>\<br/>Basically, the law says that they are not allowed to discriminate<br/>against you based on your condition. In other words, they cannot say,<br/>\"You have MS, therefore you cannot work for us.\"\<br/>\<br/>What they can do is to describe the physical requirements of the job<br/>(required to stand for long periods of time, required to occasionally<br/>lift up to 50 pounds, required to have manual dexterity) and they can<br/>require that you affirm you can perform the physical requirements of the<br/>job. They can also test you to ensure you can perform the physical<br/>requirements of the job. For example, I have MS as well, and when I<br/>applied for the police department, I did inform them I have MS but I can<br/>perform all the requirements of the job. The medical clinic did test me<br/>to ensure I could perform the requirements of the job, and they were<br/>satisfied with this. My supervisor is aware of my MS and he just asks<br/>that I be aware of myself and if something needs to be change to ensure<br/>everyone\'s safety (i.e. I need to return to the A/C in a car instead of<br/>being out in the sun all day) that I let him know and he will make the<br/>appropriate manning adjustments. He has no problem with this, and he<br/>doesn\'t look at me as \"less\" of a deputy because of it. All of this<br/>is perfectly legal and conforms with the requirements specified in the<br/>ADA.\<br/>\<br/>In addition, if you require reasonable accommodations to accomplish<br/>the requirements of the job, you are still allowed to affirm that you<br/>can perform the physical requirements of the job. For example, if you<br/>require a special wrist rest in order to use a keyboard, or an ergonomic<br/>chair to sit for lengths of time, you can positively affirm that you can<br/>perform the physical requirements of the job, because the accommodations<br/>you require are reasonable. You also don\'t have to request the<br/>accommodations during the hiring process, but in order to get the<br/>accommodations, you will eventually have to reveal your disability and<br/>your required accommodations. An unreasonable accommodation would be one<br/>that significantly changes the business, or requires such significant<br/>cost that it would be prohibitively costly for the business to<br/>implement. In such a circumstance, I would recommend you reveal this<br/>during the hiring process so that they can ensure that your<br/>accommodations are in place for when you start work and that they are<br/>not too onerous on the business.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
