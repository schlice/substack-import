<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [*Is it an effective means at reducing firearms violence in<br>schools?*\<br>\<br>Based on the amount of firearms violence in schools, the people doing<br>the shooting don\'t much care if there is a Gun-Free School Zones Act or<br>not.\<br>\<br>The law-abiding citizens who \*could\* be armed and who would normally<br>pose no danger to kids in schools and who could potentially stop a mass<br>shooter in a school, however, is hamstrung because he actually follows<br>the laws.\<br>\<br>So the Act has exactly the opposite effect of what it was going for: it<br>keeps the law-abiding citizen from preventing a crime, and allows the<br>criminals to shoot with abandon, knowing there will be no armed<br>opposition from law-abiding citizens.\<br>\<br>Sounds like a candidate for repeal to me\...]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
