<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I can help you with that.<br><br>I support *the idea of Trump*.<br><br>- I support a "political outsider." Someone who hasn't been "infected"<br>  by "the swamp."<br>- I support someone who will stand up to "the swamp" and to special<br>  interests alike.<br>- I support someone who can't be bought (and while I don't like the idea<br>  of billionaires running the country, billionaires can safely turn down<br>  big money donors).<br>- I support someone who, at a very minimum, "talks the talk." They<br>  understand the plight of the small businessman, whose efforts comprise<br>  much of the base of the economy. The understand the plight of the blue<br>  collar worker, who is largely ignored by the coastal elites.<br>- I support someone who may not necessarily be a true "conservative" in<br>  every sense of the word, but someone who understands and espouses at<br>  least a few conservative ideas, like reining in big government and<br>  empowering the states to address regional issues, and dismantling the<br>  scourge of bureaucratic despotism.<br><br>And while Trump is many of these things, I don't like Trump the man.<br>He is brash. He is bombastic. He is ineloquent. Not that any of these<br>things are *required* to be President, but as was evidenced by Trump's<br>presidency, when you have those qualities, your *intent* is often<br>overlooked while the media and the Democrats pore over your *words*. His<br>reliance on social media to reach his base was eventually his downfall,<br>and while it has sparked a conversation about big tech censorship, I<br>think that his use of the technology instead of increased curated<br>outreach by a press office was, in fact, a hindrance rather than a<br>benefit.<br><br>He's also a *misogynist.* He's a "womanizer." He may have slowed down<br>these days, but those behaviors actually alter your brain chemistry and<br>make you think along specific neural pathways that I abhor. Again, it<br>seems that everyone in Washington has skeletons (and a lot of other<br>stuff I could go my whole life without seeing) in their closets, but the<br>whole Stormy Daniels business just took too much attention away from<br>what he needed to do.<br><br>We *want* to like Trump, because he embodies everything that we like,<br>politically. But we don't like all of those political things *in the<br>package that is Trump*.<br><br>When it came down to *Trump vs Clinton*, the choice was much easier. But<br>by himself, Trump carries too much baggage to really be effective in<br>doing all of the things we want to do.<br><br>So it's really hard to directly answer the question about "do you like<br>Trump" because that implies so many things. I like Trump's ideas, but I<br>don't like Trump.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why is it that whenever I ask someone why they support Trump, they never<br>give me a straight answer? The response is always about the other<br>political parties or some other politician.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
