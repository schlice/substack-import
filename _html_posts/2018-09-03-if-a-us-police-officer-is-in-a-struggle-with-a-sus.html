While it's<br>unlikely that the district attorney would file charges against you, you<br>will most likely be sued for assault and battery. The damages you will<br>have to pay will be limited by the fact that the petitioner was engaged<br>in an altercation with a police officer for (presumably) something<br>illegal he was doing, but you could still face monetary damages for your<br>part. Your damages will also be limited by the fact that the petitioner<br>will not be able to be certain which injuries were inflicted by you and<br>which injuries were inflicted by the officer, but there will be some<br>level of liability you will face for inflicting injuries.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
