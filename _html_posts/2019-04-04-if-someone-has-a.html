<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If someone has a so-called \'disability\' does he have additional<br>rights if facing an eviction?**<br><br>The wording of your question is quite telling.<br><br>So let's start with the most blaring point: *do you have a disability,<br>or do you not?* A person with disability is defined by the Americans<br>with Disabilities Act as "a person who has a physical or mental<br>impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activity."<br>So there is either a disability, or there is not.<br><br>But this is covered by the Fair Housing Act, not ADA.<br><br>> The [[Fair Housing<br>> Act](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=48ef7c&url=https://www.justice.gov/crt/fair-housing-act-2){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="justice.gov"}]{.qlink_container} prohibits discrimination<br>> on the basis of disability in all types of housing transactions. The<br>> Act defines persons with a disability to mean those individuals with<br>> mental or physical impairments that substantially limit one or more<br>> major life activities. The term mental or physical impairment may<br>> include conditions such as blindness, hearing impairment, mobility<br>> impairment, HIV infection, mental retardation, alcoholism, drug<br>> addiction, chronic fatigue, learning disability, head injury, and<br>> mental illness. The term major life activity may include seeing,<br>> hearing, walking, breathing, performing manual tasks, caring for<br>> one\'s self, learning, speaking, or working. The Fair Housing Act also<br>> protects persons who have a record of such an impairment, or are<br>> regarded as having such an impairment. Current users of illegal<br>> controlled substances, persons convicted for illegal manufacture or<br>> distribution of a controlled substance, sex offenders, and juvenile<br>> offenders are not considered disabled under the Fair Housing Act, by<br>> virtue of that status. The Fair Housing Act affords no protections to<br>> individuals with or without disabilities who present a direct threat<br>> to the persons or property of others. Determining whether someone<br>> poses such a direct threat must be made on an individualized basis,<br>> however, and cannot be based on general assumptions or speculation<br>> about the nature of a disability. The Division\'s enforcement of the<br>> Fair Housing Act\'s protections for persons with disabilities has<br>> concentrated on two major areas. One is insuring that zoning and other<br>> regulations concerning land use are not employed to hinder the<br>> residential choices of these individuals, including unnecessarily<br>> restricting communal, or congregate, residential arrangements, such as<br>> group homes. The second area is insuring that newly constructed<br>> multifamily housing is built in accordance with the Fair Housing<br>> Act\'s accessibility requirements so that it is accessible to and<br>> usable by people with disabilities, and, in particular, those who use<br>> wheelchairs. There are other federal statutes that prohibit<br>> discrimination against individuals with disabilities, including the<br>> Americans with Disabilities Act, which is enforced by the Disability<br>> Rights Section of the Civil Rights<br>> Division.\[1\](#zDTev){#cite-zDTev .citation_link}<br><br>There's a lot to digest there, but if you can find evidence that the<br>eviction is based on the disability, or even the perception that someone<br>is disabled, you may have a claim under the Fair Housing Act.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-zDTev){.citation_index} [[The Fair Housing<br>Act](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=01d8d6&url=https://www.justice.gov/crt/fair-housing-act-1){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="justice.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
