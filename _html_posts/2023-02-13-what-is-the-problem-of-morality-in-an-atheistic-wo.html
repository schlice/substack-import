<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In an atheistic worldview, the problem of morality is *its source*.<br><br>We know that we should be good people, but *why?* Why should we be<br>faithful to our families? Who said we should "help people?" Is "helping<br>people" a universal moral obligation, or is it just true for you but not<br>for me? And to what end should you help them: Financially? Emotionally?<br>Physically? Spiritually?<br><br>If there's no objective standard outside of ourselves, then life is<br>nothing but a glorified Monopoly game. You can acquire lots of money and<br>lots of property, but when the game is over, it's all going back in the<br>box.<br><br>Is that really what life is all about?<br><br>Atheists have an innate sense of right and wrong; they just can't<br>quantify its origin, and why we all have it, regardless of how we were<br>raised.<br><br>Everyone knows that love is better than hate. Everyone knows courage is<br>better than cowardice. University of Texas at Austin professor J.<br>Budziszewski writes, "Everyone knows certain principles. There is no<br>land where murder is virtue and gratitude vice." C. S. Lewis wrote,<br>"Think of a country where people were admired for running away in<br>battle, or where a man felt proud of double-crossing all the people who<br>had been kindest to him. You might just as well try to imagine a country<br>where two and two made five."<br><br>We call those things that "everyone knows" the *moral law*. And the fact<br>that the moral law has been prescribed on the minds and hearts of every<br>human being implies the fact that there is a moral law prescriber. Every<br>prescription has a prescriber. The moral law is no different. The moral<br>law goes like this:<br><br>1.  Every law has a law giver.<br>2.  There is a moral law.<br>3.  Therefore, there is a moral law giver.<br><br>Statement 1 is indeed true. There can be no legislation without a<br>legislature. And if there is a moral *obligation*, there must be someone<br>to whom we are *obligated*. In other words, everyone knows there are<br>absolute moral obligations. An absolute moral obligation is something<br>that is binding on all people, at all times, in all places. And an<br>absolute Moral Law implies an absolute Moral Law Giver.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
