<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Your argument is known as a [[false<br>equivalence](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d6f1d5&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} so it\'s easy to see how<br>you can get caught up in believing that these two ideas (gun control and<br>mandatory vaccinations) are equivalent. They both are related to rights<br>and whether or not you have the free exercise thereof. Other than that,<br>there is no relation between the two concepts.\<br>\<br>First, I didn\'t see any right to be free from vaccinations in the Bill<br>of Rights. \"The right of the people to be free from vaccinations shall<br>not be infringed.\" I missed that amendment. There is, however, a right<br>to keep and bear arms in the Constitution, right after the amendment<br>that allows you free speech and the free exercise of religion.\<br>\<br>Second, owning or carrying a firearm is not a public health issue; not<br>getting vaccinated is. You benefit from the vaccinations of others even<br>if you choose not to vaccinate; as the population density increases, the<br>number of vaccinated individuals assists you with staying disease-free,<br>because others will be less likely to transmit the disease. You not<br>getting vaccinated risks a public health pandemic, allowing the disease<br>to spread throughout the population to people who can\'t be vaccinated<br>because of immune system complications and other reasons. Your<br>*choosing* to be unvaccinated threatens them. This is where the call for<br>mandatory vaccinations comes into play.\<br>\<br>No such similar threat exists when you carry a firearm. In fact, the<br>opposite effect happens: when you carry a firearm, others around you<br>become safer. You benefit from the safety of the person carrying a<br>firearm; criminals will think twice before acting in your vicinity, thus<br>making you safer.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
