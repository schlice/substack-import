<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Whether or not you have fear is not something which can be legislated.<br>We can only discuss what the law says.<br><br>As long as you verbally state that you are exercising your Fifth<br>Amendment right to remain silent, **your silence cannot be used against<br>you in a *criminal* proceeding***.* The Fifth Amendment<br>prohibits judges and juries from drawing any "adverse inferences"<br>against you for not testifying. For example, let's say you have been<br>charged with assault. You decide not to testify at trial. The judge<br>cannot then instruct the jury that it can infer your guilt based on your<br>silence. After all, that would defeat the entire purpose of the right<br>against self-incrimination.<br><br>However, we need to drive this point home: *you must* *verbally*<br>*state* *that you are exercising your right to remain silent*; you<br>can't just not speak at all.<br><br>This is important. Silence can be used against you. Stating that you<br>are exercising your 5th Amendment right to not answer questions<br>cannot be used against you, but just sitting there like a bump on a<br>hump not speaking any words *can* be used against you.<br><br>I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, "If I am trying to remain<br>silent, why do I have to not remain silent in order to remain<br>silent?"<br><br>It totally reminds me of this:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-04db20259140255771041d773c95d277){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-04db20259140255771041d773c95d277" master_w="385"<br>master_h="480"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(If the page is supposed to be blank, then why is the page not blank?)*<br><br>The reason is that you don't really have a right to *remain silent*,<br>meaning you don't have a right to not speak words. You have a right to<br>*remain silent*, meaning you have a right to not answer questions which<br>may incriminate you (i.e. all of them). So you can say that you are<br>not going to answer questions, but in order to invoke that right to not<br>answer questions, you must verbally and unambiguously state that you are<br>not going to answer questions.<br><br>\<br><br>It's also important to note that the 5th Amendment only applies to<br>*criminal* cases (i.e. when you're arrested by the police). In a<br>*civil* case (i.e. where you are facing a lawsuit), the judge<br>can draw an "adverse inference" from your silence.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
