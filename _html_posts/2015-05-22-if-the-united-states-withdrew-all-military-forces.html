<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [ISIS would NOT simply stop fighting and go back to their<br>homes.\<br>\<br>ISIS WILL likely grow in power, take over the remainder of Libya, move<br>on to Iraq and Iran, and will gain enough power to start launching<br>attacks against the US mainland. They may do this if we continue to<br>resist them, anyway.\<br>\<br>If we don\'t keep bringing the fight to them, they will MOST CERTAINLY<br>bring the fight to us.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
