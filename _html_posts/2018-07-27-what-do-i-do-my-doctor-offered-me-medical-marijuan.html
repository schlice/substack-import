<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What do I do? My doctor offered me medical marijuana to deal with the<br>extreme nerve pain and muscle spasms being caused by my multiple<br>sclerosis, but I'm in recovery from addiction with over 9 years clean.<br>I'm not sure what I should do.**<br><br>I'm sorry your doctor did this. So long as your doctor knows you're an<br>addict, he never should have brought it up.<br><br>I'm not going to get into the "cannabis isn't addictive" argument<br>because it is completely irrelevant when it comes to an addict. That<br>said, you might consider using a cannabis derivative.<br><br>Before I discuss it further, cannabis is normally only refined in states<br>where medical marijuana is legal. If you are not in one of these states,<br>you're not going to be able to get the refined cannabis at all, and this<br>discussion is dead before it starts. But for the moment, let's assume<br>you're in a state where medical marijuana is legal and you can get<br>cannabis tinctures and oils.<br><br>They take the cannabis and separate the antioxidant-rich cannabidiol<br>(CBD) from the psychoactive tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and provide you<br>with an oil which contains only the CBD. The oil base is usually a<br>vegetable oil or a glycerine like a propylene glycol. If you have the<br>choice, go with the vegetable oil base rather that the propylene glycol.<br>You put a few drops on your food and you don't get high, you just get<br>the benefits of the CBD. The CBD has been shown to decrease neurological<br>pain as well as decreasing spasticity, so it's definitely a useful<br>treatment (it's not a snake oil just designed to distract you).<br><br>Whether or not you go this route is entirely up to you. If you do decide<br>to try a CBD oil, make sure your care team is fully aware of what you're<br>doing, and can help you through it. If, however, you decide the risk of<br>relapse (that's drug relapse, not MS relapse) is too great a risk to<br>take, then forget the whole idea. Go back to your doctor and tell him to<br>forget it and come up with another plan. There's a fair chance that any<br>commercial drug which might touch your pain and/or spasticity is going<br>to have some hefty side effects and is basically toxic, **and may also<br>be addictive itself!** (I'm looking at you, OxyContin). So part of the<br>problem here is that any alternatives which might actually work for you<br>may actually be addictive, while CBD oil would be the least addictive<br>(if at all) in the bunch.<br><br>If it were me in your shoes, and I had the choice between a CBD oil and<br>OxyContin, I'd go with CBD oil. However, this is a very personal<br>decision, and I can't imagine how difficult this decision must be for<br>you. I wish you all the best.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
