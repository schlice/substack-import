<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Now that the results of the investigation of Brett Kavanaugh have<br>shown his innocence, is the FBI or any other officer going to arrest<br>Ford for falsely accusing someone for a crime and Diane Feinstein for<br>withholding evidence of an alleged crime?**<br><br>1.  Christine Blasey Ford may have made a reckless accusation without<br>    corroboration, *but she truly believes what she remembers*. **This<br>    does not qualify as a false accusation**. A false accusation is<br>    where you know the truth, but deliberately speak a falsehood in<br>    order to deceive. This is not what Dr. Ford did.<br>2.  The Senate Judiciary Committee is absolutely going to investigate<br>    where the "leak" of Ford's letter came from. Whether or not they<br>    refer Sen. Feinstein to the Ethics Committee for failing to report<br>    information for investigation until the last minute remains to be<br>    seen. But there is no crime here, it's just an allegation of past<br>    bad behavior. There's no crime, so she didn't withhold evidence of a<br>    crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
