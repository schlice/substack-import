<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the meaning of this, you were a cup of tea but I drink<br>champagne now?**<br><br>The original phrase was, "You were my cup of tea, but I drink champagne<br>now." "My cup of tea" is a phrase which, when discussing a person as in<br>"you are my cup of tea," means that you are perfect for me, or that we<br>are a perfect match.<br><br>The original idea behind the phrase was that the speaker has moved on<br>from the listener to someone "more sophisticated" and "of higher<br>status," as champagne is generally considered to be a celebratory<br>beverage, consumed by those of higher social status than lowly tea,<br>which is consumed by nearly everyone and anyone. The speaker is trying<br>to intimate that he has "moved up" from the listener to someone<br>"better."<br><br>However, I must say that [[Kalli<br>Noble](https://www.quora.com/profile/Kalli-Noble-1)]{.qlink_container}'s<br>meaning is just a perfect retort to the original phrase's meaning, using<br>qualities of the two drinks to indicate the position that the listener<br>believes the speaker has actually "stepped down" in leaving the listener<br>for the new person, who is actually "bubble-headed" as opposed to the<br>listener, who was "warm and perfect."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
