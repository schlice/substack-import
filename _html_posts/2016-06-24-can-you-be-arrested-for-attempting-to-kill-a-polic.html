<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's dissect your question<br><br>*Can you be arrested for attempting to kill a police officer*<br><br>Absolutely. I would even go so far as to say *I guarantee you will be<br>arrested*. You will also be charged with attempted murder (or actual<br>murder if the officer dies.<br><br>*Even though it was self defense and they were in the wrong?*<br><br>The notion of "self-defense" is what we call a *defense* against the<br>charge of murder or attempted murder. The prosecution's job will be to<br>prove that you were attempting the unlawful taking of a human life, with<br>forethought and malice. The defense's job will be to show that you were<br>acting in self-defense.<br><br>However, you can't defend yourself using force against a peace officer<br>acting within his jurisdiction. So it will *also* be the defense<br>attorney's job to show that the officer was acting ***outside of his<br>authority***. So you have a very steep hill to climb. Not only do you<br>first have to show that the officer was acting outside of his authority,<br>you will then have to show that you were acting in self-defense against<br>an officer who you unequivocally knew had no authority to do what he was<br>doing. The prosecutor will literally have a field day with you over that<br>one. It would be a very difficult charge to prove, since they will most<br>likely use the "reasonable man" standard, and the reasonable man would<br>most likely not know that the officer was within or not within his<br>authority, and that item is a matter of law to be determined by a judge,<br>not by you.<br><br>So will you be arrested? Yes. Can you claim self-defense? **You can<br>claim anything you want, but it will be *very* difficult to be<br>found not guilty.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
