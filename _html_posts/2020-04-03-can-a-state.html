<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can a state\'s legislature override a governor\'s executive order? I<br>know with the US President, there are federal court processes, for<br>example, but how does it work with a governor?**<br><br>It works exactly the same way with a governor.<br><br>The governor can issue an executive order which directs his government<br>agencies to do or not do something, in accordance with the law. For<br>example, he could order his Attorney General to use as much<br>prosecutorial discretion (which is legal under state law) as he wanted<br>when dealing with marijuana crimes. In other words, don't prosecute<br>those cases any more for low-level users.<br><br>The state legislature could then choose, for example, to write a new<br>bill which states that all laws must be prosecuted as written, when<br>evidence of a crime exists. It would be a "mandatory prosecution" law.<br><br>But remember, a bill must be signed by the governor before it becomes<br>law. And considering the governor's most recent executive order, it's<br>highly unlikely that he would sign such a bill into law, undoing his own<br>executive order.<br><br>However, just like at the federal level, in most states, a supermajority<br>of the state legislature can override a governor's veto. So if enough of<br>the legislature thought that the executive order was wrong-headed, they<br>could write a new law, but it would have to be veto-proof.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
