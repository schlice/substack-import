<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, all firearms are *machines*, and all firearms are *guns*.<br><br>But there is a definition of a *machine gun* that exists in law, and<br>that definition is a weapon which fires more than one bullet for each<br>pull of the trigger.<br><br>Adding an accessory like a bump stock doesn't change this action; you<br>still produce one round fired per trigger pull, so a bump stock produces<br>what amounts to a *simulated machine gun*. It is not mechanically<br>different than any other semiautomatic rifle.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
