<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can prison guards actually lock you naked in a concrete strip cell as<br>punishment?**<br><br>Not in the United States. The Constitution (most of it, anyway) still<br>applies to those incarcerated, and the Eighth Amendment verbatim enjoins<br>the government from imposing "cruel and unusual punishment."<br><br>[[The 8th Amendment of the U.S.<br>Constitution](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2e1714&url=https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-viii){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="constitutioncenter.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>To be more specific, a punishment is considered "cruel and unusual" if<br>it is "cruel in comparison with longstanding practices of the time." So<br>if locking you naked in a concrete strip cell is demonstrably more harsh<br>than existing punishments for the same offense, then it could reasonably<br>be considered cruel and unusual.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
