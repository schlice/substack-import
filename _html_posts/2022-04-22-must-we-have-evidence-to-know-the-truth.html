<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It depends on what you count as "evidence." Not all evidence is the<br>same. There is *scientific* evidence. There is *philosophical* evidence.<br>There is *historical* evidence. There is *observatory* evidence. There<br>is *testimonial* evidence.<br><br>And all of it has a *degree of likelihood*. In other words, some<br>evidence is more likely to be true than other evidence. For example, are<br>you 100% sure that gravity works on every dropped object? You cannot be<br>100% sure, because you have not seen every dropped object. However, you<br>can be *really* sure that gravity will work on every dropped object.<br>Why? Because it has yet to be documented that gravity has ever *failed*<br>to work on any dropped object. Therefore you can presume, ***with a very<br>high degree of likelihood which approaches, but never equals, 100%,***<br>that gravity works on all dropped objects.<br><br>So some evidence is unreliable, and other evidence is very reliable.<br><br>But in order to know the truth, we must have some evidence. Faith is not<br>believing something despite a lack of evidence. Faith is believing that<br>your evidence is true.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Must we have evidence to know the truth?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
