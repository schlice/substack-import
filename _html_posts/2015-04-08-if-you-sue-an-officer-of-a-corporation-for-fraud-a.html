<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Depends on the type of corporation. There are some<br>differences in personal liability between LLCs and S Corporations (thus<br>the term \"Limited Liability Corporation\").\<br>\<br>First of all, most corporations have liability insurance for their<br>officers that protects them in the event that they are personally sued<br>while acting on behalf of the corporation.\<br>\<br>In most cases, an officer of the corporation can be held personally<br>liable if he or she:]<br><br>- personally and directly injures someone<br>- personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the<br>  corporation defaults<br>- fails to deposit taxes withheld from employees\' wages<br>- intentionally does something fraudulent, illegal, or reckless that<br>  causes harm to the company or to someone else, or<br>- treats the company as an extension of his or her personal affairs,<br>  rather than as a separate legal entity.<br><br>\<br>That last one is important, because if the officer treats the company<br>and his personal affairs the same, a court could find that the company<br>doesn\'t exist separately from his personal affairs and he could be<br>liable for the sum total of any judgments against the corporation.\<br>\<br>\1\<br>[http://www.nolo.com/legal\....(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=28fb2a&url=http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/llc-basics-30163.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nolo.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
