<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Are multiple sclerosis symptoms constant?<br><br>It depends on what "flavor" of MS you have.<br><br>In *relapsing* forms of the disease such as **Relapsing-Remitting MS<br>(RRMS)**, the symptoms worsen during periods of *relapse*, and they last<br>for a period of time (usually from days to weeks) and then they lessen<br>or *remit* for a period of weeks to months.<br><br>In *progressive* forms of the disease such as **Secondary Progressive MS<br>(SPMS)**, the symptoms slowly get worse over time, sometimes with<br>periods of worsening or relapse. SPMS can be further characterized at<br>different points in time as either *active* (with relapses and/or<br>evidence of new MRI activity) or *not active*, as well as with<br>*progression* (evidence of disease worsening on an objective measure of<br>change over time, with or without relapses) or *without progression.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
