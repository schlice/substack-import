<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why did Jesus cry in the Bible?<br><br>Ah yes, the shortest sentence in the Bible:<br><br>"Jesus wept." (John 11:35) Upon seeing Mary and Martha's grieving over<br>Lazarus' death, He was moved to tears Himself.<br><br>However, Jesus came to Bethany in order to raise Lazarus from the dead.<br>He did not heal Lazarus remotely, in the same way He healed the<br>centurion's servant in Matthew 8:13. He delayed coming to Bethany<br>knowing that Lazarus would die before He arrived, so that He could raise<br>him upon His arrival.<br><br>Therefore, if Jesus knew that He was coming to Bethany in order to raise<br>Lazarus from the dead, shouldn't He have been triumphant? Shouldn't He<br>have been hopeful? Shouldn't He have been glad that He was about to<br>showcase the Father's power in all its glory?<br><br>Instead, he saw the sorrow, and he cried. Why?<br><br>One reason is because He took no comfort in the sorrow of others. He<br>knew what He had come to do, but He did not enjoy inflicting emotional<br>trauma on anyone, and it hurt Him to see them all hurting. He was truly<br>compassionate.<br><br>It could also be that He was "flashing forward," seeing the tomb of<br>Lazarus and knowing that His own death was only days away. He knew that<br>raising Lazarus would be the impetus that the Pharisees needed to<br>finally have Him arrested. Being fully human, we know Jesus experienced<br>everything a human does, so it's not inconceivable that Jesus would have<br>been fearful at that very moment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
