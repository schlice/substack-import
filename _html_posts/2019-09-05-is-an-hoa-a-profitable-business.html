<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is an HOA a profitable business?<br><br>No. HOAs do not make any profit at all. In fact, they are 501(c)4<br>non-profit corporations. To that end, they do not make a profit at all.<br>Their balance sheets always come out to zero.<br><br>What *does* make profit is the company which assists HOAs in doing their<br>job. Managing agents work for real estate companies. Those real estate<br>companies *do* make a profit off of HOAs, usually in fees levied against<br>incoming and outgoing homeowners. They charge hundreds of dollars to<br>ensure that a homeowner is "in good standing" in the HOA before they can<br>close on their house. They charge hundreds of dollars for "account setup<br>fees" for incoming homeowners. And most Boards of Directors for HOAs<br>never even notice how much their managing agent is charging for these<br>services.<br><br>Apparently, running a group of managing agents is a *very* profitable<br>business.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
