<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What does it take for the government to revisit a previous supreme<br>court case?**<br><br>1.  Standing. Someone must do something legal but which challenges<br>    court precedent. Taking the current crop of state laws designed to<br>    challenge *Roe v. Wade*, a state can issue a law outlawing abortion<br>    when it decides that the baby is alive. This is technically in<br>    violation of *Roe*, so it will be challenged as unconstitutional<br>    because *Roe* found a constitutional right to an abortion.<br>2.  Certiorari. When appealing to an appeals court, a party has an<br>    inherent right to do so. However, no such right exists to appeal to<br>    the Supreme Court. Instead, the party must file a *writ of<br>    certiorari* to request the high court to hear the case. "Certiorari"<br>    is from Law Latin, and means "to be fully informed." If four<br>    Justices agree to hear the case, then they are said to have "granted<br>    certiorari," or "granted cert" for short. Certiorari is<br>    discretionary; SCOTUS does not have to grant it. If they do not, the<br>    lower court decision stands. But that does not necessarily mean that<br>    SCOTUS agrees with the lower court decision, it simply means that<br>    they could not get four Justices to agree to hear the case.<br>3.  Once the case is heard at the Supreme Court, they must review their<br>    earlier decision. They can either clarify it, modify it, or reverse<br>    it. It's unlikely that SCOTUS would grant cert just to re-affirm the<br>    lower court's decision, but they may do so in order to strengthen a<br>    confusing decision, or to clarify a previous decision.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
