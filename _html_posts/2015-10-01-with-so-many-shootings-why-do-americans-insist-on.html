<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Um, because it\'s not.\<br>\<br>We tried to ban things before in the United States. Surprisingly, people<br>still got those things. For example, drugs are illegal in the United<br>States. No one can possess them. Yet somehow, millions are addicted to<br>drugs and we incarcerate over a million people a year for drugs and<br>drug-related offenses.\<br>\<br>**Those drugs were 100% illegal. And people still managed to get<br>them.**\<br>\<br>We also tried to ban alcohol in the United States in a period of time we<br>call \"Prohibition.\" Yet people still had alcohol. Illegal bars called<br>\"speakeasies\" opened up underground. Moonshiners distilled and<br>trafficked their own grain alcohol (incidentally, the cars they souped<br>up to outrun law enforcement would sometimes participate in races,<br>leading to the creation of NASCAR).\<br>\<br>Alcohol was 100% illegal. And people still managed to get it.\<br>\<br>So what\'s the point here?\<br>\<br>*Making something illegal will not stop people from getting it.*\<br>\<br>If you make guns illegal, you will simultaneously increase the black<br>market for it and enable all crime, both organized and individual. It<br>happened every time we tried to ban something. The black market for it<br>skyrocketed, and all types of crime was increased.\<br>\<br>Also, the gun is a tool. It is the most efficient tool to use with which<br>to kill individuals. Does that mean the gun should be banned? If there<br>is never an authorized, valid reason to kill, then yes, guns should not<br>be allowed, because no one has a valid reason to kill. However, the<br>entire history of the United States, going back to the Common Law<br>traditions on which our system of government was founded, includes<br>\"universal\" rights which are endowed on all people. One of those<br>rights is the right to self-defense, and another is defense against<br>tyranny. I\'d not like to debate whether or not either of these rights<br>exists or whether or not you believe they are valid. The simple fact is<br>that our Constitution was built with them in mind, It\'s why we have a<br>Second Amendment. To wit:\<br>\<br>***The only way to remove guns from the United States is to repeal the<br>Second Amendment.***\<br>\<br>There is no popular support for such a measure. Playing on emotion and<br>trying to use tragic shootings as an impetus for Second Amendment repeal<br>might work in Australia, but there is simply no support for such a<br>measure here in the United States.\<br>\<br>Finally, statistics show that there is no practical benefit to such<br>laws, as reviewing statistics from Australia and the UK, two locations<br>often bandied about in the hunt for ways to impose gun control, reveals<br>that their respective gun bans did not affect the trends in those<br>nations of either homicides, or suicides, with or without guns. Zero<br>effect. The overall trend in homicides was unaffected by the gun ban,<br>and the overall trend in suicides was similarly unaffected by the gun<br>ban.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
