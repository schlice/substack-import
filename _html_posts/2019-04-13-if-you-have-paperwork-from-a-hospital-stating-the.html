<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you have paperwork from a hospital stating the medication they gave<br>you can a probation officer violate you for a positive drug test for the<br>same thing they gave you in the hospital?**<br><br>Generally no. I can't speak for every state everywhere, but generally<br>the law reads "possession of a controlled substance without a<br>prescription." The parole agreement stipulates whether or not it is<br>"possession of any controlled substance" or "possession of a controlled<br>substance without a prescription."<br><br>There may be some probation agreements which stipulate that the parolee<br>may not have any controlled substances, even those prescribed by a<br>doctor. This is especially true when the parolee is an addict. Addicts<br>should know that any controlled substance can trigger their addiction,<br>and should avoid prescription narcotics anyway.<br><br>If in doubt, the parolee should ask his or her PO before they violate.<br>If it does violate parole, this may give the parolee an opportunity to<br>go back to the doctor and request a different (non-controlled)<br>medication.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
