<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm not sure I understand your question.<br><br>Anyone is allowed to have animals for whatever reason they want them.<br><br>If you're asking whether or not emotional support animals can somehow be<br>treated like service animals, the answer is no.<br><br>Service animals are specially trained to perform specific tasks to<br>assist a person with a disability. They are usually dogs, but in some<br>cases can be miniature horses. Service animals have **full public access<br>rights** under the law, which means they can go places other animals<br>can\'t. For example, they can go into restaurants, stores, libraries,<br>and other public places. They can also go on airplanes and other public<br>transportation. Essentially, if the public is allowed in a space, a<br>service animal is allowed in that space.<br><br>Emotional Support Animals (ESAs) provide companionship and emotional<br>support to people who have documented disabilities, but they aren\'t<br>required to perform specific tasks. They are protected under the Fair<br>Housing Act (which means they don't count as "pets" in your apartment or<br>rental property), but hotels aren\'t subject to this act. To legally<br>have an ESA, the owner must be considered to have a qualifying mental<br>health or psychiatric disability by a licensed mental health<br>professional. This is documented by a properly formatted prescription<br>letter. The landlord should be provided with this letter.<br><br>Most importantly, unless your state has special protections for ESAs,<br>they don\'t have the same protections as service animals. This means you<br>can't take them everywhere people can go, and businesses can legally<br>restrict ESAs from their premises. Some businesses allow ESAs, but it is<br>not a legal requirement. It is up to the business whether or not they<br>will allow ESAs, and people who own ESAs must be aware that they cannot<br>legally force businesses to permit ESAs on their premises.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
