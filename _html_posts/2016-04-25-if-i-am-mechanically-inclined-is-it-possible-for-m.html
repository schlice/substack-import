<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I suspect you wouldn\'t be replacing the ductwork in the house, probably<br>just the furnace/AC unit, the blower, the coils, etc.<br><br>As others have already stated, you will most definitely need to pull<br>permits before you begin your work, and you will have to have your<br>installation inspected. Be aware, inspectors are notoriously more<br>stringent with homeowners doing their own work than they are with<br>contractors. Be prepared to be failed on nit-picky items, and be<br>prepared to pay for follow-on inspections.<br><br>However, with perseverance, you can indeed install it yourself.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
