<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I only want to address the Constitutional issue here. Personally, I<br>believe that if you want to *carry* your gun off of your property, you<br>should meet high standards of training. But that's not what the OP<br>asked. The question was<br><br>> *Why aren't citizens who want guns in the US required to have high<br>> standards of training?*<br><br>What other products are you required to receive high standards of<br>training on before you purchase them? You don't need a license to<br>buy a car, you only need a license to drive a car. I know, you<br>presume that if you buy a car, you're going to drive a car, but I have<br>heard of at least one person who never had a license buying a car. He<br>can't *drive* that car, but he can *buy* a car.<br><br>We do have some requirements for buying a gun: you can't be a felon,<br>you can't be an adjudicated mental defective, etc., but those<br>restrictions are the least restrictive possible and serve a compelling<br>state interest. We have far greater restrictions and requirements<br>(including training requirements) if you want to conceal a firearm,<br>but we have yet to enact those same standards in all places for someone<br>who wishes to carry a firearm. It's very disjointed. Some states<br>allow all people who can legally own a gun to carry that gun openly,<br>some states do not. Most states allow concealed carry if training and<br>certification requirements are met, some states do not.<br><br>So I think the problem you are facing is that you misunderstand the<br>question. You don't necessarily need high standards of training to buy a<br>gun, nor should you. Cars are demonstrably more dangerous than guns, and<br>you don't even need a license to buy one. You do need a license to drive<br>one, but not to buy one. Same thing with guns. You don't need a license<br>to buy one, but you may need a license to carry one. Licenses involve<br>training.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
