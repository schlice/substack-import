<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It\'s a slippery-slope argument that holds no water.<br>Incest and LGBTQ lifestyles have absolutely zero in common.\<br>\<br>Now, replace \"incestuous\" with \"polygamous,\" and the argument isn\'t<br>quite as slippery slope as you may think.\<br>\<br>[[Judge finalizes order finding polygamy law unconstitutional; victory<br>for \'Sister Wives\' - Religion News<br>Service](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0441a9&url=http://www.religionnews.com/2014/08/28/judge-finalizes-order-finding-polygamy-law-unconstitutional-victory-sister-wives/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="religionnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>\<br>The logic goes, \"if we open the marriage door to one type of marriage<br>which is not traditionally part of marriage, that door is open, and<br>other types of marriage which were also not part of traditional marriage<br>can also be considered.\"\<br>\<br>An interesting thought piece in the *Daily Beast* (yes, their articles<br>are often thought-provoking, and before you start asking why a<br>conservative libertarian is reading the *Daily Beast*, there\'s a lot<br>that I read that doesn\'t jibe with what I believe, because I<br>purposefully challenge my beliefs daily. If my beliefs don\'t win, I<br>don\'t deserve to believe them) posited this thought:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> \W\hile it's mildly understandable that some see these conversations<br>> as conceptually linked---"If we're changing the marriage laws to<br>> include gay couples, how else might we change them?"---polygamy<br>> doesn't inherently flow from gay marriage. If anything, what polygamy<br>> does flow from is a general opening up of options.\<br>> \<br>> We increasingly allow Americans to define their own families for<br>> themselves while removing coercive public policy and judgmental social<br>> norms. And this idea, which is at the heart of everything from<br>> increasing access to birth control to the striking down<br>> anti-miscegenation laws to so much more, is exactly what conservative<br>> religious extremists have always opposed.\<br>> \<br>> There are interesting arguments to be made for legalizing polygamy,<br>> from protecting children from secretive non-consensual<br>> multiple-marriage situations to how being "feminist" actually means<br>> not protecting women from these marriages but letting them choose for<br>> themselves. \1\\<br><br>\<br>\1\ [[Is Polygamy the Next Gay<br>Marriage?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e9bebb&url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/12/is-polygamy-the-next-gay-marriage.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="thedailybeast.com"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>\<br>This link, that gay marriage equals a general opening up of options, is<br>where the current polygamist thoughts towards legalization are headed.\<br>\<br>It\'s also not too much of a stretch to assume that by legalizing gay<br>marriage, we are de-coupling the law from its association with \"people<br>who can make babies\" and associating it (more rightly) to \"people who<br>can raise babies.\" The government only licenses marriages because it<br>has a compelling interest in children, and seeing them raised in the<br>best possible environment. Since there are many familial configurations<br>that will accomplish that goal, tying benefits to only one of those<br>configurations is unnecessary and doesn\'t follow the 14th Amendment.<br>Polygamous relationships also meet the standard of \"people who can<br>raise babies\" and should be treated no differently under the law than<br>gay couples. You can start by removing the restriction that says that<br>one man can only be married to one woman at a time, and vice-versa.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
