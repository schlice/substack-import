<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The "Biden Rule" basically is a quote of then-Senator Joe Biden who, in<br>a speech in 1992, stated that if there were to be a Supreme Court seat<br>that became vacant over that summer, then-President Bush should wait<br>until the election to appoint a replacement, or appoint a moderate who<br>would be acceptable to the then-Democratic Congress.<br><br>Since there is currently a hotly contested debate as to whether or not<br>the Constitution requires the Senate to hold hearings on the President's<br>nominee to the Supreme Court "in a timely manner," if there was a desire<br>to codify the "Biden Rule," it would likely need to be an Amendment to<br>the Constitution, clarifying Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 (known as<br>the Appointments Clause):<br><br>> *He \the President\ shall have the Power, by and with the Advice and<br>> Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two-thirds of the<br>> Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the<br>> Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other<br>> public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all<br>> other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein<br>> otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the<br>> Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers as<br>> they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in<br>> the Heads of Departments.*<br><br>The phrase that everyone is confused about is "by and with the Advice<br>and Consent of the Senate". In practice, the expedient nomination of<br>Supreme Court justices has been inconsistent at best. There is nothing<br>written in the Constitution which describes just how fast an appointment<br>must be heard. And what constitutes "advice and consent?" If the Senate<br>tells the President that the next President should make the appointment,<br>does that fulfill the Senate's responsibilities for providing advice?<br><br>The short answer is that we don't know, and there has been no clear and<br>consistent "precedent." Some legal scholars simply cite the numbers (24<br>instances where presidents in their last year of a term have made SCOTUS<br>appointments, and the Senate has confirmed 21 of them), as well as the<br>fact that delaying an appointment while cases are pending could create a<br>"constitutional crisis." Scholars with the opposing view cite the text<br>of the Constitution, arguing that there is no historical or written<br>basis to support the claim that the Senate has a Constitutional<br>obligation to promptly vote on every Presidential nominee presented to<br>them. They also point to the 2016 election, and the importance of the<br>appointment of a Supreme Court justice in the minds of the voters,<br>knowing that the next nominee could swing the political makeup of the<br>Court, and affect rulings for decades. The appointment of the next<br>Justice was almost as important as job creation and retention in the<br>minds of voters, meaning it was (to them) the right decision to leave<br>the appointment to the next President.<br><br>**TL;DR: We probably will not be able to overcome this particular issue<br>without a Constitutional Amendment clarifying the Appointments Clause.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
