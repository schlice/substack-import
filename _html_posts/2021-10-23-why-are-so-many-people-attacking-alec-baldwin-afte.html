<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is no doubt that the armorer screwed up. None. And I have no doubt<br>that the armorer, while not criminally liable, will face a civil suit<br>from the estate of the deceased, and of course will never work in<br>Hollywood ever again (or anywhere else where gun safety is involved).<br><br>That said, there are basic rules of gun safety that *even actors* can<br>follow. *Even while they are acting*, they can literally still follow<br>the basic gun safety rules. It doesn't take any more effort to follow<br>the rules and still act or do literally anything else in your life.<br>People who carry weapons all the time know this.<br><br>And if Mr. Baldwin had bothered to take *JUST ONE* NRA gun safety<br>course, a few hours out of one of his days, then a decorated<br>cinematographer would be alive today.<br><br>They call these the BIG 4 because they are important. So important that<br>you can learn them one time, use them for life, and accidents like this<br>would never happen.<br><br>1.  Treat every single gun as if it was loaded. Every. Single. One. This<br>    includes prop guns.<br>2.  Keep your finger off of the trigger until you are ready to fire.<br>3.  Never point a gun at anything or anyone you are not willing to<br>    destroy or kill.<br>4.  Understand your target and what is behind your target.<br><br>While Mr. Baldwin will escape criminal liability for this tragic<br>accident, he should rightly be sued by the victim's family for wrongful<br>death, along with the armorer, because he failed to take basic care with<br>a firearm. "I didn't know the gun was loaded" has never been an excuse,<br>ever. It doesn't matter if you say it like that, or say it like "This<br>gun was supposed to be a prop gun, cleared by our professional armorer,<br>and was not supposed to contain a live round," it still means "I didn't<br>know the gun was loaded."<br><br>------------------------------<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why are so many people attacking Alec Baldwin after the set accident?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
