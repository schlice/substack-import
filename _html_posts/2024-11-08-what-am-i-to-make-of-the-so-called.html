<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Look, I get the tenor of this question. But there's a nugget of<br>something absolutely useful we can take from this demonstration of<br>unhinged emotion.<br><br>**The liberals have been lied to for so long, and in such a visible way,<br>that there will be many mental health issues following this election.<br>The tears from grown men are just the start.**<br><br>They simply can't rationalize what they've been told about Trump and<br>Republicans for so many years with what happened in the election. I<br>mean, *we've* been telling them, but they could effectively tune us out<br>because they've been told that they are the intellectual elites and we<br>are nothing more than sentient pond scum. They've been told that they<br>are right because they are smarter than us, and they have been handed a<br>drubbing which they cannot rationalize. It is this internal mental<br>struggle which is causing these emotional reactions.<br><br>It will lead to mental breakdowns nationwide. It will probably lead to<br>protests, some violent. It will probably lead to workplace violence. And<br>it will probably lead some to self-harm.<br><br>\<br><br>*So what do we do?*<br><br>We get RFK in as fast as we can, and we make mental health resources<br>available to these people before they hurt themselves. We need to help<br>them to process this correctly, and to get them out of this state which<br>I place squarely at the feet of Democrats and their mouthpieces in the<br>legacy media.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
