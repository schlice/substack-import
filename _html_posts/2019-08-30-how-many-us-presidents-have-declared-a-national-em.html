<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How many US presidents have declared a national emergency?<br><br>Eleven.<br><br>The list is fairly extensive, and appears to have been fully cataloged<br>over on<br>[Wikipedia(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=154bd0&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_emergencies_in_the_United_States){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>> The first President to issue an emergency proclamation was Woodrow<br>> Wilson, who on February 5, 1917, issued the following:<br>><br>> *"I have found that there exists a national emergency arising from the<br>> insufficiency of maritime tonnage to carry the products of the farms,<br>> forests, mines and manufacturing industries of the United States, to<br>> their consumers abroad and within the United States"*<br>><br>> This proclamation was within the limits of the act that established<br>> the United States Shipping Board.<br>><br>> Starting with Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, presidents asserted the<br>> power to declare emergencies without limiting their scope or duration,<br>> without citing the relevant statutes, and without congressional<br>> oversight. The Supreme Court in [[*Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v.<br>> Sawyer*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8299b5&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youngstown_Sheet_%2526_Tube_Co._v._Sawyer){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} limited what a<br>> president could do in such an emergency, but did not limit the<br>> emergency declaration power itself. A 1973 Senate investigation found<br>> (in Senate Report 93-549) that four declared emergencies remained in<br>> effect: the 1933 banking crisis with respect to the hoarding of gold,<br>> a 1950 emergency with respect to the Korean War, a 1970 emergency<br>> regarding a postal workers strike, and a 1971 emergency in response to<br>> inflation. Many provisions of statutory law are contingent on a<br>> declaration of national emergency, as many as 500 by one count. It was<br>> due in part to concern that a declaration of \"emergency\" for one<br>> purpose should not invoke every possible executive emergency power,<br>> that Congress in 1976 passed the [[National Emergencies<br>> Act](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eaf2df&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Emergencies_Act){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br>><br>> Presidents have continued to use their emergency authority subject to<br>> the provisions of the act, with 42 national emergencies declared<br>> between 1976 and 2007. \[1\](#YAhnE){#cite-YAhnE .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-YAhnE){.citation_index} [[National Emergencies Act -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eaf2df&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Emergencies_Act){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
