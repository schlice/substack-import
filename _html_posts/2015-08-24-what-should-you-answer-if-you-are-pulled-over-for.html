<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Current training de-emphasizes the use of such a phrase.<br>What is recommended now would be something similar to this:\<br>\<br>\"Good afternoon, my name is X from Y Police Department. I stopped you<br>today because you were going 54 miles per hour in a posted 35 mile per<br>hour zone. Is anything wrong? Is there any reason you\'re going this<br>fast?\"\<br>\<br>The infraction is what it is. It\'s a matter of what the radar says.<br>Asking the person whether or not they know if they were speeding makes<br>them admit that they\'re a poor driver and they weren\'t paying<br>attention to their speed. It provides nothing beneficial to the<br>conversation.\<br>\<br>It\'s more productive to ask someone if there is a *reason* why they<br>were going so fast. Is it because there is a medical emergency? Is it<br>because they\'re late to a meeting? Is it because they simply weren\'t<br>paying attention? It may not make any difference whatsoever, but it just<br>might.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
