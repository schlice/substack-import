<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It is actually sceintifically proven, but it\'s not<br>exactly what you think. It is a medical phenomenon called<br>[tetrachromacy.(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60137e&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachromacy){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>\<br>And it\'s not that they see *different* colors than anyone else. They<br>simply see wavelengths beyond those of a typical human being (into the<br>infrared and ultraviolet), and they are able to distinguish differences<br>and variations in colors that to everyone else appear identical. So in<br>essence, they see *more* colors than we do.\<br>\<br>The only confirmed tetrachromat alive is [[Concetta<br>Antico](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=52ab7d&url=http://Concetta+Antico){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="http://Concetta Antico"}]{.qlink_container}. And the best<br>part: she\'s an artist and she paints what she sees, so we can view the<br>world as she does. It\'s quite amazing.\<br>\<br>[[Akshay Rs\'s answer to Who is the luckiest person on<br>Earth?](https://www.quora.com/Who-is-the-luckiest-person-on-Earth-2/answer/Akshay-Rs)]{.qlink_container}]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
