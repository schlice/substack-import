<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>MS fatigue, also known as MS Lassitude, is one of the most common<br>symptoms of MS. It's estimated that 80% of MS patients have experienced<br>MS fatigue at one time or another.<br><br>Fatigue in people with MS can have many different causes. For example,<br>if your MS includes bladder dysfunction and you have to get up in the<br>middle of the night to use the bathroom, the lack of sleep can be a<br>cause of fatigue. Depression can cause fatigue. Certain medications can<br>induce fatigue as a side effect. Finally, there are other diseases such<br>as thyroid issues and anemia which can also lead to fatigue.<br><br>People who have MS and get stressed by heat also experience fatigue.<br>Over-exposure to heat, or over-exertion, can also bring on MS fatigue.<br><br>Because there are so many issues which could potentially be causing your<br>fatigue, **if your fatigue is interfering with your life, you should<br>first seek the advice of your doctor.** He should review your<br>medications with you, see if anything needs to be modified, and if all<br>other avenues are exhausted, perhaps prescribe a medication which has<br>demonstrated some benefit to some people with MS fatigue.<br><br>The National MS Society recommends the following interventions for<br>someone who experiences fatigue:<br><br>> - Occupational therapy to simplify tasks at work and home.<br>> - Physical therapy to learn energy-saving ways of walking (with or<br>>   without assistive devices) and performing other daily tasks, and to<br>>   develop a regular exercise program.<br>> - Sleep regulation, which might involve treating other MS symptoms<br>>   that interfere with sleep (e.g., spasticity, urinary problems) and<br>>   using sleep medications on a short-term basis.<br>> - Psychological interventions, such as stress management, relaxation<br>>   training, membership in a support group, or psychotherapy.<br>> - Heat management --- strategies to avoid overheating and to cool<br>>   down.<br>> - Medications --- [[amantadine hydrochloride<br>>   (Symmetrel®)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e69066&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Medications/Amantadine){.external_link<br>>   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>   onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>   qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} and<br>>   [[modafinil<br>>   (Provigil®)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e437cd&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Medications/Provigil){.external_link<br>>   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>   onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>   qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} --- are the<br>>   most commonly prescribed. While neither is approved specifically by<br>>   the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of<br>>   MS-related fatigue, each has demonstrated some benefit in clinical<br>>   trials. The most recent trial of modafinil, however, reported no<br>>   difference between modafinil and placebo in relieving<br>>   fatigue.\[1\](#fgcCO){#cite-fgcCO .citation_link}<br><br>So my advice? First see your doctor, then think about some of these<br>other interventions to assist with regaining some energy. Will you ever<br>have enough energy to run again? It's hard to say. Fatigue, like MS, is<br>different for everyone who experiences it. It's important to continue<br>some exercise regimen while you can, so keep moving, even if it's just<br>walking and not running.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-fgcCO){.citation_index}<br>[Fatigue(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a99fbb&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms/Fatigue%23section-2){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
