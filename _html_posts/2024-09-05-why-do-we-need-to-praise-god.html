<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You don't *need* to praise God. God certainly doesn't *need* praise. God<br>is omnipotent. God already *has everything.* God needs nothing.<br><br>But God *deserves* praise.<br><br>The God of the Universe, who is so powerful that He literally created<br>the entire Universe and everything in it with nothing but the breath of<br>His words, knows you personally and cares enough about you that **even<br>if you were the only person who needed to be saved,** He would still<br>have willingly gone to the cross and died for you.<br><br>That's how much He cares for you.<br><br>And that's why He deserves praise.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
