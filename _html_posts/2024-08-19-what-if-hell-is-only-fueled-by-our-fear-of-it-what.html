What if Deadpool was actually real?<br>What if my dog actually understands what I'm saying?<br><br>Our imaginations can be pretty vivid sometimes. But we shouldn't allow<br>our imaginations to drive what we know as truth.<br><br>We should rely on the Bible for our truth, as Christians.<br><br>In truth, Hell is locked from the inside. The people who will be in<br>hell, placed themselves there. They chose to ignore God's gift. They<br>willingly gave up that gift because they wanted to be in control of<br>their own life choices. They could have chosen to obey God, but they<br>chose not to. They are in hell because they choose to continue to ignore<br>God. That's why we say the door to hell is locked from the inside. The<br>people in hell put themselves there willingly.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
