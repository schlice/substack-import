<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Maybe I don't understand what "the whole bureaucratic goose chase" is,<br>but if your passport was 10 years old, it's expired by now. Adult<br>passports are only valid for 10 years; youth passports are only valid<br>for 5 years.<br><br>The best you can do is apply for another one. At best, you could have<br>used your old, expired passport as proof of citizenship and proof of<br>identity but now you'll have to do that process all over again, and<br>provide that documentation again.<br><br>You can tell them that you previously had a passport but you lost it.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I lost my 10-year-old passport and forgot the number. I keep getting the<br>whole bureaucratic goose chase trying to replace it. What should I do?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
