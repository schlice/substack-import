<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Probably not. This gets a little dicier if you live in a condo, but in a<br>single-family home HOA, it's unlikely the HOA would succeed in this<br>action. The only exception would be if there are state or local laws<br>which restrict security camera use.<br><br>In the absence of any state laws which may restrict camera usage, you<br>have a right to use security cameras to secure your property, *even if*<br>it incidentally captures neighboring properties. So long as you have a<br>valid use for your cameras (and securing your own property is a valid<br>use) and the cameras are *generally* pointed at your property (not<br>directly at your neighbor's property), it is a legal use of your<br>cameras.<br><br>The HOA would only have a case if their Governing Documents gave them<br>authority to regulate camera usage, OR if your cameras were *so<br>obtrusive* as to become an aesthetic/landscaping issue.<br><br>But if you're using standard consumer grade security cameras mounted on<br>your home pointing at your property, it's unlikely the HOA would succeed<br>in a legal challenge to get them removed.<br><br>I still suggest you reach out to a lawyer in your area who specializes<br>in HOA law to be certain before you openly defy the HOA.
