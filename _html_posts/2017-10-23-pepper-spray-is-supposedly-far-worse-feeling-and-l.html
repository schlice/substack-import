<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Nothing is fool-proof to the talented fool.<br><br>That said, you can go either way. Pepper spray is almost universally<br>effective and will allow you the time needed to escape. So in terms of<br>statistical percentages, you'll have a better chance getting away with<br>pepper spray. Yes, there is a small number of people who seem to be<br>immune to the effects of pepper spray, but weighing your odds, it's<br>statistically unlikely you'd find one of those people to be your<br>attacker.<br><br>You can also do this with a Taser, despite the fact that the effects<br>subside virtually instantly once the unit is switched off. To achieve<br>this, one mode of operation on the civilian Taser (the Bolt and Pulse<br>have this feature) involves deploying the barbs, incapacitating the<br>subject, and turning on "multi-cycle mode" which deploys the charge,<br>deactivates for a few seconds, and deploys the charge again. It<br>continues this cycle until it is stopped or the battery is depleted. The<br>idea is that if you deploy the Taser in this way, you put the unit down,<br>letting the multi-cycle mode continue, and get away. Axon (the company<br>that produces the Taser) will replace a Taser deployed in this manner<br>for free if you give them a copy of the police report showing that it<br>was used like this. Both the Bolt and the Pulse use the new "shaped<br>charge" technology which is more effective through clothing, so it's<br>more likely to do what you want it to do. However, the Taser has a<br>higher likelihood of failure. The distance on the civilian Tasers is<br>limited to 15 feet, and if you miss, it's completely ineffective.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
