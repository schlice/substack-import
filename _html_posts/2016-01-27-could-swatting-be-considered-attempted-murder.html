<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [An attempted crime requires the *mens rea,* or the<br>criminal mind, meaning you have to have some sort of plan to commit a<br>crime. But you then need to take a *substantial step* towards the *actus<br>reus* (or the.criminal act) of that crime. You need to drive to the<br>location of the crime at the time you planned, or something like that.<br>SWATting is not a substantial step towards you committing a murder. Even<br>SWATting someone hoping the police will kill them doesn\'t rise to the<br>level of attempted murder.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
