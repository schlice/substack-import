<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>MS is a diagnosis of exclusion. In order to diagnose it, you have to<br>test for (and thereby exclude) every other medical cause for the signs<br>(bright spots on an MRI) and symptoms (dizziness, vertigo, etc)<br>experienced. There are many different tests that contribute to the body<br>of evidence in a diagnosis. Once you have excluded every other potential<br>cause for the signs and symptoms, you can consider MS. For example,<br>white spots on an MRI can be caused by many different things. From<br>injury to migraines, white spots on an MRI appear for different reasons.<br>And bright spots on the spine can indeed be caused by fat deposits.<br><br>In other words, MS is considered when everything else which could cause<br>the signs and symptoms has been tested for and ruled out.<br><br>Nevertheless, I would still consider seeing a neurologist. There are few<br>other doctors who are in as good a position to help you diagnose exactly<br>what is happening with your brother.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
