<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is the US Constitution so seldom used as a model by other<br>nations?**<br><br>Because *a Constitution cannot create democracy.*<br><br>Democracy must first exist among the people, and the people have to be<br>prepared to be the final arbiter of governmental overreach. In other<br>words, a government which is subservient to the will of the people must<br>both exist and be able to be checked by the will of the people.<br><br>In far too many cases, a constitution is drafted following US<br>constitutional ideals, but the requisite will of the people to keep the<br>government in check is simply not there to the degree necessary to<br>actually do so. According to research by the [[The University of Chicago<br>Law<br>School](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5bee7c&url=https://www.law.uchicago.edu/news/lifespan-written-constitutions){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="uchicago.edu"}]{.qlink_container}, the average age of a<br>constitution in the wild is only 17 years.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
