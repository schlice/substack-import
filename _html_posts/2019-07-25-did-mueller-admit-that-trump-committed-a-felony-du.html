<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Did Mueller admit that Trump committed a felony during the recent<br>hearing?**<br><br>Initially it seemed that way, but Mueller corrected that statement that<br>made it seem like he did.<br><br>There were two hearings; one before the House Judiciary Committee, and<br>one before the House Intelligence Committee. In his first set of<br>testimony to the Judiciary Committee, the following exchange took place:<br><br>> LIEU: And I'd like to ask you the reason, again, that you did not<br>> indict Donald Trump is because of OLC opinion stating that you cannot<br>> indict a sitting president, correct?<br>><br>> MUELLER: That is correct.<br><br>Later that same day, Mueller testified again to the Intelligence<br>Committee, and in his opening remarks, he said the following:<br><br>> MUELLER: Now before we go to questions, I want to add one correction<br>> to my testimony this morning. I want to go back to one thing that was<br>> said this morning by Mr. Lieu who said, and I quote, \"You didn\'t<br>> charge the President because of the OLC opinion." That is not the<br>> correct way to say it. As we say in the report, and as I said at the<br>> opening, we did not reach a determination as to whether the President<br>> committed a crime.<br><br>**Therefore, the reason that Mueller did not charge Trump with a crime<br>is because he did not reach a determination whether or not Trump<br>committed a crime.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
