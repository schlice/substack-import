<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ultimately, what everyone has been hinting around but hasn\'t really<br>articulated is a *layered defense* strategy to your home.<br><br>There was an old story that is appropriate here. Two hunters in Africa<br>came upon a very hungry lion about a mile away that started to stalk<br>them. Upon determining that they were being threatened, the first hunter<br>stopped, took off his backpack, reached inside, and grabbed a pair of<br>running shoes.<br><br>The second hunter said, \"Why are you bothering to put running shoes on?<br>You can\'t outrun a lion!\"<br><br>The first hunter replied, \"I don\'t need to outrun a lion. I only need<br>to outrun *you.*\"<br><br>While tongue-in-cheek, the reality is still there. Ideally, you don\'t<br>have to make your home a fortress. You only have to make it *less<br>attractive* to a burglar than your neighbor\'s home.<br><br>Using the layered defense approach, start from the curb and move in.<br><br>- From the curb: Everyone\'s suggestions here are appropriate: clear out<br>  vegetation that conceals the front of your home from the street (plus<br>  it increases home value by increasing curb appeal). Clear out<br>  shrubbery that conceal someone\'s actions in and around your windows,<br>  or perhaps plant thorny shrubs underneath your windows. Add security<br>  lights, motion-sensing floodlights, or put your exterior lights on<br>  timers or light sensors so they come on at night and go off in the<br>  morning.<br>- Around the exterior: Reinforcing doors and windows can be done<br>  inexpensively. In older wood-frame windows, adding screws in the<br>  fixed-pane or in the track so that windows cannot advance beyond a<br>  certain point and reinforcing main front door hinges with 3\" or<br>  longer security screws that go all the way into the doorframe are<br>  sensible and inexpensive fixes which will increase security.<br>- Interior: Install a dog. I can\'t stress enough how important this is.<br>  Even if you don\'t get an actual dog, there are bark simulator units<br>  which are inexpensive which will go off at the slightest sound and<br>  will bark for several minutes in a random pattern that will fool<br>  almost anyone except the person paying very close attention to the<br>  barks. I had a big dog with a big bark but she was the friendliest dog<br>  you\'d ever meet. If the burglar actually made it in, she would have<br>  most assuredly warmly greeted them and licked them to death. **But you<br>  wouldn\'t know it from her bark**. Remember the expression, \"his bark<br>  is worse than his bite?\" That was my dog. A burglar will not take the<br>  chance that this isn\'t a cute cuddly Labrador and is actually a Pit<br>  Bull; he will move on to a less chancy target.<br>- Interior: (optional) Install an alarm system. Many modern alarm<br>  systems require very easy do-it-yourself installation (no wires) and<br>  have very low monitoring fees. You can buy them online and they are<br>  not ridiculously expensive. Alternatively, systems from bigger<br>  companies offer more advanced features, like video surveillance and<br>  remote system operation and control over the Internet.<br>- Deep Interior: Set up a panic room. Replace one closet door with a<br>  solid-core door, steel-reinforced hinges that swing inward, a peep<br>  hole, and a deadbolt. Inside, keep water and a previously-deactivated<br>  cell phone and charge cable (nearly all cell phones that do not have<br>  an active service contract will still dial 911). That\'s where you<br>  keep your baseball bat and (if you choose) a defensive weapon. If<br>  someone manages to get inside, get into the panic room and lock the<br>  door. Call 911 and continually announce to the intruders, \"I\'m on<br>  the phone with the police and I have a gun, do not come in here or I<br>  will shoot you\" whether you have a gun or not.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
