<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If Trump is removed from office, can the American people sue to make<br>him pay back the money he\'s spent on his golf outings?**<br><br>You can sue anyone for anything, and once Trump leaves office (either<br>through the natural end of his term or by being removed from office), he<br>is an ordinary ex-President citizen and is subject to lawsuits and<br>indictments and everything else that ordinary ex-President citizens are.<br><br>So you can indeed sue him to try to make him pay back the money he's<br>spent on vacations, but the question would be how likely you would be to<br>prevail.<br><br>The problem here is thinking that the President is getting something for<br>nothing. Like somehow "all his golf outings" are some massive benefit<br>that is so much more amazing than his actual job (you know, being the<br>leader of the free world and all).<br><br>Any time a President goes on vacation anywhere (whether it's Trump<br>playing golf or the Obamas vacationing in Hawai'i), they require Secret<br>Service protection. They also require all of the things that the<br>President needs to effectively run the country from wherever he is<br>(secure transportation, medical teams, communication, mobile office,<br>etc). This is what costs the money, not the golf outing. Heck, Trump<br>probably gets his tee time for free. It's not like it is some boondoggle<br>that the country is "forced" to pay for. Every president has taken<br>vacations, and every time they have done so, the taxpayers have paid for<br>his advance teams and his travel teams to go with him. Every. Single.<br>Time. Trump is no different. There is never an expectation that any<br>President would not take vacations.<br><br>So you could try to make him pay for his golf outings, but you'll never<br>be able to recoup the money that the government spent to protect him and<br>ensure his safety and the continuity of operations of the government.<br>He'd probably *willingly* pay back any greens fees in such a lawsuit (if<br>there were any), but the bulk of the cost is not in the actual golf<br>outing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
