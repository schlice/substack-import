<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I read Tim Cook\'s entire open letter. I didn\'t see anything at all in<br>there to suggest that Apple can\'t do what the government is asking.<br>They would have completely avoided all of this nonsense had they just<br>said it can\'t be done. They certainly did not tell the judge this,<br>which is much more telling than anything else. They stated that they<br>don\'t want to follow the order for any number of ideological reasons.<br>This means that it is technically feasible to do what is being asked:<br>loading a firmware onto a locked iPhone, or the ability to download the<br>entire flash image onto a VM. These are security flaws. Period. If the<br>ability to do this exists, it is a flaw in security of the 5C. The<br>government is not asking Apple to permanently cripple iOS, so this whole<br>talk of \"backdoors\" is disingenuous.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Should-Apple-be-forced-to-unlock-the-San-Bernardino-shooters-phone-at-the-FBIs-behest/answer/A-Eldritch-Peacock<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
