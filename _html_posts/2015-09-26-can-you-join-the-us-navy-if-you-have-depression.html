<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The answers given here are very good. Along with those<br>answers, I would suggest, as a general rule, don\'t hide things from<br>your recruiter that you think might hurt your chances to get in to the<br>military. This is more common than you may think.\<br>\<br>Look, nobody\'s perfect. Everyone has something that they have to deal<br>with. It\'s the perfect ones that I\'d have to take a second look at, to<br>be honest. Your recruiter is a *recruiter* not a *non-recruiter*. He<br>actually wants you to join the military, conditions and all. Most<br>conditions are *waiverable* depending on the severity and whether or not<br>you have successfully treated the condition.\<br>\<br>Bottom line: tell your recruiter. Let them help you. If it\'s a<br>waiverable condition, let them help you collect the evidence you need to<br>get the waiver.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
