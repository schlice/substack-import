<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>That's also because you don't have a clear, defined point to make, and<br>your point isn't backed up by any demonstrable facts. You also refuse to<br>partake in any reasoned debate about what "reasonable" and "sensible"<br>mean in relation to gun control, beyond "just ban them all" and why that<br>won't work.<br><br>Let me throw out two other phrases related to "just ban them all:"<br>Prohibition and The War On Drugs. Trying to ban alcohol and trying to<br>ban drugs did two things:<br><br>1.  Created massive black markets<br>2.  Increased total criminal activity, not just organized crime.<br><br>Now for the 64 Thousand Dollar Question (I just dated myself, didn't I):<br>If these two initiatives were such colossal failures, what leads you to<br>believe that banning guns won't do *exactly the same thing?*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Would-anti-NRA-gun-owners-be-interested-in-a-gun-lobby-that-supports-reasonable-restrictions-on-firearms-and-only-opposes-unreasonable-restrictions/answer/Chris-Everett<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
