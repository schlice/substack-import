<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No. Mental health should be the only focus.<br><br>Guns aren't the problem. We've had a Second Amendment for 231 years, and<br>we've only had school shootings similar to this one for the past 30 or<br>so. It wasn't all that long ago when kids used to *bring guns to school*<br>so that they could attend Rifle Club, and still no one was shot. High<br>school aged kids would go hunting in the morning and drive straight to<br>school, with their hunting rifles still in their trucks, prominently<br>displayed in gun racks. And still, no one was shot. The gun is not the<br>problem. We don't need more laws on guns. There is no law that you can<br>think of which would have prevented any one of these school shootings.<br><br>What we need is **serious investment in this nation's mental health care<br>system.** Ever since<br>[deinstitutionalization(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d38b6c&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinstitutionalization_in_the_United_States){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, we have had a decreased<br>emphasis on mental health. We've been told that mental health can be<br>handled in neighborhood clinics, not hospitals. We've been told that the<br>people who need inpatient care are *seriously sick*, and a judge would<br>easily rule that they are "mentally deficient." We don't really need a<br>process to involuntarily commit people we think are sick, so we're going<br>to incredibly overburden that system such that we don't accidentally (or<br>maliciously) involuntarily commit someone who is not crazy. We don't<br>need MDs who treat the mentally ill. MDs just write the prescriptions.<br>We have *therapists* and *counselors* and *social workers* who do the<br>treatment, but can't prescribe medications. Thus, we have a big<br>disconnect between the people who provide the treatments, and the<br>doctors who prescribe the medications (in actuality, patients have the<br>best chance of recovery when utilizing *both*).<br><br>The unintended consequence of that decision is that we have people who<br>are indeed mentally ill, but not so ill that they have ever crossed<br>paths with law enforcement, so a judge has never had the opportunity to<br>even determine whether or not they are mentally defective. These people<br>are also not so visibly ill as to never cause someone to take them to an<br>emergency room for a psychiatric evaluation (no, that would simply be<br>too intrusive). The people who care for them believe what the government<br>tells them, that mental health can be treated locally, with nothing more<br>than a few pills. You don't need emergency rooms and mental hospitals<br>for that. And in the last 30 years or so, the ages of those who have<br>serious, debilitating mental health conditions are getting younger, and<br>younger.<br><br>To say it a different way: deinstitutionalization has de-emphasized the<br>importance of mental health in the United States.<br><br>\<br><br>Now, combine the mental health *crisis* we are facing with the erosion<br>of the family and societal values. Families have *abrogated* their<br>responsibility to be the primary teacher of values, and the only<br>organization remaining which has a vested interest in teaching things to<br>children is the public school system. However, as all public<br>institutions are, they are susceptible to the *loudest* political<br>voices, and so they have become overrun with *woke ideology.* That<br>ideology has informed them what values they should be teaching to<br>children.<br><br>Peggy Noonan<br>[wrote(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=befd93&url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-parkland-massacre-and-the-air-we-breathe-1518739880){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wsj.com"}]{.qlink_container} the following after the<br>Parkland shooting, and she's just echoing a sentiment we all know but<br>are too afraid to say. \"The family blew up \-- divorce, unwed<br>childbearing. Fatherless sons. Fatherless daughters, too. Poor children<br>with no one to love them. The internet flourished. Porn proliferated.<br>Drugs, legal and illegal. Violent videogames, in which nameless people<br>are eliminated and spattered all over the screen\... The abortion regime<br>settled in, with its fierce, endless yet somehow casual talk about the<br>right to end a life\... So much change, so much of it un-gentle.<br>Throughout, was anyone looking to children and what they need?\"<br><br>> Are there other things that can be done so this doesn't happen again?<br><br>Besides fixing mental health and re-emphasizing the family? If we do<br>those two things, this problem will vanish. But those are *hard*, and<br>they took decades to erode. We won't fix them overnight.<br><br>So what do we do in the meantime? We make the hard choices to protect<br>our kids.<br><br>- Increase armed security at schools.<br>- Tighten policies on locked doors in schools. One entrance should be<br>  open, and that entrance should be monitored by armed school security.<br>- Enhance security with technology. AI-powered scanners [[are a real<br>  thing](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ea7592&url=https://blogmickey.com/2020/07/massive-changes-coming-to-disney-world-theme-park-bag-check-experience/){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="blogmickey.com"}]{.qlink_container} and they really work;<br>  why is it only theme parks and entertainment venues which are using<br>  them? Why haven't schools prioritized the funding to implement these?<br>- Eliminate "Free-Fire Zones," also known as "Gun-Free Zones." Shooters<br>  specifically choose these locations because they know they will face<br>  minimal resistance when they go there. It's why you've never seen a<br>  mass shooter choose a police station or a gun range. They go where<br>  they can maximize the number of lives they take before they go down in<br>  a "blaze of glory." They may have radically broken values, but they're<br>  not dumb. Concealed carriers are not your enemy. In fact, they are<br>  safer than the police.<br>- Allow teachers who are licensed and permitted to conceal firearms<br>  while at work. Those teachers are the ones who are willing to put<br>  their physical bodies in the way to save kids, but they only end up<br>  dead first. Give them the tools they already know how to use to<br>  protect our kids. But parents are *so worried* that some teacher is<br>  just going to snap and shoot a kid. Seriously? So you'll eliminate the<br>  one area where we can really make a difference because you're worried<br>  about crazy teachers killing kids? What about crazy teenagers who are<br>  killing kids *today*? ***Face the threat you have, not the threat you<br>  theorize.***<br>- Fix our broken and disjointed carry laws around the country. Move all<br>  states to "Shall Issue." And in a controversial position, I'd vote to<br>  eliminate "Constitutional Carry." I want everyone carrying a firearm<br>  to have been vetted by the state equivalent of the FBI. And start<br>  pouring some federal dollars into *that* program so that the<br>  investigations can be funded by the state. That's what "shall issue"<br>  should look like. Fill out application, give permission for background<br>  check, background check complete, license issued. All can be done<br>  online.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
