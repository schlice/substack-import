<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The word "scleroses" means "scars."<br><br>The "scars" occur on nerve cells in the central nervous system (CNS).<br><br>When the MS disease process occurs, the immune system mistakes the<br>myelin, which is the sheathing that coats nerve cells, for a foreign<br>invader, and attacks it. In the place of the myelin, a scar forms. The<br>scar is made of mostly cholesterol, but importantly, the scar is not as<br>good at insulating nerve signals as myelin. Nerve signals which traverse<br>the damaged areas are attenuated. The reduced signal through the damaged<br>nerves produces the various symptoms seen in MS.<br><br>Therefore the name: "multiple sclerosis" means "many scars."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
