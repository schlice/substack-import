<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'m sorry you have such a negative view of the police,<br>that you feel the majority are corrupt abusers of power. I blame the<br>media. But is it really their fault? I mean, would a story about 300,000<br>police officers across the US *not* breaking any laws actually sell<br>newspapers or airtime? Probably not.\<br>\<br>Anyway, my thoughts when writing that part of my answer had more to do<br>with the fact that if you \"assert your rights\" and refuse to cooperate<br>with police, you make their job that much harder. You won\'t do anything<br>to alleviate their suspicions, and they will likely be forced to arrest<br>you so that they can gather the remainder of their information. You may<br>be innocent. But hey, good for you, you asserted your rights. You wasted<br>a lot of time and effort that you could have saved had you just assisted<br>law enforcement on the first place and cooperated. But ultimately, that<br>choice is yours. The amount of time you choose to waste is totally up to<br>you. The end result will be the same. How long it takes to get there is<br>up to you.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-it-illegal-in-Texas-to-not-comply-with-an-officers-order-when-you-have-not-committed-any-crimes-If-you-are-a-bystander-and-a-police-officer-tells-you-to-sit-down-and-you-do-not-comply-is-this-a-crime/answer/David-Rosen-5<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
