<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What happens if a person with mental disabilities is caught sexually<br>abusing children over the internet?**<br><br>Well, you can't sexually assault someone you can't touch, but you can<br>commit online sexual harassment. The problem, of course, is that the law<br>hasn't fully caught up with the technology. Usually enforcement begins<br>with the platform on which the abuse is taking place, but if law<br>enforcement is involved, then it proceeds outside of the jurisdiction of<br>the provider.<br><br>The mental disability of the suspect can be a mitigating factor, but it<br>does not eliminate the crime. It may cause the state to involuntarily<br>commit the suspect to treatment, and/or to declare the suspect a "mental<br>defective."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
