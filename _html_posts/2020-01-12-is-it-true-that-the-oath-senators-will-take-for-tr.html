<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It is, but it shouldn\'t.<br><br>Senators are not jurors. They are not impartial. They are partisan<br>actors, all of them, on both sides, voting in the interest of their<br>constituents. No one in that Senate chamber is, or can be, impartial.<br><br>They can, at least, give the evidence a thorough review as it is<br>presented by the House. They should swear to do that, not to be fair and<br>impartial. They should not swear to that, since there is no way they can<br>logically keep that oath.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
