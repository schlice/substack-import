<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I am a Christian, so my viewpoint is informed by my religion. And<br>Christians have that silly little bracelet:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-d76f8b401dcca8aaf5ce42ef8a42c850){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-d76f8b401dcca8aaf5ce42ef8a42c850" master_w="499"<br>master_h="212"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*What would Jesus do?*<br><br>We can easily look to the Bible to see what Jesus did in this case.<br><br>It wasn't Nikolas Cruz, but it was someone equally hated in society:<br>tax collectors. Everyone hated them. They often took way more taxes<br>than they had to, and kept the rest for themselves. They were spiteful,<br>hateful little people who had the backing of the government to do their<br>dirty work. But so long as the government got paid, they didn't really<br>care.<br><br>Zacchaeus was a tax collector, universally hated amongst the local<br>people, but he really didn't care. He was also a short man. Here's what<br>happened:<br><br>> Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. A man was there by the<br>> name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy. He<br>> wanted to see who Jesus was, but being a short man he could not,<br>> because of the crowd. So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree<br>> to see him, since Jesus was coming that way. When Jesus reached the<br>> spot, he looked up and said to him, \"Zacchaeus, come down<br>> immediately. I must stay at your house today.\" So he came down at<br>> once and welcomed him gladly. All the people saw this and began to<br>> mutter, \"He has gone to be the guest of a \`sinner.\'"<br>><br>> But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, \"Look, Lord! Here and<br>> now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated<br>> anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.\"<br>><br>> Jesus said to him, \"Today salvation has come to this house, because<br>> this man, too, is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek<br>> and to save what was lost.\" --- Luke 19:1--10 NIV<br><br>Jesus shows us what to do. We show kindness and compassion for those who<br>are sinners. It is not up to us to judge them; that's God's job. It is<br>our job to *love them*.<br><br>> "You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your<br>> enemy.' But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who<br>> persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He<br>> causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the<br>> righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what<br>> reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And<br>> if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than<br>> others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your<br>> heavenly Father is perfect. Matthew 5:43--48 NIV<br><br>Love your enemies. Pray for those who persecute you. It is what we are<br>commanded to do. Let God handle the judgments and the punishments.<br><br>And if I may, let me caution you the same way Jesus did:<br><br>> Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.<br>><br>> At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people<br>> gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. The teachers of<br>> the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They<br>> made her stand before the group and said to Jesus, "Teacher, this<br>> woman was caught in the act of adultery. In the Law Moses commanded us<br>> to stone such women. Now what do you say?" They were using this<br>> question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him.<br>><br>> But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his<br>> finger. When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said<br>> to them, "Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw<br>> a stone at her." Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.<br>><br>> At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older<br>> ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing<br>> there. Jesus straightened up and asked her, "Woman, where are they?<br>> Has no one condemned you?"<br>><br>> "No one, sir," she said.<br>><br>> "Then neither do I condemn you," Jesus declared. "Go now and leave<br>> your life of sin." --- John 8:1--11 NIV<br><br>What a powerful admonition! Let the one among you who is without sin<br>cast the first stone.<br><br>In other words, if you're going to judge others, you had better be<br>perfect. And in case you were unaware, none of us are sinless. None of<br>us are perfect. We are all sinners and have all fallen short of God's<br>grace. But he gives it to us anyway, and that's the beauty of<br>Christianity: even while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.<br><br>Don't judge others; that's God's job. Love others. Let God do the<br>judging.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**If Nikolas Cruz was vomiting uncontrollably in his hands and crying,<br>would you give him a bag?**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
