<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**The mother of my child cheated on me and left me for that guy. She now<br>wants to try to make it work for our child but she still loves and<br>misses the other guy. They work together and always see each other. Can<br>this work out for us?**<br><br>So lemme get this straight. The girl cheats on you with "that guy." She<br>loves him. She misses him. They work together. They always see each<br>other.<br><br>But she still "wants to try to make it work with you?" You know, "for<br>the sake of your child."<br><br>Let me be brutally honest.<br><br>It's not going to work. Ever.<br><br>What might work will be co-parenting, but you two will never work as a<br>couple because despite her words, that's not what she wants. Because if<br>that's what she wanted, she would prove it through her actions, not her<br>words.<br><br>Be there for your child. Make sure you shoot for sole custody, but at<br>the very least, get joint custody. Be a good father for your kid.<br><br>But stay clear of that woman. She's nothing but trouble.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
