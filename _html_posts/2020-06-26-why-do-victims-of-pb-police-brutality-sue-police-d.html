It makes more sense to punish the<br>policemen instead of the PD or city?**<br><br>Short answer: they can't. While they are on the job, police officers are<br>protected by what's known as *qualified immunity.*<br><br>Qualified immunity is a doctrine that states that so long as the police<br>are not violating an established law, and they are acting under color of<br>law, they cannot be personally sued for actions that they take as part<br>of their job.<br><br>It extends to all government officials, and basically says they can't be<br>sued unless you can show that they violated \"clearly established<br>statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would<br>have known\".<br><br>It was instituted in 1967 to protect police officers from frivolous<br>lawsuits and to protect them from financial liability in situations in<br>which they acted in good faith when the situation was legally unclear.<br>Over the years, it has been expanded. Most notably, the "clearly<br>established law" test has been expanded to require that in order to be<br>"clearly established," there must be case law already on the books<br>regarding that issue.<br><br>Critics have claimed that this makes it far more difficult to recover<br>damages when police officers violate civil rights, because most suits<br>don't even qualify.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
