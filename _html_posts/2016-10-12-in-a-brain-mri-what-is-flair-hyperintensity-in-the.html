<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>FLAIR stands for "Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery" and is a pulsed<br>sequence used in MRIs to produce an image. Using various Time to Echo<br>(TE) and Response Time (TR) values, we can produce different images, as<br>[BR(https://www.quora.com/profile/BR-185)]{.qlink_container}<br>described. The T2-weighted FLAIR image (high TR/high TE) can show us a<br>great deal more detail compared to older spin-density sequences (high<br>TR/low TE spin echo).<br><br>A "hyperintensity" is basically a white spot. In a T2-weighted FLAIR<br>image, a bright spot on the image is considered a hyperintensity.<br><br>What it means is not for us to say here. Simply saying that there is<br>a hyperintensity on a particular area of the brain (in your case, the<br>anterior pole of the right temporal lobe) signifies nothing other than<br>an MRI finding. It's up to the neurologist to tell you what that<br>hyperintensity indicates.<br><br>White matter hyperintensities in otherwise normal brains may be a cause<br>for concern. For you, it may be expected after brain surgery. Only your<br>neurologist can answer that question for you.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
