<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, let's start with the actual passage, try to understand what<br>Christ was saying, and then see if we can apply that understanding to<br>the question.<br><br>> "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and<br>> vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for<br>> yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy,<br>> and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure<br>> is, there your heart will be also." --- Matthew 6:19--21 NIV<br><br>\<br><br>The Bible mentions "rewards" in heaven a number of times.<br><br>> Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which<br>> the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that day, and not<br>> only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing. --- 2 Timothy<br>> 4:8 ESV<br><br>Here, Paul's second letter to Timothy mentions "the crown of<br>righteousness" which is a treasure awaiting us in heaven.<br><br>> The one who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a<br>> prophet's reward, and the one who receives a righteous person because<br>> he is a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward. ---<br>> Matthew 10:41 ESV<br><br>Matthew talks about rewards which will be received in heaven.<br><br>> "Behold, I am coming soon, bringing my recompense with me, to repay<br>> each one for what he has done." --- Revelation 22:12 ESV<br><br>Revelation talks about Jesus bringing "recompense" (rewards) with him<br>which will be used to repay us based on what we have done.<br><br>\<br><br>So there are various locations in the Bible where rewards in heaven are<br>mentioned. But Jesus did something very important in this passage from<br>the Sermon on the Mount that is missed by the question. **He linked the<br>"storing of treasure" to "our hearts."** "For where your treasure is,<br>there your heart will be also." This is monumentally significant in<br>order to understand what Jesus was saying.<br><br>We are supposed to honor God with everything we do. We are supposed to<br>treasure Christ first and foremost. If we treasure Christ in our life,<br>we will commit our worldly resources --- our time, our money, our talent<br>Colossians 3:23--24 ESV<br><br>When we devote our lives to God, it does not go unnoticed.<br><br>> "If anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones<br>> who is my disciple, truly I tell you, that person will certainly not<br>> lose their reward" --- Matthew 10:42 ESV<br><br>\<br><br>So back to the question. It's clear that Jesus said we ought to be<br>storing up treasures in heaven, because doing so means we're living for<br>Christ and honoring him here on earth.<br><br>But one line of the question is a little off:<br><br>> Why does some Christians make it sound like it\'s a sin to want to be<br>> rich in heaven?<br><br>The answer is likely that some Christians misunderstand what the<br>"rewards" in heaven will be, especially given that the questioner said<br>that "it's a sin to want to be rich in heaven." It's clear that the<br>person saying that it's a sin to want to be rich in heaven doesn't<br>actually know what the "treasures" in heaven will be, and what we will<br>be "rich" in. It certainly won't be possessions.<br><br>So what will the treasures in heaven be? Our friends at<br>[gotquestions.org(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=22e4d3&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/rewards-in-heaven.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container} looked at what those<br>treasures are, and where some of the confusion may be coming from:<br><br>> The rewards we gain in heaven are not like the rewards we earn here on<br>> earth. We tend to think in material terms---mansions, jewels, etc. But<br>> these things are only representations of the true rewards we will gain<br>> in heaven. A child who wins a spelling bee treasures the trophy he<br>> receives not for the sake of the trophy itself but for what that<br>> trophy means. Likewise, any rewards or honor we gain in heaven will be<br>> precious to us because they carry the weight and meaning of our<br>> relationship with God---and because they remind us of what He did<br>> through us on earth.<br>><br>> In this way, rewards in heaven glorify God and provide us with joy,<br>> peace, and wonder as we consider God's work in us and through us. The<br>> closer we were to God during this life, the more centered on Him and<br>> aware of Him, the more dependent on Him, the more desperate for His<br>> mercy, the more there will be to celebrate. We are like characters in<br>> a story who suffer doubt, loss, and fear, wondering if we will ever<br>> really have our heart's desire. When the happy ending comes and desire<br>> is fulfilled, there comes a completion. The story would not be<br>> satisfying without that completion. Rewards in heaven are the<br>> completion of our earthly story, and those rewards will be eternally<br>> satisfying ([[Psalm<br>> 16:11](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d009fe&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ps%252016.11){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}).\[1\](#ziuUy){#cite-ziuUy<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>So we're not storing up "physical treasures" which will make us "rich"<br>in heaven. We're storing up satisfaction, fulfillment, and completion of<br>our story. Our good works on earth store up a celebration. That is the<br>reward we will have. And it is good to seek it, and it will be eternally<br>joyous to receive it.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ziuUy){.citation_index} [[What is the purpose of there<br>being rewards in<br>heaven?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=22e4d3&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/rewards-in-heaven.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
