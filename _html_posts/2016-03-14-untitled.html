<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It seems to be reprehensible to ask a rape victim of any age to pay for<br>the child created during that attack. It seems to be more<br>reprehensible to ask a statutory rape victim to pay for the child,<br>especially when they were not legally able to consent to the sex act.<br>Then asking them to pay for the child that was created from that sex act<br>is ludicrous.<br><br>Remember though, like I mentioned, the child support doesn\'t benefit<br>the rapist, nor is it is not punitive damages for a rape victim. It is<br>designed to ensure a child is cared for. Regardless of how the child<br>came into being, there is still a child there, and the state has a<br>vested interest in ensuring the welfare of children.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/If-some-woman-will-hypothetically-rape-me-then-can-I-be-forced-to-pay-child-support-for-18+-years-to-any-children-who-will-result-from-this-rape/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
