<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [First of all, he said *most* people are afraid of cops<br>because it reminds them that there are consequences when they violate<br>the law. But we know that not everyone violates the law, right?<br>Therefore, it should hold true that only people who violate the law<br>should be afraid of cops. So the question becomes, are you worried<br>because you do actually violate the law and you worry that a cop will<br>find out, or are you really worried that over 300,000 law enforcement<br>officers around the country are, in reality, actually condescending<br>jerks and have nothing better to do with their time than to jam you up?<br>If you believe the latter, you watch too much TV. Re-read the section on<br>media bias. If you believe the former, there\'s still time to clean up<br>your act before you end up in prison beside the truck owner.\<br>\<br>Second, I understand you had a terrible day, but have you even bothered<br>to look at it from the cop\'s perspective, or do you just judge others<br>based on your narrow view on life? That cop has had a hundred other<br>traffic stops *just like yours* where someone has been found driving a<br>vehicle not registered to them. Guess how many of those times the driver<br>is actually using the vehicle legally. The correct answer can be counted<br>on one hand. Couple that with your behavior and your story, which does<br>seem a little off, and even to Joe Schmuckatelli non-cop, this whole<br>thing looks fishy. Can you blame him for investigating? I do agree that<br>he took it too far. [[Christopher<br>Hawk](https://www.quora.com/profile/Christopher-Hawk)]{.qlink_container}<br>said the same: there are some bad seeds on the force. It simply can\'t<br>be avoided. You met one and survived relatively unscathed. You should go<br>buy a lottery ticket; the odds of a truly law-abiding citizen actually<br>meeting a bad cop are pretty low.\<br>\<br>Finally, did you report the officer? The only way bad cops get off the<br>street is when honest citizens take the time and go through the effort<br>to report these officers to their supervisors. Even if they never tell<br>you what they do to that officer, *even if they don\'t actually do<br>anything this time,* ten reports with no action taken still sends a<br>message to supervisors, as much of a message as a single actionable<br>report. *But nothing gets better until you take action*. My dad used<br>to tell me, \"if you\'re not part of the solution, you\'re part of the<br>problem.\" Which are you?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-are-people-so-scared-of-cops-and-hate-them-despite-their-great-service-and-self-sacrifice/answer/Christopher-Hawk<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
