<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can the President be legally and quickly removed from office<br>before tens of thousands more die from his leadership failures?<br>Political pressure? Public demonstrations? 25th Amendment? Or something<br>else?**<br><br>What exactly are you basing your *prediction* of "tens of thousands more<br>deaths" specifically caused by "leadership failures?"<br><br>Are you referring to the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19?<br><br>Because *predictions* of death are just that --- predictions.<br>Predictions based on modeling data, not *settled science*.<br><br>Don't get mesmerized by the numbers that are presented to you daily in<br>the doom-and-gloom show on TV. Those models are all merely predictions.<br>Yes, they are using numbers to try to predict what might happen.<br><br>Let me take a wild stab here at what you're trying to say. I bet you're<br>saying that Trump is going to re-open the economy and it's going to<br>cause more people to die. Is that right?<br><br>Well then, I guess I'm the guy who has to drop the truth bombs on you.<br>Duck and cover, here it comes.<br><br>- There is literally nothing we can do to stop the healthcare system<br>  from being overrun.<br>- People are going to get sick. People are going to die.<br>- No amount of governmental intervention is going to stop that.<br><br>Ouch, that hurt, didn't it?<br><br>So why then are we closing the economy? We're doing it because the<br>*models* say that if we include social distancing, we can reduce the<br>number of deaths by *50 times*. That's pretty good. It's certainly<br>better than the 2.2 million projected dead if we did nothing. So we do<br>it for a short time.<br><br>But what is the result of that? We are looking at what is an "essential<br>business," and we are thus telling people that their work is either<br>essential, or it is not. We are literally pointing at two people and<br>saying, "your work is essential, but yours is not." You can go to work,<br>but you cannot. You can earn money for your family, but you cannot.<br><br>The point: **this isn't a debate about lives versus money. This is a<br>debate about lives versus lives.** We are literally destroying the<br>fabric of what makes the world economy tick, and for what? A small<br>fraction of the amount of people who die anyway? As of yesterday, we had<br>100 jobs lost for every one death. Think about that. 100 people are no<br>longer able to afford the house they live in, able to afford to buy food<br>for their kids, because one person out of that 100 died. We are<br>irrevocably altering the lives of 100 people because one died. Does that<br>sound like a proportional response?<br><br>Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that we shouldn't have done<br>anything. We did. It had positive effects.<br><br>But people want *HOPE*. People want to know that this is going to<br>*END* sometime soon. Is there a light at the end of the tunnel?<br>Currently, no one is offering any.<br><br>So I agree with you, the President isn't doing is full job yet. He's not<br>offering any *HOPE*.<br><br>But can you "get him out of office?" Nope. Not at all. Not without an<br>assassin\'s bullet. The way to get him out of office is to not re-elect<br>him in November, period. That's how our Constitution is designed. We<br>don't have "votes of no-confidence" like they have in Parliamentary<br>systems; we don't need them. We vote for President every four years. If<br>you don't like how the President has handled this pandemic, look to<br>change in November.<br><br>(EDIT: A note to USSS who no doubt will hear about and then subsequently<br>read this answer: I am in no way suggesting that we should assassinate<br>the President. I merely said that such was the only way that he would be<br>"removed" from office before the end of his natural term.)<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
