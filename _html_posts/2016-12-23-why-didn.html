<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What [[Subhankar<br>Das](https://www.quora.com/profile/Subhankar-Das-12)]{.qlink_container}<br>is trying to say is that the reason Asus went with the more durable less<br>scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass 4 on the Zenfone 3 is the same reason a<br>company makes any business decision: cost. They were trying to<br>control the costs on the Max and Laser, so they went with the cheaper<br>glass (Gorilla Glass 3). It's more durable, but less scratch-resistant,<br>which makes it cheaper.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
