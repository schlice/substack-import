<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Some people do feel this way. However, the logic does not follow their<br>reasoning. Their reasoning is based on *emotion*, not *logic.*<br>Put simply, they are wrong.<br><br>Looking at the situation logically produces a different set of results.<br>At the time of the founding, there were indeed repeating rifles. There<br>were breechloading rifles. They were not vastly underpowered as compared<br>to modern-day rifles. Granted, modern technology and manufacturing<br>processes have made the firearm more accurate, easier to maintain, and<br>easier to use, but "more lethal?" I can't see that modern firearms are<br>"more lethal" because they are more accurate or easier to maintain. More<br>accurate rifles still require a decent shooter to put the round on<br>target. Rifles at the time of the founding also required a decent<br>shooter to operate the rifle. Not much different than today. Rifles then<br>and now still go boom, and the recipient becomes just as dead. They<br>aren't "deader" today than they were at the time of the founding. The<br>founders absolutely could have imagined more accurate rifles, or higher<br>capacity repeating rifles, because they already had that technology, so<br>envisioning improvements to that technology would not have been unheard<br>of.<br><br>As for some people who feel that the 2nd Amendment should change because<br>technology has changed, what other amendments should we change because<br>technology has changed? Perhaps the 1st Amendment? While firearms may<br>have improved but are basically the same technology that was available<br>at the nation's founding, the tools we use for speech have *vastly*<br>changed, and the Founders had no way of knowing we'd have anything like<br>radio, television, computers, or the Internet. Instant dissemination of<br>information was witchcraft back then. The Founders *never* could<br>have reasonably assumed we'd have such means of communication when they<br>wrote the 1st Amendment.<br><br>If any amendment needs to change because technology has changed, it's<br>the 1st Amendment, not the 2nd.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
