<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does Donald Trump have a medical degree or is he a quack doctor<br>presenting serious health risks to many Americans?**<br><br>Donald Trump does exactly what I do here on Quora. He provides GENERAL<br>MEDICAL INFORMATION. The information is timely, and needs to be widely<br>distributed so doctors can interpret it for their patients.<br><br>He does not provide medical advice, which requires a<br>doctor-patient relationship. He cannot prescribe medications, so unless<br>people are finding illegal ways to obtain medicine solely based on<br>general medical information, he's not introducing any serious risks to<br>Americans.<br><br>Or maybe you're talking about this:<br><br>[[Man Dies, Woman Hospitalized After Taking Form Of Chloroquine To<br>Prevent<br>COVID-19](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fbc636&url=https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/24/820512107/man-dies-woman-hospitalized-after-taking-form-of-chloroquine-to-prevent-covid-19){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="npr.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall in that house.<br><br>> Man: Trump said that hydroxychloroquine may help with lessening the<br>> effects of the virus.<br>><br>> Woman: Hey, our fishtank cleaner had that stuff in it!<br>><br>> :::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>> ::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>> !(images/qimg-0c0c42277052235d9160ba9e16d12ec6){.landscape<br>> .qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>> master_src="images/qimg-0c0c42277052235d9160ba9e16d12ec6"<br>> master_w="640" master_h="480"}<br>> :::<br>> ::::<br>><br>> Man: But the label says "Not for Human Consumption."<br>><br>> Woman: But the President said so!<br>><br>> Man: Okay, let's eat it!<br>><br>> Woman: Okay!<br><br>I'm not sure if this says more about the President, or more about the<br>people eating fishtank cleaner.
