<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The existence of God relies on nothing. Existence does not rely on<br>evidence. Existence does not rely on belief. Existence is its own entity<br>separate from anything else which analyzes or describes the existence.<br>For example, evidence *points to* the existence; the existence doesn't<br>rely on evidence in order to exist. Additionally, the truth of God's<br>existence is discovered, not invented. The truth exists regardless of<br>anyone's belief in it. Therefore, neither faith nor evidence is required<br>to create the truth of God's existence.<br><br>That said, faith is nothing without evidence, which points to existence.<br>But what type of evidence is there that points to God's existence? And<br>will you accept that evidence? God exists outside of the physical realm<br>He created, so He cannot be measured or seen or examined. So if it's<br>**only physical, empirical, testable evidence you're looking for, you<br>will be sorely disappointed.**<br><br>*But that's not the only evidence of God's existence.*<br><br>There is abundant evidence to show that God exists, but it's not direct<br>evidence of God Himself. For example, the scientific evidence<br>overwhelmingly confirms that the universe exploded into being out of<br>nothing. Either someone created something out of nothing (the theistic<br>view), or no one created something out of nothing (the atheistic view).<br>Which view is more reasonable? The theistic view. Which view requires<br>more faith? The atheistic view.<br><br>Also, the simplest life form contains the information-equivalent of<br>1,000 encyclopedias. Theists believe only an intelligent being can<br>create a life form containing the equivalent of 1,000 encyclopedias.<br>Atheists believe non-intelligent natural forces can do it. Theists have<br>evidence to support their conclusion. Since atheists don't have any such<br>evidence, their belief requires a lot more faith.<br><br>So not only does the belief in the existence of God have evidence, the<br>belief that God does not exist requires a lot more faith!<br><br>I just don't have enough faith to believe that God does not exist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
