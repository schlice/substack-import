<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can I stop law enforcement from constantly assaulting me with<br>energy weapons? There are no long term studies on the effects of radar<br>effects on the body?**<br><br>Clever! Here's another way to try to stop law enforcement from doing<br>their jobs:<br><br>*Law enforcement can't use radar on my car because it's not using radar<br>to track my speed, it's "assault with an energy weapon."*<br><br>First of all, RADAR is not an "energy weapon." It's a traffic control<br>device. It is specifically designed to emit such a low level of<br>radiation that it blends in with the natural radiation in the<br>environment.<br><br>Secondly, and this ties in to that last sentence, you receive RF<br>radiation from a variety of sources, every single day:<br><br>- Outer space and the sun<br>- The sky -- including lightning strikes<br>- The earth itself -- most radiation from the earth is infrared, but a<br>  tiny fraction is RF<br><br>Man-made RF radiation is used for many different things, such as<br><br>- Broadcasting radio and television signals<br>- Transmitting signals from cordless telephones, cell phones and cell<br>  phone towers, satellite phones, and 2-way radios<br>- WiFi and Bluetooth<br>- Cooking food (in a microwave oven)<br>- Heating body tissues to destroy them in medical procedures<br>- "Welding" pieces of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) using certain machines<br>- Millimeter wave scanners at the airport\[1\](#idLED){#cite-idLED<br>  .citation_link}<br><br>And, of course, police radar.<br><br>The World Health Organization says the following regarding exposure to<br>radio frequency energy and risk of cancer:<br><br>> Many epidemiological studies have addressed possible links between<br>> exposure to RF and excess risk of cancer. However, because of<br>> differences in the design and execution of these studies, their<br>> results are difficult to interpret. A number of national and<br>> international peer review groups have concluded that there is no clear<br>> evidence of links between RF exposure and excess risk of cancer. WHO<br>> has also concluded that there is no convincing scientific evidence<br>> that exposure to RF shortens the life span of humans, or that RF is an<br>> inducer or promoter of cancer. \[2\](#cYMTV){#cite-cYMTV<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>To answer the specific question about police radar, as I mentioned, the<br>average output power emitted is very low (a few milliwatts), and so they<br>are not considered hazardous to health, even when used in very close<br>proximity to the body. You get larger doses of radiation from everyday<br>objects, the universe, and your cell phone than you do from police<br>radar.<br><br>TL;DR: You can try to get the police to stop using RADAR by claiming<br>that it is an "energy weapon" and that no one really knows the long-term<br>effect of being blasted by those energy weapons inside your car, but<br>science knows better.<br><br>I must say though, it's pretty clever. Good for you. Better idea though:<br>just drive the speed limit.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-idLED){.citation_index} [[Microwaves, Radio Waves, and<br>Other Types of Radiofrequency<br>Radiation](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=65827a&url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/radiofrequency-radiation.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cancer.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-cYMTV){.citation_index} [[Electromagnetic fields and<br>public health: radars and human<br>health](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=66baf4&url=https://www.who.int/peh-emf/publications/facts/fs226/en/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="who.int"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
