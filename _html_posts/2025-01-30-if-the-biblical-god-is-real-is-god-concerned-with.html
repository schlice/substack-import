<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **If the Biblical God is real, is God concerned with human free will,<br>> or does God care only about obedience?**<br><br>Wow, this really is an excellent question! I mean, if God makes you do<br>something, doesn't this mean you don't have free will? How can you have<br>free will if you are forced to do what God wants you to do?<br><br>Let's look at the technicality first. We absolutely have free will.<br>For example, Jonah did have free will, because Jonah chose to disobey<br>God. But that wasn't your question. You contrasted Jonah's free will to<br>obedience to God. While it's true that you can be disobedient to God<br>while exercising your free will, you can also freely choose obedience to<br>God's callings. So free will and obedience are not complete opposites.<br>You can exercise your free will by freely agreeing to follow God's call<br>on your life. In other words, "free will" is not "the opposite of<br>obedience."<br><br>What you instead mean by "free will" is "making my own choices, separate<br>from what God wants for my life." But *the very fact that you can do<br>this* *proves* that you have free will. If you had no free will, you<br>wouldn't be free to disobey God in the first place. Just ask Adam and<br>Eve. When they committed the world's first sin, they were exercising<br>their free will.<br><br>> **Does the story of Jonah show that God does not care about Jonah\'s<br>> free will?**<br><br>Far from it. The story of Jonah, just like the story of Adam and Eve,<br>shows that *God loves you* *so much* *that He is willing to let you<br>make choices which are clearly not good for you.* God's plans are for<br>our good (Jeremiah 29:11). He has "plans of fullness, not of harm" for<br>us. God's plans will never hurt us, and like the old saying goes, *if He<br>brings you* *to* *it, He'll bring you* *through* *it.* Often,<br>when we receive a call from God, we don't want to do it because we are<br>fearful that we will be hurt or that we will fail. But we were not<br>created with a spirit of fear. We were "fearfully and wonderfully made"<br>(Psalm 139:14) with a spirit of "power, love, and a sound mind" (2 Tim<br>1:7).<br><br>By the same token, *God is not going to alter His plans just because you<br>are fearful.* It is not up to God to change His plans to accommodate<br>you. It is up to you to acknowledge God's sovereignty and accept that<br>God will get you through whatever it is that He is calling you to do.<br><br>> What about the free will of the people of Nineveh?<br><br>Oh, they exercised their free will, all right.<br><br>> *Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,<br>> "Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and call out against it, for<br>> their evil has come up before me." \-- Jonah 1:1--2 ESV*<br><br>The people of Nineveh were "evil," which means that they *actively<br>disobeyed God.* This wasn't just accidental, random sin. This is<br>active, willing disobedience which says, "I know what is right. I<br>know what God wants me to do, and I am going to do the opposite, to<br>*spite God*."<br><br>To that end, what we're saying is that **the people of Nineveh<br>absolutely had free will,** and they used it to actively oppose God's<br>good plans for them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
