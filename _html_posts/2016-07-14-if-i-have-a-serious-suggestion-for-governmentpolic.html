Usually the department website has contact information<br>that you can use. Make sure you request a reply with the status of your<br>suggestion.<br><br>Failing that, you can go to your city council with your suggestion. They<br>essentially control policy at the department.<br><br>You can also always go to the media with your idea. If local news<br>outlets get hold of it, they might publicize it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
