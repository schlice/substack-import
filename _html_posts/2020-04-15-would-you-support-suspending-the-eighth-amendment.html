<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would you support suspending the Eighth Amendment for particular kinds<br>of criminals?**<br><br>No.<br><br>There really is no further discussion needed other than "no," but let me<br>explain.<br><br>The 8th Amendment states:<br><br>> Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor<br>> cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.<br><br>I'm certain when you're talking about "particular kinds of criminals,"<br>you mean the "cruel and unusual punishments" part. Like maybe we should<br>go back to firing squads, or drawing and quartering (but with Mack<br>trucks instead of horses). Or public executions. Or maybe implementing<br>[[The Running<br>Man](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=17e1f6&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Running_Man_(1987_film)){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}! Great prime-time viewing<br>right there, and we can charge Pay-Per-View!<br><br>Just like I am against restricting hate speech, I am also against<br>limitations on any Constitutional amendment for "certain classes" of<br>anyone or anything.<br><br>**Because it's usually exactly those kinds of things that the Amendment<br>was designed to protect**.<br><br>The Amendment was designed to protect the classification of people as<br>"particular kinds of criminals." Because, just like hate crimes:<br><br>- *Who gets to decide who is a "particular kind of criminal"?*<br>- *What happens when someone is classified as a "particular kind of<br>  criminal" and you don't think he should be? Or vice-versa?*<br><br>We cannot fall into the trap of dividing our country. Our last president<br>was expert at dividing us against each other in this way. Don't allow<br>yourself to fall into the same trap.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
