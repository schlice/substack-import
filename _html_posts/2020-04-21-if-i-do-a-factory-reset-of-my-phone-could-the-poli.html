Your carrier prints out a log of<br>all of your text messages (incoming and outgoing) for the time period<br>indicated on the warrant. They retain a log of all of your messages for<br>precisely this purpose.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
