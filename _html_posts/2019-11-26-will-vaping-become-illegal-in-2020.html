<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Will vaping become illegal in 2020?<br><br>*(United States answer)*<br><br>Across the country, I don't think so. However, individual states will<br>implement "common-sense" restrictions, like removing good flavors from<br>e-liquid so that you don't entice children to vape. Some states (I'm<br>looking at you, New York and California) could possibly ban vaping<br>altogether.<br><br>The science, however, does not comport with that decision.<br><br>The deaths from vaping were all found to have been linked to chemicals<br>in *illegal* e-liquid from China. The liquid was used not to transport<br>nicotine, but to transport THC, the active ingredient in marijuana.<br><br>Illegal vape cartridges containing THC also contain significant amounts<br>of vitamin E acetate. Because cannabis oil is expensive, producers use<br>the acetate to dilute and thicken it without affecting its flavor or<br>smell. But the vitamin's oil-like properties can cause respiratory<br>issues, including cough, shortness of breath and chest pain. 85% of the<br>deaths reported have been linked to vaping some form of THC. Since<br>marijuana is illegal at the federal level, the FDA cannot exercise any<br>oversight over the products themselves, which means they all exist,<br>unregulated, on the black market.<br><br>Unless and until marijuana is legalized at the federal level, black<br>market e-liquid will continue to exist, it will continue to be<br>unregulated, and people choosing to consume illegal vape liquid will<br>continue to die. No amount of restriction on vaping will stop that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
