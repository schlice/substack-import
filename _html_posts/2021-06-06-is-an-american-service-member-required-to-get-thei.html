<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is an American service member required to get their family members<br>military ID cards?**<br><br>Technically no, but if they want to access any of the base services (or<br>access the base at all) they're going to need them. Especially if you're<br>living on base, it would be difficult to get to your house if you didn't<br>have military ID to let you in.<br><br>They are going to get healthcare from the military. They need an ID card<br>for that.<br><br>They are going to shop for groceries at the Commissary. They need an ID<br>card for that.<br><br>They are going to shop for other things at the BX/PX. Most of these<br>require ID cards at checkout.<br><br>They may want to use the base amenities (gym, pool, auto care, etc). All<br>require ID.<br><br>Basically, anything you do on base will require ID.<br><br>Now, let's say you're a military member but you're independently wealthy<br>and you can get your own health insurance and you live off-base and you<br>don't need to access the base for anything. Your dependents don't<br>technically need to get their own ID cards. They'll still be registered<br>in DEERS as dependents, but whether or not they get ID cards is, at that<br>point, up to them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
