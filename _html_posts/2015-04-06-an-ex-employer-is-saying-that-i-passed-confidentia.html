<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Even though th s is a specific question, I was A2A so I<br>will answer the general legal question \"if someone accuses me of X,<br>don\'t they have to prove it in order to convict me?\"\<br>\<br>Short answer: yes.\<br>\<br>Longer answer: under the U.S. Legal system, you are \"innocent until<br>proven guilty in a court of law.\" The burden of evidence is on the<br>prosecution to show \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" that you did it. The<br>defense is charged with casting light on reasonable doubt, showing the<br>jury the items which introduce reasonable doubt.\<br>\<br>So unless someone is filing a lawsuit against you, there is nothing for<br>you to do. I would make sure you are aware of a good corporate defense<br>attorney in your area and have the ability to retain that person, so<br>make sure you have the finances in order to pay the retainer, should you<br>get sued.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
