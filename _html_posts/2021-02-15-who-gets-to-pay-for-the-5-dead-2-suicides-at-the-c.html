<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Who gets to pay for the 5 dead + 2 suicides at the Capital? No one<br>talks anymore about them.**<br><br>The criminals who committed criminal acts are the ones who will pay. If<br>they were killed by trampling or some other accident, then no one but<br>society pays.<br><br>**Could "civilian" Trump still be indicted by a Grand Jury involving<br>culpability if the DA in DC can bring charges? RE: Inciting a riot<br>resulting in death?**<br><br>Sure, if you can find enough evidence that her did that, but currently<br>there is not. He gave a very public speech, for which we have the entire<br>transcript, and it does not amount to inciting a riot.<br><br>We apply the legal test to determine when highly emotionally charged<br>speech can be restricted in order to determine that. It\'s called the<br>Brandenburg test, from the Supreme Court case where it was invented:<br>*Brandenburg v. Ohio.* The Brandenburg test says that speech can be<br>restricted if:<br><br>1.  the speech is "directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless<br>    action," AND<br>2.  the speech is "likely to incite or produce such action."<br><br>BOTH elements are required. But what is "imminent?" The imminence test<br>was exemplified in another case which used the Brandenburg test: Hess v.<br>Indiana in 1973. The court concluded that Hess' speech, while laced with<br>vulgarities, did not specify a time for lawless action. The Court<br>concluded that the speech "amounted to nothing more than advocacy of<br>illegal action at some indefinite future time."<br><br>But it's not just imminence. In order to qualify as inciting, it must<br>direct listeners to imminent *lawless* action. Trump did not even<br>suggest to his listeners that they engage in lawless action, even if it<br>was imminent. *Even if he knew* that lawless action would ensue from<br>his speech, it doesn't make his speech inciting because *he didn't<br>actually suggest committing lawless action.*<br><br>And just because his speech riled up an already incitable crowd doesn't<br>make it unconstitutional, either. In another Brandenburg test case,<br>*NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware* in 1982, the Court discussed why fiery<br>rhetoric is not unlawful:<br><br>> *Strong and effective extemporaneous rhetoric cannot be nicely<br>> channeled in purely dulcet phrases. An advocate must be free to<br>> stimulate his audience with spontaneous and emotional appeals for<br>> unity and action in a common cause. When such appeals do not incite<br>> lawless action, they must be regarded as protected speech.*<br><br>When that test is applied, you find that the speech did not meet the<br>legal standard for speech which can be restricted, so the speech was<br>Constitutional. Unwise, maybe. But Constitutional? Definitely.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
