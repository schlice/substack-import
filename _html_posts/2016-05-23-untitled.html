<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The idea here is not that the manufacturer was complicit in the murder.<br>The idea is to make it too costly to produce firearms in America,<br>because litigation costs from all of the victims' families from every<br>shooting in America will sue the manufacturer of the gun that killed<br>their loved one, thus destroying the gun industry by using the hammer of<br>the justice system. Ideally, she'd like to destroy the gun manufacturing<br>industry in America.<br><br>Of course, none of these lawsuits hold any merit. They are simply<br>enacted to burden the gun manufacturer with added legal costs so that it<br>becomes impractical to produce firearms.<br><br>It's very similar to SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public<br>Participation) lawsuits. The plaintiff didn't hope to win. The plaintiff<br>only hoped to pressure the defendant enough to abandon whatever it was<br>they were doing that the plaintiff found objectionable; usually it was<br>publicly discussing something unpleasant about the plaintiff. Usually,<br>mounting legal costs were enough to dissuade defendants and get them to<br>stop talking about whatever unpopular thing it was that the plaintiff<br>didn't like. And prosecuitng SLAPP plaintiffs was hard because you don't<br>want to deny real good-faith claims by making anti-SLAPP legislation too<br>broad.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/I-want-to-help-make-America-a-gun-free-society-What-steps-do-I-take-Are-there-any-specific-organizations-or-movements-I-can-join/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
