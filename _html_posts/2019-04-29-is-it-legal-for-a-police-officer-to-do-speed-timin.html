What is legal in one<br>department is illegal in another.<br><br>Also, even where something is legal, local department policy may still<br>prohibit it.<br><br>So the correct answer is that in order to find out, you will need to<br>check the laws in the locality in which you are asking.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
