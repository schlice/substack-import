<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So you're asking whether or not we have the requisite knowledge and<br>ability to put a man on the moon again. So to me, you're asking the<br>following:<br><br>- Know-how: Do we have the technical knowledge required to calculate<br>  the orbital mechanics to launch a vehicle to get a man to the moon<br>- Ability: Do we have the hardware to make it happen<br><br>So with this in mind, I'd say that yes, we have the technical know-how,<br>but no, we don't currently have the ability. We would have to design<br>entirely new launch vehicles, new lunar landers, etc. in order to get<br>there and get home. The investment in the vehicles, in today's dollars,<br>would be incredibly large.<br><br>*Can* it be done? Without a doubt. We did it once, we can do it<br>again. *Will* it be done any time soon? Without a compelling reason<br>to put a man on the moon again, I don't see it happening. We've done it<br>once, we've proved we can do it, and there doesn't appear to be a reason<br>why we would want to do it again. It would have to be part of a larger<br>project, like maybe establishing a base on the moon from which we can<br>launch interplanetary missions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
