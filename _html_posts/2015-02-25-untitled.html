<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [The vast majority of citizens don\'t live in fear of the<br>police. Some people do, because they have lived their lives in such a<br>way as to draw negative attention from the police. Some people do<br>because they are perpetually fearful of authority. And some people do<br>because they are just mentally unstable. But the vast majority of the<br>population are good, honest, hard-working citizens who deserve<br>protection.\<br>\<br>Your notion of police-citizen relations is skewed. I can say that<br>because I grew up in the Tri-State area. And my dad was a cop there.\<br>\<br>I saw the good cops and I saw the bad cops. I saw what the cops there<br>did when no one was looking, so I know what good cops and bad cops look<br>like. I could tell stories, but what would be the point of that? I also<br>know that many police *administrations* in that area of the country<br>were bureaucratic nightmares in which corruption was rampant, but at the<br>line level, it was very infrequent. It happened, and more so in the<br>Tri-State area than in other parts of the country, but not more so than<br>other departments around the country, on average. Remember that those<br>areas of the country have a much higher number of people living there<br>than in other areas around the country, and things \*appear\* to happen<br>more frequently there because there is a larger population there, as<br>well as a larger police force.\<br>\<br>But cops are people too, and cops have good days and bad days.\<br>\<br>If you\'re spending your entire life living in fear of the police,<br>you\'re not living right, and you\'re wasting your fear on the police.\<br>\<br>Cops don\'t want to bother you! They\'d rather do *less* paperwork than<br>*more*. So remember, if you\'re stopped by the police, relax, do what is<br>asked (up to a point), and you\'ll be fine. You can\'t take a few bad<br>apples and generalize to the whole population. How your particular<br>interaction with the police goes is mostly up to you and how you<br>respond.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-can-police-citizen-relations-be-improved-in-the-United-States-where-police-brutality-is-a-rising-concern/answer/Kevin-Allaire<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
