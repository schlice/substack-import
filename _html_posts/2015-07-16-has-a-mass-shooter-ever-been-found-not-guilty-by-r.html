<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Interesting you should ask now, because James Holmes (the<br>shooter in the Aurora theater shooting) is on trial for murder, he has<br>pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, and the jury took just two<br>days to return a verdict.\<br>\<br>(EDIT) Holmes was indeed convicted of first-degree murder, the jury<br>finding that he was not insane during the shooting. I would add,<br>however, that there is no doubt that he is insane now.\<br>\<br>But to answer your question, yes, at least one mass shooter has been<br>found not guilty by reason of insanity.\<br>\<br>[[Old Salisbury Road<br>murders](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=013712&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Salisbury_Road_murders){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>[[John Hinckley,<br>Jr.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cc1b05&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hinckley,_Jr){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} - the man who attempted<br>to kill President Reagan\<br>\<br>Many defendants are found to be sane enough to stand trial, so the<br>insanity defense cannot be used.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
