<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: NO.<br><br>The ready availability of handguns does not increase the risk that<br>people will commit suicide.<br><br>It increases the ease with which people can commit suicide. It also<br>increases the risk that people will be successful at suicide;<br>firearms are the most successful method of suicide, with nearly an<br>80--90% success rate worldwide.<br><br>However, the method used varies worldwide, mostly based on the ready<br>availability of the agent used to commit suicide. The popularity of<br>handgun suicide in the United States is indeed linked to the<br>availability of handguns. The popularity of poisoning suicide in South<br>America is linked to the ready availability of poisons commonly used in<br>agriculture.<br><br>However, worldwide, hanging is the most common method of suicide,<br>accounting for 53% of the male suicides, and 39% of the female suicides.<br>Suffocation and hanging, next to firearms, is the second most successful<br>method of suicide, with a 60--85% success rate. Drowning is a form of<br>suffocation.<br><br>So, the burning question: if you get rid of handguns, will suicides<br>decrease?<br><br>If you look worldwide, there is no indication that removing one agent<br>used for suicide will decrease numbers of suicides. It increases the<br>risk that people will turn to other forms of suicide. In the United<br>States, hangings will increase for males, and poisonings will increase<br>for females, if 300 million handguns mysteriously disappeared.<br><br>The tool makes it easier. It doesn't make it possible.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
