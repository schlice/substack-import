<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Absolutely none. And that fact is *critical* for pro-life males to<br>understand.<br><br>I will never know what it feels like to be pregnant.\<br>I will never know what it feels like to grow a human being inside my<br>body.\<br>I will never know the (albeit temporary) pain of childbirth.\<br>I will never know what it feels like to feed a baby with my body.<br><br>In short, I will never know what it feels like to be *a mother*.<br><br>I know what it feels like to be a father. I am a father three times<br>over. I've had some great successes, and I've made some monumental<br>errors. Some of those were even my fault (gee, how humble of me). But<br>through all of it, I've *grown*. And based on how my boys turned out,<br>I'd say we did a pretty decent job.<br><br>But this decision has zero impact on my personal life. None. Even if I<br>had the opportunity to have sex with another woman, I can't have any<br>more children. So this *literally* has zero impact on me.<br><br>But as pro-life men, this doesn't mean that it has zero impact on my<br>brothers and sisters. And it certainly has a tremendous impact on the<br>pre-born human beings whose rights we have come closer to protecting.<br><br>What I'm getting at is that while we champion the cause of the pre-born<br>humans who have no voice, we must remember that this decision<br>*profoundly* and *uniquely* impacts a woman. Often, the charge that<br>"men just want to control women's bodies" is made because women feel<br>like men make these decisions that do not impact them, so there can be<br>no other reason for such a decision other than that they want to control<br>women. We must be sensitive to this fact while we fight for equal rights<br>for the pre-born.<br><br>Men really don't want to control women's bodies. Seriously. If that were<br>true, we'd be advocating for all sorts of laws which have nothing at all<br>to do with pregnancy. I thought the old trope was "barefoot and pregnant<br>in the kitchen." Where's the legislation to keep women barefoot? Where's<br>the legislation to keep women in the kitchen, or at least out of the<br>workforce? Surprisingly (it seems), it's not there, nor are there any<br>calls for such legislation to pe passed, outside of some very, very<br>fringe people.<br><br>What you do with your body is your decision. But that's *your* body.<br>What you do with *other people's* bodies is decidedly not your<br>decision. Morally speaking, your bodily autonomy has limits, just as<br>mine does. Equally, we cannot make decisions about our bodies which<br>affect the lives of other humans. Remember, "the right to swing your arm<br>ends at my nose." Your rights are absolute *until they begin to impact<br>my rights.*<br><br>So while I'm glad that the Court has finally reversed a Constitutionally<br>fraught decision, we're not done. This is a *checkpoint*, not the<br>*finish line.*<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What effect does Roe v. Wade being overturned in the US Supreme Court<br>have on you?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
