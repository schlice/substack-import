<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you believe all addictions can be cured with the right relationship<br>with God?**<br><br>Can God cure addiction? Absolutely 100% yes. There is nothing that God<br>can\'t do. Nothing. Any question that begins with "Can God" is answered<br>with yes, God can.<br><br>But should we *expect* that God should do this? Should we expect that we<br>can induce God into action by us doing something? Should we expect God<br>to respond a certain way based on what we do?<br><br>There used to be a phrase I would use often: *God doesn't give you more<br>than you can handle*. The sentiment was accurate, but it put the focus<br>in the wrong place. It is better said: *You can handle anything when you<br>trust in God.* God is not doling out your trials and only allotting<br>exactly the amount you can handle on your own. God *expects* you to lean<br>on him.<br><br>> Trust in the Lord with all your heart\<br>> and lean not on your own understanding;\<br>> in all your ways submit to him,\<br>> and he will make your paths straight.<br>><br>> ---Proverbs 3:5--6 NIV<br><br>Note what the psalmist says here: Trust in God, and **lean not on your<br>own understanding**. Isaiah 55:8--9 tells us why we often don't<br>understand what God is doing: \"\'For my thoughts are not your thoughts,<br>neither are your ways my ways,\' declares the Lord. \'For as the heavens<br>are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my<br>thoughts than your thoughts.\'\" God sees the whole picture, while we<br>only see our tiny corner of it. **To trust in the Lord with all our<br>heart means we can't place our own right to understand above His right<br>to direct our lives the way He sees fit.** When we insist on God always<br>making sense to our finite minds, we are setting ourselves up for<br>spiritual trouble.<br><br>Our limited understanding can easily lead us astray. Proverbs 16:25<br>says, \"There is a way that appears to be right, but in the end it leads<br>to death.\" **When we choose to direct our lives according to what seems<br>right to *us*, we often reap disaster** (Judges 21:25).<br><br>The point here is that while we might think that by setting ourselves<br>into a "right relationship" (as far as we know), that God should do<br>something. It's the "vending machine" view of God: I do something, and<br>God responds the way I choose.<br><br>Here's my question: ***what happens to you if you set yourself in a<br>right relationship with God and he doesn't cure your addiction?***<br><br>Were you simply not worthy? Did you not set your relationship right<br>enough? Did you do something to displease God? Or worse, does God even<br>care?<br><br>These are not only dangerous thoughts, but they border on the<br>blasphemous.<br><br>The bottom line is that *we may never know during our lifetime what<br>God's plans for us entail.* What we do know is that God keeps his<br>promises. And he has promised us that if we believe in Jesus and accept<br>him as our savior and turn our lives over to him, we will be saved.<br><br>Our lives may not proceed in exactly the way we thought. Indeed, our<br>lives may involve pain. But we have never been told that the life of a<br>believer would be free of struggle. Indeed, even the greats of the faith<br>in the Bible lived lives of torture until they died, and never got an<br>adequate explanation of how their lives would impact the world while<br>they were alive. But they never questioned that God was doing what he<br>promised. The pain of life never made them stop believing in God. Just<br>look at the life of Job for a perfect example of this.<br><br>Ultimately, God never promised us a life free of pain. He also never<br>promised that he would act a certain way if we act a certain way. He has<br>promised that if we believe in him and commit our lives to him, we will<br>be saved.<br><br>TL;DR: Can God remove addiction? Yes. Should we *expect* **God<br>to remove addiction, regardless of what we do? No.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
