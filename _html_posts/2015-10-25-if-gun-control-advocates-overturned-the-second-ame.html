<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Let\'s just stop this hypothetical right here before we<br>ever get to how to overthrow the government, because the whole idea is<br>just silly on its face. \"Gun control advocates,\" by themselves, can\'t<br>\"overturn\" the Second Amendment. To repeal an amendment, you have to<br>pass a new amendment which does just that. For example, the 21st<br>Amendment repealed the 18th Amendment.\<br>\<br>Amendments require *broad, popular support.* You need Congress to<br>write the amendment, and then you need a 2/3 majority in Congress to<br>pass it, followed by 3/4 of the states ratifying it. That means you need<br>38 states with a majority of people who believe that the Second<br>Amendment is no longer needed because the police can keep me safe from<br>bad guys (because when seconds count, the police are only minutes away),<br>and that whole \"resistance to tyranny\" thing is a bunch of hogwash,<br>because the government will never take my rights away, right?\<br>\<br>Except for those pesky guns\...\<br>\<br>Besides, Congress will never pass such an amendment. It\'s political<br>suicide. Taking away rights? Good luck with that. Heck, Colorado passed<br>a 10-round magazine limit, and the two state representatives who<br>authored the bill were *recalled*. So yeah, there\'s no chance that<br>Congress will even author an amendment repealing the Second Amendment.\<br>\<br>Since there\'s no way Congress will do it, you have to go grassroots.<br>Your only option is to get 34 state legislatures ( a 2/3 majority) to<br>call for a *Constitutional Convention* to propose a new amendment<br>repealing the Second Amendment. However, once they write the amendment,<br>you still need 38 states (a 3/4 majority) to ratify it. Understand<br>though, this has never been done in the history of the country. We have<br>27 Amendments, and all 17 times (the first 10 were all written<br>together), Congress has authored the Amendment.\<br>\<br>I don\'t even want to press the remainder of the hypothetical, because<br>it\'s simply too silly. But assuming that an amendment was passed that<br>repealed the Second Amendment, the 100 million or so gun owners would<br>probably act much like Australia. When guns were restricted (heavily)<br>through their legislative process, and they instituted a buyback, it\'s<br>estimated that about 250,000 rifles and an unknown number of handguns<br>were left, and still remain today, on the gray market. I\'d expect<br>higher numbers in America. Most of the guns turned in were rusty,<br>unwanted guns that were just sitting in a closet somewhere anyway.\<br>\<br>No \"insurrection\" would take place, because lawful gun owners know<br>that the amendment process worked as it was supposed to, and the vast<br>majority of Americans wanted to get rid of the Second Amendment, so they<br>would accept that they were in the minority. I suspect, though, that<br>they would also be happy remaining *criminals* and retaining their<br>guns.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
