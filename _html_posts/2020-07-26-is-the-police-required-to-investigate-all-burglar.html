<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is the police required to investigate all burglar alarms or are there<br>some neighborhoods where they don\'t have to respond to them?**<br><br>The police are under no specific legal requirement to do anything,<br>except to enforce the law. What does "enforce the law" mean? That means<br>if a person breaks a law, the police ensure that whatever the punishment<br>is that is listed in that law, the person is brought to a judge to see<br>if they will be given that punishment.<br><br>That's it. That's what the police are required to do, by law.<br><br>They do all the rest when they have time, when there aren't shootings<br>and drunk drivers and rioters that they have to deal with. They fill<br>their time answering *calls for service*.<br><br>And with the number of false positives with burglar alarms, the priority<br>for unverified burglar alarms is really low, if they get to it at all.<br><br>Note that priorities in some departments are different. Some departments<br>may classify some alarms differently. But you didn't ask about that, you<br>asked what police are required to do.<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being<br>isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I<br>wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is<br>un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m<br>wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,<br>not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,<br>you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.<br>Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be<br>followed by a block and a mute. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
