<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, preventing someone from driving drunk should never<br>escalate to the point of physical violence. The most physical you should<br>ever get is taking their keys. The police should never be involved.<br><br>Because if the police get involved, they will wait until the drunk<br>person gets behind the wheel, and then arrest the drunk person for DUI.<br>You don't actually have to be "driving" the vehicle before you can be<br>arrested for DUI. But the bottom line is that this "friend" of yours<br>will end up in jail if you get the police involved.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
