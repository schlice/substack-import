<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I just want to say off the bat that I am sorry that people are the way<br>they are. Draw a circle around your feet. You only have power to change<br>everything inside the circle. Anything outside the circle cannot be<br>changed by you.<br><br>To me, the answer to your question is easy. But all too often, we simply<br>don't see it, or we ignore it because it's difficult or we simply don't<br>want to do it.<br><br>**If there is someone in your life who does not treat you the way you<br>deserve to be treated, *remove that person from your life.***<br><br>I have had to remove people from my life, some people who I was very<br>close to over the years, and even some biological family members,<br>because they did not treat me the way a *human being* deserves to be<br>treated. Notice that I distinguish *biological family* from other family<br>members because membership in a family does not need to be biological to<br>be important.<br><br>Humans deserve to be respected as individuals simply because of their<br>humanity.<br><br>If someone fails to do this, they do not *deserve* to be part of your<br>life. Cut them off. Stop calling them. Block them on Facebook. Don't<br>spend time with them.<br><br>Remember, it's not about *punishing them*. It's about *freeing<br>yourself.* Theirs is not an influence you need in your life. Get rid of<br>it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
