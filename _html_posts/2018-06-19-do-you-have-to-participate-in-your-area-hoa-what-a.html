<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you HAVE to participate in your area HOA? What are the penalties<br>for refusing to follow HOA rules?**<br><br>If you purchase a home in a neighborhood controlled by an HOA, you<br>signed the agreement to pay your dues at the same time you signed all<br>the other paperwork to buy your house. Remember that marathon signing<br>session? One of the things you signed was the covenants, which is<br>one of the governing documents for the HOA. The covenants is on file<br>with the City, and becomes part of City charter. It's fully legal,<br>supported by the city, and you're a part of it.<br><br>In short, if you bought a house in a neighborhood with a HOA, you<br>already agreed to participate in it. One of the conditions to buying a<br>house in an area with an HOA is that you agree to being bound by the<br>HOA. It's essentially a contract that you must sign when buying your<br>house.<br><br>Penalties for refusing to follow HOA rules are defined in the governing<br>documents, but they are usually limited to fines. If the HOA owns the<br>streets (i.e. you live in a gated community), the HOA can define rules<br>for parking and if you violate those rules, your car can be booted or<br>towed. If the HOA does not own the streets, punishments for breaking<br>rules governing parking are limited to fines.<br><br>But there's a bigger stick that the HOA has: liens. The HOA has an<br>*ownership interest over your house*, which means that if you fail to<br>pay your fines (and any late fees and attorney's fees which go along<br>with administering those fines), the HOA can place a lien against your<br>house. This means that you can't sell or refinance your house until your<br>lien is paid.<br><br>Even worse, if the HOA decides they have gone long enough without being<br>paid, they can *foreclose on your lien*, which means they take the<br>money they are owed out of the cost of your house when it is sold out<br>from under you.<br><br>So short answer: if you buy a house in an area controlled by an HOA, you<br>must participate in the HOA, and you can be fined if you don't pay your<br>dues, a lien can be put on your house to cover the fines, and they can<br>foreclose on your lien and you can lose your house if you still fail to<br>pay.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
