<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you don\'t like being told what to do, ever, it\'s a nuisance. If you<br>believe that you should be able to do whatever the hell you like with<br>your own property and neighbors be damned, then you\'ll hate HOAs.<br><br>If you like assurance that your neighbor won\'t make his house a pit and<br>kill your property values, it\'s a necessity. If you like lower trash<br>prices than you could ever negotiate on your own, it\'s very nearly a<br>necessity.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
