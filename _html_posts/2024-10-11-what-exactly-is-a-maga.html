<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As a Christian, I know that we are all sinners. We have all fallen short<br>of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). I am no better or worse than Trump in<br>that regard. You said that "\Trump\ is not a good man." But *no one<br>is!* No one is righteous, not one (Romans 3:10).<br><br>Yes, he is a sinner. Yes, he has character flaws. Yes, I would beseech<br>him to seek repentance and forgiveness. But whether or not he does that<br>is between him and his Savior. While I would encourage him to do so, I<br>cannot force him to do so.<br><br>So it wouldn't be right to judge whether or not I should vote for him<br>based on his sins alone, because using that metric, I can't vote for<br>anyone. I could only vote for Jesus, because He is the only person who<br>was ever sinless.<br><br>So if I can't use their level of righteousness to determine whether or<br>not to vote for any one candidate, what do I use?<br><br>I use their potential for positive results for the country. Whose<br>policies will best promote the common good? As a Christian, we should<br>first turn to the Bible for answers.<br><br>> But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and<br>> pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your<br>> welfare. \-- Jeremiah 29:7 ESV<br><br>So it seems that the Bible agrees that we should vote in a way in which<br>we justifiably believe will promote the common good.<br><br>I personally follow the "Least Bad Option" strategy. Since it is quite<br>possible that either candidate will provide some "common good," and<br>neither candidate is perfect, I tend to vote for the candidate who is<br>the "lesser of two evils," which suggests that both candidates might be<br>detrimental to the common good. Nevertheless, I can still vote in good<br>conscience for the less harmful candidate when I am convinced that they<br>possess the necessary qualifications and suitability for the office, and<br>is the most likely to provide good outcomes for the country.<br><br>So yes, as a Christian, I can safely vote for Trump, knowing that his<br>presidency is the most likely to provide good outcomes for the largest<br>majority of the country.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
