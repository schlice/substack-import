An illegal immigrant did. He<br>is solely responsible for her murder.<br><br>But as we always do, we start to look for the *reasons.* Why did he do<br>it? Why was he even in this country? How did he get here? How did we<br>allow him in?<br><br>It's plainly obvious that a contributory factor (not the **proximate<br>cause**) to this murder was the fact that he was an illegal immigrant.<br><br>It's not hard to stretch that fact to the conclusion that tighter<br>immigration laws may have prevented the illegal immigrant from being in<br>the country in the first place.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
