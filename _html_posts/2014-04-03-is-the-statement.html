<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Absolutely true, and is the entire motivation behind the<br/>[[Posse Comitatus Act of<br/>1878](https://www.quora.com/topic/Posse-Comitatus-Act-of-1878)]{.qlink_container},<br/>which was designed to limit the federal government\'s use of federal<br/>military personnel to enforce state law. The Act was updated in 1981,<br/>reaffirming and strengthening it.\<br/>\<br/>The Act is only applicable to the [[United States Armed<br/>Forces](https://www.quora.com/topic/United-States-Armed-Forces)]{.qlink_container}.<br/>It is not applicable to the [[U.S. National<br/>Guard](https://www.quora.com/topic/U-S-National-Guard)]{.qlink_container}<br/>which can enforce state law at the direction of the Governor, nor is it<br/>applicable to the [[U.S. Coast<br/>Guard](https://www.quora.com/topic/U-S-Coast-Guard)]{.qlink_container},<br/>which works for [[U.S. Department of Homeland<br/>Security](https://www.quora.com/topic/U-S-Department-of-Homeland-Security)]{.qlink_container}<br/>(except when transferred to jurisdiction of the [[United States Navy<br/>(USN)](https://www.quora.com/topic/United-States-Navy-USN)]{.qlink_container}<br/>by the<br/>[President(https://www.quora.com/topic/Presidents-of-the-United-States-of-America)]{.qlink_container}<br/>or the [[U.S.<br/>Congress](https://www.quora.com/topic/U-S-Congress-2)]{.qlink_container},<br/>typically during times of war) and has a federal law enforcement role as<br/>well as a federal regulatory agency role.\<br/>\<br/>There is one major exception to this rule, and it is codified in the<br/>Insurrection Act of 1807 (as currently amended). The President can<br/>employ US troops to enforce US law if conditions in the US become such<br/>that states can no longer maintain order over lawlessness. The actual<br/>text reads:\<br/>\<br/>]<br/><br/>&gt; *(1) The President may employ the armed forces, including the National<br/>&gt; Guard in Federal service, to\--*\<br/>&gt; *(A) restore public order and enforce the laws of the United States<br/>&gt; when, as a result of a natural disaster, epidemic, or other serious<br/>&gt; public health emergency, terrorist attack or incident, or other<br/>&gt; condition in any State or possession of the United States, the<br/>&gt; President determines that\--*\<br/>&gt; *(i) domestic violence has occurred to such an extent that the<br/>&gt; constituted authorities of the State or possession are incapable of<br/>&gt; maintaining public order; and*\<br/>&gt; *(ii) such violence results in a condition described in paragraph (2);<br/>&gt; or*\<br/>&gt; *(B) suppress, in a State, any insurrection, domestic violence,<br/>&gt; unlawful combination, or conspiracy if such insurrection, violation,<br/>&gt; combination, or conspiracy results in a condition described in<br/>&gt; paragraph (2).*\<br/>&gt; \<br/>&gt; *(2) A condition described in this paragraph is a condition that\--*\<br/>&gt; *(A) so hinders the execution of the laws of a State or possession, as<br/>&gt; applicable, and of the United States within that State or possession,<br/>&gt; that any part or class of its people is deprived of a right,<br/>&gt; privilege, immunity, or protection named in the Constitution and<br/>&gt; secured by law, and the constituted authorities of that State or<br/>&gt; possession are unable, fail, or refuse to protect that right,<br/>&gt; privilege, or immunity, or to give that protection; or*\<br/>&gt; *(B) opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United<br/>&gt; States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.*<br/><br/>\<br/>The Act is very clear as to what conditions can constitute the use of<br/>the military within the borders of the United States. I would also<br/>venture to guess (being a former military officer myself) that you\'d<br/>find quite a few more [[conscientious<br/>objectors](https://www.quora.com/topic/Conscientious-Objection)]{.qlink_container}<br/>should the military be ordered to fire against US citizens.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
