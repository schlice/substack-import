<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can a veteran legally own an M-16, and if not, what is the closest<br>thing they can legally own?**<br><br>Since you're asking about a veteran, let's assume you are asking if a<br>veteran can own a military-version M-16 capable of full auto or 3-round<br>burst as in the A2 version.<br><br>Yes, anyone who is a US citizen and not a convicted felon or an<br>adjudicated mental defective can own a firearm, including a<br>fully-automatic M-16. There are certainly more strict licensing and<br>background checking requirements to own fully automatic firearms, and<br>there may be some state-level restrictions on their ownership, but it is<br>possible.<br><br>Because the supply to civilians was artificially limited, their price is<br>very high. A fully-transferrable M-16 will cost you well over \$10,000,<br>and that doesn't include the cost of the \$200 tax stamp to do the<br>transfer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
