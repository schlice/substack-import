<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does is matter to conservatives that Brett Kavanaugh told many<br>provable lies to the Senate Judiciary Committee?**<br><br>It doesn't matter whether Conservatives care about lies Kavanaugh may<br>have told. Or even if you can prove that it's untrue.<br><br>It only matters to Congress.<br><br>In the case of lying to Congress, there are two separate crimes we can<br>discuss: "knowingly and willfully giving materially false statements to<br>Congress" which does not need to be done under oath, and a general<br>"perjury (lying under oath)" charge.<br><br>In either case, while you may be able to prove that "an untruth was<br>spoken," the actual crime of lying to Congress is really difficult to<br>prove. First, you have to prove that the lie was "knowingly and<br>willfully" given. This means that the alleged liar knew the right<br>answer, and intentionally gave a false answer with the intent to derail<br>an investigation or to mislead the Congress. That intent statement kinda<br>ruins most of the "lying" accusations, because most of the things<br>Kavanaugh has, of late, been accused of lying about have not been done<br>with the intent of misleading Congress, they're just factually<br>incorrect. Then, on top of that, the "materiality" portion of the law<br>kicks in. The statement has to be materially important to why Congress<br>has you testifying in the first place; it can't just be an untruth which<br>was "accidentally" given, or was a "mistake" in fact, in any ancillary<br>statement throughout the testimony. It actually has to be part of what<br>Congress was primarily investigating with the testimony.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
