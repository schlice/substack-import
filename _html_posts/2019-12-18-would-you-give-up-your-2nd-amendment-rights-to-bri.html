<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would you give up your 2nd amendment rights to bring back one police<br>officer killed in the line of duty?**<br><br>Nice, a clever twist on the "[[false<br>dilemma](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5c946b&url=https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/black-or-white){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="yourlogicalfallacyis.com"}]{.qlink_container}" logical<br>fallacy intermixed with the "[[false<br>equivalence](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=22885e&url=https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/false-cause){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="yourlogicalfallacyis.com"}]{.qlink_container}" logical<br>fallacy.<br><br>The False Dilemma: If you don't give up your rights, you're a monster<br>because you don't want to bring dead cops back to life. If you do vote<br>to bring dead cops back to life, the Second Amendment is meaningless<br>because you don't choose to fight for it.<br><br>The False Equivalence: You presume by your question that giving up your<br>2nd Amendment rights will somehow mean that cops won't get killed by<br>criminals, when there is no such equivalence.<br><br>Your question is loaded with logical fallacies, which makes it<br>unanswerable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
