<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: <br/><br/>From the [[National MS<br/>Society](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3512f2&amp;url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms/Cognitive-Changes){.external_link<br/>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br/>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br/>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}:<br/><br/>&gt; Cognitive changes are common in people with MS --- approximately half<br/>&gt; of all people with MS will develop problems with cognition. Cognition<br/>&gt; refers to a range of high-level brain functions, including the ability<br/>&gt; to learn and remember information; organize, plan and problem-solve;<br/>&gt; focus, maintain and shift attention as necessary; understand and use<br/>&gt; language; accurately perceive the environment; and perform<br/>&gt; calculations. In MS, certain functions are more likely to be affected<br/>&gt; than others:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Memory (acquiring, retaining and retrieving new information)<br/>&gt; - Attention and concentration (particularly divided attention)<br/>&gt; - Information processing (dealing with information gathered by the<br/>&gt;   five senses)<br/>&gt; - Executive functions (planning and prioritizing)<br/>&gt; - Visuospatial functions (visual perception and constructional<br/>&gt;   abilities)<br/>&gt; - Verbal fluency (word-finding)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Certain functions are likely to remain intact:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - General intellect<br/>&gt; - Long-term (remote) memory<br/>&gt; - Conversational skill<br/>&gt; - Reading comprehension<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; A person may experience difficulties in only one or two areas of<br/>&gt; cognitive functioning or in several. Only 5-10 percent of people with<br/>&gt; MS develop problems severe enough to interfere significantly with<br/>&gt; everyday activities. In very rare instances, cognitive dysfunction may<br/>&gt; become so severe that the person can no longer be cared for at home.<br/><br/>Further,<br/><br/>&gt; Cognitive problems are only weakly related to other disease<br/>&gt; characteristics --- meaning that a person with almost no physical<br/>&gt; limitations can have significant cognitive impairment, while a person<br/>&gt; who is quite disabled physically can be unaffected cognitively.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; - Changes can occur at any time --- even as a first symptom of MS ---<br/>&gt;   but are more common later in the disease.<br/>&gt; - Cognitive function correlates with number of lesions and lesion area<br/>&gt;   on MRI, as well as brain atrophy.<br/>&gt; - Cognitive dysfunction can occur with any disease course, but is<br/>&gt;   slightly more likely in progressive MS.<br/>&gt; - Being in an exacerbation is a risk factor for cognitive dysfunction.<br/>&gt; - Cognitive changes generally progress slowly but are unlikely to<br/>&gt;   improve dramatically once they have begun.<br/><br/>IQ tests are designed to test \"intelligence.\" Since \"intelligence\"<br/>is defined as \"one\'s capacity for logic, abstract thought,<br/>understanding, self-awareness, communication, learning, emotional<br/>knowledge, memory, planning, and problem solving\"<br/>\[1\](#EkXFL){#cite-EkXFL .citation_link}, and MS can affect all of<br/>those, by extension, MS can alter IQ.<br/><br/>Footnotes<br/><br/>\[1\](#cite-EkXFL){.citation_index} [[Intelligence -<br/>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f27487&amp;url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence){.external_link<br/>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br/>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br/>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
