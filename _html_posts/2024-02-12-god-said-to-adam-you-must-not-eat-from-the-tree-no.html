<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's go step by step and see if we can answer these questions.<br><br>First, God told Adam that he should not eat of the fruit from the tree.<br>God didn't say anything about not touching it.<br><br>> And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, "You may surely eat of<br>> every tree of the garden, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and<br>> evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall<br>> surely die." --- Genesis 2:16--17 ESV<br><br>*When Eve explained to the serpent what God had commanded, however,* she<br>included the "or not touch it."<br><br>> He said to the woman, "Did God actually say, 'You shall not eat of any<br>> tree in the garden'?" And the woman said to the serpent, "We may eat<br>> of the fruit of the trees in the garden, but God said, 'You shall not<br>> eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden,<br>> neither shall you touch it, lest you die.'" --- Genesis 3:1--3 ESV<br>> (emphasis mine)<br><br>So right there, as Eve was talking to the serpent, the serpent knew that<br>Eve didn't have a complete understanding of God's command. That left the<br>serpent an opening that he could use to confuse and tempt Eve, which he<br>did to full effect.<br><br>But the "death" they were discussing in the Garden was a little more<br>nuanced. In order to understand this, we need to understand how the word<br>"death" is being used in a given context. The physical death (or the<br>first death) is simply the end of a human being\'s life, whether through<br>age, disease, accident, or violence. The breath of life leaves the<br>person, consciousness ceases, and the body begins to decay. This is the<br>fate of all human beings.<br><br>But the Bible also uses death to describe the spiritual state of<br>people who are undoubtedly physically alive.<br><br>> Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death<br>> through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned ---<br>> Romans 5:12 ESV<br><br>The death that entered the world through Adam\'s sin was *not*<br>physical death. Adam was a flesh-and-blood human being, so his body<br>was naturally subject to entropy. The fact that he was created as flesh<br>meant that, at some point, his heart would stop, and the breath of life<br>would leave. Even if he had lived a sinless life, he still would have<br>died when his body ceased to function. Adam was never immortal; he<br>needed to eat of the Tree of Life to live forever:<br><br>> Then the Lord God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us in<br>> knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also<br>> of the tree of life and eat, and live forever" --- Genesis 3:22 ESV<br><br>When Adam sinned, he immediately entered a state of spiritual---not<br>physical---death, which contributed to the foundation of Satan\'s<br>deception that life continues after sin.<br><br>As it remains today, Satan\'s treachery was effective and destructive<br>because, like Adam, we typically live on---physically---after sinning.<br>While Adam\'s physical death was a foregone conclusion due to his being<br>fleshly, it was not the death that entered the world through his sin.<br>Instead, spiritual death entered the world at that point and spread to<br>all of his offspring. His sin destroyed the union mankind had with God,<br>without which there is no life:<br><br>> Behold, all souls are mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul<br>> of the son is mine: the soul who sins shall die. --- Ezekiel 18:4 ESV<br>><br>> The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity<br>> of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son. The<br>> righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the<br>> wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself. --- Ezekiel 18:20 ESV<br>><br>> Behold, the Lord\'s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save,\<br>> or his ear dull, that it cannot hear;\<br>> but your iniquities have made a separation\<br>> between you and your God,\<br>> and your sins have hidden his face from you\<br>> so that he does not hear. --- Isaiah 59:1--2 ESV<br><br>Accordingly, separated from God, mankind has no future beyond physical<br>death unless God acts. The wages of sin is eternal death, and there will<br>not be everlasting life unless God gives it as a gift.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
