<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Who do you report a police dispatcher to if they\'ve got an attitude<br>with a caller on a non-emergency number, and could they be tracked<br>through a phone call made to them?**<br><br>Depends on where you made your call.<br><br>Some dispatchers work for the police department. Others work for a<br>regional 911 authority, especially when the 911 service covers multiple<br>departments and jurisdictions. Here in Colorado Springs, our 911 system<br>is run by a [[regional 911<br>authority](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cdd2b9&url=http://elpasoteller911.org/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="elpasoteller911.org"}]{.qlink_container}, as we have seven<br>call centers which cover two counties, six police departments and<br>sheriff's offices, five fire districts, and four military installations.<br><br>You'll have to do an Internet search for 911 in your area, and you'll<br>usually be able to find information on who runs your local 911 service.<br>As an alternative, you can call your police department's<br>non-emergency line (it should be on your city's website or, if you<br>still have one, the blue pages of your local phone book) and ask them<br>who runs your local 911 service.<br><br>Once you've found the agency which runs your local 911 service, you'll<br>want to talk to a supervisor and inform them you'd like to make a<br>complaint. You can absolutely track your 911 call based on your phone<br>number and the date (and approximate time) you called. During most 911<br>calls, you provide your number. This is primarily for call-back purposes<br>in case you get disconnected before the natural end of the call.<br>However, the number is recorded in the notes for the call, and so you<br>can use the number to locate the call, and thus locate the operator.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
