<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How do I unlock the SIM lock code on my SIM card and phone?<br><br>If you get a message that states your SIM card is locked, you will need<br>your Personal Unlocking Key (PUK) which is unique to your SIM card. Your<br>carrier will have this information in their Support section on their<br>website. Just go to your carrier's website and search for "SIM card<br>lock" and you should find where you can look in your online account (if<br>you have one) for your PUK. Your carrier's website should also have<br>detailed instructions for how to unlock your SIM card.<br><br>If you need any help with this, contact your carrier's Customer Service<br>department directly. You can get there directly by dialing 611 on your<br>phone, but I recommend finding their toll-free number and dialing it<br>from another phone, so you can work on yours while you speak to them.<br><br>If you are talking about "carrier-locks," where your phone is locked to<br>your carrier, whether or not you can unlock depends on whether or not<br>you have paid off your phone. Once you have paid off your phone (if you<br>have an equipment installment plan with your carrier), your carrier will<br>give you information on how to unlock your phone. Once it is unlocked,<br>you can use any compatible SIM card from any carrier in your phone.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
