<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>"Feeling like a tomboy" does not make you a boy. You're still a girl,<br>who likes to do things which were traditionally part of what boys do.<br><br>Note that you're claiming you shouldn't be put into a traditional gender<br>box, but your argument is that you "feel like a tomboy," which means<br>that you identify with things that are traditionally gender-based.<br><br>Your own argument is self-defeating.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
