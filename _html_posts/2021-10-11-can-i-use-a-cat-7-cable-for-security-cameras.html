<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is: yes you can, but you don't need it.<br><br>CAT 7 cable has a few unique features, like being one of the first<br>cables to offer 10 GB/sec speed up to 100 meters. At the time of its<br>development, it was faster than anything else.<br><br>But CAT 7 cables are proprietary. They don't use traditional<br>Ethernet cable headers. They use a GG45 connecter, which is proprietary.<br>And while there is backwards compatibility with RJ45, those connecters<br>are hard to come by.<br><br>In fact, the proprietary nature of CAT 7 cables was what drove the<br>development of the nearly-equally-performing CAT 6a cable. Yes, that<br>means that CAT 6a cable is actually newer than CAT 7, but as you can<br>see, people look at the two and think that CAT 7 must be newer even<br>though it is not.<br><br>So in short, you probably don't need CAT 7. For most installations, you<br>can use CAT 6a, or even CAT 8 cable if you need it.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can I use a CAT 7 cable for security cameras?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
