<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How do I contact the police to hold an event for them?<br><br>I suggest you contact the department's public affairs office. That<br>number should be available in the phone book, but if not, call the main<br>switchboard number for the department and ask for public affairs. That<br>number is definitely in the phone book.<br><br>Please do not call 911 for this. I know, you shouldn't have to say that,<br>but actually you do. Some people...<br><br>Anyway, public affairs should most definitely be able to assist you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
