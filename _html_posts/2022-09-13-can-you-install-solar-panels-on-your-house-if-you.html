<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The short answer to all legal questions is "it depends."<br><br>And in this case, whether or not your HOA can block the installation of<br>solar on your house depends on what state you live in.<br><br>Arizona, California, Colorado, DC, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho,<br>Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,<br>Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, Utah,<br>Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin have what are<br>known as "solar rights laws." These states have passed laws which<br>specify that the HOA cannot block your installation of solar. The<br>HOA can make changes to a solar install, but they cannot block it<br>outright. For example, if you want to install a freestanding solar<br>array, the HOA can tell you that you must install it on the roof<br>instead. As another example, the Illinois law says that the HOA can<br>relocate your array, so long as the new location does not reduce the<br>expected electricity production by more than 10%.<br><br>Some other states have no laws regarding solar whatsoever. Alabama,<br>Arkansas, Connecticut, Michigan, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania,<br>South Carolina, South Dakota and Wyoming have no laws at all regarding<br>solar. If your HOA denies your request, you're pretty much out of luck<br>in those states.<br><br>All of the remaining states have "solar easement" laws, which allow you<br>to enter into voluntary agreements with your neighbors specifying that<br>you have access to a certain amount of sunlight. This is important in<br>heavily wooded areas, or areas which will grow to become heavily wooded.<br>Once you have a solar easement agreement in place, it stays with the<br>property, so future property owners would be guaranteed the same right<br>to sunlight as you are.<br><br>So if you live in a state which allows you to get solar, follow your<br>HOA's process for exterior changes, and then you're good to go!<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can you install solar panels on your house if you live in a homeowner<br>association (HOA) community?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
