title: '"Someone please help. I am a born again christian of about 8 months. I was
  RADICALLY saved and experienced a profound spiritual transformation. I was delivered
  and had multiple encounters with God. I was on top of the world, full of love joy
  peace etc.. wanting to serve God and was starting to become more and more vocal
  about it. I felt I had produced all the fruit of the spirit to some degree. My spiritual
  eyes had been completely opened and I had a deep sense of right and wrong with very
  strong conviction. Despite this I STILL went back to my ex partner (I broke up with
  him because he does not believe in Jesus, and even insults him regularly). I slept
  with him multiple times in full blatant disrespect and disregard for everything
  God had done in my life.. even though I felt God had produced in me the self control
  to say no and avoid the situation. I STILL did it. I have now repented once and
  for all but it feels like I took too long to do it because now I am so consumed
  with fear and guilt and have absolutely no peace, I have lost 5kg in one week because
  I can"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We are all sinners. No one is righteous, not one.<br><br>> As it is written:<br>><br>> "There is no one righteous, not even one;\<br>> there is no one who understands;\<br>> there is no one who seeks God.\<br>> All have turned away,\<br>> they have together become worthless;\<br>> there is no one who does good,\<br>> not even one." --- Romans 3:10--12 NIV<br><br>All believers have the best intentions. But we fail. We fail because<br>we're human, and we still have human frailty, and we still live in a<br>fallen world, in sinful bodies.<br><br>Paul talked about this in his letter to the Romans. He struggled with<br>exactly what you're feeling now:<br><br>> I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but<br>> what I hate I do. And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that<br>> the law is good. As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it<br>> is sin living in me. For I know that good itself does not dwell in me,<br>> that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is<br>> good, but I cannot carry it out. For I do not do the good I want to<br>> do, but the evil I do not want to do---this I keep on doing. Now if I<br>> do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is<br>> sin living in me that does it. --- Romans 7:15--20 NIV<br><br>Verse 20 is really important: " Now if I do what I do not want to do, it<br>is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it." It's<br>not me who is doing it, but the sin that lives within me. We're all<br>sinners. The sin lives within all of us.<br><br>Don't beat yourself up over it. Recognize it, repent of it, and ask God<br>to give you the strength to resist. Over time, it will get easier and<br>easier to resist. But remember, we will still fail.<br><br>Hang in there. God isn't going to give up on you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
