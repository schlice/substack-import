<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [The *legality* of food found in your fridge is not<br/>necessarily what I would question. The *safety* and *origin* of such<br/>food would probably be of a higher concern.\<br/>\<br/>I would think the rules of etiquette would have you advise the third<br/>party that they left something in your fridge and that if they didn\'t<br/>come back for it you were going to eat it.\<br/>\<br/>I think there aren\'t really legal issues unless this item in your<br/>fridge was of particularly high value (i.e. Beluga caviar or<br/>Cristal).]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
