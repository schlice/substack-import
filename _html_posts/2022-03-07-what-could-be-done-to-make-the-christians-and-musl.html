<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We need to end the war on truth.<br><br>Our postmodern culture has really twisted the idea of truth. They say<br>that there is no such thing as absolute truth, and that truth is<br>relative. They say pithy little sayings like "my truth," usually in a<br>sentence like, "I'm speaking my truth." These days, these ideas are<br>hailed as progressive and enlightened.<br><br>But the religious among us (Christians and Muslims alike) know that<br>there *is* absolute truth, and it *can* be known. We know that two<br>contradictory things cannot both be true at the same time.<br><br>Getting along is what we call "tolerance." Tolerance means treating<br>people who have different ideas with respect and civility. But the<br>postmodernists in society treat tolerance as affirming that<br>contradictory ideas are both valid, and this doesn't really make sense.<br><br>For example, I can believe that Christianity is the one true religion,<br>and I can still respect my Muslim brothers and sisters, and treat them<br>with civility. And it's also important to note that Christianity is not<br>the only religion which makes truth claims. All major religions make<br>these types of claims. Most of the central beliefs of these religions<br>simply cannot be reconciled. For example, Islam teaches that Jesus<br>Christ was a prophet, not a deity. But if Jesus was only a prophet, he<br>couldn't have been a very good one, because he claimed to be God. If he<br>wasn't really God, then he was either a liar or he was insane. Neither<br>of those make him a very good prophet, or teacher.<br><br>TL;DR: Regardless of our differences in beliefs, it doesn't mean we<br>can't be civil. It just means that we have different beliefs. Tolerance<br>means treating others with respect. It doesn't mean we have to reconcile<br>all of our beliefs, as most of them are irreconcilable.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What could be done to make the Christians and Muslims get along? How<br>would they found out the real prophet between the Christ and Muhammed?<br>Please elaborate on your answers üôè. Note: I asked to seek knowledge not<br>to be attacked.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
