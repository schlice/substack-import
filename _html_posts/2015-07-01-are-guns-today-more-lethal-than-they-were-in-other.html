<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Of course, it\'s fair to say that guns have advanced<br>technologically over the years. Everything has.\<br>\<br>If anything, though, the gun is now far more accurate, and so is less<br>likely to injure someone other than the intended target.\<br>\<br>The rallying cry of \"guns are technologically more advanced, let\'s get<br>rid of them\" is disingenuous and logically sloppy. Many things are more<br>technologically advanced than they were just a few years ago, yet there<br>is no rallying cry to ban anything else that I am aware of. The gun<br>simply performs its job better. That\'s not a reason to ban it. Guns are<br>still the best tool to use to stop a human threat. Nothing else provides<br>the level of certainty that the threat will be stopped like a gun.\<br>\<br>Now, if you want to argue that we shouldn\'t be allowed to use a gun to<br>stop a threat, then argue that. But this argument holds no logical<br>water.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
