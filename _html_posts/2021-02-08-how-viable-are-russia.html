<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How viable are Russia's new bullet proof combat suits?<br><br>[[Russia is building a futuristic combat suit it claims can stop .50<br>caliber<br>bullets](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a91dbd&url=https://taskandpurpose.com/military-tech/russia-sotnik-combat-armor-development/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="taskandpurpose.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Considering that they are building off of a platform that they have been<br>developing for decades and is already battle-tested to stop a 7.62 NATO<br>round, it's certainly possible that they could, within the next decade,<br>*improve* their current battle armor such that it will stop a .50 BMG<br>round.<br><br>There are always trade-offs when you employ armor. Mobility is one of<br>them, and thermal issues (both hot and cold) are the other. The US<br>military has been working on exoskeletons which allow their troops to<br>move more and carry heavier loads, and their armor solutions have been<br>lagging way behind. But if they can perfect the heavy lifting<br>capabilities of an exoskeleton, attaching armor to it would be trivial,<br>and it could easily handle the additional weight without tiring out the<br>soldier. Then you can include additional components like heads-up<br>displays and personal environmental control systems.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
