<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The difference is consciousness.\<br>\<br>The fly exists fulfilling unthought primal urges. Eat. Avoid being<br>eaten. Make baby flies. Repeat. The fly does not \"think,\" it just<br>\"does.\" It therefore has no awareness of self. It is alive because of<br>the definition of life. But it is not \"alive.\"\<br>\<br>The man has consciousness; he is aware of his existence. Because of this<br>awareness, he now understands that he is \"alive,\" and that at some<br>point in the future he will not be. Therefore, his life must derive some<br>meaning beyond that of the fly, so he examines his life searching for<br>meaning. He says, \"The unexamined life is not worth living.\"<br>(Specifically, Socrates said that, but I digress). He therefore is the<br>only creature that must define meaning from life. William Hazlitt<br>(another man) said, \"Man is the only animal that laughs and weeps, for<br>he is the only animal that is struck with the difference between what<br>things are and what they ought to be.\" And George Eliot (yet another<br>man) said, \"It is never too late to be who you might have been.\"<br>Finally, John Ruskin (yep, another man) said, \"The highest reward for a<br>man\'s toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it.\"\<br>\<br>These men sought to understand why they were alive, and somehow create,<br>and thus derive, some meaning from their lives.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
