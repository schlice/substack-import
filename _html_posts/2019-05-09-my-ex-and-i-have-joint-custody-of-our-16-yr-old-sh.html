<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My ex and I have joint custody of our 16 yr old. She lives with him.<br>He lets her drive alone with only a permit that she\'s had for a month.<br>Can I be held liable if she has an accident?**<br><br>The answer to that is "it depends."<br><br>Liability insurance typically follows the driver, and<br>comprehensive/collision insurance follows the car. In a joint custody<br>arrangement, the parent who has more visitation, especially during<br>school months, typically carries the child on their policy.<br><br>To that end, financial responsibility for a driver with a GDL (graduated<br>driver's license) will be with the parent who has that driver on their<br>policy. If that policyholder did not follow the rules when it comes to<br>their teen driver, that insurance company could increase that parent's<br>rates, or could potentially drop them from coverage. This is true<br>whether or not the child got into an accident; if the child is stopped<br>by the police and they are found to not be in compliance with the GDL<br>law, insurance can still act.<br><br>If the child gets into an accident and their GDL doesn't allow them to<br>be driving without an adult, the child will be fined and will likely<br>lose her license for a period of time. Additionally, if someone is hurt<br>in the accident, the child could be labeled as a "youthful offender"<br>under the juvenile justice system and could face probation, mandatory<br>court-ordered counseling, community service, or even juvenile detention.<br>The child's guardian at the time of the incident could also face<br>punishment, especially if that guardian was supposed to be in the car at<br>the time.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
