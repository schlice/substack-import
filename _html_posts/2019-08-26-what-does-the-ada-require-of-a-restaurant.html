Designated spots should be on a level<br>> surface with a slope of 2 percent or less. There must be at least one<br>> accessible parking spot for every 25 parking spaces in a restaurant's<br>> lot. Additionally, at least one in every eight accessible parking<br>> spaces needs to have an access aisle that is at least 8 feet wide so<br>> it is accessible for those with vans. A restaurant should place its<br>> accessible spaces in the location nearest its accessible entrances.<br>><br>> Travel Routes to the Restaurant<br>><br>> A restaurant must provide at least one travel route that is accessible<br>> for those who wish to access the eatery from parking spaces, public<br>> transportation stops, public streets or a passenger-loading zone.<br>> Passenger loading zones ought to be parallel to a vehicle pull-up<br>> space and be at least 60 inches in width and 20 feet in length. If<br>> there are any curbs on a travel route, a restaurant must also provide<br>> a curb ramp that is at least 36 inches wide, not counting any flared<br>> sides, and have a slope of 2 percent or less.<br>><br>> Restaurant Ramps<br>><br>> If a restaurant provides a ramp for its disabled patrons, the maximum<br>> slop must be 1:12 or less. Ramps have to be at least 36 inches wide<br>> with a minimum landing length of 60 inches. If a ramp is longer than 6<br>> feet, it must have a handrail on either side that measure 34 to 38<br>> inches in height.<br>><br>> Entrances<br>><br>> If the entrance to a restaurant has stairs to the dining room, it must<br>> also provide a ramp, a lift or an alternate, accessible entrance.<br>> Accessible restaurant doors are those that provide a 32-inch opening.<br>> In the case of a double door, at least one of the doors should provide<br>> a 32-inch opening. There must be at least 18 inches of clear wall<br>> space when an individual must pull on the door to enter or exit the<br>> restaurant or a room within it. Moreover, an individual ought to be<br>> able to open or close a door with a closed fist. Beveled edges in the<br>> door must not measure more than 0.75 inches, and a threshold edge must<br>> be 0.25 inches or less.<br>><br>> Seats, Tables and Counters<br>><br>> The aisles between fixed seats must be at least 36 inches wide, and<br>> restaurants should provide wheelchair accessible seats throughout the<br>> dining room. To accommodate those in wheelchairs, tabletops and<br>> counters need to measure 28 to 34 inches in height. Under the table, a<br>> restaurant must provide knee room that is at least 30 inches wide, 27<br>> inches high and 19 inches deep. Cashier and food-ordering counters<br>> must be 36 inches tall or less or have a space on the side where<br>> restaurant staff can assist customers or pass food to a customer who<br>> cannot reach over the counter.\[1\](#lquLH){#cite-lquLH<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.
