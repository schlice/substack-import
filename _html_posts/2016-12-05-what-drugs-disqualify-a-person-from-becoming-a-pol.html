<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The short answer: recent ones. If anything comes up on your drug panel<br>when you get your inprocessing physical, you're gone.<br><br>The longer answer: every department has its own limitations. Also, every<br>department understands that people are human, and that college-age kids<br>experiment. Heck, President Clinton smoked pot (but he didn't<br>inhale...yeah right).<br><br>If you tried basic rec drugs as a kid, but you did what the vast<br>majority of normal people do and never touch the stuff again, you should<br>be fine.<br><br>If you were using anything illegal last week, you're pretty much not<br>going to get in.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
