<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it the cell phone's fault that you practice distracted driving? Why<br>do we always look to technology to handle people problems?<br><br>We already have plenty of laws against distracted driving (yet we still<br>felt compelled to pass a new law against a particular kind of<br>distraction, but hey, I'm not a legislator). Do we need a new<br>technological solution to fight a people problem?<br><br>And even if we do, you still have to use it in order for it to do<br>any good.<br><br>*"Loss of phone privileges?"* How about loss of car privileges? Oh<br>wait, we already have that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
