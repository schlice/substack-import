<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The decades worth of psychological studies of rapes have<br>found them not motivated by sex at all. They are motivated by the<br>rapist\'s desire for power and control. They want to totally dominate<br>and control someone so fully that they can take the most precious and<br>closely guarded act (the sex act) and control that too. It\'s a need for<br>control, and to control whether or not someone has sex is complete and<br>total dominance.\<br>\<br>EDIT: I wouldn\'t use Wikipedia as my definitive source for decades<br>worth of psychological studies. Maybe I should write my own Wikipedia<br>page and then you can quote me as authoritatively as you do other Wiki<br>authors.\<br>\<br>The truth is that studies don\'t lie, and decades worth of studies have<br>shown and re-proven that rape is motivated by control and lust, but lust<br>for power, not sex.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
