<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think you need to define what you mean by "bigotry."<br><br>Bigotry, as far as I am aware, is defined as "obstinate or unreasonable<br>attachment to a belief, opinion, or faction, in particular **prejudice<br>against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a<br>particular group**." I don't see this as the primary motivator for<br>people who discuss Catholicism from the outside in. I simply see it as a<br>lack of good communication.<br><br>Christian apologists have a fine line to walk. We have to show that<br>Catholic beliefs are unbiblical while still honoring the Catholic's<br>freedom to believe exactly as they choose to believe, as well as making<br>sure that our message does not come across as "you're a bad person for<br>believing this." Unfortunately, anyone who has their personal and<br>deeply-held beliefs questioned feels defensive, so it could be easily<br>*perceived* as bigoted. And that's a difficult message to deliver. And<br>with our current communication platforms, it's really difficult to<br>deliver that message in a way which conveys a message of honoring Christ<br>and shepherding believers to correct, Biblically-based belief. People<br>online are too quick to point to others and say "your belief is<br>unbiblical" without explaining "but you are not a bad person for<br>believing it" and it just comes across as bigoted.<br><br>Finally, the issue may be that we are commanded to spread the Gospel<br>message, but the vast majority of people implementing that command don't<br>know how to properly do it. This makes it even more difficult for those<br>of us who do.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
