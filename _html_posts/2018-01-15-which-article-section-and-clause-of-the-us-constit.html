<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>[[Steve<br>Dutch](https://www.quora.com/profile/Steve-Dutch)]{.qlink_container}<br>says that it's the Commerce Clause, but the answer is slightly more<br>nuanced than just that.<br><br>Until the early 20th century, states had the legal authority to police<br>themselves as they saw fit, and laws typically existed at a state level,<br>with federal authority only extending to interstate activity. However,<br>after the New Deal, case law started emerging which stated that<br>"intrastate" commerce which "affected interstate commerce" could be<br>regulated by the Federal government, and by the end of the civil rights<br>movement of the 60s, case law emerged which basically allowed the<br>federal government to control social policy in the states. Today, most<br>state laws are subject to this new notion of federal preemption, with<br>the exception of some 10th Amendment exceptions which came out of the<br>Rehnquist SCOTUS.<br><br>The Controlled Substances Act uses this same idea of federal preemption<br>and the new interpretation of the Commerce Clause, stating that drug<br>control is a "national" problem which requires federal oversight.<br><br>Most states have enacted their own versions of the Controlled Substances<br>Act, basically voluntarily integrating their own drug policies into the<br>federal one. Whether or not a state can similarly voluntarily choose to<br>not integrate their state's laws into the federal statute is still a<br>question which has yet to be decided.<br><br>With Trump reversing the Obama-era policy directing US Attorneys to not<br>prosecute state-level Federal drug offenses, this question may soon come<br>to the fore.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
