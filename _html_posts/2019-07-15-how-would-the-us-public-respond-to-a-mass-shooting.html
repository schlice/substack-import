<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How would the US public respond to a mass shooting by the military of<br>those civilians storming Area 51?**<br><br>Oh, there will be plenty of outrage. But it won't change a thing.<br><br>Make no mistake, the security of our classified assets is no joke.<br>Defying orders of military police tasked with protecting these<br>facilities can indeed lead to getting yourself shot. Anyone thinking of<br>storming Area 51 must understand that they place their own life in their<br>hands.<br><br>But I can tell you, *it will never get to that point.*<br><br>No one will be able to get *anywhere near* Area 51. Doesn't matter how<br>many of them are there.<br><br>There is a buffer zone around the facility, patrolled routinely by<br>military contractors. Anyone approaching the buffer zone will be dealt<br>with by the local sheriff. I think the sheriff's office will be able to<br>deter the largest majority of civilians before they ever breach the<br>outer border.<br><br>Beyond the buffer zone, it is even classified if, and how many, people<br>have been killed by the military. We probably ought not to think about<br>that kind of stuff. Because I'm sure it won't get to that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
