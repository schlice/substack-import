<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The atheist, upon taking the stand, need only advise the judge that they<br>do not wish to swear. Witnesses are permitted to *affirm* rather than<br>swear. A typical affirmation used in U.S. District Courts would sound<br>like this:<br><br>> You do affirm that all the testimony you are about to give in the case<br>> now before the court will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing<br>> but the truth; this you do affirm under the pains and penalties of<br>> perjury?<br><br>Raising the right hand is not swearing, it actually is a practice which<br>goes back hundreds of years. Back in early England, criminals would get<br>their hands branded following a conviction. Thus, when in court, they<br>raise the right hand to prove that they have no brand; if they did, the<br>court would not be so lenient with the person.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
