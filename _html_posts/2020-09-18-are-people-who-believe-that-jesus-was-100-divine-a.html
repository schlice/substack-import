<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Are people who believe that Jesus was 100% divine and 0% human<br>damned?**<br><br>No, they're just misinformed.<br><br>But I'd ask them what exactly they believe. Christians believe that<br>Jesus was born, lived, and died, and was raised back to life on the<br>third day, conquering death. This death and resurrection paid for our<br>sin and paved the way for us to enter heaven.<br><br>I guess I have a question: *if Jesus was 100% divine, how did he die?*<br><br>He had to be born as a man. He wanted to feel what we feel. He wanted to<br>live as we live. He needed to do this in order to redeem us. He wouldn't<br>have been able to be a perfect vessel for our sin if he didn't come to<br>earth and live a perfect life without sin.<br><br>In other words, *Jesus had to be born as human in order to fulfill his<br>destiny.*<br><br>If Jesus wasn't human, how was he able to die for our sins?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
