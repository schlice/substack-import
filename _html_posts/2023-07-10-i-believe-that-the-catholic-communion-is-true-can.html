<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No.<br><br>According to the rules and guidelines from the Catholic Church, only<br>baptized Catholics are eligible to receive Communion. Non-Catholics can<br>come to as many Catholic Masses as they want, but they can\'t receive<br>Holy Communion in the Catholic Church until they become Catholic.<br><br>To receive the Eucharist, one must believe that Jesus is truly present<br>under the appearances of bread and wine, and must also be in communion<br>with the Catholic Church. Non-practicing Catholics who have negligently<br>not attended Mass or who have abandoned the teachings of the Church are<br>not in a state of grace and cannot receive Holy Communion.<br><br>Protestants can receive Holy Communion only in extreme circumstances,<br>such as when they are on their deathbeds.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
