Untreated, RRMS transitions to SPMS within 10 years. We know<br>that using the MS therapy drugs extends that time. We don't know exactly<br>how much the drugs extend that time.<br><br>Also considering that MS is usually diagnosed between ages 20 and 40,<br>that would mean this woman is between 50 and 70 right now, which also<br>means that she was able to hold off the SPMS for the majority of her<br>childbearing years, meaning that quality of life during that time was<br>pretty good.<br><br>With new medicines being approved all the time, I think she's in great<br>shape for the future.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
