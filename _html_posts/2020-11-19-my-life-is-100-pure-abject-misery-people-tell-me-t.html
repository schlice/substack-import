<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My life is 100%, pure, abject misery. People tell me that God has a<br>blessed plan for my life. Am I justified in punching them in the face?**<br><br>I know, right? Who the heck are they to say that some God somewhere has<br>a great plan for me, when my life is nothing but sadness and misery? Is<br>this the "great plan" he has for me? To live in misery? What a joke!<br><br>I will tell you that punching them in the face, while offering some<br>temporary relief for your frustration, won't make you any less<br>miserable, and may actually lead to *more* misery (i.e. you might get<br>the shit beat out of you and/or you might land yourself in jail).<br><br>But let me ask you a question: *just because God has a plan for you,<br>where did you get the idea that this plan involved you being happy? Do<br>you know what his plan for you is?*<br><br>Because I certainly don't. None of us do.<br><br>So let's ask another question: *Where did anyone, ever, get the idea<br>that God having a plan for us, or even us being Christian, included us<br>being happy?*<br><br>In other words, God has a plan for your life. This much is true.<br><br>You're also depressed. It certainly sounds like this is true as well,<br>although I certainly am not qualified to make that diagnosis.<br><br>Those two are pretty much unrelated.<br><br>If you're depressed, get help. This is something we in the United States<br>are really, really bad at. There is a stigma around getting yourself<br>mental health counseling, but there shouldn't be. Get yourself some good<br>quality psychiatric help. The medications have come a long way from<br>Celexa and Prozac.<br><br>On a totally different thread, God has a plan for your life. You may<br>never know what it is. Heck, you might go your entire life and die<br>without ever knowing his plan for you. The Bible tells us that even some<br>of the giants of the faith lived their entire lives without ever knowing<br>God's plan for them. Look at Joseph. He was hated by his brothers, sold<br>into slavery, imprisoned, falsely accused of attempted rape, and<br>threatened with execution. There was no indication that God had<br>explained to Joseph all of the reasons why he had to go through all of<br>that, or what would eventually be done with his life. **He was expected,<br>as you and I are, to live out his life one day at a time in something<br>less than complete understanding. What pleased God was *Joseph\'s<br>faithfulness when nothing made sense*.** In other words, it's one thing<br>to believe in him and be faithful when everything is going your way. But<br>when everything is coming your way because you're going the wrong way on<br>a one-way street, it's much harder to be faithful. It pleases God when<br>we are faithful *despite* our lack of understanding.<br><br>We know that life won\'t be smooth sailing. Where did we ever get the<br>idea that it was? Jesus told His followers to anticipate suffering. \"I<br>have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. *In this<br>world, you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the<br>world*.\" (John 16:33). Paul wrote, \"In all our troubles my joy knows<br>no bounds. For when we came into Macedonia, this body of ours had no<br>rest, but we were harassed at every turn\--conflicts on the outside,<br>fears within\" (2 Cor 7:4-5). Peter said, \"Dear friends, do not be<br>surprised at the painful trial you are suffering, as though something<br>strange were happening to you. But rejoice that you participate in the<br>suffering of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when His glory is<br>revealed\" (1 Peter 4:12-13).<br><br>Get yourself some help first. When you can start to feel better, then<br>start to look in to God's plan for your life.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
