<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why would an incompetent president be reelected?<br><br>There are several reasons why an incompetent president would be<br>re-elected.<br><br>1.  He may be incompetent, but still wildly popular.<br>2.  Or maybe, "incompetence" is subjective. In other words, what one<br>    person finds "incompetent," other people find perfectly acceptable.<br>    Remember, political competence is not something you can objectively<br>    measure. It is highly subjective, and much confirmation bias exists<br>    in determining it. In other words, if you already thought of the<br>    president favorably, then you are far more likely to think of his<br>    actions as "competent," and vice-versa.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
