<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [This sort of technology is currently in existence. We have<br>\"net guns\" and \"bean bag guns\" that can be used without hurting<br>someone.\<br>\<br>Some people won\'t be stopped by these technologies. And the use of one<br>of these, in lieu of deadly force, will still leave the police and the<br>public vulnerable to the use of deadly force.\<br>\<br>So the real question is: do you think that it is appropriate to use<br>lethal force against someone who is a threat to a police officer and to<br>the general public? Is there a line that you would draw below which you<br>could \*not\* use lethal force? Would you universally say that Michael<br>Brown should not have been shot simply because he was unarmed? Does<br>\"unarmed\" equal \"not dangerous\" in your eyes?\<br>\<br>I might also add that a TASER is a less-than-lethal weapon, just as a<br>slime gun is. Until the slime gun malfunctions, or a suspect chokes on<br>the slime and dies, or the suspect slips in the slime and falls down and<br>breaks his head open and dies. Does that make the slime gun a lethal<br>weapon? No more than it makes a TASER a lethal weapon, and it still<br>hurts.\<br>\<br>A slime gun is big and awkward (you need a big tank of slime to spray).<br>When I can wear a slime gun on my belt like a TASER, I\'ll look at it as<br>a possibility.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
