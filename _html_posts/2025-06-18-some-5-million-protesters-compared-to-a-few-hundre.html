<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **Some 5 million protesters compared to a few hundred-thousand at<br>> Trump\'s parade**<br><br>Apples to oranges comparison.<br><br>As opposed to one single parade in DC for the Army, the protests were<br>funded by the Democrat party. No fewer than 70 Democrat focused<br>organizations organized protests in 19 states, funded their operations,<br>*paid people to be there*, and provided logistics support. In<br>addition, well-organized violent agitators also attended these same<br>protests, in secret, outside of the work done by the organizers of the<br>protests. These violent agitators basically hijacked any peace in<br>"peaceful protests" and turned them into violent riots. So much for<br>"peaceful" protesting.<br><br>Anyway, the organizers failed miserably, for multiple reasons:<br><br>- The unfortunately-named "No Kings" protests just didn't land with<br>  people. The day after the protests, we all woke up and, miraculously,<br>  we were still not ruled by a king. So...congratulations? You got what<br>  you wanted?<br>- The irony of the whole "No Kings" protest on the same day as the 250th<br>  birthday of the US Army was clearly lost on the organizers, as the<br>  only reason you can peacefully protest and not be immediately arrested<br>  is because the Constitution was preserved by the Army.<br>- It should also be noted that if the US were actually ruled by a king,<br>  a protest titled "No Kings" would not be permitted. So the very idea<br>  of a "No Kings" protest existing belies the idea that the US is run by<br>  a king.<br><br>> **were there any celebrations of Trump\'s birthday (like the MAGA<br>> election-celebrations across the country)?**<br><br>So since you are apparently comparing the "No Kings" protest to Trump's<br>birthday (because I guess everything is about Trump), no, there were no<br>large-scale birthday celebrations anywhere in the US for Trump's<br>birthday.<br><br>Because, as we have noted throughout this answer, Trump is not a king.<br>If he was, we'd be celebrating him as if he were a king, but since he is<br>just a political office holder, we don't celebrate him as we would for a<br>king, with kingdom-wide celebrations.<br><br>*Election* celebrations, on the other hand, are quite common and were<br>widespread the day after the election. Elections are politically and<br>emotionally charged, so some revelry is expected after an election.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
