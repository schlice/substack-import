We can do<br>anything.<br><br>*Is it a worthwhile comparison?* Well, that's for the reader to<br>decide.<br><br>In terms of the number of people killed, they are (today) about the<br>same. However:<br><br>- The population of the US was about 1/3 of what it is today, so that<br>  same number was much more significant than it is today. In other<br>  words, Spanish Flu still killed more people when we *normalize the two<br>  populations* by deaths per 100,000 instead of total deaths.<br>- The mean age of those who died from Spanish Flu was 28, whereas the<br>  mean age of those who died of COVID-19 was 78.<br>  - However, with modern medicines, we live much longer than they did,<br>    so if we didn't have the same population of elderly folks, would<br>    COVID have been as deadly as it was?<br><br>Speaking of modern medicine, we have tremendous interventions today<br>which did not exist in 1918. Therefore, we have no real idea what would<br>have happened in the COVID-19 case without any intervention whatsoever.<br><br>So while it's probably not a great comparison, you can make it.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can we compare COVID-19 to the Spanish flu?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
