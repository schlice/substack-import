<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>People disrespect the law because their own government shows them that<br>laws are irrelevant.<br><br>For example, the President is not allowed to write law. But he tried to<br>do so on many occasions. He just happened to get called out on it today.<br>The court told him that he cannot write law, and his executive action<br>was unlawful. He then went on television and said, in no uncertain<br>terms, that it's everyone else's fault, I'm going to keep doing what I'm<br>doing, and the court decision doesn't affect me at all.<br><br>People only emulate what they see in their own government. When the<br>President can flout the law as it suits him, the people will follow<br>suit.<br><br>And the people resent the police because the police show them, quite<br>painfully sometimes, that there are indeed consequences to your actions.<br><br>This government wants you to believe that actions do not have<br>consequences. Have sex freely! When it makes a baby, kill it! Whatever!<br>No consequences! Birth control? Someone else pays for that! No<br>consequences! No personal responsibility! When a soft drink is "too big"<br>and will "make you fat," ban it! You can't think or make decisions for<br>yourself! Let us handle all that "difficult decision making for you!"<br><br>And then we'll demonstrate exactly how you should treat the law. As if<br>it doesn't exist.<br><br>People disrespect the law because they have taken the cue from their own<br>government: the law doesn't apply to you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
