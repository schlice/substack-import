<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why do Americans pay taxes every year instead of every 5 or 10<br>years?**<br><br>Americans pay the majority of their taxes out of their paychecks in a<br>process called "withholding." Their employers conveniently deduct their<br>taxes directly out of their pay, since Americans pay income tax, and<br>employers provide income. It's convenient for employers to remit the<br>income tax for their employees, and the IRS can monitor employers<br>instead of every single American every two weeks. Employers use an<br>estimation called "exemptions" to determine an estimate of how much tax<br>to withdraw from your paycheck.<br><br>Once a year, Americans rectify those numbers, using actual calculations<br>that employers simply could not have access to. If the taxpayer overpaid<br>throughout the course of the year (through their payroll deductions,<br>which is usually the case), they get a refund on the amount they<br>overpaid. If they didn't pay enough (because they perhaps got some<br>untaxed income from another place, or they didn't withhold enough from<br>their paycheck), then they pay the difference. The IRS can then monitor<br>this process once a year to ensure legal compliance. It's much more<br>convenient and less expensive for the IRS to monitor all taxpayers<br>annually.<br><br>So once a year, American taxpayers rectify the amount that they should<br>have paid with the amount they already paid. They don't actually "pay<br>taxes" only once a year.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
