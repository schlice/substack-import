<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I love how you just casually threw that out there, as if it's an option<br>that Hamas just hasn't considered.<br><br>"It's easy, Hamas! All you have to do is stop being bad!"<br><br>Except *Hamas can't stop being bad. Being bad is in their nature, in<br>their charter.*<br><br>It's literally on their website. Their goal is the complete eradication<br>of the state of Israel and all Jews.<br><br>\<br><br>Hypothetically speaking (because there is no way this is happening in<br>reality), *IF* Hamas agreed to peacefully coexist with Israel, the<br>conflict would end the same day.<br><br>But that's a really big IF, because **Hamas doesn't want to agree to<br>peaceful coexistence.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
