<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What depletes phone batteries? In order of biggest draw:<br><br>- Screen usage<br>- CPU utilization<br>- Network usage<br>- Memory utilization<br><br>Screen usage is the number one culprit of phone battery utilization,<br>more than CPU utilization or anything else you do with your phone. So<br>turn down your brightness, reduce the frame rate of your game (which you<br>can do with Samsung's Game Launcher, and usually doesn't negatively<br>impact gameplay), and you can extend your battery without unduly<br>sacrificing gameplay.<br><br>Without a rooted phone, you can't modify how the phone uses the CPU, but<br>even interactive CPU governors are going to be running nearly full tilt<br>while you are actively using the phone, so it's of little benefit to<br>discuss it in a discussion of active use of the device.<br><br>Network usage can be curtailed during a game, especially if it doesn't<br>have online components (i.e. connecting to Google Play or Facebook for<br>online gameplay or statistics or saving). If the game does connect, only<br>leave active the one method by which it connects; turn the other radios<br>off or limit background data and sync.<br><br>Memory utilization also can't be controlled by the end user, it's more<br>of a developer thing. Ensuring you have enough free memory for swap<br>space can help, and regular cleaning of junk also helps.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
