<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What entitles you to change a question after it is answered? This is a<br>violation, and should not happen.**<br><br>We should be able to edit the question to correct for grammar (this is<br>especially common for non-native English speakers). There's nothing<br>wrong with editing the question for clarity. If we did not have the<br>ability to edit the question, we'd have to report every question which<br>was not worded correctly (which automatically downvotes the question)<br>and Quora Moderators have enough to deal with when it comes to the stuff<br>they deal with now, let alone having to edit questions for grammar or<br>clarity.<br><br>*Changing* *the original intent* of the question is not correct. The<br>edit should be reported if the original intent of the question is<br>changed.<br><br>If someone is changing the question simply because they don't like the<br>question, they should be reported.<br><br>Finally, in Quoraville, **questions belong to the community, not solely<br>to the asker. Answers belong to the answerer.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
