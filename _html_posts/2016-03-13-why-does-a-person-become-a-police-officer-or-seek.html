<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [A2A\<br>\<br>For me, a few reasons.\<br>\<br>My wife, who knows me better than I do, says that I have a \"servant\'s<br>heart.\" Everything that I have done in my life has been some form of<br>service. My military service was pretty obvious. After that, I went to<br>work for a computer company\...in customer service. And now, I am<br>working towards volunteering for the Sheriff\'s Office as a Reserve<br>Deputy.\<br>\<br>But why law enforcement? It\'s in my blood. My grandpa and my dad were<br>both cops. Once you have lived in a cop\'s family, it sorta \"grows\" on<br>you. And I\'ve already been a reserve cop before: I was a READY<br>Augmentee for Security Forces in the Air Force. I did really enjoy that<br>work.\<br>\<br>So I know it\'s not for the money, since Reserve Deputies don\'t get<br>paid. For me, I want to give back to my community in a tangible,<br>meaningful (to me) way. I can fulfill my dream of continuing my family<br>legacy in law enforcement and still provide the lifestyle my family has<br>come to expect. This is what I chose.\<br>\<br>(BTW, this is a portion of the presentation I gave at Oral Boards when I<br>was applying to the department).]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
