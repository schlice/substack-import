<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>Pretty much anyone can join the department beyond the classes you noted.<br>If you've ever been convicted of a felony, you're out. If you're not a<br>US citizen, you're out. But other than that, if you're over 18 and are a<br>high school graduate or have your GED, you can apply. In most cases you<br>must also possess a driver's license and you must also have an almost<br>clean driving record.<br><br>All department hiring practices are different, but most require you to<br>have certain physical skills (be able to lift a minimum amount of<br>weight, have a minimum level of aerobic fitness, etc), and pass numerous<br>other physical, psychological, and educational tests.<br><br>In our department, you start with a written test. You then move on to<br>oral boards, where you make a few extemporaneous presentations in front<br>of command staff. If you pass those two, you move into background<br>checks, physical tests, psychological tests (both paper and interview),<br>and a CVSA (Computer Voice Stress Analysis, similar to a polygraph). If<br>you pass all of these, you are offered a slot in the upcoming class.<br><br>State law requires a complete application from soup to nuts for each<br>class. So when the department decides to do a class, it opens up testing<br>about four months before the class is scheduled to start. By the time<br>the class is set to begin, they have developed a class list for that<br>class.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
