<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, I don't think so. I think atheists can be just as hateful and<br>judgmental as theists.<br><br>Sure, there are some atheists who live more morally than many<br>Christians, and there are some Christians who live more morally than<br>many atheists.<br><br>And there are plenty of Christians who wrongly believe that their<br>judgement is somehow acceptable because they are saved, and the atheist<br>is not. Clearly, this is the Christian's problem, and they are<br>absolutely wrong for thinking this way. But this "moral high ground"<br>fallacy works both ways. Some atheists believe they are more moral<br>because they don't wrongly judge, but believing this places them in the<br>position of being the arbiter of morals, since they have no foundation<br>for their purported morality.<br><br>But I don't think there's anything special about Christians which makes<br>them especially more judgmental than atheists.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
