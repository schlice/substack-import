<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should a homeowner\'s association be a deal breaker when purchasing a<br>property? If not, how high should the fees be?**<br><br>The existence of an HOA should never be a deal breaker when purchasing a<br>property. Remember the purpose of an HOA: **to keep your home value as<br>high as possible by ensuring that what your *neighbors* do to<br>their houses doesn't negatively impact your home's value.**<br><br>Unless you get anxiety when someone tells you what you can and can't do<br>with the outside of your house, an HOA is a good thing. Here's why.<br><br>Let's say your neighbor really loves electric blue, and wants to paint<br>their house electric blue.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-fb0c57ffc8a8b76b31f8b6196f5a0ec8){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-fb0c57ffc8a8b76b31f8b6196f5a0ec8" master_w="398"<br>master_h="342"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>This one actually doesn't look terrible, but some houses might not look<br>good in electric blue, especially if all of the other houses in the<br>neighborhood are "earth tones." In that circumstance, the resale value<br>on your home would decline, as the neighborhood simply doesn't look<br>good. Is that fair to you?<br><br>What if your neighbor is an auto mechanic, and he loves to tinker on old<br>cars, and he's always got two or three cars in his driveway up on<br>blocks, and another with parts strewn all over the front of his<br>property? While it may look like heaven to your auto mechanic neighbor,<br>to everyone else it looks like a junkyard. Now, no one wants to move<br>into your neighborhood because it looks like the Beverly Hillbillies<br>live down the street. Is that fair to you?<br><br>What if you have a neighbor who believes in "natural living" and treats<br>his front yard the same way? "Let nature handle the lawn," he says.<br>Consequently, it looks like a weed-infested jungle. But hey, it's his<br>property, right? Except that no one wants to buy your house because<br>they'd be living next door to George of the Jungle. Then all manner of<br>wild animals start nesting in his jungle, and causing disease and<br>nuisance to your pets and affecting the safety of the children in your<br>neighborhood. Without an HOA, while it is doable with lawyers and code<br>enforcement, it's still really difficult, expensive, and time consuming<br>to get that neighbor to clean up his act. Is that fair to you?<br><br>HOAs ensure that what your neighbors do doesn't impact your house's<br>value or the safety and well-being of your neighborhood.<br><br>HOAs can provide other services as well, such as community pools,<br>community trash and recycling services (where it is not provided by the<br>city), maintained walking trails, etc.<br><br>So how much is too much? It depends on the services the HOA offers. Do<br>they have a community center? Does it have a pool? How elaborate is that<br>pool? Does it have a community exercise room? Does the community have<br>walking trails? Does it have a community playground? Along with<br>maintaining all of those properties, the HOA must also carry liability<br>insurance on those properties, which is yet another added cost.<br>Therefore, the cost of the HOA should be commensurate with the services<br>they offer. If they are much higher than what they actually offer, you<br>might reasonably think twice about buying in that neighborhood.<br><br>You can also expect condos and townhomes to have higher HOA fees than<br>single family neighborhoods, as they are more expensive to maintain and<br>also offer more services.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
