When<br>someone is convicted of a crime, the law addresses punishment.<br><br>Therefore, *after* a person is convicted of a crime, we can talk<br>about punishment. But the Constitution is never to be used as a<br>punishment to anyone. It is a set of guardralis to keep government in<br>check.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
