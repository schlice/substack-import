<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should Mike Pence also be impeached by the United States House of<br>Representatives for refusing to perform his constitutional duties as<br>Vice President, especially those specified in the 25th Amendment?**<br><br>No. Failing to perform your job is not an impeachable offense. Failing<br>to perform your job is an issue addressed at the ballot box.<br><br>Impeachment is reserved for "high crimes and misdemeanors." In general,<br>this means when a politician has done something so egregious that he<br>cannot be left in office.<br><br>This does not mean when a politician does their job *badly*. It also<br>does not mean when a politician *doesn't even do what they're supposed<br>to do*. There is no requirement for a Vice President to take action to<br>remove a President who is doing his job *badly*. That's nowhere to be<br>found in the 25th Amendment.<br><br>The 25th Amendment does not apply when the president does his job, but<br>he does it in a way that you don't like. The 25th Amendment only applies<br>when the president is *physically incapable of doing his job*. In this<br>case, he is doing his job, but we don't like how he is doing it. That<br>situation is handled at the ballot box.<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance<br>for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough<br>shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion<br>masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your<br>own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.<br>If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"<br>don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything<br>vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a<br>block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
