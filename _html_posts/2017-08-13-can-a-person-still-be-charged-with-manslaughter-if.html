<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Can a person still be charged with manslaughter if they accidently<br>> killed a person but did not do anything illegal or dangerous that<br>> caused that person\'s death?*<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Manslaughter (in the US) is *the unlawful taking of a life*. The<br>definition of the crime says nothing of forethought (planning to, or<br>thinking about, harming someone), and it says nothing of malice<br>(intention to take a life, otherwise called *mens rea,* or the guilty<br>mind*).* It is simply the *actus reus* (or the guilty act) of unlawfully<br>taking a life. Whether or not the act that caused the death was illegal<br>or dangerous is also not considered. Taking a life unlawfully is<br>manslaughter. Manslaughter is the physical element of the crime without<br>the mental knowledge that what one was doing was a crime. Manslaughter<br>is a strict liability crime, one in which only the actus reus is<br>required. The only thing required is that the act was voluntary, since<br>involuntary acts are not criminal unless they stem from recklessness or<br>criminal negligence.<br><br>Hopefully, the state of mind and the fact that what the killer did was<br>not illegal or dangerous will be factored in when sentencing takes<br>place.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
