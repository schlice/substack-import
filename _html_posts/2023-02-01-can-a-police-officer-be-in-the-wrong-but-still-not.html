<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Absolutely.<br><br>But to do so, we'd need to define what it means to be "in the wrong."<br>There are different rules that are imposed on police officers, first and<br>foremost would be the law. Secondarily to the law, the officer works for<br>a police department, which has standards of conduct. Finally, there are<br>the civil rights of the victim to consider, because even if a police<br>officer did not commit a crime, he may have violated the victim's civil<br>rights.<br><br>Therefore, a police officer may not have committed a crime for which he<br>can go to jail, but he may still have violated the civil rights of the<br>victim, and he may have violated department policy.<br><br>That's why, when a police officer is involved in a shooting, there are<br>far more investigations taken against that officer then there are when a<br>citizen is involved in a shooting. When it's a citizen, the criminal<br>investigation happens, and that's about it. If the citizen is cleared of<br>criminal wrongdoing, it's nearly impossible to make a case for a civil<br>wrongful death action in most states, and that's where the investigation<br>ends.<br><br>For a police officer, that same criminal investigation takes place, but<br>simultaneously, the officer's department will review the case to see if<br>any department policies were violated. Violating those rules could get<br>an officer fired. At the same time as those investigations, the<br>Department of Justice may also review the incident to see if the civil<br>rights of the victim were violated, and may bring Federal civil rights<br>charges against the officer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
