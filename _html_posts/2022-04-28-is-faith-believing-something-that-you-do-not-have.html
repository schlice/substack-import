<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a common misconception about faith, usually promulgated by<br>people who are not believers themselves, but sometimes from believers<br>who believe without *knowledge of* the good reasons behind their beliefs<br>(not that those reasons don't exist).<br><br>**Faith is not belief without evidence. Faith is believing what you<br>already know to be true, *even though there may be unanswered<br>questions remaining*.**<br><br>Let's give an example to aid in our understanding. Let's say I see a<br>chair. I would like to sit in the chair. *But how do I know that the<br>chair is going to hold my (greater than I'd prefer) weight?* I can look<br>at the chair, which appears sturdy. I can check to see if all the<br>fastening hardware is there. I can look at its design, and see if the<br>materials, in my experience, can support me. I can look around and see<br>if anyone else is sitting in a similar chair. *But I will never have a<br>100% guarantee that the chair will support my weight*. At a certain<br>point, I have no choice but to *have faith* in what I know, based on<br>the evidence I already have, and sit in the chair.<br><br>What does this example teach us? My faith in the ability of the chair to<br>support me is based on good reasons to believe it. It's based on<br>empirical and observational evidence, *but without direct evidence of<br>this chair's construction or ability to actually do what I need it to<br>do.* But I have faith that what I know about chairs in general, and what<br>I can determine about this chair in specific, will appropriately guide<br>me into making the correct choice. And so, I can proceed with faith that<br>what I know sufficiently helps me understand what I don't.<br><br>We can apply the same logic to religion as well. My religious faith is<br>also based on lots of empirical and observational evidence, but without<br>direct evidence of God's existence. At a certain point, the amount of<br>evidence I have must be enough to allow me to have faith that what I<br>believe is true.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is faith believing something that you do not have good reasons to<br>believe?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
