<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Can* you carry a gun like that? Sure you can. All you have to do is<br>stick it there, and you can carry it. It may not be lawful in your<br>jurisdiction to carry a firearm in this manner, but not every<br>jurisdiction has carry laws dictating how you must carry a firearm.<br><br>*Should* you do this? Absolutely not.<br><br>Modern firearms are designed to only discharge when the trigger is<br>pulled. Therefore, to prevent accidental discharge, you must protect the<br>trigger while the firearm is being carried.<br><br>*This means you have to carry that firearm in a holster.* This is<br>the only way to safely carry a loaded firearm, if it's not in your hand<br>under positive control.<br><br>If you fail to do this, you risk accidental discharge. Here's just a few<br>stories of recent self-inflicted gunshot wounds caused by improper carry<br>of a firearm:<br><br>[[Police: Man mishandles handgun, accidentally shoots himself in leg at<br>Colorado Springs<br>7-Eleven](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=33c9fd&url=http://gazette.com/police-man-mishandles-handgun-accidentally-shoots-himself-in-leg-at-colorado-springs-7-eleven/article/1592584){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gazette.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>[[Man accidentally shoots himself in Colo.

Always carry a firearm<br>in a holster. If you want to tuck the firearm inside your waistband, you<br>need an "inside-the-waistband" holster (otherwise known as an IWB<br>holster). Don't be lazy and stick it in a pocket or just shove it in<br>your pants. It's not like cell phones which went from waistband holsters<br>to pockets because it's cool. It's definitely not cool.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
