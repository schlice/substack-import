<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I flew Frontier from Colorado Springs to Las Vegas just a few months<br>ago, and then I flew Southwest from Denver to Raleigh just a month<br>later.<br><br>**There is literally no comparison. Southwest does not belong in this<br>category.**<br><br>First, a little background. My flight on Frontier was just about an hour<br>and change, and the aircraft was only a few weeks into service, so it<br>was one of Frontier's most current offerings. But I have flown with<br>major airlines like United and Delta, and budget airlines like<br>Southwest, for many years. This was my first experience on Frontier.<br><br>Here's my impressions of Frontier:<br><br>1.  Everything is an upgrade. They do offer some of these items (like a<br>    bag and a seat selection, for example) bundled together for a single<br>    charge, but everything is only available by purchase.<br>    1.  You do not get any bags included at all. Your only included item<br>        is one bag as a personal item that must fit under the seat in<br>        front of you. If you want to bring a carry-on (regardless of<br>        where you put it on the plane), it's an extra charge. If you<br>        want to bring a checked bag, each bag is an extra charge, there<br>        are no bags included in the ticket price.<br>    2.  No food or drinks are included in your ticket. Everything is<br>        purchasable. Granted, they try to make it as convenient as<br>        possible: you can buy a "snack pack" which includes snacks and a<br>        drink for one price. But there are no complimentary drinks or<br>        snacks included at all.<br>    3.  If you want to choose your seat, you may do so. For an extra<br>        charge, of course. If you want to save money, you can let<br>        Frontier place you in a seat of their choosing.<br>    4.  Not that they ever reclined very far to begin with, but the<br>        seats don't recline. There were, maybe, three rows with<br>        reclining seats, which you could choose to sit in. For an extra<br>        price, of course.<br>2.  I think the Colorado Springs to Vegas flight is about as long as I<br>    can stand to sit in those seats. They were horribly uncomfortable.<br>    The padding was very thin. You could feel the metal bars right<br>    through the seat padding. And mind you, this aircraft was brand new.<br>3.  The tray table wasn't much bigger than my cell phone. So much for<br>    putting the laptop up there to watch movies. The laptop actually had<br>    to sit, well, in my lap.<br><br>On the upside, the lav was beautiful and well-lit. The cabin was also<br>well-lit, with colored LED lighting. The ventilation worked very well.<br><br>In comparison to Southwest:<br><br>1.  Southwest gives you two checked bags for free, along with your<br>    carry-on, and a personal item. All at no additional charge.<br>2.  On Southwest, you can pick your seat. When you board the plane!<br>    Southwest has open seating: no assigned seats. While it does take<br>    slightly longer to board this way, this method has one of the<br>    highest customer satisfaction ratings of any method of boarding a<br>    commercial aircraft. Passengers are assigned a group and a numbered<br>    boarding position. Families traveling with children six and under<br>    can board together between the A and B groups. You have the option<br>    to upgrade to the A boarding group for anywhere from \$30 to \$50,<br>    depending on route.<br>3.  Southwest crews are genuinely happy. It's genuine. You can see it in<br>    their faces. They actually enjoy what they do.<br>4.  Southwest offers complimentary soft drinks and water, along with an<br>    assortment of snacks which varies by route. They also offer buy on<br>    board food.<br>5.  Southwest aircraft include free Wi-Fi on board, which gives you<br>    access to free movies, an assortment of live television stations,<br>    and free messaging (limited to iMessage and WhatsApp, which you need<br>    to have downloaded before you board, since there's no access to the<br>    App Store or Google Play). You can buy full access to the Internet<br>    for \$8 per day, regardless of how many flights you take that day.<br>    While this gives you access to all of your productivity software<br>    like email and most websites, this excludes access to most movie<br>    streaming services like Netflix or HBO GO. It also excludes access<br>    to Voice over IP (VoIP), so no phone calls while on the plane<br>    (although that may change in the future).<br><br>Southwest and Frontier aren't even remotely comparable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
