<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, you still have the right to travel by road. The government simply<br>limits what you must do in order to **operate a motor vehicle on a<br>public road**.<br><br>You can travel *on a bicycle* by road.<br><br>You can travel *using your feet* by road.<br><br>You can even travel *as a passenger* in any motor vehicle on any road.<br><br>Governments only require you to pass tests, obtain licenses, insurance,<br>and registration when you are *operating a motor vehicle* on a<br>public road. Wearing safety gear is only applicable when operating a<br>motorcycle or a bicycle on public roads.<br><br>But "traveling" using **any other method besides "driving a car"<br>(legally known as "operating a motor vehicle") does not require any of<br>the conditions you listed.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
