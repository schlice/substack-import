<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In reality, it would be very difficult to enforce such a law.<br><br>But the point of it isn't to enforce it. The point is to *pass it to<br>send a message.*<br><br>Some people will get that message and will consider other options<br>besides abortion, like adoption. Others will think twice before having<br>unprotected sex.<br><br>Ultimately, the goal of the law is to reduce the number of unborn babies<br>that are killed. And if they achieve that goal, *even just a little*,<br>the law would be successful.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Missouri lawmakers have proposed making it illegal to travel to other<br>states to obtain an abortion.
