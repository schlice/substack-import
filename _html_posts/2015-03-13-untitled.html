<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Forgive me please, it\'s been a long day and while I can<br>multitask (post on Quora and do my job), sometimes the stress of work<br>tends to bleed over to Quora and I get\...snippy. I\'m sorry if I did<br>that.\<br>\<br>This is a topic that I\'m very passionate about. While I think the<br>Ferguson PD is in serious trouble, most departments would be using this<br>scenario as a training exercise. They would be examining, re-examining,<br>and re-evaluating all of their training and best practices, and I know<br>that plenty of departments spent quite a few in-service training<br>sessions reviewing this scenario, what happened, where Wilson failed,<br>and how he could have improved.\<br>\<br>People need to take the time to objectively review what happened, and<br>that\'s really really hard to do when emotions get in the way. Yes,<br>we\'re sad for Michael Brown and the entire situation, but if we\'re<br>going to learn anything from it, we have to step back and apply that<br>objectivity. Thanks for doing that.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Ferguson-Grand-Jury-Decision-November-2014-Is-Darren-Wilson-a-coward-for-his-actions/answer/Chris-Everett<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
