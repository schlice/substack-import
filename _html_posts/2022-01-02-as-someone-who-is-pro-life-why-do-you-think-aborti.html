<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why do you think that the punishment for the rape should be carried out<br>against the innocent victim instead of against the perpetrator?<br><br>Let's pose this another way: let's say the mother had her day-old baby<br>with her when she was raped. Would you think about killing the baby to<br>punish the rapist *then*? Of course you wouldn't. So why do it before<br>the baby is born? What does a few weeks matter? Just because you wish to<br>assign less value to its life simply because of its temporal locality<br>still doesn't mean that it's appropriate to exact your revenge on the<br>baby instead of the rapist. If you want to kill someone, kill the<br>rapist. But that baby is as much a victim as is the mother. Why must you<br>victimize it twice?<br><br>Let it be born and give it up for adoption. The mother is no longer a<br>mother, she goes back to her life, the baby has an opportunity to live<br>in a family that can't naturally have children, it's a win-win.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>As someone who is pro-life, why do you think abortion should be illegal<br>even in the case of rape?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
