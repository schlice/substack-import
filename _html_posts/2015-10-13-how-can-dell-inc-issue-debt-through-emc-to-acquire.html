<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [*NOTE: I am an employee, but I have no more inside<br>information than what you\'ve seen in the press releases.*\<br>\<br>\<br>\<br>Not sure where you got your information, but Dell is not \"issuing debt<br>through EMC.\" Dell, along with their equity capital partners, are<br>essentially acquiring new debt to finance this deal. Dell will spend the<br>next few years following the completion of this transaction (which is<br>expected to be 2Q16) paying down that debt, but their expected revenue<br>from the combined operation more than permits them to pay down that<br>debt. The eight or so banks that have already signed agreements with<br>Dell to finance the deal seem to think so, anyway.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
