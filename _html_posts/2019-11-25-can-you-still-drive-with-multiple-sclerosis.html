<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can you still drive with multiple sclerosis?<br><br>If you're asking whether or not someone with MS is allowed to drive<br>cars, the answer is yes. There is no law that revokes a driver's license<br>once you are diagnosed with MS.<br><br>If you're asking whether or not an MS patient can drive a car *safely*,<br>that's between that patient and his or her doctor. If their impairment<br>because of MS so impacts their reflexes, eyesight, or gross motor<br>functions that they can no longer operate a car or do so safely, they<br>should probably consider not driving. I would hope that a neurologist<br>would have that kind of discussion with his or her patient.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
