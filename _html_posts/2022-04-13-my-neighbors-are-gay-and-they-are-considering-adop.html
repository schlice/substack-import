<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You don't.<br><br>Your learned opinion may very well be that children do best in a common<br>household with their biological mother and their biological father.<br>Studies have indeed shown this. The state even incentivizes this<br>relationship, offering tax breaks for people who structure their lives<br>like this, so that children can get the best possible chance for a good<br>outcome.<br><br>**But none of that has anything AT ALL to do with the fact that a loving<br>couple wants to raise a child.** It may not be the most statistically<br>ideal structure, but that simply does not equate to a bad outcome for<br>*that* child. Just because a particular structure offers the *best<br>chance* for a child to have a good outcome later in life **DOES NOT<br>MEAN** that all other structures are "highly inappropriate." About that<br>point, you are simply incorrect.<br><br>Not to mention that the real *highly inappropriate* part is for you to<br>tell anyone at all about statistical outcomes based on parental types<br>unless you are asked.<br><br>Stay out of other people's business. Don't give anyone your opinion<br>unless they ask for it. And even then, politeness and couth might<br>dictate that you keep your opinion to yourself.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>My neighbors are gay and they are considering adoption. How can I<br>politely explain to them that it is highly inappropriate for same sex<br>couples to raise children?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
