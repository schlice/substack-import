<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What happens when the Congress and the president do not like a Supreme<br>Court ruling that interprets the meaning of the Constitution?**<br><br>There are really only three things to do: nothing, re-write the law, or<br>re-write the Constitution.<br><br>1.  Nothing. They can understand that the Supreme Court isn't the<br>    last word because they're always right; the Supreme Court is always<br>    right because it has the last word.<br>2.  Re-write the law. They can write a new law which accomplishes<br>    what they wanted to accomplish while staying Constitutional. Perhaps<br>    they can remove the unconstitutional portion of the law. Perhaps<br>    they can re-word the law to respect the Constitution.<br>3.  Re-write the Constitution. They can pass an Amendment to the<br>    Constitution and submit it to the States for ratification. If the<br>    Amendment is ratified, then they can re-pass the original<br>    legislation which is no longer conflicting with the amended<br>    Constitution. Admittedly, this would be the most difficult path.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
