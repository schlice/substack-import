<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a police officer is taking a statement from a victim of sexual<br>assault, is he/she allowed to turn their body camera off so the victim<br>feels more comfortable sharing intimate details?**<br><br>The answer is "it depends."<br><br>As you know, Body-Worn Cameras (BWCs) are very new, and every agency and<br>state has different rules around their use and implementation.<br><br>If an agency has a "record everything" policy, well first I'd love to<br>meet them and see how exactly they're swimming in money, but more to the<br>question, the officers would likely not be able to turn off the cameras.<br>They would have to cite the fact that the complainant does not have a<br>reasonable expectation of privacy when speaking to a police officer, and<br>whatever they say can be recorded. That doesn't mean that it can be<br>released to the public; videos of a sensitive nature can be protected<br>from FOIA requests. But in those departments, the officers would not be<br>able to deactivate their cameras.<br><br>If an agency allows officers to switch on and switch off the cameras<br>based on policy (which is the majority of departments' procedures<br>because storage space costs money), then policy *should* dictate that<br>the officer can deactivate the camera if a witness is giving a<br>statement. The contents of the statement would be verified and<br>authenticated (initialed) by both the complainant and the officer on the<br>statement form before the officer left, so there should be no need to<br>record that particular conversation on the BWC.<br><br>As I mentioned, this is a very new area of law, and policy is being<br>developed and refined continuously. Departments have many things to deal<br>with, including state and local laws, as well as how much storage space<br>is available for evidentiary and non-evidentiary video, and storage<br>policies and release policies must be tailored for each specific type of<br>video and for the amount of available storage space. Laws must be<br>created which balance the need for protecting the privacy of victims<br>while still providing transparency into law enforcement operations and<br>good evidentiary video. It is going to be a work in progress for some<br>time.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
