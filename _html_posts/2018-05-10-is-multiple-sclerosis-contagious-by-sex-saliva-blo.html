<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is multiple sclerosis contagious by sex /saliva /blood?<br><br>No, multiple sclerosis is not contagious. You can't "catch" MS.<br><br>There are several factors which go into determining your risk for MS.<br>Age, sex, ethnicity, geography of birth, prevalence in your first-degree<br>relatives, and exposure to an as-of-yet unidentified infectious trigger<br>are all factors which can increase your risk of developing MS.<br><br>Exposure to a person with MS is not one of them.<br><br>We're so convinced that MS is not contagious, that eleven years ago, the<br>Red Cross lifted its ban on MS patients donating blood.<br><br>[[People with MS can now give blood at the Red<br>Cross](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fc89ac&url=https://secure.nationalmssociety.org/site/SPageServer/%253Bjsessionid%3DDF09D5EA8D68BF2CA036C48F00BFB260.app354a?pagename%3DNTH_programs_giveblood){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>> *Until recently, people with multiple sclerosis (MS) were not<br>> permitted to donate blood at American Red Cross donation centers. The<br>> ban has now been lifted because no scientific evidence exists that MS<br>> is contagious or can be transmitted via blood.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
