<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, but it doesn't really work like that. It happens because of a lot<br>of failure to communicate, and that is usually *willingly* failing to<br>communicate.<br><br>If you don't pay your dues, or if you get fines or fees added to your<br>account that you don't pay, those charges will add up and you will start<br>to accrue late fees. Those fees continue to add up to a certain point,<br>at which your delinquent account is turned over to the association's<br>attorney. Along with what you've already accumulated, you then begin to<br>accrue the attorney's fees.<br><br>After a certain amount of time has passed, the HOA will place a *lien*<br>on your property. And if you allow your account to continue to remain<br>delinquent, the HOA will *foreclose* on your lien, selling your house<br>out from under you, so that they get their money and the attorney gets<br>paid.<br><br>It takes a long time and a lot of communication to allow your account to<br>go that far delinquent. Usually, it's willing (usually, homeowners say<br>something like, "I'm not going to talk to those HOA fools; they can't do<br>anything to me"), but sometimes it's not. Often, it's just the letter<br>from the attorney which says that the delinquent account has been turned<br>over to them which gets them communicating and working on a get-well<br>plan. But some people are pretty obstinate and flat-out refuse to<br>cooperate. Those are the people who lose their houses out from under<br>them.<br><br>In my time on HOA Boards, I have seen that happen *exactly once*. It is<br>a pretty rare occurrence, and this guy was a real piece of work, if you<br>know what I mean. He ended up getting arrested on domestic violence<br>charges, *and he was a well-known attorney in our area at the time!* He<br>truly thought he was smarter than everyone and he didn't have to pay his<br>dues or fines. He's now sitting in a jail cell. Go figure.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
