<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's unpack your question.<br><br>> **Is it proper to require a disabled new member of a group to use a<br>> provided wheelchair**<br><br>A venue can require that a wheelchair-bound person transfer into a<br>provided wheelchair. This may be for important reasons, like standard<br>wheelchair widths may not fit the aisles, or the wheelchair may have<br>special adaptations for the venue. The venue should specify, at the<br>door, that wheelchair-bound participants must transfer. This is the<br>verbiage used across the industry to indicate that a wheelchair-bound<br>person transfer from his own chair to a provided chair. The venue must<br>have a valid reason for requiring wheelchair-bound patrons to transfer.<br>The venue can then deny entrance to wheelchair-bound patrons who cannot<br>transfer, if the reason precludes entirely having a personal wheelchair<br>in the venue.<br><br>> **\A<br>d then seat that person in a special wheelchair area of an<br>> arena away from the other members of the group he had joined?**<br><br>Some venues have specially-designated sections for wheelchairs only. The<br>sections would normally have seats, but instead have seats removed, and<br>provide direct access for wheelchairs. You normally find accommodations<br>like this in stadiums and in other places where there are fixed seats.<br>The benefit of wheelchair sections is that they are designed so that<br>wheelchair-bound patrons have a good view of the venue even if people in<br>seats in front of them are standing.<br><br>Most venues which have wheelchair seating areas also have nearby seats<br>into which they can re-locate other members of the party, but **this is<br>not required**. The venue is under no obligation to provide seating for<br>members of the disabled person's party.<br><br>Places of public accommodation are required to provide reasonable<br>accommodations to disabled persons. They do not have to provide<br>accommodation to the disabled person's party, or to anyone else.<br>Anything else above what is required by the ADA is a convenience,<br>not a requirement.<br><br>In theory, the traveling party would have purchased tickets in seats<br>near the wheelchair area if keeping the entire group together was a goal<br>of the party.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
