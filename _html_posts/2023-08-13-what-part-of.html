<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Most of the time, Christians have trouble understanding what "other<br>Gods" means.<br><br>The Bible specifically said, "I am the LORD your God who brought you out<br>of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. You shall have no<br>other gods before me" (Deuteronomy 5:6--7 NKJV).<br><br>So not only is God saying that His people cannot practice idolatry, but<br>He explains *why*. Only God had the power to bring the slaves out of<br>Egyptian slavery. Only God cared enough for them to choose them to be<br>His chosen people. Only God protected them. Can an idol of stone or gold<br>do that?<br><br>Can anything we worship that is not God do that? Can money do that?<br>Money can buy you some temporary safety, but does it offer you<br>*everlasting life?* Not even the promise of cryogenics does that.<br><br>More specifically, God is talking about *materialism*.<br><br>> No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love<br>> the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You<br>> cannot serve God and money. --- Matthew 6:24 ESV<br><br>The "money" referred to in this translation is more appropriately called<br>materialism. You cannot love God and be materialistic. The dangers of<br>worshiping material things are clearly outlined in the story of the rich<br>young ruler (Matthew 19:16-26) who turned away from Christ because he<br>could not part with his wealth.<br><br>This is the crux of what Christians misunderstand about the First<br>Commandment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
