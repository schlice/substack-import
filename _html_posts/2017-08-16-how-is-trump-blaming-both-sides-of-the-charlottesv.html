<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Um, his words?<br><br>> *NEW YORK (AP) --- Combative and insistent, President Donald Trump<br>> declared anew Tuesday "there is blame on both sides" for the deadly<br>> violence last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia, appearing to once<br>> again equate the actions of white supremacist groups and those<br>> protesting them. He showed sympathy for the fringe groups' efforts to<br>> preserve Confederate monuments.*\[1\](#syvKM){#cite-syvKM<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>(EDIT) I see that I was not clear enough in answering the question. The<br>question is basically asking "how is it 'promoting racism' by blaming<br>both sides?"<br><br>The first clue comes from AP themselves, who are editorializing instead<br>of reporting (whoa, big surprise there). The quote says that Trump is<br>"...appearing to once again equate the actions of white supremacist<br>groups and those protesting them."<br><br>This is where the media gets their "racism" claim. Because Trump says<br>that there is blame on both sides, and refused to call out the white<br>supremacists over the ANTIFA and BLM crowds, Trump is actually<br>"promoting racism" because he has equated what the white supremacists do<br>with what the ANTIFA and BLM groups do.<br><br>Now, in order to believe this, you have to believe that ANTIFA and BLM<br>had *absolutely no agenda* other than to protest white supremacy.<br>They were nothing more than innocent protesters. They don't belong to<br>any hate groups themselves, right? They were just bystanders,<br>expressing their First Amendment right to protest, when they were<br>*viciously attacked* by those haters, those KKK-loving, neo-Nazi white<br>supremacist bastards! Isn't that the story they want you to hear?<br><br>So when Trump says, "there's blame on both sides," he has essentially<br>said, in their view, that ANTIFA and BLM have the same quality and<br>character as white supremacists. Oh, the indignity! This cannot stand!<br>The media goes apoplectic and that little vein in their forehead pops<br>out while they write their headline.<br><br>Why? They *love* what ANTIFA and BLM stand for, and they *hate* what<br>white supremacists stand for.<br><br>So they are engaging in the very same value judgement by judging these<br>groups and assigning a value to them, when Trump is merely talking about<br>their conduct, not their character. The media then makes the leap<br>that based on your character, you should not have as much of a right<br>to speak as some other group, that your speech should be restricted.<br>They therefore believe that ANTIFA and BLM are "right," and the white<br>supremacists are "wrong," and if the President doesn't hold the white<br>supremacists to blame 100% for the whole thing, he's actually promoting<br>what they stand for, when he did nothing of the sort. He later came out<br>and denounced the white supremacist group for what they believe, but he<br>still holds to his opinion that their conduct, on both sides, was wrong.<br><br>The treatment of Trump in the media is a wholesale repudiation of the<br>First Amendment, and it is shameful.<br><br>Regardless of what you think of the character of any of these groups,<br>they have the right to speak. The conduct of both of these groups was<br>reprehensible. But they all have the right to speak.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-syvKM){.citation_index} [[Defiant Trump insists anew:<br>Blame both sides for<br>violence](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d7f8ac&url=https://www.apnews.com/7654c14b6bd94cf8814fa6a0af8d1edd){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="apnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
