<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You're right, you need faith alone to get into heaven. *Sola fide*.<br><br>However, faith produces works. Every. Single. Time. Therefore, if<br>you don't see works, you can rest assured that the requisite faith isn't<br>there either.<br><br>Faith begets works. So works is a good indication of faith.<br><br>The passage that comes to mind is James 2:14--26:<br><br>> What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does<br>> not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is<br>> poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them,<br>> "Go in peace, be warmed and filled," without giving them the things<br>> needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it<br>> does not have works, is dead.<br>><br>> But someone will say, "You have faith and I have works." Show me your<br>> faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.<br>> You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons<br>> believe---and shudder! Do you want to be shown, you foolish person,<br>> that faith apart from works is useless? Was not Abraham our father<br>> justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? You<br>> see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was<br>> completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says,<br>> "Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as<br>> righteousness"---and he was called a friend of God. You see that a<br>> person is justified by works and not by faith alone. And in the same<br>> way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she<br>> received the messengers and sent them out by another way? For as the<br>> body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is<br>> dead.<br><br>That's why faith without works is dead. The believer is *justified* by<br>his works. **Faith without works may be dead, but works without faith is<br>lame.**<br><br>How do we know this? Matthew 7:21--23:<br><br>> "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of<br>> heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.<br>> On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in<br>> your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works<br>> in your name?' And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you;<br>> depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'"<br><br>They did the works, but they didn't have the faith in Christ alone.<br>Works without faith will get you nowhere. It is the faith that produces<br>the works. The works are the sign that points to the faith. Works which<br>come from faith are the only works that count.<br><br>**TL;DR: It is faith that saves, but faith without works isn't faith<br>that will save you.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
