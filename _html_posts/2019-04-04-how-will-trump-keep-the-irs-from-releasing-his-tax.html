<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How will Trump keep the IRS from releasing his tax return now that<br>HW&M Chair has formally requested them under 6103 (audit sitting<br>president) as part of its program oversight responsibility? Does the IRS<br>need Trump\'s permission? Auditing**<br><br>First of all, IRS rule 6103(f) is not about auditing a sitting<br>president. It's about oversight over the IRS.<br><br>Congress can audit the IRS to ensure that they're doing their job. They<br>do this by collecting certain tax returns and making sure that if the<br>IRS did an audit, did they do it for the right reasons, and if they<br>didn't do an audit, that they failed to audit for the right reasons.<br><br>Contrary to what you may have heard in the mainstream media, this is all<br>about the IRS, and not about Trump. At least, that's what 6103(f) is<br>*supposed* to be about.<br><br>Congress is required to keep these tax returns confidential. However,<br>should another member of Congress get to see those returns, *they* could<br>release them because the seal of confidentiality has already been<br>broken.<br><br>I think the risk is too great to the President to not go down without a<br>fight.<br><br>So what will the President do? His personal legal team will file for an<br>injunction, requesting that the IRS not disclose those returns until<br>sufficient cause for each piece of information is given, and sufficient<br>proof is given that the returns can be kept confidential without being<br>leaked.<br><br>I say they do it just as they do with any classified documentation: no<br>electronic devices in the room, no paper in or out, you can come in and<br>view the documents, but you must leave them there, etc., any disclosure<br>will be severely punished, etc.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
