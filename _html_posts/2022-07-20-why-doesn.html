<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What gave you the idea that he *should*?<br><br>Is there something in Scripture which says that God will skip along in<br>front of his believers with his great cosmic leaf-blower, clearing our<br>path through life from any unpleasantness?<br><br>Seriously, what ever caused you to believe that being a Christian meant<br>a trouble-free life?<br><br>*Because the Bible says otherwise.* That's right, the Bible tells us to<br>*expect* the hard times, because they will come. Jesus told His<br>disciples that they should anticipate suffering. He said, "I have told<br>you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you<br>will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world" (John<br>16:33). Paul wrote, "In all our troubles my joy knows no bounds. For<br>when we came into Macedonia, this body of ours had no rest, but we were<br>harassed at every turn---conflicts on the outside, fears within" (2 Cor.<br>7:4-5). Peter left no doubt about difficulties in this Christian life<br>when he wrote, "Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial<br>you are suffering, as though something strange were happening to you.<br>But rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that<br>you may be overjoyed when His glory is revealed" (1 Pet. 4:12-13).<br><br>This is the consistent, unequivocal expectation we have been given by<br>the biblical writers, and yet we seem determined to rewrite the text.<br>Why? From where have we gotten this notion that God will take all our<br>troubles away?<br><br>Don't get me wrong, sometimes God intercedes in our lives. Sometimes he<br>does so greatly. And other times, when we call on him, he simply<br>responds with "trust me, be patient" (I've gotten that message before).<br><br>And trying to understand why is really difficult, because God's mind is<br>so much greater than ours. The Bible is exceedingly clear about this<br>point as well. Solomon wrote in Proverbs 25:2, "It is the glory of God<br>to conceal a matter. . . ." Isaiah 45:15 states, "Truly You are a God<br>who hides Himself." First Corinthians 2:11 says, "No one knows the<br>thoughts of God except the Spirit of God." Deuteronomy 29:29 reads, "The<br>secret things belong to the Lord our God" (NKJV). Ecclesiastes 11:5<br>proclaims, "As you do not know the path of the wind, or how the body is<br>formed in a mother's womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the<br>Maker of all things." Isaiah 55:8-9 teaches, "'For My thoughts are not<br>your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways,' declares the Lord. 'As<br>the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your<br>ways and My thoughts than your thoughts.'"<br><br>Clearly, Scripture tells us we lack the capacity to grasp God's infinite<br>mind or the way he intervenes in our lives. How arrogant of us to think<br>otherwise. Trying to analyze his omnipotence is like an baby in the womb<br>attempting to comprehend the splendor of God's creation. Romans 11:33<br>(NKJV) indicates that God's judgments are "unsearchable" and his ways<br>"past finding out." Similar language is found in 1 Corinthians 2:16:<br>"Who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct Him?" Unless<br>the Lord chooses to explain himself to us, which he does not often do,<br>his motivation and purposes are beyond the reach of humans.<br><br>But he has promised good for us, and he has kept every one of his<br>promises. "'For I know the plans I have for you,' says the Lord, 'plans<br>to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a<br>future.'" (Jeremiah 29:11 NIV).<br><br>I heard it said once that "Christians don't have a death wish, but they<br>do have an exit strategy." So rather than wondering about why God<br>doesn't take away your diseases, rejoice that God has given us the<br>greatest exit strategy for this life than anyone else ever could. And<br>only he could do it. Remember Jesus' words: "In this world, you will<br>have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world."<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why doesn\'t God remove disease from us, His believers?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
