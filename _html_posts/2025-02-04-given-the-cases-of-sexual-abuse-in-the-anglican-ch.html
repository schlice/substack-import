<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's re-phrase your question to see if we can gain some understanding:<br><br>***Given that sin exists in the world and that everyone is a sinner, how<br>can anyone evangelize?***<br><br>The answer is simple. It's in the Bible.<br><br>> *but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners,<br>> Christ died for us. \-- Romans 5:8 ESV*<br><br>And there it is. Christ died for us while we were sinners.<br><br>See, God doesn't wait for us to become perfect before He redeems us. We<br>don't take a bath before we take a shower. Christ didn't come to heal<br>the *well*, He came to heal the *sick*. He loves us and redeems us<br>while we are sinners. Not after.<br><br>\<br><br>Secondly, the Church has no moral authority. The church isn't the one<br>handing out moral dicta. The morality is God's morality. The church<br>is just the mouthpiece. And since the church is made up of people, the<br>church will always be marred by the stain of sin.<br><br>That doesn't mean that the church doesn't strive for holiness. That<br>doesn't mean the church doesn't use Biblical principles when it<br>encounters active sin in its members. But it does mean that the church<br>is nevertheless commanded to preach the Gospel regardless of how sinless<br>we personally are.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
