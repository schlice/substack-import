<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Taxes (and what you pay) are based on the state in which<br>you earn the income, not your state of legal residence.\<br>\<br>You generally have to file a return for your state of residence<br>(assuming it collects state income tax). If your state of legal<br>residence is Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington,<br>or Wyoming, you don\'t pay state income tax.\<br>\<br>In addition, New Hampshire and Tennessee only tax interest and dividend<br>income, not wages or earnings:\<br>]<br><br>- New Hampshire collects tax on interest and dividend income exceeding<br>  \$2,400 (\$4800 for joint filers) plus additional exemptions for age,<br>  blindness and disability.<br>- Tennessee collects tax on interest income from bonds, notes and<br>  dividends from stock exceeding \$1,250 (\$2,500 for joint filers).<br>  \1\<br><br>Generally, you have to file a nonresident state tax return if:\<br><br>- You earned income in a state that is not your resident state.<br>- Your employer incorrectly withheld taxes for a state that is not your<br>  resident state.<br>- You had gambling winnings in a state that is not your resident state.<br>- You owned rental property in a state that is not your resident state.<br>- You are a partner in a partnership, or a shareholder in an<br>  S-Corporation, that is based in a state that is not your resident<br>  state.<br>- You received income from an estate or trust that has interest in a<br>  state that is not your resident state. \2\\<br><br>You do not generally have to file a return for the state where your<br>employer is located *unless* you also work there. What matters is where<br>you earned the income, not where your employer is based.\<br>\<br>You generally have to file a part-year resident tax return for each<br>state you lived in:<br><br>- If you moved from one state to another state, you will probably need<br>  to file a part-year resident tax return for both states.<br>- If you lived in multiple states, you will probably need to file a<br>  part-year resident return for each state.\<br><br>\1\ [[Which states don\'t collect income<br>tax?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6c4ef4&url=https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1901267-which-states-don-t-collect-income-tax){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="intuit.com"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>\2\ [[State Income Tax Returns-Part-year, Resident,<br>Nonresident](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=10c219&url=http://www.efile.com/state-tax/state-income-tax/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="efile.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
