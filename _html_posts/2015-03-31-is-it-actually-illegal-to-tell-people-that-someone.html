<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [*Can you go to prison for this?* Generally speaking,<br>no. Your speech, while hurtful and possibly offensive, is legal. It\'s<br>protected by the First Amendment. It\'s nothing more than opinions,<br>since you can\'t really prove any of those things. Depending on how it<br>was done, it could be considered harassment, but in general, stating<br>your opinion about someone is legal.\<br>\<br>If it was done in a *threatening* way, you might be open for issues,<br>but if you simply stated your opinion in a wholly non-threatening way,<br>it\'s not likely that you broke any laws.\<br>\<br>*Can you be expelled from college?* Again, generally speaking, no,<br>you shouldn\'t be expelled from college for speaking your mind, which is<br>generally protected under the First Amendment. But colleges are not the<br>law, they are institutions of learning, and they can set their own<br>standards of conduct. If they find that your speech violated a set<br>standard of conduct, they can expel you based on their standards. But<br>that\'s up to the individual college, and not a reflection of law.\<br>\<br>*Can you be given a restraining order?* If a judge finds that there<br>is a threat or a perception that harm may come to the victim of your<br>verbal assault, then yes, a restraining order may be granted against<br>you. But some real or perceived threat would have to be shown in court.<br>Simply stating your opinion is generally not considered a threatening<br>statement. Like I said earlier, if you did it in a threatening way, then<br>that perception of threat could be grounds for a restraining order. The<br>manner in which the speech was delivered would determine whether or not<br>a reasonable person might be threatened by that<br>speech.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
