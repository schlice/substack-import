<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It appears that you are misinterpreting the statistics you provided.<br><br>It appears that you are looking at "injuries" and assuming that police<br>*intended* to only injure.<br><br>In the United States, when police use a firearm, they have already<br>reached the legal threshold above which they are authorized to use<br>deadly force. Deadly force is force that is reasonably assumed will<br>cause death or grave bodily injury.<br><br>Therefore, when police use a firearm, they have made the calculation<br>that they have the justification to use deadly force to stop an act.<br>Firearms in the United States are not employed when there is no<br>justification to use deadly force. When the police have reached the<br>highest level on the force continuum, then deadly force is authorized.<br><br>Additionally, police do not "shoot to kill" or "shoot to wound." Police<br>shoot to "stop the act." The most effective location to stop the act is<br>shooting in the center of mass of the body, which is in the center of<br>the torso.<br><br>In general, this also applies to other countries. They simply keep track<br>of scenarios in which shots were fired and the suspect was injured (i.e.<br>not killed). This, in general, indicates shots intended for the center<br>of mass, but missed. However, it could also indicate shots which hit the<br>center of mass but did not cause death. The statistics are unclear about<br>this point. Other countries, however, do authorize things like "warning<br>shots," which in general in the US, are not authorized.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
