<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is "it depends." The rules for meetings will be in the<br>Governing Documents, and not all Governing Documents are alike. There<br>may be a provision in your Governing Documents which permits the<br>president to suppress taking the minutes for the meeting.<br><br>But in the vast majority of cases, this cannot happen.<br><br>It all comes down to the structure of the HOA. Most HOAs in the United<br>States are 501(c)(4) non-profit corporations and as such, are governed<br>by some individual documents which make up what we call the Governing<br>Documents of the HOA, such as the Articles of Incorporation and the<br>Bylaws. These are standard corporate documents which dictate the<br>structure and operations of the legal entity we call a corporation. You<br>probably aren't even aware, but usually the "official" name of your HOA<br>isn't just your neighborhood name plus HOA. It's usually "neighborhood<br>name" HOA, Inc, because you are a corporation. You have a Board of<br>Directors, you have elections, you have officers, you have committees,<br>you have a budget, and you have Annual Meetings. All of these things are<br>governed by those articles of incorporation and bylaws, which direct how<br>all of those things are to happen.<br><br>You may have a rule in your Governing Documents which says that minutes<br>must only be taken during the Annual Meeting and are optional for other<br>Board meetings. You may not. Only your Governing Documents will tell you<br>for certain.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
