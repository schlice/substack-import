<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As a Board member myself for many years in multiple states, I can tell<br>you that the most successful Board members are there because they care<br>about the neighborhood. They want the neighborhood to succeed. They want<br>to ensure the money we pay in dues is actually spent in a responsible<br>way (i.e. finding the best, most reasonably-priced contractors, staying<br>on top of repairs, addressing issues as they appear, etc).<br><br>In my current neighborhood, we have a fair amount of rental houses. We<br>maintain contact with the rental agencies that manage those houses, and<br>we have a good relationship with them. During the intervening periods<br>when the units are vacant, we watch for issues at the houses. We have<br>physically intervened in cases such as, for example, a sprinkler line<br>burst and was shooting water all over the property (but it was vacant at<br>the time).<br><br>There was another time when one of our homeowners was out of town on<br>vacation and had inadvertently left his garage door open. Using our HOA<br>contact list, we were able to get in touch with the homeowner on<br>vacation, and he gave permission to close his garage door, which I did<br>using the "push the button and run out of the garage" method.<br><br>The most effective Board members serve because they are invested in<br>their neighborhoods and want to see them succeed. Yes, it's absolutely<br>true that some people who serve on a Board don't understand why the<br>Board exists, or think of the Board in an inappropriate way (as if the<br>Board is the "neighborhood police" which it is not). But usually, the<br>Board is made up of multiple people and usually, not all of them think<br>that way.<br><br>The problem is that while many complain about the HOA, not many will<br>give of their time to do something about it. This is reflective of<br>society as a whole, so it's no surprise. Especially now with social<br>media, many people can very easily complain with very little effort.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
