<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [To be specific, you didn\'t do anything wrong legally. She<br>ate at least once that day, and courts have ruled that \"sending a child<br>to bed without dinner\" is not \"cruel and unusual punishment\" assuming<br>the child has eaten at least one other meal that day and the pattern is<br>not continuous (i.e. daily).\<br>\<br>However, as a parenting philosophy, it doesn\'t make sense to deny food<br>because the child isn\'t following the phone rules. If the rule is \"no<br>phones at the table,\" the violation of that rule results in the phone<br>being taken away for a period of time, not the dinner.\<br>\<br>You might even try to forestall the issue entirely by placing one of<br>these near (but not at) the dinner table\<br>\<br>]<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-4f5a95e8e188185a8c42658964e6d952){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-4f5a95e8e188185a8c42658964e6d952" master_w="300"<br>master_h="259"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-be6563d95eabde58c0f357ba0d5cd03b){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-be6563d95eabde58c0f357ba0d5cd03b" master_w="640"<br>master_h="440"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>All phones must be checked in to the phone stand before dinner, no one<br>may respond to their phones, and as an added bonus, the phones charge<br>while you eat!\<br>\<br>Additionally, you can say that eating at the table is a privilege which<br>can be removed; i.e. the child can be made to eat in his room by himself<br>and not with the family. But in all cases, the most appropriate<br>punishment is the removal of the phone, not the removal of the meal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
