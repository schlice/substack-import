<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [As most of the other posters already said it really<br>depends on whether or not what you said in your post was true. As long<br>as everything that you said was true, you are completely within your<br>rights to say it. This is the entire crux of the First Amendment. As<br>long as what you say is true, you have every right to say it. This is<br>why online message boards are so powerful. This is the information that<br>you need in order to battle a defamation charge. The truth of your<br>statement is what will protect you. Contact the State Bar Association<br>and report his ethics violation.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
