They<br>think that government employees will always work for the public good,<br>and would never intentionally over-assess a property. Sometimes,<br>over-assessment is simply due to math errors. It could be that the<br>assessor has an outdated, incorrect or inaccurate assessment of the<br>actual property. But many Americans simply pay the difference because<br>the cost (in time and money) to get the property re-assessed is too high<br>to justify when compared to the amount of money you will actually save.<br><br>The process by which you can appeal the assessor's decision is lengthy<br>and cumbersome, while the actual reduction in taxes you see (while still<br>qualifying as a reduction) may not be worth the effort to get it<br>re-assessed and reduced.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
