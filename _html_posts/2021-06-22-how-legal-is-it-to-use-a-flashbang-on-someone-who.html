<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, if you are in fear for your life, you can use any force,<br>including deadly force, to preserve your life.<br><br>The problem with a flashbang is that they are indiscriminate, and they<br>are not 100% harmless to people around them. You risk injuring yourself<br>and the other people inside your home, not to mention that a flashbang<br>doesn't work like it does in a video game; it does grenade-level damage<br>to your property. It's going to cost you so much more to throw a<br>flashbang than it's worth.<br><br>Actual military and LE flashbangs are considered "destructive devices"<br>and are not available on the commercial market. However, there are<br>civilian versions of flashbangs which consist of a charge in a cardboard<br>canister, and these are essentially classified as "pyrotechnic devices."<br>They are less destructive and quieter than the real thing (125 db vs 175<br>db) but would still be pretty convincing in a home defense scenario.<br><br>[[These flashbang grenades are legal for<br>civilians](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=29385e&url=https://www.wearethemighty.com/mighty-tactical/flashbang-grenades-legal-for-civilians/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wearethemighty.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>TL;DR: don't use real flashbangs. Get some civilian-version ones;<br>they'll still do the job against the uninitiated.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How legal is it to use a flashbang on someone who is robbing my house?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
