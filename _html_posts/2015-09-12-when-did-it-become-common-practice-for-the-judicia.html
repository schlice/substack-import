<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The SCOTUS does not \"create\" law where there was no<br>existing law.\<br>\<br>What they sometimes do is read ideas into the Constitution where they<br>did not exist before.\<br>\<br>For example, *Roe v. Wade* established a \"right to privacy\" which does<br>not exist word-for-word in the Constitution. Nevertheless, cobbling case<br>law together and using the existing principles within the Constitution,<br>the SCOTUS at the time found that there was an assumed right to<br>privacy.\<br>\<br>Case law can sometimes change how an existing law is interpreted, and<br>while that interpretation may be in line with the Constitution, it may<br>not be what legislators intended. That said, it does not \"create\" law<br>when laws did not previously exist.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
