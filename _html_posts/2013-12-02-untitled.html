<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [You have an interesting story. I don\'t often hear of<br>peoples\' MS stories starting with narcolepsy. Being genetic and running<br>in your family, I would imagine that your narcolepsy is genuine, likely<br>caused by a genetic mutation passed down your family lineage.\<br>\<br>The rest of the story, however, is intriguing. Your symptoms outside of<br>the narcolepsy are definitely ones experienced by MS patients. The<br>balance and coordination, memory and bladder issues are definitely<br>MS-like. However, knowing your family history of genetic brain<br>mutations, I would look very closely at the source of these other<br>symptoms. MS is often called \"the Great Imitator\" since none of its<br>symptoms are unique to it alone.\<br>\<br>MRI technology has come a long way in 10 years. So much so that the<br>definition of clinical MS has changed so that a conclusive finding of<br>clinical MS can be made with a neurological exam, a thorough vetting of<br>all of the other potential causes for the symptoms, and a MRI scan<br>showing all of the clinical signs of someone with MS.\<br>\<br>My suggestion for you would be to see your neurologist and run down this<br>list with him. I would expect to see a full neurologic exam, a \"little<br>white spot\" assay, which is basically a battery of blood tests to rule<br>out other causes for white spots on an MRI, and the 1.5T high-field MRI<br>exam, which should only take about 45 minutes \"in the tube\" if you<br>have a good radiology crew. I have such a good crew here that by the<br>time I have re-dressed and an ready to leave, my images are already on<br>CD waiting for me. Of course, the radiologists report follows the next<br>day. One way or another, you should be able to find the source of your<br>symptoms. If you don\'t have a good neurologist, it is time to get one.<br>You need someone who specializes in MS and related neurological<br>diseases, or who is in a practice where such doctors also work, for easy<br>consultation.\<br>\<br>Good luck to you, and if I can be of any more assistance, please let me<br>know. As we say in the MS world, \"keep s\'myelin!\"<br>:-)]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-possible-link-between-narcolepsy-and-multiple-sclerosis/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
