<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>God is not physical. There is no physical test in this world which can<br>detect God. So that's not the way we can argue that God exists.<br><br>But there are certain things in the world that we *can* detect, and<br>through repetition and observation, we know where those things come<br>from. So we can draw a logical inference based on what we already<br>observe in the world.<br><br>\<br><br>*The Beginning of the Universe\*<br>We argue that God exists because God *must* exist. There is no other way<br>that the universe could have come into existence.<br><br>- We know through scientific investigation that the universe had a<br>  beginning. The Big Bang, the second law of thermodynamics, the<br>  radiation echoes from the Big Bang, red shift of galactic objects,<br>  galaxy seeds, and a host of other scientific observations tell us that<br>  the universe had a beginning.<br>- The Law of Causality tells us that **everything which has a beginning<br>  has a cause.** Even the great skeptic David Hume said, "I never<br>  asserted so absurd a proposition as that something should arise<br>  without a cause." Therefore, we know that something *caused* the<br>  universe to come into existence.<br>- Einstein's theory of General Relativity (which has been proven<br>  accurate to at least five decimal places today) tells us that there is<br>  an *absolute beginning* *to all time, space, and matter* in<br>  the universe. This tells us a few things:<br>  - If there was a beginning to time, there was no time before that.<br>    There is no "before" before that, because time did not exist before<br>    that.<br>  - If there was a beginning to space, then space did not exist before<br>    that. There was no place for anything to exist, because space did<br>    not exist.<br>  - If there was a beginning to matter, then matter and energy did not<br>    exist before that. It wasn't in another form, because there was no<br>    space for it to exist, and there was no place in time for it to<br>    exist.<br><br>*So what caused the universe to come into existence?**\*<br>We know that there must be a cause. The Law of Causality says that<br>everything which has a beginning has a cause. Something, therefore,<br>caused the universe to come into existence. It didn't just "happen" by<br>random chance; chance isn't a cause.<br><br>We know that the universe did not create itself, because that's an<br>analytically false statement. You would have to exist before you existed<br>in order to create yourself.<br><br>Therefore, the only other remaining choice is that the universe was<br>created by an intelligent mind. Everything which has been created has a<br>Creator. Therefore, the universe has a Creator.<br><br>\<br><br>*But why God?**\*<br>We can look at the evidence we do have and determine that an<br>intelligence created life on earth. We know this because of *specified<br>complexity*.<br><br>Darwinists and evolutionists insist that we evolved from single-cell<br>organisms in some primordial goo and then over billions of years, poof!<br>here we are. But the supreme problem for Darwinists is not explaining<br>how all life forms evolved. The supreme problem for Darwinists is<br>explaining the origin of the *first* life. **For unguided, naturalistic<br>macroevolution to be true, the first life must have generated<br>spontaneously from nonliving chemicals.** Unfortunately for Darwinists,<br>the first life---indeed any form of life---is by no means "simple." This<br>became abundantly clear in 1953 when James Watson and Francis Crick<br>discovered DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the chemical that encodes<br>instructions for building and replicating all living things.<br><br>DNA has a helical structure that looks like a twisted ladder. The sides<br>of the ladder are formed by alternating deoxyribose and phosphate<br>molecules, and the rungs of the ladder consist of a specific order of<br>four nitrogen bases. These nitrogen bases are adenine, thymine,<br>cytosine, and guanine, which commonly are represented by the letters A,<br>T, C, and G. These letters comprise what is known as the **four-letter<br>genetic alphabet.** This alphabet is identical to our English alphabet<br>in terms of its ability to communicate a message, except that the<br>genetic alphabet has only four letters instead of twenty-six. Just as<br>the specific order of the letters in this sentence communicates a unique<br>message, the specific order of A, T, C, and G within a living cell<br>determines the unique genetic makeup of that living entity. Another name<br>for that message or information, whether it's in a sentence or in DNA,<br>is *specified complexity.* In other words, not only is it complex---it<br>also contains a specific message.<br><br>What we have observed is that nature never produces messages. We<br>have observed that messages only come from intelligence. We know<br>this because all of our observational evidence tells us that every time<br>we see a message, we know it comes from intelligence. And scientists<br>know this too, *they simply refuse to apply their science to the<br>creation of life*. How do we know they know? Because SETI exists. SETI<br>(the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) forever scans the skies,<br>listening for certain patterns in radio waves. Any idea what kind of<br>patterns they're looking for? Yep, you guessed it, *specified<br>complexity*. In the movie *Contact,* Jodie Foster plays a scientist who<br>is part of the SETI research team. In the movie, Foster gets extremely<br>excited when her antenna picks up radio waves that appear to have an<br>intelligent pattern, "One, two, three, five, seven, eleven . . . those<br>are primes!" she exclaims (meaning prime numbers). "That can't be<br>natural phenomena!" Indeed, random radio waves can be naturally<br>produced, but those that contain a message always have an intelligent<br>source. Prime numbers, from one to 101 in order, constitute a message<br>that only comes from an intelligent being.<br><br>So the logic in where we have come to now looks like this:<br><br>- Messages only come from intelligence<br>- DNA is a message.<br>- Therefore, DNA must have come from intelligence.<br><br>This isn't an argument from ignorance, and it isn't a "god-of-the-gaps"<br>fallacy. It is a logical conclusion based on observation and<br>repetition---the scientific method in action.<br><br>It is actually Darwinists who are committing a "god-of-the-gaps"<br>fallacy, and evolution is their god. Darwinists believe, *by faith,*<br>that our minds arose from mindless matter without intelligent<br>intervention. We say it is by faith because it contradicts all<br>scientific observation, which demonstrates not only that messages come<br>from intelligence, but also that an effect cannot be greater than its<br>cause (another facet of the Law of Causality). You can't give what you<br>haven't got, yet materialists/Darwinists believe that dead,<br>unintelligent matter has produced intelligent life. This is like<br>believing that the Library of Congress resulted from an explosion in a<br>printing shop, or that a tornado blew through an arboretum and a 747<br>ended up on the other side.<br><br>\<br><br>These, among many other scientific observations, are the ways that you<br>can cogently argue for an intelligent Creator. Now, it's worth noting<br>that we haven't even touched on which Creator is the right one. The only<br>thing we have proven is that a Creator is necessary, and must exist.<br>*Learning about* that Creator is the realm of religion, but we are not<br>even there yet. One step at a time. First, let's prove the necessity and<br>existence of a Creator, and then we'll take the next step and describe<br>that Creator.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
