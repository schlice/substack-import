<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human<br>Rights](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=aeca24&url=http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="un.org"}]{.qlink_container} states (emphasis mine):<br><br>> Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this<br>> right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and **to<br>> seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media** and<br>> regardless of frontiers.<br><br>Clearly, the writers of this Article intended that any media sources are<br>protected, because it allows for the ability to seek (look for), receive<br>(get), and impart (pass on) information through any media. This covers<br>both the people looking for information, and the people providing it<br>(such as media outlets).<br><br>Remember, though, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not<br>legally binding on any nation-state. It is a "common standard" that all<br>member nations pledge to work towards. The individual nation-state is<br>still free to choose to incorporate these rights into their own state<br>actions, or not.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
