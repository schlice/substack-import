<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Saul Alinsky's seminal work, *Rules for Radicals,* says "never let a<br>good crisis go to waste." I see you've read his work.<br><br>Using a tragedy (a shooting at a parade) to push your political agenda<br>(removing firearms from law-abiding citizens) is poor form.<br><br>First, there is no correlation between criminals committing crimes and<br>law-abiding citizens owning firearms for their personal protection.<br><br>Second, when do we start blaming the criminal instead of the tool?<br><br>Third, why is only "gun violence" something we need to worry about?<br>Can't we also worry about "sexual assault" and the recent string of<br>"burglary in broad daylight"? Aren't there other things, things which<br>are far more destructive and devastating, that we can devote our<br>attention to fixing?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
