<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is it possible for a veteran that was dishonorably discharged<br>(from the United States Air Force for rape), to be permitted to live in<br>a VA sober living home free of charge?**<br><br>Veterans who received a dishonorable discharge are not entitled to VA<br>healthcare benefits. In most cases, if a veteran was dishonorably<br>discharged, there is no recourse to receiving medical care. However,<br>sometimes care may be offered on a temporary, emergency basis when<br>substance abuse or mental health are issues. If the veteran is later<br>found to be ineligible, the veteran will be responsible for the costs of<br>that healthcare.<br><br>I can't speak to this particular veteran's situation, but it sounds like<br>the discharge was not officially categorized as dishonorable. It may<br>have been under Other Than Honorable (OTH) conditions, or may have been<br>a Bad Conduct Discharge, but it was likely a character of discharge that<br>was something other than honorable but also something other than<br>dishonorable. In those circumstances, the veteran may still receive VA<br>healthcare for service-connected conditions, or conditions made worse by<br>service. Other VA benefits may not be available to this category of<br>discharge, but healthcare for service connected issues generally remains<br>intact.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
