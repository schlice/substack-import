<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It will be a very long time.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-bd0265e6e22d074fc46df5d1b1564ae9){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-bd0265e6e22d074fc46df5d1b1564ae9" master_w="128"<br>master_h="164"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Originally, sex separated toilets emanated from the idea that a woman's<br>place was in the home. In mid-20th century United States, this wasn't a<br>means to "keep women down," but to "keep women *protected*", because<br>the common understanding was that women were the "fairer sex." Because<br>they were physically weaker, the common thought went, they shouldn't<br>have to be subjected to the rigors of work outside of the home.<br><br>But emanating from that belief (however erroneous it may have been),<br>allowing women into the workplace meant that they needed to be<br>"shielded" from the "harsh realities" of the working environment, and<br>needed a "private retreat" to where they could escape: the women's<br>restroom. It wasn't to "keep women down." It was to protect the "fairer<br>sex" from the horrors of the working world.<br><br>Indeed, at the time, separate spaces for women were being introduced<br>throughout society: women's reading rooms were incorporated into public<br>libraries; separate train cars were established for women, keeping them<br>in the back to "shield" them in the event of a crash; and the<br>aforementioned sex separated toilets. The suggested layouts of those<br>women's retreats/restrooms were designed to mimic the comforts of home<br>(think curtains and chaise lounges). If you are my age and you managed<br>to sneak in to some women's restrooms after hours as I did in my youth,<br>you'd find a much cleaner, better-smelling space (even one I found with<br>a couch) which actually reflects this aging reality.<br><br>Today, they remain, not because of bigotry or systemic sexism, but<br>building codes. Depending on a building's level of occupation, a<br>certain number of toilets must be provided, and building codes still<br>specify separate spaces for men and women. In many cases, those building<br>codes mandate a minimum number of toilets and urinals for each sex.<br>These building codes often result in more facilities being made<br>available for men than for women (based on projected occupancy). In some<br>cases (such as arenas or theaters or auditoriums), the required ratio of<br>toilets does favor females. However, for the overwhelming majority of<br>facilities in our day-to-day lives such as nightclubs, restaurants,<br>retail stores or educational facilities, the ratios are the same across<br>genders, which has the knock-on effect of the long lines for women's<br>facilities which have become so ubiquitous in American culture.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-dc32278e2e1dc57f9d8b4b2596c069ad){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-dc32278e2e1dc57f9d8b4b2596c069ad" master_w="589"<br>master_h="334"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(Image courtesy*<br>[*Saniflow*(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a4ac22&url=https://www.saniflowcorp.com/saniflow-blog/1_restrooms-designed-with-women-in-mind.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="saniflowcorp.com"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br>The idea that we need to protect women from harm hasn't changed despite<br>the change in the conversation. That idea has stuck around in American<br>culture, and the trans bathroom debate has reignited those smoldering<br>embers when we nearly had them extinguished.<br><br>I would hesitate to call it bigotry or sexism when it's really just<br>cultural affectations which have been incorporated into long-lasting<br>building codes which are *very difficult* to change and require a great<br>deal of effort to re-engineer, and a great deal of time to incorporate.<br>And the desire to protect women hasn't faded, and I doubt that it will<br>any time soon.<br><br>So for non-individual restrooms, I suspect that sex-separated restrooms<br>will remain for quite some time. Even if a decision was made today to<br>change them into unisex restrooms, it would still take at least ten<br>years before you see them being incorporated into new buildings, and<br>retrofits will take longer still.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
