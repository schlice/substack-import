<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The United States foreign policy is not based on *forcing* other<br>countries to agree with our way of life. Our foreign policy is based on<br>*convincing* other countries that it is in their best interest to do<br>things that more closely coincide with our way of life. The easiest way<br>to do that is to stop trading with them. We are the world\'s superpower.<br>We are not, however, as you say, the \"humanitarian and global police<br>force.\" We get no money from the world to be their police, so whatever<br>military action we take has to be in *our* best interest, not just<br>*theirs*.<br><br>And we have *never* invaded a country without either a) provocation, or<br>b) a direct and grave threat to national security, or both. If they are<br>not a direct threat to us, we do not \"invade\" anywhere. They may<br>be a threat to their own people, but that, to be fair, is not actually<br>our concern. As I already mentioned, we are not the world\'s police<br>force. Unless we are asked, we don\'t just drop in and impose our values<br>on a country. If a sovereign nation requested assistance, we would<br>provide it. If US interests were at risk, we would protect them.<br>Otherwise, we don\'t just invade other countries. We have neither the<br>time, the inclination, or the money to be the world\'s morality police.<br><br>(EDIT) Let me qualify the \"we never invade\" statement. In the<br>discussion around foreign policy, we do not invade other countries. In<br>practice, what some administrations have done in furtherance of their<br>particular interpretation of that foreign policy objective have held<br>slightly less closely to the original meaning of \"we never invade.\"<br>For instance, the Clinton administration felt that \"humanitarian aid\"<br>was not \"invasion\" no matter how it looked. And we could provide<br>\"humanitarian assistance\" whether it was requested by the host country<br>or not. I do not necessarily agree with those interpretations of foreign<br>policy. But as a military officer, I deploy where the boss says to<br>deploy, regardless of how I personally interpret US foreign policy<br>objectives.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
