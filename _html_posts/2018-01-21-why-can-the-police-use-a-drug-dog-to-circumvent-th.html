<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why can the police use a drug dog to circumvent the 4th amendment by<br>creating probable cause? It seems unconstitutional that they can<br>manufacture probable cause to allow them to search your car when you do<br>not consent due to principle.**<br><br>I can understand how the use of the drug dog on the outside of your car<br>may seem like a circumvention of the 4th Amendment.<br><br>But the Supreme Court does not agree.<br><br>One of the key exceptions to 4th Amendment protection is what is known<br>as the "plain sight" test. For example, if an officer approaches your<br>car and a doobie is clearly visible in the ashtray (yes, some cars still<br>have ashtrays), the officer now has probable cause to search your car,<br>as the drugs are clearly visible from the exterior of the car. The<br>"plain smell" test falls into the same category as the "plain sight"<br>test; in other words, if it can be smelled from outside of the car<br>without impacting the vehicle at all (i.e. searching the interior of the<br>car), then the "plain smell" test is passed, and the 4th Amendment does<br>not apply. For example, if you roll down your window and the officer can<br>smell marijuana, this provides the probable cause to search the vehicle<br>without a warrant, as this is part of the "plain smell" exception to 4th<br>Amendment protections.<br><br>The use of a drug dog around the exterior of the vehicle is similarly<br>covered by the "plain smell" exception to the 4th Amendment.<br><br>What is not covered is elongating a traffic stop for more<br>time than the stop would normally take **in order to request a drug<br>dog**. For example, an officer cannot make you wait for hours for a drug<br>dog to arrive in order to perform a plain smell search on the outside of<br>your car. Any such delay is grounds for dismissal of the charges. If a<br>drug dog can arrive in the same amount of time that a normal traffic<br>stop would take, then the dog is allowed. If the dog's arrival elongates<br>the duration of the stop at all, the dog (and the results of the dog's<br>search, including any probable cause produced because of the dog) are<br>inadmissible.<br><br>Now, if you are stopped by a K9 officer, if one can arrive within<br>minutes, or if you are at a roadside checkpoint where a drug dog is<br>present, you're most likely outta luck. If this happens to you, make<br>sure you provide all these details to your lawyer and see what you can<br>do.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
