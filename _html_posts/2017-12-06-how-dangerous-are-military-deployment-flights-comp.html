<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Flying as a passenger on a military transport is no more or less<br>dangerous than flying on a commercial airliner from an aircraft safety<br>point of view, but there are several factors that make military travel<br>slightly safer in other respects than civilian air travel.<br><br>On military transport, when you are not sitting in jump seats, you are<br>seated backwards. Studies have shown that sitting facing rearward is a<br>safer position to sit, as it minimizes blunt force traumas which may<br>occur if the aircraft lurches during landing, or if there is<br>a...ahem..."sudden deceleration" from an "unscheduled landing." If that<br>particular unscheduled landing is survivable, you have a better chance<br>of minimizing injuries by sitting facing rearward. But John Q. Public<br>likes to ride in their airplanes the same way they ride in the bus or in<br>the car: facing the front, even though it is demonstrably safer to face<br>the rear while flying.<br><br>Additionally, military airfields are significantly less crowded than<br>commercial airports, so you are less likely to encounter ground<br>impingement at a military airfield.<br><br>Finally (and not to be terribly underestimated), because the general<br>public does not ride on military aircraft, there is far less threat of<br>nefarious or unruly characters on board than on a civilian passenger<br>plane.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
