<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>My training sergeant said, on our first day, "People don\'t become<br>police officers to be loved. If you want to be loved, be a firefighter."<br><br>Firefighters universally come to save you. Police come to either protect<br>you, or send you to jail. Firefighters are generally fit and healthy<br>because of the physicality of their jobs, police are sometimes not<br>required to meet fitness standards. Finally, police officers remind<br>people that there are consequences for their actions. That doesn\'t sit<br>well with people, even if what they did was actually wrong.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
