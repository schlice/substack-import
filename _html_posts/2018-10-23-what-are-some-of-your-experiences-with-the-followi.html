<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are some of your experiences with the following MS medications,<br>Copaxone (glatiramer acetate), Gilenya (Fingolimod), and/or Tecfidera<br>(dimethyl fumarate)?**<br><br>I got two out of the three: Copaxone and Gilenya.<br><br>I started my MS journey on Copaxone (the once-a-day version; they didn't<br>have the higher dose back then). I wasn't squeamish about needles so it<br>wasn't a big deal. I only used the auto injector when injecting into my<br>"love handle" areas and under my arms because it made one-handed<br>injections easier.<br><br>I never had any problems on the Copaxone. It did exactly what it claimed<br>to do. It slowed disease progression and prevented new lesions from<br>forming. Copaxone worked great, until it didn't. After being on it for<br>about seven years, it simply stopped working, and my disease began to<br>progress again. I developed new lesions in my brain and weakness on the<br>right side of my body, and my doctor and I agreed that this was bad<br>enough that it was time to switch.<br><br>I spent 18 months on Tysabri, which was also great until it wasn't, and<br>that's when I switched to Gilenya.<br><br>It was my first experience with an oral MS medication. It slowed my<br>heart rate to a worrying degree, so much so that I'd drink "rocket fuel"<br>(aka Diet Mountain Dew) to balance it out, which surprisingly worked<br>pretty well. Nevertheless, those side effects eventually subsided.<br>Gilenya has produced some, er, "lower GI sensitivity" in me, but since<br>that's not a common occurrence, no one is chalking it up to Gilenya but<br>me. Your mileage may vary. I'm managing it with supplements and visits<br>to a naturalist, and it is adequate. So far, I'm almost 5 years into<br>Gilenya, and it has been working very well for me. "Very well" means "no<br>new lesions, no active lesions, no visible disease progression." We're<br>calling that a win.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
