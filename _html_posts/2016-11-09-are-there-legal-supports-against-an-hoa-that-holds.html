<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Most definitely.<br><br>Above all else, HOA\'s must apply the rules and regulations in the<br>neighborhood equitably amongst all of the homeowners. If your HOA is<br>unfairly targeting one neighbor over another, it is likely that the<br>court would find those HOA\'s enforcement actions to be illegitimate and<br>strike them down.<br><br>However, as with everything, the real answer is it depends. If, for<br>example, the homeowner in question has failed to pay his dues for a<br>certain amount of time, the HOA may, as part of its enforcement action,<br>stop providing one or more dues-funded services to that homeowner. If<br>the HOA was withholding services as a form of punishment for failing to<br>pay dues, that might be seen in a court as acceptable.<br><br>The particular punishment in question must also be listed in the fee<br>schedule in the rules and regulations. The HOA board can\'t simply make<br>these things up as they go along.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
