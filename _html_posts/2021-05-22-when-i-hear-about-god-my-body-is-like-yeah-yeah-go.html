<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Our human bodies are flawed. They are sinful. They desire to do what is<br>easy, expedient, and pleasurable, not what is pleasing to God. In other<br>words, left to our own devices, we would live in sin constantly, because<br>that's what our bodies tell us they want. It's *easy* to sin. It's<br>*easy* to ignore God and how he wants you to live.<br><br>Our feelings can easily lead us astray. The Bible even tells us to be on<br>guard and not trust our feelings.<br><br>> He who trusts in his own heart is a fool, but he who walks in wisdom<br>> will be saved. --- Proverbs 28:26 KJV<br>><br>> The way of fools seems right to them, but the wise listen to advice.<br>> --- Proverbs 12:15<br><br>Feelings are not evil *per se*, but they could lead us easily into<br>sinful behavior, and even into ignoring God.<br><br>Feelings are a good indicator of what's going on inside of us, and yours<br>are indicating that there is a struggle in you. Your feelings should<br>inform you of what's going on inside you, but God never intended your<br>feelings to *lead* you. That's his job. He wants that job; he never<br>intended your feelings to control you.<br><br>Living by faith means letting God lead you, not your emotions. Instead<br>of focusing on your feelings, focus on what you *know* is right:<br><br>> Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble,<br>> whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is<br>> admirable---if anything is excellent or praiseworthy---think about<br>> such things. --- Phillipians 4:8 NIV<br><br>Feelings are a *gauge*, not a *guide*. Live by *faith*, not by feelings.<br><br>> So do not fear, for I am with you;\<br>> do not be dismayed, for I am your God.\<br>> I will strengthen you and help you;\<br>> I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. --- Isaiah 41:10 NIV<br><br>Emotions are powerful, and can be amazing and terrifying. But living in<br>faith means understanding the source of our emotions, and not allowing<br>them to control us.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**When I hear about god my body is like (yeah yeah god yuh) as if my<br>body dislike\'s him or doesn\'t care. I try to be like God is good and<br>loving but my body\'s feelings is just negative towards him. I\'m very<br>concerned?**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
