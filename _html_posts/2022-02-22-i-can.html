<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The reason why you don't like the phrase is because you know definitions<br>of words. You can understand that people don't have *individual truths*.<br><br>What you're seeing is the assault by today's society on the concept of<br>truth. The ideas of "pluralism" and "tolerance" are a direct result of<br>that assault.<br><br>Truth is universal. Truth is undeniable. Truth is unchanging. Absolute<br>truth exists, and we can know it.<br><br>There is no such thing as "my truth" and "your truth." There is only<br>*one truth.* The Law of Noncontradiction says very clearly that<br>something is either true, or it is not true. There is no third choice.<br><br>Here's a few other facts about truth:<br><br>- Truth is *discovered*, not *invented*. Gravity existed before the<br>  apple fell on Newton's head.<br>- Truth is *transcultural and timeless*. It is true for all people at<br>  all times in all places. 1+1=2 for all people everywhere, and has been<br>  true for all of history.<br>- Truth is *unchanging*, **even though our beliefs about truth may<br>  change**. The orbits of the planets did not change after we began to<br>  believe that the sun was the center of the solar system instead of the<br>  earth. The orbits did not change, only our *belief* about the orbits<br>  changed.<br>  - And as a corollary to that last point, belief does not change facts,<br>    regardless of how sincere you are in your belief. I may sincerely<br>    believe that the earth is the center of the universe, but that just<br>    makes me sincerely mistaken.<br><br>TL;DR: Contrary *beliefs* are possible, but contrary *truths* are not.<br>We can *believe* that everything is true, but that doesn't *make*<br>everything true. We can *believe* that people have their own individual<br>truths, but that doesn't *make* all of them true.<br><br>So "speak your belief." Don't "speak your truth," because there is no<br>such thing as "your truth."<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I can't stand the phrase "speak my truth", can you give suggestions for<br>anything else we can say for that concept?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
