Just because you don't like a book doesn't mean<br>you should clog your toilet over it.<br><br>If you own a book you're not interested in reading, you should perhaps<br>donate it. Maybe someone else might enjoy reading it more than you did.<br><br>A better option would be to burn it. Just be aware of your<br>municipality's outdoor burning rules, if you have any in place at the<br>time. I wouldn't advise burning the book inside the house.<br><br>It's just a book. The pages on which the words are printed aren't<br>sacred, or imbued with any special magic. Feel free to dispose of it in<br>any way you like.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why don't people flush the Bible down the toilet?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
