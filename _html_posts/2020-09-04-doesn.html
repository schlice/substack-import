<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Doesn\'t \"From my cold, dead hands\" sound a lot better than \"I lost<br>it at a boating accident\"? Why the latter?**<br><br>One or the other of those two phrases would be uttered if some<br>government agent knocked on your door and ordered you to turn over all<br>of your firearms because somehow either the Constitution was invalidated<br>or the 2nd Amendment was repealed.<br><br>You could either shout, "You'll get my guns when you pry them from my<br>cold, dead hands!" and they might take you up on your offer.<br><br>Or, you could say, "Oh, sorry, I had my entire gun collection out with<br>me on a deep-sea fishing trip (while simultaneously ignoring why you<br>would have your entire gun collection on a deep-sea fishing vessel) when<br>a rogue wave suddenly washed them all overboard."<br><br>Presumably, the 4th and 5th Amendments were still a thing in this<br>hypothetical example and the police still needed a warrant to search<br>your house. In order to get a warrant, they would somehow need to<br>possess information proving that you had committed a crime, which in<br>this wild hypothetical would mean that gun possession had<br>unconstitutionally become illegal (*ex post facto*), and they had actual<br>evidence that you had said firearms in your possession. While they might<br>be (illegally) able to obtain purchase records to show that at one time<br>you bought them, there is no requirement to register firearms, so there<br>is no requirement to report them lost to anyone.<br><br>So unless you committed a crime, there likely isn't a warrant to search<br>your house, so no one is getting your firearms. So the second phrase is<br>better because you are legally safe. And you don't die.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
