<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Legally, assisted suicide is a suicide committed with the<br>aid of another person. Physician assisted suicide is where a doctor<br>assists by providing the knowledge and the means for a person to end<br>their own life.\<br>\<br>Euthanasia is slightly different from physician assisted suicide. In<br>euthanasia, the physician actually administers the drugs themselves to<br>end the person\'s life. In physician assisted suicide, the physician<br>provides the drugs and the information on how to use them, but the<br>patient administers the drugs himself.\<br>\<br>If you provide someone with the information they need for the express<br>purpose for them to use to commit suicide, knowing that they want to<br>commit suicide, you could be charged with assisting a suicide if it is<br>illegal in your jurisdiction. I think that I would avoid providing<br>anyone information on how to take their own life as this is a<br>questionable legal area.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
