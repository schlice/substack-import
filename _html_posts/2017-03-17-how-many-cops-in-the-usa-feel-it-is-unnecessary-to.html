<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I want to pass on an answer by [[R. Justin<br>Freeman](https://www.quora.com/profile/R-Justin-Freeman)]{.qlink_container}<br>that I read several years ago. It explains *exactly* why some police<br>officers may not want to criminally charge a marijuana user. Please read<br>this answer:<br><br>[[R. Justin Freeman\'s answer to What do police officers think about<br>legalizing drugs? Would it make their jobs harder or<br>easier?](https://www.quora.com/What-do-police-officers-think-about-legalizing-drugs-Would-it-make-their-jobs-harder-or-easier/answer/R-Justin-Freeman)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Some notable sections of his amazing answer (emphasis mine):<br><br>> \L\et\'s make what I think is an important bifurcation \[when<br>> discussing drugs\]: Marijuana, and everything else. Now, let\'s get<br>> something on the table before the screaming starts. I despise<br>> marijuana. Other than meth, it has got to be, on balance, the<br>> filthiest drug on the street - in a literal sense. If you buy from a<br>> typical low level dealer, I can almost guarantee that your product has<br>> been inside a sweaty sock. Or worse. And there is a definite slacker<br>> culture which has adopted its use that I have unconcealed contempt for<br>> in general. However, if I had a policymaking throw switch, I would<br>> legalize, regulate, and tax marijuana. Yes, even for recreational<br>> use - let\'s just skip the charade of faux glaucoma and Generalized<br>> Anxiety Disorder epidemics.<br>><br>> There are tons of reasons for this. I could cite the quality control,<br>> the tax revenue, the frustration of networks and cartels, the fact<br>> that if we prosecuted actual warfare like the War on Drugs, we\'d<br>> still be trudging around Vietnam despite the fact we\'d turned its<br>> entire surface into smoldering glass. For the sake of our respective<br>> sanities, though, I\'ll refer you to much more salient voices on the<br>> broader topic and focus on the law enforcement angle:<br>><br>> 1.  **Marijuana is undeserving of being treated as proximal to other<br>>     street drugs**. It\'s not just that marijuana is lower grade, or<br>>     that it can be considered a three or four if meth is a ten.<br>>     Marijuana isn\'t on the same spectrum as heroin, cocaine, LSD, or<br>>     meth. There are assuredly people out there who have suffered in<br>>     one way or another because of marijuana, but that number is<br>>     dwarfed by the swarms of people lain waste in the swath created by<br>>     the War on Drugs. Productivity dip? Possibly. Intelligence<br>>     quotient dip? Perhaps \1\. Life destruction? Vanishingly rare,<br>>     and typically more a hallmark of the doomsaying of the shrillest<br>>     among us. Don\'t let me catch you lumping casual tokers with meth<br>>     users, unless you like being laughed at and lectured. I\'ve seen<br>>     them both. One of these things is not like the other.<br>> 2.  Pot arrests are a monumental waste. Of everything. First you<br>>     find it. Then you secure it as evidence. Then you handcuff. Then<br>>     you search. Load. Radio. Transport. Drive time. Disembark. Secure<br>>     duty weapon. Buzz into the jail. Paperwork. Property log. Ticket.<br>>     Metal detect.\<br>>     \<br>>     Then, while the jail is re-searching, fingerprinting, processing,<br>>     photographing and securing, I\'m leaving, going to HQ, into the<br>>     property room, dime bag into heat seal bag, property form,<br>>     evidence tape, submission. Then comes the report, with its person<br>>     tab, property tab, narrative. Then a sergeant reads, sends back,<br>>     rereads, edits, approves.\<br>>     \<br>>     The ticket goes to records to be stamped, separated, forwarded.<br>>     The marijuana goes to the chronically (pun acknowledged)<br>>     backlogged forensics lab, which must verify the \"green, leafy<br>>     substance whose smell, based on my training and observation,<br>>     matched that of marijuana\" is, indeed, marijuana. They generate a<br>>     report which is forwarded to me in the event of a trial. The<br>>     prosecutor has long since gotten my ticket, and set a court date<br>>     for the accused. A subpoena is mailed; they bounce back as often<br>>     as they\'re delivered.\<br>>     \<br>>     Suspect shows, pleads not guilty. Trial date is set. I get<br>>     subpoenaed. There\'s a high probability suspect doesn\'t show.<br>>     Prosecutor asks for and gets issuance of an arrest warrant. I<br>>     leave after ninety seconds, but get paid the minimum for a court<br>>     appearance: two and one-half hours\' pay. Six months later I pull<br>>     a car over; our toker is a passenger, whom I must now arrest<br>>     because of the arrest warrant.\<br>>     \<br>>     And the cycle repeats.<br><br>TL;DR: Marijuana and *all other drugs* are in two totally different<br>universes. It's a *massive* time sink to arrest and process your average<br>pot head. If there was a way to get that pot head some help, that would<br>be useful. The problem we have is we treat addicts like criminals<br>instead of like patients. But because the medical establishment has not<br>seen fit to call addiction a disease, then addicts must simply be people<br>making bad choices, which leaves it up to law enforcement to handle.<br>This overcrowds the jails with people who should never be there. They<br>should be getting medical help, not arrest records.<br><br>So if an officer's discretion sneaks in when a kid gets caught with a<br>joint, and the officer just returns the kid home and gives the parents a<br>good tongue-lashing, I think you'll find many officers who personally<br>agree with that decision.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
