<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You are likely adolescent or young adult, right? You have<br>brand-new hormones coursing through your veins. You are a normal young<br>adult.\<br>\<br>If you\'re 40 and you\'re still thinking about girls \"every six<br>seconds,\" there may be an issue.\<br>\<br>Know that for the most part, this is normal. This is your body telling<br>you that you\'re at the prime physical age to make new people, and your<br>body has this desire to make new people (otherwise known as<br>procreating).\<br>\<br>Now, be an adult, and control yourself. Keep your thoughts to yourself.<br>You\'ll find someone. If you have found someone, share those thoughts<br>with them.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
