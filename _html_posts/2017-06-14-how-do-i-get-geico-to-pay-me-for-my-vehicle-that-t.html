<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Simplest way: get a lawyer.<br><br>Personal injury lawyers won't take your case unless you have one, and<br>you have a good chance of winning, because they get paid out of your<br>winnings. If you don't win, they don't get paid. They usually also offer<br>free consultation, to find out if you have a winning case.<br><br>So call a personal injury attorney in your neck of the woods. You<br>probably see their ads all over the place: "Hurt in a car wreck? Call<br>me!" Except you don't have to be physically hurt to have a case on which<br>they can collect.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
