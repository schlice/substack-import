<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do pro-lifers approve of vasectomies?<br><br>The pro-life movement has no specific views on vasectomies.<br><br>Pro-lifers are concerned with humans who are killed after the sperm<br>joins with the egg, not with what form of birth control anyone may<br>choose to use.<br><br>You're probably confused because you correlate "pro-life people" with<br>"religious people." Not everyone who is pro-life is religious, nor does<br>the pro-life position have as a requirement any specific religious<br>teachings.<br><br>The pro-life position, on its own, has nothing to say about vasectomies.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
