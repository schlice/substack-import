<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is actually a far more nuanced question than critics make it out to<br>be.<br><br>First of all, since God exists outside of time, He sees everything<br>differently. For God, everything is now. The past is now. The<br>present is now. The future is now. God literally sees all of it.<br><br>But that ability to see everything *alone* does not limit our ability to<br>make free choices.<br><br>The difficulty comes when we try to understand this within God's<br>framework. *If I haven't made the choice*, they reason, *then how could<br>God possibly see what I will choose?* *And if God sees it, then it means<br>I've either already made the choice, or I must choose the path that God<br>sees, and therefore I don't actually have free will!*<br><br>The truth is that yes, human beings have the ability to choose to do<br>anything they have the ability to do.ยน But the concept of free will is<br>*fraught*, because I never really truly have free will. My choices are<br>always influenced by something.<br><br>Even before we talk about whether or not God influences our choices,<br>*we* influence our choices. Our history influences our choices. Our<br>*destination* influences our choices.<br><br>Jonathan Edwards, in his book *The Freedom Of The Will*, says that free<br>moral agents always act according to the strongest inclination they have<br>at the moment of choice. In other words, we always choose according to<br>our inclinations, and we always choose according to our strongest<br>inclination at any given moment. So for example, if I asked you, "Why<br>are you sitting in that chair right now?" you would be able to analyze<br>your current situation and determine why you are actually in that chair<br>right now. It might be, "because I'm at my computer," or "I always sit<br>in this chair, so I just chose this one," or "this is the only chair in<br>the room," or "I got tired of standing, so I sat in the nearest chair."<br><br>The point is that even choices which seem free actually have some form<br>of motivation, regardless of how small. The difference is that *we*<br>are making that choice, without any outside coercion.<br><br>But what if there *is* outside coercion? Do you still have free will?<br>Can you still make choices? What if a robber holds me at gunpoint and<br>says, "gimme your wallet and your phone right now or I'll kill you"? You<br>have far *fewer* choices at that very moment, but you would indeed still<br>have choices, and you can still choose any of them. You'd think your<br>only choice would be to hand over your wallet and your phone, but that's<br>not true. You could choose to fight, saying "well, I have cancer, so I'm<br>going to take the chance that I can fight him off, and maybe I get shot<br>and maybe I don't, but I don't care." So even when we have very limited<br>choices, we are still able to make choices.<br><br>So ultimately, we have a paradox. Every choice we make is free, and<br>every choice we make is simultaneously determined. We are both free<br>and determined. R.C. Sproul holds this view as well; an appeal to irony.<br>Initially, it would seem that the concept of *free will* and<br>*determinism* are flatly at odds: if my choices are determined, then<br>they are not free. But my point is that our choices are *always*<br>determined by something. At this point, most people would say, "yeah,<br>but as long as *I* am the one making the choice, then I am free." So<br>the answer is that most people equate free will with<br>self-determination.<br><br>And if that's true, if my choices stem from my disposition and desires,<br>and if my actions are the consequences of underlying causes and reasons,<br>then it is my personal desire that, in a very tangible way, dictates my<br>personal choices.<br><br>But if my desires dictate my choices, are they truly free? I would<br>even go so far as to say that if it is true that you *always* make the<br>choice which correlates to your strongest desire at that very moment,<br>then *your choices are never truly free*, because they are always<br>determined by something. You will always choose according to your<br>strongest desire, so your choices are always determined.<br><br>*So when we talk about "free will," what do we mean?*<br><br>The classic argument says that if God already knows what I will choose,<br>then I must make that choice because God has already seen the choice; I<br>cannot choose otherwise.<br><br>*So couldn't it be possible that God knows your* *desires**, so He<br>knows what you will choose because He knows what your strongest desire<br>is, and what your strongest desire will be?*<br><br>The answer is yes, He can know. He can know what you think and what you<br>desire. Therefore, He can easily know what you will choose, not just<br>because He has seen you make that choice (even though He has), but<br>because He knows your heart, and He knows what you will choose, even if<br>you think you haven't made the choice yet. He knows what you will<br>choose, because we always choose in accordance with our strongest desire<br>at that very moment.<br><br>\<br><br>ยน In specific, humans can't choose to do things that are outside of<br>their nature. For example, I can choose to walk across a bridge. I can<br>choose to skip across a bridge. I can choose to ride a bike across a<br>bridge. But I cannot choose to flap my arms and fly across a bridge,<br>because I cannot fly. So I can only choose to do things that I am able<br>to do.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
