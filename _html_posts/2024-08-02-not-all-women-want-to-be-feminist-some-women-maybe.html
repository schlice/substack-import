<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Your view is perfectly okay! This is the biblical order of marriage and<br>family, ordained by God, based on the way that women and men were<br>designed, and there is nothing wrong with holding that view.<br><br>But it is perfectly acceptable to hold the opposite view as well, that<br>it is okay for women to be CEOs and climb the corporate ladder. It's not<br>*biblical,* but it's not *wrong*. God gave us free will, and we can use<br>that free will to either follow Him or reject Him.<br><br>Both views are perfectly okay for any one person to hold.<br><br>\<br><br>What is *NOT* okay is to *malign* the person who holds the opposite<br>view.<br><br>I'm certainly not accusing you of doing this; you did not. You simply<br>said that not all women want to be feminists. You're right. You said<br>that you believe the man to be the head of the household. That's a<br>perfectly acceptable belief.<br><br>But the feminists want to tell you that ***you are wrong for holding<br>such a belief.***<br><br>The feminists want to tell you that holding to the Biblical<br>understanding of how to build a household in a Godly manner is wrong<br>and must be rejected. THIS is what is not okay. This view that your<br>opinion carries less weight because you have an opinion of how you wish<br>to run your own life.<br><br>Similarly, it would not be okay to tell a feminist that she is wrong by<br>wanting to be a CEO or lead a nation. She is perfectly free to hold that<br>view.<br><br>There is a difference between what is *socially acceptable* and what is<br>*biblical*. ***Not everything that is socially acceptable is<br>biblical.***<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
