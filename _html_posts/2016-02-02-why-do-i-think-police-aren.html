<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In Colorado, POST requirements for *reserve* officers (not even<br>full-time officers) includes approximately 300 hours of training.<br>Breaking that down, 50 hours is firearms, 40 hours is driving, 40 hours<br>is arrest control. The rest of the time is all classroom time, reviewing<br>the individual sections of criminal law that police are required to<br>understand. Full-time officers have about twice that, but the times for<br>practical training are all the same. I know it is similar in the UK.<br><br>So I\'m not sure where the whole \"police aren\'t trained in law\"<br>statement comes from.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
