<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In the professional massage business, patients are often<br>completely unclothed. But they are always covered with a blanket or<br>towel during therapy, as only the body part which is being worked on is<br>exposed. I\'m reasonably certain that women need to remove bras, as<br>it\'s difficult to massage the back with a brastrap in the way.\<br>\<br>Patients can leave undergarments on if they choose, but regardless,<br>patients will never be completely uncovered. Keeping the muscles warm<br>allows for them to relax more, so being completely uncovered would chill<br>the body and cause additional muscle tension.\<br>\<br>I received professional massage from a LMT/NMT for over a year after my<br>car accident. I\'ve done both: left my underpants on and had them off.<br>Since some of my issue involved my sciatic nerve, my glutes had to be<br>done. This is more difficult (and messy) with underwear on, but still<br>doable.\<br>\<br>Note that professional massage therapists do this all the time, and it<br>is perfectly legal.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
