<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How successful is President Trump\'s Tax Cut bill given that most<br>companies are spending more in buying back stocks than in investing in<br>capital or labor?**<br><br>I'm not sure you and I define *success* in the same way.<br><br>The tax plan has arguably put money back in the pockets of every<br>working-class American in this country. By lowering the Federal income<br>tax, companies withhold less from your paycheck, which means more money<br>in your pocket.<br><br>This also means more money for companies to use (since their effective<br>tax rates are higher than the individual worker). They can do lots of<br>things with that money, including returning some of it directly to<br>employees in the form of bonuses or pay increases, capital investments,<br>R&D investments, business expansion, or simply strengthening the bottom<br>line of the business by reducing debt by buying back stocks.<br><br>The simple fact is that money is *moving*. Under the Obama-era economic<br>uncertainty, businesses didn't invest. They just held on to their<br>capital reserves. They knew they had improvements to make, but with such<br>a volatile and uncertain market, no one wanted to spend the money.<br><br>The market loves certainty. And under Trump's tax bill. it is certain<br>that the economy will grow. And when companies see positive movement in<br>the economy, they loosen the reins on their capital reserves, and they<br>start spending. The more companies spend, the better the health of the<br>economy.<br><br>**TL;DR: Stipulating that companies must spend on labor or capital<br>improvements is too narrow a measurement to determine whether or not the<br>tax plan is successful.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
