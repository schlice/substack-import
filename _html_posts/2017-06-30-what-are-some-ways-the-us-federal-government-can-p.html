<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *What are some ways the US Federal Government can prevent individual<br>> states from meaningfully following the Paris Accords?*<br>><br>> *Maybe withhold funding to blackmail them?*<br><br>They can pass a law that states that following the Paris accords is a<br>federal crime. If such a law was to pass (and be found to be<br>Constitutional, which is unlikely), then states would be bound by that<br>law as well.<br><br>However, the federal government does not have control over<br>*intrastate* (i.e. within a state) commerce, only *interstate* (i.e.<br>between states) commerce. The federal government can't control if a<br>state decides to enact limits on carbon dioxide emissions on<br>manufacturers in their state, or tax vehicle drivers based on the amount<br>they drive (thus determining the amount of greenhouse gases they emit).<br><br>States are free to do this. And businesses and people are free to move<br>to another state. That's how the free market system works. If it's<br>cheaper to run your business in another state (maybe even just across<br>the border), then you move there. But how does that improve the<br>environment? The same emissions are entering the atmosphere, but they<br>are doing so from another state.<br><br>The measure feels good, even though it doesn't do good.<br><br>Nevertheless, the federal government has withheld funding in the past<br>when states have not complied with federal policy. They may try again.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
