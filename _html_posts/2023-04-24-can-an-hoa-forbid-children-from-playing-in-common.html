<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, HOAs can put whatever access restrictions they choose on the common<br>areas. So long as they do so in accordance with their Governing<br>Documents, they can indeed impose access restrictions on the common<br>areas. Usually, such restrictions are at the discretion of the Board of<br>Directors.<br><br>You should also bear in mind that HOAs only carry general liability<br>insurance on those areas, and that may be insufficient if your children<br>are injured and you need to collect. In other words, it might be in your<br>best financial interest to keep your kids out of those areas.<br><br>And if the HOA *does* prohibit people from entering those areas and your<br>children violate the rules and play down there anyway and end up getting<br>hurt, I doubt the HOA's liability insurance would pay at all.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
