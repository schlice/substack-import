<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>- Swipe down from the top of the screen and select the gear icon, this<br>  will take you into Settings.<br>- Select Applications<br>- Select Application Manager<br>- Click MORE in the upper-right hand portion of the screen.<br>- Select "Apps that can appear on top"<br>- De-select any apps that you no longer wish to allow permission to draw<br>  over other apps.<br><br>If you're having a specific problem with the Install button, for<br>example, there is a great (ad-supported) app called [[Install Button<br>Unlocker](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=95e599&url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Djp.sfapps.installbuttonunlocker){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container} by SFApps. You can find it<br>in the Google Play Store. It is extremely effective at identifying and<br>allowing access to these pesky buttons which always seem to be<br>underneath a "screen overlay." You do have to contend with ads, but it's<br>a small price to pay to fix the annoying screen overlay issue.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
