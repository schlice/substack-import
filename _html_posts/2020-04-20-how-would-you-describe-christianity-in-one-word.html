<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>HOPE.<br><br>Christianity acknowledges the state of the world as it is. It<br>acknowledges that the world is fallen and broken.<br><br>*But for all of that, it offers* *hope**.*<br><br>It's precisely like the story of Pandora's Box. Adam and Eve opened the<br>box, and released all of that evil into the world. With free will comes<br>the possibility to choose evil.<br><br>But stuck down in the small corner of the box was the one thing that<br>Christianity offers: hope. We are hopeful for our future because of the<br>gift of salvation that we have been given.<br><br>> In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome<br>> the world. --- John 16:22 NIV<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
