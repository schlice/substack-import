<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**A woman that I don't know left me a voicemail, "by law you have to put<br>me on the do not call list, by law". She then ordered me to put her on<br>the do not call list, and hung up. Is what she said true, or can I just<br>not pick up the phone?**<br><br>LOL, unless you are a telemarketer, I don't really think you have<br>anything to worry about. If you didn't call her, you're in good shape.<br><br>Feel free to ignore the voicemail, and have a good day.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
