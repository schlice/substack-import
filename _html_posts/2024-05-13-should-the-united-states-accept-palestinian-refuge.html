<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This question assumes that there are civilians in the region called<br>Palestine who are *not* Hamas-sympathizers and who affirmatively deny<br>Hamas' leadership and control, and wish to be free.<br><br>And if that's what they wanted so badly, *why did they choose to live in<br>Palestine under the control of the Palestinian Authority?* Israel<br>already freely takes Arabs from Gaza and the West Bank and allows them<br>to assimilate into Israel. There are thousands of free Arabs living in<br>Israel today. They serve in the IDF. They have lives and jobs and<br>families. And they are notably the only Arabs in the entire region to be<br>living in a truly free democracy.<br><br>If they were truly not Hamas supporters, why did they choose to live<br>under Hamas' control?<br><br>I will not deny that it is possible that such people could exist. But I<br>think the number is *much smaller* than most people believe it to<br>be.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
