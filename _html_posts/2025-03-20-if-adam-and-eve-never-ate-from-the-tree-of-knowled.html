<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because God told them.<br><br>Remember, He told them that they could eat from any tree they wanted to,<br>except for that one. So *they already knew* not to do it.<br><br>The great secret of the fruit was that **the fruit didn\'t have any<br>magical properties**. It didn\'t impart any wisdom by its consumption.<br>It was just fruit.<br><br>What changed Adam and Eve was *the act of disobeying God.* Their act<br>introduced sin into the world for the first time, and they were<br>*changed* by the sin. Their eyes were opened. No longer did they only<br>know good, but because they introduced evil into the world, now they<br>*saw* evil. They *saw* pain. They *saw* sadness. And they saw shame.<br>And they noticed that they were naked, and they were ashamed. Shame was<br>something that was not introduced into the human condition until Adam<br>and Eve sinned.<br><br>The fruit didn\'t do anything to them. The sin did.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
