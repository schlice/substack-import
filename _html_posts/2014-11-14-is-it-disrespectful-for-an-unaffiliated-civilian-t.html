<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Like<br>[Tim(https://www.quora.com/profile/Tim-Dees)]{.qlink_container} said,<br>it\'s just as likely that the person displaying the \"thin blue line\"<br>decal is a cop as he is someone who simply supports the police, but in<br>almost any case, is just trying to get out of a speeding ticket.\<br>\<br>I see many cops today do this not on their own vehicles, but on the<br>vehicles of their spouses or family. They\'re not so much worried about<br>getting jammed up themselves, but would very much like other cops to<br>know that the person they are pulling over is the spouse of a cop.\<br>\<br>When I was growing up on Long Island, the state allowed the Nassau<br>County Police Department (for whom my father worked as a PO and later as<br>a Detective) to get plates where the three letters on the plate were<br>\"NCP\". My dad\'s plate was \"93-NCP\" and that plate was only<br>available to police officers. I can only assume (although I can\'t<br>remember) that the state allowed Suffolk County Police Department<br>officers to get \"SCP\" plates, NYPD officers to get \"NYP\" plates,<br>etc.\<br>\<br>In my experience, the plates never stopped him from being pulled over<br>for what he did while he was driving with me. So I don\'t really<br>understand the appeal. The fact that he likely knew the person pulling<br>him over, or worked with that person, probably was what got him out of<br>tickets.\<br>\<br>A more common practice for family members was for the officer to give<br>family members a photocopy of his ID card. My dad also gave me a<br>\"family badge,\" which was a miniature version of his full-size shield,<br>which was also supposed to help family members in the \"professional<br>courtesy\" department. Anyway, the photocopy actually did get me out of<br>a ticket once, when I was still partially living at home. I was<br>attending school at the Air Force Academy, but was home on leave,<br>visiting my girlfriend. I was headed home, and it was late (or early AM,<br>to be precise), and it was raining. I had borrowed my brother\'s car to<br>go see her, since I no longer had a car at home. I wasn\'t used to it,<br>and I was driving too fast for conditions when the light in front of me<br>changed. I slammed on the brakes (no ABS at this time), and slid into<br>the intersection. Fortunately, there was no one there, so I simply<br>turned right and continued on. Alas, this was a \"No Turn On Red\"<br>intersection, and I was immediately lit up from behind. I pulled over<br>and explained to the cop what had happened. I gave her my driver\'s<br>license, my military ID, and that copy of my dad\'s ID card. She glanced<br>through the documents while I was talking until she got to the ID card<br>copy, when she interrupted me:\<br>\<br>\"This your dad?\"\<br>\"Yep.\"\<br>\"Where does he work?\"\<br>\"First squad.\"\<br>\"Be careful on your way home.\"\<br>\<br>Today, I interpret this for what it is: the officer was exercising that<br>same professional courtesy to a family member especially when the charge<br>was not terribly egregious.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
