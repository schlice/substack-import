<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [The major difference between the U.S. and the UK: the U.S.<br>government doesn\'t have the authority to enforce state law. Only a<br>state-based police force has the authority to enforce state law. The<br>federal organization has the ability to enforce only federal laws.\<br>\<br>In the United States, we are a federation of independent states. We<br>cannot, under the Constitution, be served by \"national police.\"\<br>\<br>That looks too much like the U.S. military enforcing civilian law, and<br>no one wants that either.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Should-police-departments-be-nationalized/answer/Leif-Jerram<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
