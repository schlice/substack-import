<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Varies by state, but in most states:<br><br>- Speeding is not a \"prosecutable\" offense, as it is a moving<br>  violation, not even a misdemeanor. Most moving violations are punished<br>  with fines and \"points\" against your license. Accumulate enough<br>  points, and you can lose your license. Be aware, there are a few<br>  moving violations which are misdemeanors, such as reckless driving or<br>  reckless endangerment. Depending on what is involved, those might rise<br>  to the level of a felony.<br>- In most states, moving violations must be \"observed by a peace<br>  officer\" in order to be issued. Which is why red-light cameras have<br>  required law changes in many places in order to come into existence.<br>  In some cases, one peace officer can observe the offense, and a second<br>  peace officer can issue the ticket with the first peace officer as the<br>  complaining official.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
