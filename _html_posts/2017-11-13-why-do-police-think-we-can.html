<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Some* government buildings cannot be photographed. Those buildings will<br>be clearly marked, and police will indeed tell you that you can't<br>photograph those buildings. Generally, you also can't access those<br>buildings (i.e. they will be fenced off), but this is not always the<br>case.<br><br>If an officer tells you that you can't photograph a building that you<br>believe you are allowed to photograph, please feel free to file a<br>complaint with that officer's department, or head to your nearest ACLU<br>office to file a First Amendment violation lawsuit. If you don't stand<br>up to officers who act inappropriately, the behavior will never be<br>corrected, and you have no reason to complain when it continues.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
