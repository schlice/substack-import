<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are the requirements for a warrant to be issued under the Fourth<br>Amendment?**<br><br>The 4th Amendment states (emphasis mine):<br><br>> The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,<br>> and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be<br>> violated, and **no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,<br>> supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the<br>> place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.**<br><br>Therefore, the requirements for a warrant under the 4th Amendment:<br><br>- Probable cause<br>- Someone swearing an oath that the warrant is being genuinely issued to<br>  investigate and/or prosecute a crime<br>- A detailed description of the place to be searched and the persons or<br>  things to be seized.<br><br>EDIT: Quora Content Review keeps changing the question to "What are<br>the requirements for a warrant to be issued by the Fourth Amendment?"<br>regardless of how many times I try to fix it. I should answer the<br>question as written so that my answer does not get flagged for not<br>answering the question. The answer to the question as written is that<br>the Fourth Amendment does not issue warrants. The Fourth Amendment does<br>not grant any powers for anyone to issue warrants, which is why the<br>wording of the question is wrong. So if you were the original author and<br>you thought the Fourth Amendment gave warrant power, you are mistaken.<br>The Fourth Amendment defines the conditions under which warrants must be<br>issued in order to safeguard rights.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
