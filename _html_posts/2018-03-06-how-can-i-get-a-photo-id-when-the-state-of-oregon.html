But at least one of these<br>should be able to happen: you should be able to get a new birth<br>certificate without a photo ID, or you should be able to get a photo ID<br>without a birth certificate.<br><br>You must check with each agency involved to see what the process is if<br>you don't have the one document or the other.<br><br>In my opinion, I would start with the birth certificate. Most states<br>have procedures for obtaining a birth certificate without a photo ID. It<br>does sometimes happen that vital documents are destroyed simultaneously<br>(think house fire). There must be a way to get a copy without a photo<br>ID. For example, some states allow you to submit a sworn notarized<br>statement in lieu of a photo ID. Some states allow your parents (who are<br>listed on your birth certificate) to submit a notarized letter and a<br>copy of their photo ID in lieu of your own.<br><br>But if your state absolutely will not give you a copy of your birth<br>certificate without a photo ID, then work on part 2: getting a<br>replacement photo ID without a birth certificate. Every state is<br>different when it comes to this, but just as in the case of vital<br>documents, there must be a procedure which permits you to get a<br>duplicate photo ID if you don't have a birth certificate. Usually you<br>can provide supporting information, like your checking account (your<br>checks show your name and address), a credit card statement, your water<br>or electric bill, or other locally-recognized documents which show who<br>you are. Some states even allow you to request a new photo ID online.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
