<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a good question and it deserves a little review and<br>understanding.<br><br>So let's first talk timelines.<br><br>Long before God created Adam, He created angels. Angels are messengers,<br>and worshippers. They work for God, and they worship God. But there was<br>one angel who was one of the most amazing angels God created. It's silly<br>to say his voice is "angelic" because he's an angel, but it's just hard<br>to describe how amazing and entrancing his singing is. Think of the most<br>amazing singer you can, and then multiply that by ten and you might come<br>close to how incredible his singing voice is. By the way, if you haven't<br>guessed yet, his name is Lucifer.<br><br>Lucifer decided that he did not want to worship God any longer. He<br>wanted worship *himself*. Instead of praising God with his voice, he<br>wanted that praise himself. There was a great struggle in heaven, and<br>God cast Lucifer out of heaven to the earth, and he took about a third<br>of the angels with him (the ones who chose to worship Lucifer instead of<br>God), and they became demons.<br><br>For them (Lucifer and the demons), God created hell. It's a place where<br>God's love does not exist. It is a place of "eternal torment," not a<br>place of "eternal torture." Living in a place where God's love does not<br>exist, while being able to see the Kingdom of Heaven, and know that it<br>was your choices alone that placed you there, would be an endless<br>torment. At the end of hell, the Bible talks about "the lake of fire"<br>which will be the ultimate destination of Lucifer (now known as Satan).<br>*That* place is indeed where souls will suffer for all eternity.<br><br>So we need to understand that God created hell and "the lake of fire"<br>for Lucifer and the demons.<br><br>\<br><br>Following the events in heaven with Lucifer, God created Adam. Satan was<br>exceedingly jealous of Adam, because Adam was God's penultimate<br>creation. God walked with Adam in the Garden every day. Satan did not<br>like that at all, so he took advantage of Adam and Eve's naïveté and<br>tricked them into sin. Once Adam and Eve had sinned and introduced sin<br>into the human condition, they could not enter the kingdom of Heaven.<br>They had unpaid sin debt, and only those who have no sin debt can enter<br>Heaven. Therefore, when they die, their new destination becomes hell<br><br>\<br><br>So some things to take away from this story:<br><br>1.  God created hell for Satan and his demons, not for humans.<br>2.  Adam and Eve made a *choice* to sin. They freely chose to disobey<br>    God. We do the same, every day.<br>3.  Our final destination is hell because of that sin.<br><br>Sounds pretty bleak, no? Sounds like there's not much we can do to get<br>out of this.<br><br>But God made a way.<br><br>While we were still sinners, God sent Jesus, the only person ever born<br>without sin, to take on our sin debt and die on the cross as payment for<br>that sin. This pays our sin debt and allows us to enter the Kingdom of<br>Heaven.<br><br>(Just as an aside, we know Jesus is God. So it is actually God who paid<br>for our sins for us. God took that sin debt onto Himself so that we can<br>be justified and sanctified. Think about that for a second).<br><br>\<br><br>So back to the original question:<br><br>> **How is the concept of Hell reconciled with God\'s love for<br>> humanity?**<br><br>Hell was never intended to be the final destination for mankind. Man's<br>choice to sin changed his final destination from heaven to hell. And<br>God, being just, did not stop this, because it was man's own choices<br>that sent him there.<br><br>Usually, at this point, people respond with "Well it was Adam's sin! Why<br>am I destined for hell?" The answer is that we are responsible for our<br>own sin, which you and I commit every single day, in our thoughts and in<br>our words, in what we have done, and what we have failed to do.<br><br>> Is it considered cruel for God to have created such a place?<br><br>Not at all. If you look through that history, God has only responded to<br>what has happened. God doesn't *send* anyone to hell. People *choose*<br>hell every single day by not repenting for the sin they freely commit.<br>God's justice (everyone gets exactly what they deserve) is generally<br>considered to be very loving. What's more loving is the fact that God's<br>mercy allowed Him to come up with a plan to save us, and His grace gives<br>us the gift of salvation when we simply do not deserve it.<br><br>In this way, we can choose to love Him or reject Him without violating<br>our free will, and that is ultimately the purpose of this life: to be<br>able to make that choice freely, without coercion. God *is* love, and<br>love can only be given freely, it can never be coerced.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
