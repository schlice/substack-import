<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My boyfriend and I made out and I put his hand in my pants and he is<br>accusing me of forcing him to touch my vagina when I did not force him<br>at all. Is this sexual assault?**<br><br>Legally, in most states, the standard is "no means no," not "yes means<br>yes" as some college campuses have instituted (and some states are<br>trying to pass).<br><br>What does that mean? If someone does not consent to sexual activity,<br>they must affirmatively say no. So unless he said no, or made some other<br>overt motion to indicate no, it's not assault.<br><br>In order for him to non-verbally indicate no and qualify as assault, you<br>would have had to drag him, kicking and screaming, into your pants, and<br>it's unlikely that this happened.<br><br>Maybe he wasn't ready for that level of engagement. Maybe he thinks this<br>is all moving too fast. Any of this could be true.<br><br>But sexual assault, this is not.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
