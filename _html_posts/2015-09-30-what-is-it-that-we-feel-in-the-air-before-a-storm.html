<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There are several things that could be causing that<br>phenomenon.\<br>\<br>You did specify pressure changes. You\'ll often hear older people say<br>that a body part \"aches\" right before a storm. The theory is that<br>pressure differences cause this.\<br>\<br>Electrical changes in the air cause another phenomenon: the creation of<br>*ozone* in the air. Ozone is O3 and is created through electrical<br>discharge in the atmosphere. It also has a very pungent odor, and can be<br>smelled at a very low concentration in the air. So electrical changes in<br>the air can produce ozone that you can smell.\<br>\<br>Sometimes, not only will barometric pressure, electrical charge and<br>ozone concentration change, but moisture content (humidity) will also<br>change before a storm. You can feel and smell that difference as<br>well.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
