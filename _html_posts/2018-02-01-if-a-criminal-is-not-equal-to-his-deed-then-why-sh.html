<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>***If a criminal is not equal to his deed then why should a punishment<br>equal to the deed be applied to the criminal?***<br><br>Your use of the word "equal" in the two thoughts is incorrect.<br><br>A criminal is only equal to his deed in that he is the impetus behind<br>the deed. The criminal is not "bad," the deed was "bad."<br><br>A punishment is never equal to the deed. If that were the case, the<br>punishment for theft would be for the government to steal something of<br>equal value from you. The punishment for rape would be to have someone<br>rape you.<br><br>Punishments are equitable, not equal. Punishments are measured<br>by the deed, but they punish the criminal for committing the deed.<br>Punishments, therefore, are only tangentially tied to the deed, but<br>primarily punish the person committing the deed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
