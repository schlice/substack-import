<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should the FBI take 3 days to investigate Prof. Fords allegations<br>against Judge Kavanaugh, prior to his confirmation?**<br><br>Thanks for the A2A. No, the FBI should not take any time to investigate<br>Dr. Ford's allegations, ***because there is no allegation of a Federal<br>crime, and all background investigations have been successfully<br>completed***.<br><br>The "three days" you cite is related to Clarence Thomas' confirmation<br>hearings, and the review of Anita Hill's claims of sexual assault. The<br>reason why the FBI investigated then was that Thomas was a government<br>employee at the time, on government property, when he allegedly sexually<br>assaulted Ms. Hill. Therefore, a Federal crime was alleged. The FBI took<br>three days to determine that Ms. Hill's claims were "unfounded."<br><br>In this case, there is no Federal crime alleged, and the FBI has no<br>authority to investigate state crimes. Additionally, the statute of<br>limitations has expired, so there is no crime to investigate anyway.<br><br>If you're talking about the FBI and its background investigations which<br>it has already completed on Judge Kavanaugh, those are at the behest of<br>the White House, and the two they did are already closed. If the White<br>House is interested, it could direct the FBI to re-open the background<br>investigation that it just finished and it could ask them to review the<br>new information, but as of today, the White House does not seem all too<br>eager to re-open that investigation, and the FBI cannot unilaterally<br>decide to investigate someone without being directed to do so. Since the<br>FBI, in the case of the background checks, is under the direction of the<br>White House, the Senate Judiciary Committee also has no authority to<br>direct the FBI to re-open that investigation, either.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
