<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, it's because many people call themselves Christian, maybe even<br>attend church every week, *but are not saved*. Our pastor once estimated<br>that as many as 40% of the people who attend our church may not be<br>saved. Note this is a rough estimate and it's not based on any empirical<br>data, but it goes to show you that just because you call yourself a<br>Christian doesn't mean you're saved.<br><br>Why is this important? A saved person, a person who has confessed<br>himself or herself as a sinner and has accepted Jesus as their Lord and<br>Savior, will act differently.<br><br>Saved people have had "their hearts of stone" replaced with hearts of<br>love, which will always love Jesus. Saved people will desire to live out<br>the Great Commission. Saved people will seek out opportunities to serve.<br><br>But most crucially to this discussion, ***saved people know that being a<br>Christian is not comfortable.***<br><br>> "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In<br>> this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the<br>> world." --- John 16:33 NIV<br><br>Jesus was clear: the world is *uncomfortable*. The world will hate you.<br>The world will reject you. And that's okay, because while the saved<br>person is *in* the world, they are not *of* the world. The world will<br>reject those who do not belong to it. The world will reject those who<br>continue to be *uncomfortable* in a world in which they only need to<br>follow the dictates of their feelings and they'd be comfortable.<br><br>But that's not our calling. Our calling is to not bow to the dictate of<br>our feelings. Our calling is to not fear the uncomfortable. Our calling<br>is to step outside of our comfort zone and to boldly proclaim the<br>Gospel. That's not easy, and it's certainly not comfortable.<br><br>TL;DR: Those who call themselves Christian come in many different<br>flavors, but those who are *saved* are a smaller group of Christians,<br>and they are the ones who live *uncomfortably*, living to worship God<br>and serve others, and to spread the Gospel to the world.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why do many of us Christians seem comfortable not obeying the majority<br>of the things that Jesus taught us?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
