<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Of course, every jurisdiction is different, but in general, photocopies<br>of the license plate are not valid. You can either find a rack that has<br>a spot for a license plate, or find a bracket that attaches your license<br>plate to your bike rack. You must relocate the plate so that it is<br>visible.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
