<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's not irrelevant to the "abortion debate/problem." It's central<br>to it.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Because if it's not alive, then you're not killing it by removing it<br>and no one would care. Pro-life people would have nothing to object to,<br>because you're not actually causing a death to an existing life, you're<br>only removing some structure which will one day become a life. It's the<br>classic "clump of cells" reduction, which only fails because the baby<br>is, in fact, *alive.*<br><br>If the baby is alive, then it deserves the same protections as any other<br>live human being, regardless of how early in its development it is, or<br>whether it can survive on its own, or whether it is even physically<br>recognizable as a human. So the distinction about "when life begins" is<br>central to the pro-life/pro-choice debate.<br><br>Whether or not it is "alive" and whether or not it is "human" are both<br>questions with easy, well-recognized scientific answers, despite<br>breathless apologetics by the stridently pro-choice crowd. Truly honest<br>embryologists agree that the life created at conception is a unique<br>human organism, so we know it is "human." It exhibits all of the<br>characteristics of life: cellular organization, the ability to<br>reproduce, growth & development, energy use, homeostasis, response to<br>their environment, and the ability to adapt. It is, definitionally,<br>"alive."<br><br>Rather than debating these points, pro-choice people would be much<br>better served if they stipulated to the fact that they are fully aware<br>that the baby is alive, but they are okay with killing it because: it<br>can't live on its own, it is a parasite, it doesn't even look human,<br>there's no brain, there's no heart, the mother's life is more important,<br>etc. These are fine arguments to make. We kill people all the time in<br>today's society. Police legally kill about a thousand people a year in<br>the United States. We execute criminals lawfully in today's society. And<br>in some states, physician-assisted suicide is legal. So saying that<br>lawfully some humans can be killed is not a stretch. It's just<br>articulating the argument that causes the issue.<br><br>\<br><br>Despite endless cries to the contrary, there is really only one<br>difference between the pro-life and the pro-choice positions. When you<br>strip them down to their most essential difference, this is it:<br><br>- Pro-life people place equal value on all life at all times, and<br>  that includes both the baby and the mother. Neither life is more<br>  important than the other.ยน<br>- Pro-choice people place differential value on the life of the baby<br>  depending on its *temporal locality.* A "temporal locality" is a<br>  position in both space and time. In other words, pro-choice people<br>  place different value on the life of the baby depending on where<br>  physically, and when in time, it is located. During those times, **the<br>  life of the mother has more value than the life of the baby.**<br><br>That's it. Trying to say that it's something other than this is<br>disingenuous, and is usually just emotion talking instead of reason.<br><br>\<br><br>ยน The "life of the mother" exception still can co-exist with placing<br>equal value on all life. If a mother's life is being threatened by a<br>continuing pregnancy, that pregnancy should be able to be ended in order<br>to save her life.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*I will only entertain* *rational discussion* *in this comment<br>section. Do not come into these comments and attempt to tell me what my<br>(pro-life) position is; I will delete your comment. Do not come into<br>these comments and attempt to harass or shame me; I will delete your<br>comment and block you. Rational, reasonable discussion only, or you will<br>be deleted and blocked. Don't waste my time and yours if you can't be<br>reasonable. I'm willing to entertain reasonable discussion. To me,*<br>*even though I personally value the life of babies,* *a reasonable<br>restriction on abortion would be any time within the first 15 weeks, as<br>\~95% of all abortions occur during that timeframe anyway. Morally, I am<br>completely against abortion, but legally, I'm willing to compromise<br>because people are different.*<br><br>*Discuss.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
