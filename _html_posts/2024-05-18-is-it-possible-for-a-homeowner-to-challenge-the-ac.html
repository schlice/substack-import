<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sure! You can sue anyone for anything in the United States. But you'd<br>have to find a lawyer willing to do it, and you'd probably have to have<br>some reasonable chance of winning before that lawyer would take on such<br>a case.<br><br>If the HOA does something which clearly violates the Governing<br>Documents, you can refuse to comply, and when you are fined, you can<br>retain your own attorney to sue them.<br><br>But if you simply don't like what they're doing, even though it's<br>perfectly legal under your Governing Documents, you're going to have a<br>tough row to hoe if you want to challenge them (if you can even find a<br>lawyer to take your case).<br><br>You're better off running for the Board and working with them to change<br>their rules.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
