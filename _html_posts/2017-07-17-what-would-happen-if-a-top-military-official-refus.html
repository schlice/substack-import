<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Whether it's a top general or a Second Lieutenant, an officer refusing<br>to follow an order is a serious charge. You'd better have a damn good<br>reason for refusing to follow an order from your commander, and the only<br>good reason would be that the order violates a law. It may violate rules<br>of engagement, it may even go so far as to violate the Law of Armed<br>Combat for the engagement in which you are currently operating. But<br>regardless, you never see active refusal to follow orders unless there<br>is a violation of law in the order.<br><br>Generally, what would happen is that the senior officer would find<br>someone else to carry out the order (if they can) and then will file<br>Article 15 proceedings against the officer for failure to follow a<br>direct order. The order will be reviewed, and if the order is found to<br>be compliant with law, the officer will be court-martialed and likely<br>dishonorably discharged.<br><br>So if you're going to refuse to follow an order, you better be right.<br><br>Specifically for the President and his service chiefs, he would probably<br>fire them (i.e. reassign or retire) and get someone else who would<br>follow orders.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
