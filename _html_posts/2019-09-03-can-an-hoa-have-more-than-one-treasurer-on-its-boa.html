What are the<br>pros of having two treasurers?**<br><br>Generally each Board position is only filled by one person. Additional<br>Board members who do not fill a vacant Board position are known as<br>Members-At-Large. They have full voting rights and vote when the<br>Board must vote on matters before them, but they don't occupy a denoted<br>seat.<br><br>This is all spelled out in the *Bylaws* of the Association. If the<br>Association's Bylaws allow positions to be filled by more than one<br>person, they would be known as "Co-Chairs." In this case, you'd have<br>"Co-Treasurers."<br><br>But again, this is only if the Bylaws allow it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
