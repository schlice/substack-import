<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You will go through OTS as normal (OTS stands on its own,<br>as it is the commissioning source). Once you are a commissioned Second<br>Lieutenant, you will attend Air Force Security Forces Academy at<br>Lackland AFB in Texas. This 80 day course covers standard law<br>enforcement topics as well as specialty training such as convoy defense,<br>missile security, and capture and recovery of nuclear weapons.\<br>\<br>From there, you will proceed to your first duty assignment and be<br>immediately put to work.\<br>\<br>You can go on to specialty training after that.\<br>\<br>Talk with your recruiter about this if you want to learn<br>more.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
