<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What does Donald Trump's executive order against social media<br>include?**<br><br>As of Noon on Thursday, the EO hasn't been released. He tweeted about<br>it, but he hasn't released anything yet.<br><br>We do know that it will likely have something to do with Section 230 of<br>the Communications Decency Act. We won't be able to comment specifically<br>regarding the EO until it is released, but we think it will relate to<br>how the FCC defines whether or not an online platform retains immunity<br>from tort liability after editing content on its platform.<br><br>Under normal circumstances, if an online content platform exercises<br>traditional editorial functions over user submitted content, such as<br>deciding whether to publish, remove, or edit material, that platform<br>will not lose immunity **unless those edits materially alter the meaning<br>of the content.**<br><br>My guess is that the EO will clarify how the FCC is to define<br>"materially altering the meaning of content."<br><br>Since the law does not specify, it is up to the Executive Branch to make<br>that determination, and an EO would be the correct vehicle to do it.<br><br>The Congress can, of course, object, and they have the option of passing<br>a new law or an amendment to the existing law clarifying what *they*<br>meant by "materially altering the meaning of content," which would<br>override the EO.<br><br>Or, as is the modus operandi of the day, someone can bring an action in<br>Federal court, and a circuit court judge (most likely in the 9th Circus)<br>can issue a restraining order against the FCC barring them from<br>following the guidance in the EO until that court case could be heard.<br>You can expect this to happen, probably the same day that the EO drops.<br>There's likely a petitioner waiting in the lobby of the clerk's office<br>for the EO to be published.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
