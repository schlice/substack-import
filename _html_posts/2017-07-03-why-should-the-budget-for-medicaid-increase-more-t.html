<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>> *Why should the budget for Medicaid increase more than 18% in ten<br>> years?*<br><br>Answer: ObamaCare.<br><br>ObamaCare is also called the "Affordable Care Act." Because it is<br>anything but affordable, I hesitate to use that name. Suffice it to say<br>that any reference to ACA or the Affordable Care Act or ObamaCare refer<br>to the same thing.<br><br>ObamaCare accomplished its goal of providing insurance to everyone at<br>all costs by opening the floodgates and enrolling more people in<br>Medicaid. It changed the coverage rules, allowing more people to enroll<br>in Medicaid in order to get them insured. It then spent over \$1<br>trillion in tax revenue to subsidize premiums, and added massive<br>regulation and taxes on insurance companies, many of which,<br>counterproductively, raised premiums.<br><br>Despite incessant claims by the left, these people will not lose<br>coverage if they want to keep it.<br><br>Therefore, we are going to have to prop up Medicaid for the foreseeable<br>future, thanks to ObamaCare.<br><br>What we do with *new* people entering the workforce, on the other hand,<br>is a completely different story. Hopefully, it's what gets addressed<br>under the American Health Care Act.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
