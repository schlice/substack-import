<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a person calls 911 on a person who is lawfully carrying a gun in<br>the open, why isn't he/she arrested for abusing an emergency line and<br>taking officers away from a possible real emergency?**<br><br>The situation you're describing is not classified as false reporting.<br>False reporting (at least in Colorado) would consist of reporting an<br>event which does not exist.<br>[Swatting(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=19e73b&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} would be an example of<br>false reporting using the 911 system.<br><br>However, calling 911 and reporting a person with a gun is not false<br>reporting. The police can absolutely come and check it out and see what<br>the person is up to, and then perhaps advise the caller that it is legal<br>for people to openly carry firearms in that jurisdiction.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
