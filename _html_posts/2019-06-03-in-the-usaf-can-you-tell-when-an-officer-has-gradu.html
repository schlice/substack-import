<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In the USAF, can you tell when an officer has graduated from the Air<br>Force Academy?**<br><br>Unless you see a ring or the officer tells you, no. No differences in<br>the uniform.<br><br>Some others are going to say, "Yeah, it's the cocky bastards who are the<br>grads" because they had a bad experience with a grad. I can tell you<br>that the vast majority of grads are not cocky bastards.<br><br>(EDIT) [[Rob<br>Fabian](https://www.quora.com/profile/Rob-Fabian)]{.qlink_container}<br>added jump wings to the mix, and he's not wrong. If you see an officer<br>in most any career field (but especially in ones that wouldn't normally<br>be jumping from airplanes) who is wearing jump wings, there's a good<br>chance that officer is an Academy grad. The Air Force has very few<br>opportunities for members to earn jump wings, and the Academy is one of<br>those opportunities. In fact, the Academy's Airmanship 490 class is one<br>of only two free-fall jump programs in the Air Force, and one of a<br>handful throughout the entire military (most jumps are static line).<br>Jump wings is one of the few devices you can earn as a cadet that you<br>can wear once you graduate. So it's a pretty fair bet that if you see an<br>officer wearing jump wings, he or she is probably a grad.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
