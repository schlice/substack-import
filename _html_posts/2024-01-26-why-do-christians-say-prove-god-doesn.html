<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Atheism is an affirmative position which states that god does not exist.<br>It is not a "maybe." It doesn't say "maybe God doesn't exist," because<br>that's something else. That's agnosticism or skepticism. Those positions<br>say "we don't know whether or not God exists" or "we can't know whether<br>or not God exists."<br><br>Atheism affirmatively says "God does not exist." And truthfully, in<br>order to make this claim, there must be some sort of evidence possessed<br>by the believer that his belief is true.<br><br>This is where Christians get caught in a trap, because the atheist has<br>exactly as much evidence that God doesn't exist as the theist has for<br>the existence of God. The theist may have logical and philosophical<br>reasons to believe that God exists, but the physical evidence for God's<br>existence is the same as the physical evidence which proves that God<br>doesn't exist: there is none.<br><br>Atheists should be cautioned against asking Christians to prove that God<br>exists, because they have exactly as much evidence that God does not<br>exist as the theist has for God's existence.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
