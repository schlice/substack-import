<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think the other answers here nailed it. If you read the specifics of<br>the law, it\'s not technically gambling because you get "something\"<br>every time. If everyone\'s a winner, does that meet the definition of<br>gambling? The only difference may be how much you paid for that<br>particular item. So it might be considered a purchase of<br>\"variable-price\" items, but it doesn\'t really match the definition of<br>gambling.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
