<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>Like any other workday, on Friday, January 20, 2017, I'll be working. My<br>customers rely on me.<br><br>But I'll also have the TV on in the background so that I can watch the<br>festivities.<br><br>It's an important event. The peaceful transition of power between<br>elected governments is a hallmark of United States constitutional<br>democracy. It's a momentous occasion, and I'll be sure to watch it.<br><br>I also want to hear the Inaugural Address. To be fair, I'd much rather<br>read the transcript once it's posted at the White House website, but I<br>want to hear it live.<br><br>This is an historic election. Why? This is the first time in the history<br>of the nation that we have elected someone who has never served in<br>elected office, or is not a former military officer. Additionally, we<br>gave him a fully-loaded Republican majority in Congress. This is both a<br>complete and total repudiation of Obama's economic policies and a<br>mandate to get it fixed. I am excited to see that plan come together. I<br>like Trump's policies, and I like his plans, especially what he's laid<br>out for his first 100 days (see my post<br>[here(https://www.quora.com/Do-Trump-voters-understand-how-scared-many-groups-of-Americans-are/answer/Bill-Stein)<br>]{.qlink_container}for a detailed list). I'm not too sure about him<br>personally; I've heard mixed things. But I vote for policy, not<br>personality. And I'm super excited to see who he nominates to fill the<br>late Justice Antonin Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court. That person has<br>BIG shoes to fill.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
