<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you provide any evidence to support Trump's claim that there was<br>cheating in the election? None of the authorities in our country can<br>find any evidence of cheating, the courts are throwing out lawsuits, so<br>where is this alleged cheating?**<br><br>There is a pervasive media narrative which happens to be flat-out wrong:<br><br>*Evidence* is not *proof*.<br><br>Evidence *can* be proof, but it is not *always* proof. For example,<br>there may be evidence that a crime has taken place, but upon<br>investigation, proof of the allegation is sometimes not found. That<br>doesn't negate the evidence. It also doesn't mean the allegation was<br>incorrect, or wrong to bring. For example, there may be evidence that<br>you killed your spouse. Your neighbors overheard you having a fight. You<br>took a late-night fishing trip in your boat. And the next day, your<br>spouse is gone, never to be seen again. That evidence is<br>*circumstantial*, but it is still evidence. Is it *proof* of your guilt?<br>Maybe. It's up to the judge to decide if it proves your guilt.<br><br>Contrary to what the mainstream media is trying to feed you (which is<br>disinformation), there is indeed evidence of voter fraud. That evidence<br>must be investigated. If it is found to be lacking sufficiency, then the<br>allegation is rejected. But the evidence is there. The investigation<br>into the evidence follows, and if the allegation is proven, then the<br>case moves forward.<br><br>In at least a few cases, some of the allegations have merit, and their<br>investigations are moving forward. In others, the allegations were found<br>to be without merit and are tossed.<br><br>A court would not allow a claim in the door without some evidence to<br>merit its reason for existence. If there was no evidence at all, the<br>case would have been tossed at the door. Perhaps the evidence was<br>investigated and found to be insufficient to support the charge. In many<br>cases, this is what happened. In some, there was sufficient evidence to<br>move forward. If the case was allowed to be heard and there was no<br>evidence, the defense would request *summary judgement* and would make<br>the claim that the petitioner did not present sufficient evidence to<br>meet the *evidentiary requirement* to bring the charge in the first<br>place.<br><br>Regardless, this is how we ensure that the election is fair and legal.<br>This process must continue.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for<br>everyone.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
