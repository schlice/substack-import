<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why did Trump break with decades of tradition for presidential<br>candidates by refusing to release his income tax filings during his 2016<br>campaign?**<br><br>Because he's not a career politician.<br><br>Career politicians structure their finances so that they'll look good on<br>a 1040. No one else does this, because no one else has a need to do<br>this.<br><br>Trump has no need to disclose his tax filings because the law says that<br>they are between him and the IRS. There may be tradition of career<br>politicians voluntarily disclosing their tax returns, but there is no<br>law requiring a candidate to do so.<br><br>And making a law requiring candidates to do so will simply encourage<br>fewer non-career politicians from engaging in the political sphere. You<br>may think that's a good thing. I do not.<br><br>So do you think he's hiding something? Probably. What's he hiding? He's<br>probably hiding exactly how much he donates to charity. He's probably<br>hiding details about his companies (which are still in operation),<br>disclosure of which could financially harm those existing entities.<br><br>None of those things are required to be known by anyone but Trump and<br>the IRS.<br><br>Don't like it? Don't vote for him. Simple as that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
