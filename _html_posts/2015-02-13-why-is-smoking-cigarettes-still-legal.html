<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Tobacco is not part of the war on drugs because it is not<br>illegal. The question is: should it be?\<br>\<br>If we determine what should be illegal based on how damaging it is<br>to your body, alcohol and tobacco should be highly illegal, along with<br>most illegal drugs. Marijuana shouldn\'t really be on the list, as it is<br>more helpful than hurtful.\<br>\<br>If we determine what should be illegal based on how addictive it is,<br>the marijuana should not even be on the list, but many other drugs,<br>including tobacco and alcohol, should. Nicotine is more addictive than<br>cocaine.\<br>\<br>If we determine what should be illegal based on whether or not it has<br>any medicinal benefit, then marijuana, cocaine, and opium should be<br>off the list. Nicotine should definitely be on this list.\<br>\<br>But in the United States, we don\'t determine what is illegal by any of<br>those factors. It\'s done by politicians, political agendas, and big<br>business, not common sense.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
