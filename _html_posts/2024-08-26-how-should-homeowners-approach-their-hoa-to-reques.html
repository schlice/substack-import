<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If the assessment is a *fine* for a violation of the Rules and<br>Regulations of the Association, or for some fault you've caused, you're<br>certainly welcome to request a payment plan, but it's not required.<br><br>If the assessment is a special assessment which has been assigned to<br>*all* homeowners for a new repair or a new addition, the HOA should<br>automatically be providing payment options through whoever does your<br>association's billing. Usually, it is the management company which does<br>the actual billing of the monthly dues and any special assessments. The<br>management company should be the ones who would be providing a monthly<br>payment option. If they don't, request it from them. If they can't do<br>it, then address the Board about it. If the Board refuses to create a<br>payment plan, you have two options: borrow the money at your own expense<br>and repay it according to the loan you took, or hire an attorney to<br>compel the Board to create a payment plan with their management company.<br><br>Ultimately, the Board wants their money. But at the same time, they<br>don't want to see you fall behind in payments, and it is clearly<br>unreasonable to expect homeowners to front a large assessment all up<br>front. If you can't afford the entire payment up front, it's in the<br>Board's best interest to work out a payment plan with you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
