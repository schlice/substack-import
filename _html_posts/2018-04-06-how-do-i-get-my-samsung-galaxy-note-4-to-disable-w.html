<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do I get my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 to disable waking the screen<br>when I receive notifications from apps? I want the light to turn on, but<br>not the whole screen.**<br><br>There are several ways you can prevent the screen from turning on when<br>you receive notifications. Try them all out and see what works best for<br>you. Note that I'm not going to give you all the breadcrumbs through<br>Settings because the breadcrumbs are different depending on Android<br>version. You should be able to search Settings to find what you're<br>looking for. Or search Google for the feature and your Android version<br>and you'll find the breadcrumb trail to get you there.<br><br>1.  The setting you're really looking for is called *Ambient Display*<br>    settings and it's usually under Settings \> Display. You can turn<br>    that off, and then Android won't wake the display when you get a<br>    notification.<br>2.  You can modify how notifications for each app appear under Settings<br>    \> Notifications. You can enable/disable notifications for a<br>    specific app, or make them appear "silently" which means they will<br>    still show up in the notifications list, but they won't pop a<br>    notification onto the screen.<br>3.  More obscure would be to change how Gmail presents you with<br>    notifications (i.e. use the Priority Inbox) or how Email presents<br>    you with notifications (i.e. use the VIP setting), but these are a<br>    little more difficult to configure, and they are highly dependent on<br>    how you use email, and they do nothing for other alerts like<br>    Snapchat or SMS texts.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
