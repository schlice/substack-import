<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>At 18, can I purchase a handgun and put it in my car in Wisconsin?<br><br>Let's separate the "buying" from the "carrying in your car" questions.<br><br>Under Federal law, you must be 18 to purchase a handgun, but in<br>Wisconsin, you must be 21 to buy one from a registered dealer. Since<br>there are no background checks required for private sales in Wisconsin,<br>you can receive a handgun as a gift, or you can have one transferred to<br>you by your family, but you can't buy one yourself from a dealer. Even<br>in a private sale, if you are a prohibited person, it is illegal to buy<br>a firearm, but the seller hasn't committed a crime by selling the gun to<br>you.<br><br>However, despite what you may have been told, **open carrying in a<br>vehicle is NOT legal.** It is illegal to transport a loaded handgun<br>within reach while in a vehicle in Wisconsin without a permit.<br><br>So you can open carry while you are not in a car, but you may not open<br>carry in a car. Before you get in to drive, you must place the firearm<br>"out of reach" of the driver, so in a lockbox, or in a locked glove box,<br>or (preferrably) somewhere in the back of the car, like the trunk, in a<br>lockbox. You want to make extra sure that no one can accuse you of<br>having a gun "within reach," so even a locked glove box is not a great<br>idea. Somewhere in the back of the car, where the driver absolutely<br>cannot reach without stopping and getting out of the driver seat, is the<br>only way I'd transport a gun in a car.<br><br>When you get to where you're going, you may retrieve your handgun and<br>return it to your holster.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
