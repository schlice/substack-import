<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The article basically says that the 25th Amendment is good as it is.<br><br>It's simply up to the Vice President to be on his toes, along with the<br>members of Trump's cabinet, for signs of "mental breakdown."<br><br>And the speculation in the article is outrageous. They make it seem like<br>every day in the Trump White House is an exercise in trying to prevent<br>the president from making one stupid mistake after another, and if<br>anyone has an "off day," we're all in for World War III.<br><br>I didn't believe anything I read from media sources before, and I<br>certainly don't believe any of this now. None of those people have any<br>credibility any more; they are all dyed-in-the-wool liberal<br>propaganda-spreaders; their articles should be labeled "FOR<br>ENTERTAINMENT USE ONLY" as they rarely present any reliable facts that<br>can be verified.<br><br>Just as this story shows, there are no verifiable accounts of what the<br>"reporter" says about the Trump White House. For all we know, he made it<br>up just before he wrote it because it fits his narrative. And how does<br>he know? Where did he get his information? Was it verified? We'll never<br>know, and the media does like to hide behind their "protected sources"<br>front.<br><br>Nevertheless, the 25th Amendment is good as it is. If the President<br>can't fulfill his duties, the Vice President can take over. Simple. The<br>purpose of the Amendment is not to remove a president because "you don't<br>like what he's doing." That's what *elections* are for.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
