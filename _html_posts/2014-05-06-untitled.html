<br/><br/>Answer Comment<br/><br/><br/>Content: [This is correct; while state of registry is first in line,<br/>it\'s not always paramount in every case. In some cases, it is the<br/>nationality of the citizen in question which takes precedence. In some<br/>cases, national publicity by one nation or the other will determine<br/>which country has the greater interest in pursuing primary state<br/>prosecutorial ownership of the case. In every case in which nationality<br/>differences between the actors and the aircraft are different, the<br/>departments with valid standing will determine who is to take primary<br/>jurisdiction for any incident in question, because these are common law<br/>practices, especially in cases of international travel. They are always<br/>subject to interpretation and they are always subject to<br/>change.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Answer:<br/>https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-jurisdiction-of-a-crime-committed-in-an-airplane/answer/Joshua-Kaplan<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
