It was far more<br>successful (and survivable) in the prop age than it is in the jet age,<br>but it is still a somewhat survivable attack, depending on<br>circumstances.<br><br>There is no "rule" that says that a hijacked plane must be rammed.<br>Ramming is an option when armaments are depleted or jammed and the<br>opposing aircraft must be brought down. Our pilots will accomplish the<br>mission, even if it places them at risk of not returning safely to the<br>ground. Circumstances will always dictate how we will respond; there is<br>no doctrine that mandates any specific response.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
