<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My two-and-a-half year-old daughter won\'t potty train at all. What<br>should I do as she is getting frequent rashes from the diapers?**<br><br>At home, put her in underwear. On the road, put her in pull-ups.<br><br>Tell her that it's time (make a big deal of it) and that she gets to<br>wear big girl underwear.<br><br>She will wet them. Be prepared for that. But it will be far less<br>comfortable than wetting a diaper or pull-ups.<br><br>The whole idea behind pull-ups was that you could feel the urine inside<br>of them, unlike a diaper that "locks it away." That way, they could feel<br>the point at which they go and at which they start to feel<br>uncomfortable. With underwear, she won't like the feel of wet clothes,<br>and she'll prevent that (eventually) by using the bathroom before she<br>wets them.<br><br>Important point: don't shame her or be angry at her when she wets her<br>underwear. Just work with it---help her change into dry clothes,<br>extolling the virtues of how good it feels to be in dry clothes and<br>saying how uncomfortable it must have felt inside those wet clothes.<br><br>And take heart --- there aren't any 8 year olds still wearing diapers<br>because they never learned. It will come, and all kids get there at<br>different times.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
