<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: that\'s not for you to decide.<br><br>Longer answer: The officer who lights you up expects you to safely move<br>your vehicle to the shoulder when he does. The law doesn\'t allow you to<br>determine whether or not the area is "safe\" to stop in. If you stop and<br>the officer believes the area is unsafe, he will tell you to move using<br>the PA system.<br><br>If you abrogate a police officer\'s responsibility onto yourself, you<br>risk additional charges.<br><br>The only time I would ever suggest not doing is if it is an unmarked car<br>attempting to stop you and you are alone. In that case, immediately call<br>911 and find out if the car behind you is real. If it is, you must<br>immediately stop. In that case, and only in that case, slow down, move<br>to the right-hand lane, and activate your hazard flashers. You should be<br>doing this while you are on the phone with the 911 dispatcher. It's<br>still illegal, but the officer should understand.<br><br>I know some departments (ours included) generally will not use unmarked<br>vehicles for traffic enforcement, for that very reason. Some agencies,<br>like our state patrol, however, specifically use unmarked vehicles to<br>catch willful traffic violators. That said, the above likely doesn't<br>apply on the interstate. It's well-lit, and you're never alone. It would<br>be difficult to claim you're all alone on a well-lit interstate with<br>hundreds of cars passing you by. If you get lit up on the freeway, you'd<br>better be stopping.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
