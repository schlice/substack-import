<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **How do airlines handle passengers who booked a flight for a plane<br>> that just crashed?**<br>><br>> *Imagine flight 007 from Generic Airlines crashed on July 5th. What<br>> happens to the passengers that booked a flight for July 6th? Is the<br>> flight canceled or does the airline immediately puts another plane on<br>> that route?*<br><br>The airlines will usually have aircraft of the same type or similar<br>which can be rotated in due to routine mechanical failure. The same<br>action would occur if an airframe were out of commission because of a<br>mechanical issue as would occur due to a complete airframe loss.<br><br>If the airline cannot get a replacement airframe rotated in in time,<br>they will cancel the flight, which would cause the passengers to be<br>re-booked on another flight. If the airline could not re-book the<br>passengers onto suitable flights within their own airline, they would<br>transfer tickets to other airlines which could accommodate the<br>passengers' schedules.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
