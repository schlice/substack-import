<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Every line cop I bump into who says they don't recognize me and I tell<br>them I'm a Reservist has told me, "Wow, that's really awesome." "Thanks<br>for what you do." "We really appreciate you guys." Or something similar.<br><br>They thank us because we're the guys who come out to sit on a crime<br>scene so they can get back to patrol. We're the guys who provide<br>security for the County Fair so they don't have to. We're the guys doing<br>the jobs that are "time sinks" that are serious time killers but require<br>a sworn deputy to do. They know that if it wasn't for us, it would be<br>them filling that position.<br><br>We consider ourselves "force multipliers." We are there to back them up,<br>relieve them when needed, and stand beside them if necessary. They know<br>that, and as far as I can tell, they are grateful.<br><br>I can understand some of the criticisms, but we don't "take" anyone's<br>paid duty assignments. Those assignments are always offered to line cops<br>first.\* If no one takes it (we always tend to have more requests for<br>paid assignments than we can reasonably fill), they go to Reserves. The<br>pay goes back into the Reserve budget except in extremely rare cases<br>when a paid duty assignment *must* be filled and we can't even find a<br>Reservist to fill it. The department has, on those occasions, authorized<br>the pay to go directly to the Reservist just so the job gets filled.<br>Usually it's something on a holiday when no one but the duty crew wants<br>to be out, and I bet that in half of those cases, even they don't want<br>to be there.<br><br>These days, I think they recognize that the general public sees<br>Reservists as filling a crucial gap, and I'm not talking about the<br>manpower and money gaps (although we do that). We fill that "in-between"<br>space between a cop and a civilian. We're your insurance agents (we have<br>several), your car dealership owners (we have one), your tech support<br>agents (again, several), military contractors, military retirees<br>(there's a lot of that), etc. We're not full-time cops. We don't "live<br>the life" of a cop. Therefore, in some respects, we provide an<br>"outsiders" view of life as a cop, so the public knows there's people<br>doing the job who have a civilian's perspective on the job, while still<br>being full-fledged cops. The public respects that view, regardless of<br>what they think of cops in general.<br><br>\<br><br>\*There is one caveat to that. Here in Colorado Springs, our department<br>has one big-ticket contract with 10ABW at USAFA to provide all of the<br>security at Air Force home football games. With few exception, all of<br>the deputies at the game are Reservists. And that contract is our<br>bread-and-butter. Not to mention, it comprises a significant chunk of<br>the 192 annual hours we are required to commit to the department. To be<br>fair, pretty much everyone puts in more than that, but I had to mention<br>the minimum requirement.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
