<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes.<br><br>It is called "Late-Onset MS" and it is fairly rare. One<br>[study(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c2ac9b&url=https://doi.org/10.1590/0004-282x20170070){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="doi.org"}]{.qlink_container} shows that as many as 4% of MS<br>patients are diagnosed with Late-Onset MS, which is characterized as a<br>primary diagnosis of MS after age 50.<br><br>I actually knew a PA in Colorado who was diagnosed with Late-Onset MS.<br>He was in his 70s and already had heart trouble, so he and his<br>neurologist decided that they would not treat it.<br><br>Treatment is the same whether you're 40 or 80, but not treating MS<br>diagnosed in your 80s is also an option. There is a risk/benefit<br>calculation you have to take: how disruptive to my life will the<br>medicine be in order to receive a moderate ability to slow down the<br>progression of the disease? At a certain point, the interference with<br>normal life and side effects caused by the medication becomes too great.<br><br>But that's a decision between you and your neurologist. No one gets to<br>decide how to treat your MS but you, and whether and when it's no longer<br>worth it to you to do so.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional medical advice.
