<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I have loved the Dodge Charger since I was little. I have<br>always wanted a Charger. That will probably be my mid-life crisis car.\<br>\<br>When the police started adopting the Charger, I told my youngest son (a<br>gear head himself) that if I was ever going to be pulled over, I wanted<br>it to be a Charger.\<br>\<br>The fact is, I liked the Charger long before it was used as a police<br>vehicle, and I\'ll still like it long after police departments stop<br>using it.\<br>\<br>I often rent Impalas. I used to own at least one Explorer.\<br>\<br>The question you asked was do people who drive these cars feel more<br>respect or empowerment? I don\'t think so. For most of us, even an<br>unmarked police car is easy to spot: the aerials on the roof, the strobe<br>lights on the rear deck, the push bar on the front of the car, the dark<br>tinted windows, etc. I also know that police in my area have a general<br>agreement to not perform routine traffic duty in unmarked cars. Now, if<br>an officer in an unmarked car saw you do something egregious, they\'d<br>stop you, even in an unmarked car. I watched this happen. My neighbor<br>(who at the time was a Sheriff\'s Detective) was driving his unmarked<br>County car a few cars ahead of me, when a nominee for the Darwin Awards<br>decided he didn\'t want to wait for the red light to change, so he<br>rolled up on the shoulder, bypassing all the traffic (and my neighbor)<br>and proceeded through the light. My neighbor also pulled out of traffic,<br>the same way the Darwin Award nominee did, turned on his lights, and<br>stopped the vehicle. What he likely did was to call a marked unit to<br>assist (I was already through the light at that point), but he could<br>have just as easily written the citation himself.\<br>\<br>For the most part, that doesn\'t happen.\<br>\<br>So I don\'t really look at unmarked cars as something I need to be<br>worried about, and drivers of similar models are probably much more<br>thrilled at the fact that they own a car that is so popular amongst so<br>many groups.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
