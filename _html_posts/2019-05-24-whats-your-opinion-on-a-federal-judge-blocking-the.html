<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why did a federal judge blocks Mississippi\'s new abortion law?<br><br>The particular federal judge they *chose* (in a process called "court<br>shopping") is very pro-abortion. He heard arguments that the law would<br>destroy the abortion industry (it will) and decided that while the<br>constitutionality of the law is under review, the law should not go into<br>effect.<br><br>That's fine. The purpose wasn't to block abortions. The purpose was to<br>challenge the constitutionality of *Roe v. Wade.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
