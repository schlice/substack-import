<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can I be personally sued for a non-ADA compliant website?<br><br>As with any legal question, the answer is "it depends." Of course,<br>anyone can sue anyone for anything. The question, as always, is not<br>whether or not you can be sued, but whether or not the complainant has a<br>chance of collecting.<br><br>Currently, the law is a little bit murky when it comes to ADA compliance<br>on a website. Courts have been interpreting ADA in various ways when it<br>comes to website compliance. Some courts have stated that any US<br>business must have an ADA-compliant website. Some courts have said that<br>the website must have a "nexus" to a physical location which must be ADA<br>compliant. This is why Facebook was able to dismiss a 2011 ADA case in<br>California, but Home Depot was not. Finally, some courts have stated<br>that ADA simply does not apply to websites.<br><br>While the law is still all over the map right now, it's worth noting<br>that in a personal ADA lawsuit, the only remedies available are<br>injunctions which force you to bring the website into ADA compliance,<br>and attorney's fees. If it becomes a Federal case and the DOJ becomes<br>involved, they may invoke other civil penalties and/or fines.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
