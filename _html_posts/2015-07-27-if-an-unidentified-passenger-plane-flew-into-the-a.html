<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The entity charged with watching the ADIZ (Air Defense<br>Identification Zone) is NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense<br>Command, which is a *combined* command. A combined command differs<br>from a *joint* command as a joint command is inter-service, where a<br>combined command is international. NORAD is a combined US-Canadian<br>command comprised of military members from both countries.\<br>\<br>The ADIZ varies in the distance of its boundaries, but in general is<br>about 200 nautical miles off the coast of the United States.\<br>\<br>]<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-2ba9cac651868dc45fd7c1c5a9b83fab){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-2ba9cac651868dc45fd7c1c5a9b83fab" master_w="840"<br>master_h="674"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br>Any aircraft that crosses the ADIZ must have a valid flight plan filed<br>with the FAA. This includes aircraft that are continuing internationally<br>(i.e. not landing in the United States). An aircraft that does not have<br>a valid flight plan as it crosses the ADIZ *into* North American<br>airspace will be flagged, and NORAD fighter assets will be deployed to<br>intercept. NORAD has a fighter base dedicated to each ADIZ where pilots<br>sit \"alert\" waiting to dash out to an airframe and intercept an<br>incoming aircraft.\<br>\<br>The interceptors would visually identify and attempt to contact the<br>inbound aircraft using radio as well as \"shots across the bow,\" where<br>the fighter will cross the flight path of the intruder at a visually<br>close range. An F-16 screaming past the nose of your aircraft is hard to<br>ignore. At the same time, NORAD and FAA ground controllers will attempt<br>to contact the company or governmental agency that owns the aircraft,<br>based on registration or markings. Once they exhaust all attempts to<br>contact the aircraft, and they are certain that the aircraft is<br>intentionally non-compliant, the NCA (National Command Authority) will<br>make a determination on what to do. There are many things they can do,<br>such as escorting the aircraft, ensuring it does not endanger US<br>citizens by its actions, attempting to force it to land somewhere, or if<br>the NCA deems the aircraft to be a threat (especially if the aircraft is<br>not a commercial airliner), they do have the authority to shoot it<br>down.\<br>\<br>(EDIT) To answer the updated portion of the question:\<br>\<br>*If the plane ignored even signals from jet fighters and flew into<br>heavily populated areas and started releasing unidentified material. I<br>imagine orders to shoot wouldn\'t come quickly even in the aftermath of<br>9/11.*\<br>\<br>As I mentioned above, there are lots of factors that will determine how<br>the military responds to an intruder.\<br><br>- Is the aircraft a commercial jet liner with passengers aboard, visible<br>  from the windows? Is it a military aircraft? Is it a private cargo<br>  plane?<br>- Is the registration up to date? Can the owner be contacted?<br>- Is the pilot visible in the cockpit? Is he/she responding to visual<br>  signals?<br><br>On top of this, the pilots are authorized to shoot the aircraft out of<br>the sky if they see an immediate security threat. First of all, an<br>aircraft coming in from overseas or from another country, crossing the<br>ADIZ, without a flight plan, would not make it very far past US<br>territorial airspace (which is inside of the ADIZ).\<br>\<br>Even if it did, the pilots would prevent it from overflying a populated<br>area using whatever means they deemed to be necessary. It would never<br>get to a point where it could release something over a populated area.<br>It could absolutely do so with a flight plan, but without one, it would<br>be unlikely to be able to get close.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
