<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If I find an injured person in the street, should I take him to the<br>hospital in my car or call 911 in the USA?**<br><br>In general, the answer is call 911.<br><br>There are a few very rare corner cases in which loading the person into<br>your own car and driving them to the hospital might be acceptable, but<br>in the *vast* majority of cases, that's not the right solution.<br><br>Primarily, you don't want to do this because you can't begin to<br>stabilize and treat the patient en route, which an ambulance can do. The<br>call also preps the emergency room to receive the patient, gets the<br>right specialists in gear, and gets that ball rolling at the call onset,<br>rather than at your arrival. You get the fast-track to treatment with an<br>ambulance instead of walking in the front door.<br><br>Finally, and these days it can't be overstated, there is the issue of<br>liability. Yes, you are protected by "good Samaritan" laws which absolve<br>you of any liability in the event the person is hurt during your<br>transport and they choose to try to recoup some of those costs from you.<br>But must you really put yourself through that, when an ambulance is a<br>perfectly acceptable alternative?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
