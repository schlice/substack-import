<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If the Second Amendment was to (hypothetically) be repealed, do you<br>think it will be because of the Pro-Second Amendment supporters<br>unwilling to compromise on regulations, or because of the gun-control<br>supporters gaining more support?**<br><br>It's actually very easy to answer this question, and the way to answer<br>it is to understand how an amendment gets repealed.<br><br>To repeal a Constitutional amendment, you must pass another amendment<br>which declares the target amendment to be null and void.<br><br>How do you pass an amendment?<br><br>First, you have to draft an amendment. Then, the amendment **must be<br>ratified.**<br><br>There are two ways to draft an amendment:<br><br>1.  Two-thirds of Congress (that is, two-thirds of the House and<br>    two-thirds of the Senate) must vote to approve a Bill of Amendment<br>    detailing the actual Amendment<br>2.  Two-thirds of the states can call a Convention to draft Amendments<br>    to the Constitution (often called an Article V Convention).<br><br>Note that in the entire history of our country, an Article V Convention<br>has never been called. It's apparently easier to get two-thirds of<br>Congress to pass a Bill of Amendment than to get two-thirds of the<br>states to agree to an Article V Convention.<br><br>Once you have the Amendment drafted, it must be ratified. This means<br>that three-fourths of the states must ratify (or vote for) the Amendment<br>to be added to the Constitution. This means that 38 states must all vote<br>yes, which means that in 38 separate state elections, the majority of<br>the people must agree to the amendment becoming part of the<br>Constitution.<br><br>So now to answer your question: *If the Second Amendment was to<br>(hypothetically) be repealed, do you think it will be because of the<br>Pro-Second Amendment supporters unwilling to compromise on regulations,<br>or because of the gun-control supporters gaining more support?*<br><br>***The answer is neither. It will be because a majority of the people in<br>38 different states along with two-thirds of Congress agrees that it<br>should be repealed.***<br><br>Right now, there is *NOWHERE NEAR THAT LEVEL OF SUPPORT* for such a<br>notion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
