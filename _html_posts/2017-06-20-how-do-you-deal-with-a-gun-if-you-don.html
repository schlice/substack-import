<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>1.  Meet your girlfriend somewhere else. You could potentially meet her<br>    in a more "gun-unfriendly" state like New York or California, where<br>    only the bad guys have guns. You'll be much safer then. You know<br>    those bad guys, always following the law and such.<br>2.  Get over your fear. It's irrational; no one is going to shoot you<br>    unless you threaten their life. Don't threaten anyone's life, and<br>    you won't get shot. Somehow, I've managed to live over 40 years<br>    without threatening anyone's life; you can probably survive one<br>    visit to America without doing it. Perhaps you can't; I don't know.<br>3.  If you simply can't get over your fear and you can't meet your<br>    girlfriend somewhere else, get a new girlfriend who doesn't live in<br>    the United States. But watch out for Switzerland. They all have guns<br>    there. It must be utter chaos, blood in the streets there too. We<br>    probably just don't hear about it.<br><br>This doesn't really seem that difficult to sort out.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
