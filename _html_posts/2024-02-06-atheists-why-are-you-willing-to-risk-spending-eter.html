<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So let's be clear. I'm not an atheist. But your characterization of what<br>will happen to them is not exactly correct.<br><br>First, the Bible does not say eternal torture. The Bible says<br>eternal torment. Those two words are different. What you described<br>is eternal torture, and the Bible does not say that. It does say<br>that they will suffer eternal torment, but "unimaginable pain" is<br>incorrect.<br><br>The punishment of the wicked dead in hell is described throughout<br>Scripture as "eternal fire" (Matthew 25:41), "unquenchable fire"<br>(Matthew 3:12), "shame and everlasting contempt" (Daniel 12:2), a place<br>where "the fire is not quenched" (Mark 9:44-49), a place of "torment"<br>and "fire" (Luke 16:23-24), "everlasting destruction" (2 Thessalonians<br>1:9), a place where "the smoke of torment rises forever and ever"<br>(Revelation 14:10-11), and a "lake of burning sulfur" where the wicked<br>are "tormented day and night forever and ever" (Revelation 20:10). But<br>"fire" in the Bible is often used as a symbol of God's wrath or<br>judgement. God's "unquenchable fire" is His holy wrath, poured out<br>on the unrepentant, for all of eternity. It is punishment, not<br>burning in unimaginable pain. It is torment to fully know God and to<br>be fully separated from His love. That is true punishment, the<br>unquenchable fire of God's wrath.<br><br>The punishment of those who actively reject God in hell is as never<br>ending as the bliss of the righteous in heaven. Jesus Himself indicates<br>that punishment in hell is just as everlasting as life in heaven<br>(Matthew 25:46). The wicked are forever subject to the fury and the<br>wrath of God. How? By being burned in pain forever? Not necessarily.<br>Those in hell will acknowledge the perfect justice of God (Psalm 76:10).<br>Those who are in hell will know that their punishment is just and that<br>they alone are to blame (Deuteronomy 32:3-5).<br><br>In short, people in hell will fully know the glory of God. They will<br>fully know that they are eternally separated from that glory. And they<br>will fully know that it was their own choices which put them there.<br>Having that full knowledge of their circumstances, and the eternal<br>separation from the love of God, is the one thing which will torment the<br>unrepentant, day and night, for all of eternity.<br><br>\<br><br>Now that we got that little detail out of the way, atheists are "willing<br>to risk it" because they don't believe the evidence for the existence of<br>God is convincing enough. In fact, they believe that accepting the truth<br>of Christianity would require them to change their thinking, friends,<br>priorities, lifestyle, or morals, and they are not quite willing to give<br>up control over their lives in order to make those changes. They believe<br>that life would be easier and more fun without such changes. Perhaps<br>they realize that while Christianity is all about forgiveness, it's also<br>about denying yourself and carrying your cross. Indeed, Christianity is<br>free, but it can cost you your life. Atheists are simply unwilling to<br>make those changes.<br><br>But that's okay. They are free to make that choice, as God has given all<br>of us free will.<br><br>> In fact, that's the beauty of God's creation: if you're not willing to<br>> accept Christianity, then you're free to reject it. This freedom to<br>> make choices---even the freedom to reject truth---is what makes us<br>> moral creatures and enables each of us to choose our ultimate destiny.<br>> This really hits at the heart of why we exist at all, and why God<br>> might not be as overt in revealing Himself to us as some would like.<br>> For if the Bible is true, then God has provided each of us with the<br>> opportunity to make an eternal choice to either accept Him or reject<br>> Him. And in order to ensure that our choice is truly free, He puts us<br>> in an environment that is filled with evidence of His existence, *but<br>> without His direct presence*---a presence so powerful that it could<br>> overwhelm our freedom and thus negate our ability to reject Him.<br>><br>> In other words, God has provided enough evidence in this life to<br>> convince anyone *willing* to believe, yet He has also left some<br>> ambiguity so as not to compel the *unwilling*.<br>><br>> In this way, God gives us the opportunity either to love Him or to<br>> reject Him without violating our freedom. In fact, the purpose of this<br>> life is to make that choice freely and without coercion. For love, by<br>> definition, must be freely given. It cannot be<br>> coerced.\[1\](#OvLHb){#cite-OvLHb .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-OvLHb){.citation_index} [[I Don\'t Have Enough Faith to Be<br>an Atheist: Geisler, Norman L., Turek, Frank, Limbaugh, David:<br>9781433580758: Amazon.com:<br>Books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=770f5b&url=https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Have-Enough-Faith-Atheist/dp/1433580756){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
