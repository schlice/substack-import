<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [They go to kids jail.\<br>\<br>Seriously. Except it\'s not called \"kids jail.\" It\'s called<br>juvenile detention, a youth detention center, juvenile hall,<br>or as it is colloquially known, juvy. The name varies by state, but<br>the function is the same: the youth detention center houses youthful<br>offenders (YOs) who are awaiting trial, or who are awaiting placement in<br>other programs or facilities.\<br>\<br>What happens next is a function of whether or not the YO is going to be<br>tried as an adult. If so, he will go into the regular court system and<br>will be tried there. If he is not going to be tried as an adult, he will<br>be tried in the *juvenile court system*. Juvenile court has different<br>standards and different punishments for crimes committed by YOs.\<br>\<br>Once they enter the juvenile court system, most YOs charged with murder<br>will be treated as adults in the United States and will proceed to trial<br>under the regular legal system. There are still some children who are<br>not eligible to be tried as adults, and the age varies by state, but in<br>nearly all states, children can be tried as adults for capital offenses<br>such as murder, robbery, rape, arson and kidnapping.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
