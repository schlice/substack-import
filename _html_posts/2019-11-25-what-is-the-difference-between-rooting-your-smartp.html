<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the difference between rooting your smartphone and rooting a<br>tablet and why is rooting a tablet illegal?**<br><br>There is no functional difference between rooting a phone and rooting a<br>tablet.<br><br>Neither one is illegal.<br><br>However, rooting your device will void any manufacturer's warranty that<br>your phone may still be covered under. Word to the wise: don't root your<br>phone while it still is within the manufacturer's warranty period.<br>Additionally, some software will stop working when a phone is rooted.<br>For example, Samsung KNOX will no longer function when the phone is<br>rooted. This is because rooting the phone requires a custom bootloader,<br>and flashing the bootloader will trip the e-fuse in the phone. Yes, it's<br>a physical fuse. And once it's tripped, it will never work again; it<br>cannot be reset. KNOX functionality requires an intact e-fuse. Several<br>things rely on KNOX, including Samsung Pay, and encrypted "work"<br>profiles (if your company uses that functionality).<br><br>Nevertheless, to answer your specific question, there is really no<br>functional difference between rooting a phone and a tablet, and neither<br>is illegal. However, it may affect supportability and warranties, so<br>root with care and be sure you fully understand the consequences of<br>rooting.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
