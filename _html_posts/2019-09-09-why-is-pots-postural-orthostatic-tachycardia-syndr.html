<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's so commonly misdiagnosed because it's easy to misdiagnose.<br><br>POTS is generally associated with what is called a **pathophysiological<br>mechanism**. This means an area where pathology and physiology converge.<br>In other words, POTS is generally associated with disordered<br>physiological processes that cause, result from, or are otherwise<br>associated with a disease or injury.<br><br>In other words, you must have had one of the associated diseases or<br>injuries before the physiological disorder begins to emerge. It's not a<br>straightforward cause, and it's certainly not easy to spot. Its symptoms<br>look like a thousand other diseases or conditions.<br><br>Doctors who are unaware of POTS will really only reach that diagnosis<br>once they have excluded other causes of reflex tachycardia upon<br>standing. And since some of the treatments are similar, they may never<br>properly diagnose the condition.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why is P.O.T.S. (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) commonly<br>misdiagnosed by doctors?<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
