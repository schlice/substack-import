<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What would you do if someone murdered one of your relatives, and<br>nothing is being done about it?**<br><br>This is quite a hypothetical, because if you said that someone murdered<br>one of my relatives, you have already conceded that the police know that<br>this was not an accident, and it was not suicide.<br><br>Therefore, in order for the police to come back to me, look me in the<br>eyes, and tell me that they have literally exhausted every avenue of<br>investigation available to them and they cannot find the killer, I would<br>have expected them to do a lot of investigating.<br><br>If I felt that they had literally done everything they could, and there<br>was nothing more that could have been done, I would accept the fact that<br>there are just some things in this life that we will never know, and try<br>to live the rest of my own life in a way that honors my departed<br>relative.<br><br>On the other hand, if I felt that the police had executed a very sloppy<br>investigation and left many avenues of investigation untouched, there<br>would be no expense that I would spare to hire private investigators to<br>find the killer and bring him to justice.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
