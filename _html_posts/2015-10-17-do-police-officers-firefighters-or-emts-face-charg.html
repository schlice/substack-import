<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [They do not face \"charges\" as in criminal charges, but<br>they can face disciplinary actions. Since they are authorized to use<br>their lights and/or sirens at any time, they cannot face charges for<br>using them. It is only department policy that dictates when lights<br>and/or siren are to be used, and those vary widely between departments,<br>if a policy exists at all.\<br>\<br>Police officers are more susceptible to discipline than paramedics, as<br>police dash cams also record when the siren or the lights are on. A<br>simple review of the footage will tell whether or not the lights or<br>siren were on, and a review of the dispatch logs will determine if the<br>officer was responding to a call. Normal internal department<br>disciplinary actions will take place if complaints are received and it<br>is not the first occurrence.\<br>\<br>There is nothing in the ambulance that records what a paramedic is doing<br>and when he is doing it, so it would be far more difficult to accuse,<br>and then discipline, a paramedic for similar activities. So supervisors<br>will use volume of complaints to determine who is telling the truth,<br>basically. If it\'s a one-off, it will be treated as a one-off. If it is<br>a regular occurrence, the paramedic will be<br>disciplined.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
