<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What surprises me is that Britons are willing to accept that unarmed<br>officers should have no personal ability to defend themselves against<br>armed assailants, regardless of how good their hand-to-hand skills may<br>be. While I've worked as a US police officer, I would never personally<br>volunteer to be an unarmed officer, ever. I applaud, and am in continual<br>awe of, the work [[Adey<br>Hill](https://www.quora.com/profile/Adey-Hill)]{.qlink_container} and<br>his comrades do every day, and we in the US are saddened and horrified<br>by their loss, but being a PC in the UK is not a job you'd be able to<br>get me to do.<br><br>Yes, in America, individual liberty is paramount. We have **guaranteed<br>individual rights** which the government cannot infringe upon. Even for<br>the collective good.<br><br>In our view, collective welfare is socialism. The United States<br>government *promotes the general welfare*, but does not<br>*provide* it.<br><br>And we like it just fine that way.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/In-regards-to-the-recent-terror-attack-in-London-would-the-officer-who-was-stabbed-still-be-alive-he-he-had-a-firearm/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
