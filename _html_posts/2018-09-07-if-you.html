<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you\'ve been stopped by police and they request you open your<br>trunk, do you have to?**<br><br>Not without a warrant.<br><br>If they do not have a warrant, they can either get one, or place you<br>under arrest, at which point they can tow your car to the station and<br>inventory its contents. But of course, both of those need *probable<br>cause* (either to get a warrant to search or to arrest you).<br><br>Without those, any request to open your trunk should be answered with,<br>"Do you have a warrant?"<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
