<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>During the time of the American colonies, there were two legal practices<br>which were highly disliked among the colonists: *general warrants* and<br>*writs of assistance*.<br><br>A *general warrant* is a warrant obtained by a law enforcement or<br>government official which does not specify the location to be searched<br>or the item to be seized. It gives officials broad authority to search<br>persons or places as they choose, without any real description of what<br>it was that needed to be seized. These were routinely granted by the<br>Crown, to the distress of colonists.<br><br>*Writs of assistance* were similar. During the same time period, the<br>Crown began enforcing some provisions of the Navigation Acts by granting<br>custom officers writs of assistance. Much like general warrants, writs<br>of assistance not only allowed the holder to search anywhere at any<br>time, but they were permanent, and even transferable. They expired only<br>upon the death of the King.<br><br>The Fourth Amendment sought to provide citizens of the United States<br>with some sense of security in their persons and property, providing<br>that the government needed to be specific in their requests for searches<br>and seizures.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
