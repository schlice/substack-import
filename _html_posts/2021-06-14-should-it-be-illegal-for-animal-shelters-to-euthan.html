<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not necessarily. It's not any more humane to leave an unwanted or<br>potentially violent pet alive simply because we have no method to<br>euthanize them. To live out a life devoid of love or human contact is<br>torture, and that is a far worse fate than euthanasia. What *should*<br>be illegal is using a gas chamber to euthanize animals.<br><br>While the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) has declared<br>that euthanasia by injection is the most humane method of euthanasia<br>currently available, it has failed to condemn the use of gas chambers in<br>shelters. I'll spare you the details of euthanasia by gas chamber, but<br>just know that it causes the animal to suffer in pain and fear for<br>potentially minutes before it finally succumbs. No animal deserves to<br>die like that.<br><br>While we can't eliminate euthanasia for unwanted or potentially<br>dangerous pets, we can at least make euthanasia as humane as possible.<br>The number one way to do this is to endorse and promote euthanasia by<br>injection, and end the use of the gas chamber for euthanasia.<br><br>We are making progress. Since 2013, approximately 70 shelters in 13<br>states have voluntarily removed their gas chambers. But there are only<br>27 states with full bans in place, and gas chambers are known to still<br>be in use in at least four states.<br><br>The Humane Society of the US is driving to have bans passed in all 50<br>states so that no pet\'s life ever ends in a gas chamber. They have been<br>helping shelters voluntarily transition away from the gas chamber to the<br>more humane euthanasia by injection by providing grants and training and<br>has assisted states with passing outright chamber bans.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Should it be illegal for animal shelters to euthanize a healthy animal?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
