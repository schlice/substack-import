<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why do Trump supporters embrace herd immunity when it doesn\'t work?<br><br>It's not that it doesn't work, because to a certain extent, it does<br>work. However, coronaviruses are more like the flu than smallpox, so<br>herd immunity just doesn't apply.<br><br>In order for herd immunity to be effective, doctors estimate that<br>60--70% of the population would need to be infected and recover in order<br>for it to have any benefit, and that immunity must last for a<br>significant period of time.. Currently, we're pushing around 3% of the<br>population, and we are putting a strain on our medical system with just<br>that. We would probably need to be pushing that 70% figure in order to<br>prevent community transmission of this disease.<br><br>But much like the flu, the immunity doesn't last forever. Some studies<br>have shown that the immunity only lasts for about four or five months.<br>So much like the flu shot, you'll need to get re-vaccinated every year,<br>and even with the shot, it's only estimated to be somewhere between 30<br>and 80% effective against whatever strain happens to be circulating that<br>year.<br><br>If it follows that this strain of coronavirus is similar in transmission<br>characteristics to the flu, you'll be getting a coronavirus shot<br>alongside your flu shot, but even that is not a guarantee that you won't<br>get the virus.<br><br>Maybe in ten to fifteen years we'll have something akin to herd<br>immunity, but if this coronavirus is anything like the flu, then herd<br>immunity just isn't a thing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
