<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [False equivalency. Selling situations are completely<br>different. Selling something that requires skill and personal<br>involvement, something you craft with love and passion, is far different<br>than scanning a barcode and running a credit card.\<br>\<br>If I\'m a Walmart checkout clerk and I \"sell\" someone (to the extent<br>that a Walmart checkout clerk \"sells\" things) rat poison and they go<br>home and feed it to their kids and they die, did the Walmart checkout<br>clerk participate in the murder?\<br>\<br>I suppose it depends on your definition of \"participate.\" If you<br>consider \"selling someone the tools that, unbeknownst to you, they use<br>to commit a crime,\" then I suppose they did. Thankfully, the law<br>doesn\'t take your position.\<br>\<br>Most store clerks (including Christian gun shop owners) aren\'t building<br>custom items specifically for you. They\'re not handcrafting a special<br>item of significance related specifically to a special day that has<br>great social and political significance. They\'re just selling you<br>something that someone else made. They are probably leaving the box<br>sealed, too. Well, maybe they do a quality check before it goes out the<br>door, but they have no emotional involvement in that sale. There\'s no<br>handcrafted gun that they\'re making. But even if there was, the law<br>doesn\'t take the view that the person who sold it has any<br>responsibility for how the buyer uses it.\<br>\<br>So if I\'m a Christian baker and you come to me and want a cake for your<br>gay wedding, and I sell you an off-the-shelf Entenmann\'s boxed cake (I<br>don\'t even open the seal), I would consider myself to not have<br>participated in the wedding.\<br>\<br>If I sold you a cake for your kid\'s birthday, and you went home and<br>force-fed it to your kid and they went into a sugar coma and died, would<br>I be complicit in the murder? Again, assuming I didn\'t know you were<br>going to force-feed it to your kids in such a quantity as to cause a<br>sugar coma. The answer is no.\<br>\<br>Hopefully these examples help to illustrate the false<br>equivalency.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
