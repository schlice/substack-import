<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it legal for the speaker of the house not to send impeachment to<br>the Senate?**<br><br>The Constitution does not specify the time frame within which the<br>Articles of Impeachment must be sent to the Senate, so it's not<br>"technically" illegal.<br><br>However, the Senate has a Constitutional duty to hold a trial, and they<br>cannot commence with their Constitutional responsibilities until the<br>House sends the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate.<br><br>There is no Constitutionally-acceptable reason under which the Speaker<br>has the right to withhold the Articles from the Senate other than she<br>doesn't want to see justice done. Oh yes, she's made her excuses. The<br>Senate won't hold a fair trial! The Senators have publicly stated their<br>biases! On and on the excuses roll, and yet none of them are grounded in<br>any Constitutional authority.<br><br>The only authority the House is banking on: it's never been done before,<br>and there's no law or Constitutional provision specifically prohibiting<br>it, so it's not technically illegal. She can grandstand all she likes<br>until someone with authority (i.e. the court) says otherwise.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
