<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because despite all of the entities you mentioned, *the statistics<br>simply do not support the notion that guns make people commit crime.*<br><br>And the most telling examples are "all the other first-world or advanced<br>economies around the world" which have little to no guns in public<br>hands.<br><br>*They all still have crime*.<br><br>And for those first-world/advanced economies *which have transitioned<br>away from general public ownership of firearms,* the statistics show<br>that the change induced negligible impact to overall crime rates. In<br>Australia, for example, their big gun buyback (which only removed about<br>1/3 of the guns from public hands) had virtually no impact on the<br>(already downward trending) rates of homicide.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-11e6c652242b6533a47fed92136abe20){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-11e6c652242b6533a47fed92136abe20"<br>master_w="1073" master_h="770"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Innocent victims of violence using a gun do not change the fact that<br>crime rates are not positively correlated to gun ownership. Those<br>innocent victims of violence can be more helpful in making the case that<br>politicians at the state level need to get tougher on crime. Gun<br>crimes need to attach mandatory sentences, and DAs should be forced to<br>charge gun crimes when guns are involved, and they should not be able to<br>plead gun crimes away.<br><br>But at the state level, *exactly the opposite* has been happening, and<br>California has been leading the charge. California has been converting<br>more high-level misdemeanors to low-level misdemeanors (so they can't<br>even detain for those crimes any longer). They have also eliminated cash<br>bail, meaning that an offender can walk free with no accountability,<br>increasing the chance that they will not return for their appointed<br>court dates. New York and Illinois are not far behind.<br><br>And don't forget, those states have some of the highest rates of gun<br>crimes out there, despite having some of the toughest laws on the books.<br><br>Guns don't make people commit crime any more than forks make people fat<br>and paint and brushes make people artists. *People commit crimes*. Guns<br>have no magical powers to induce people to commit crimes.<br><br>If your idea is that guns somehow entice people to "punch above their<br>weight," so to speak, then you might want to take a closer look at<br>"liquid courage," otherwise known as *alcohol*. Alcohol is the largest<br>external factor in domestic violence, and yet guns are not even the<br>number one or number two weapon used in those cases (first is knives and<br>second is fist/feet). Controlling alcohol is a much more productive way<br>to reduce crime. Plus, alcohol has no positive effects whatsoever, while<br>guns *prevent orders of magnitude more crimes than they cause.*<br><br>But you probably won't do that because you like alcohol and you don't<br>like guns.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
