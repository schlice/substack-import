<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It depends on whether or not you want to pursue being an officer in the<br>Air Force.<br><br>If becoming an Air Force officer is the career path you would like, it<br>is much harder (but not impossible) to become an officer if you enlist.<br>It is possible to get into one of the commissioning sources (OTS, ROTC,<br>or USAFA) after enlisting, but the number of people accepted vs the<br>number of people applying means that it's not the easiest path to take.<br>If you enlist, you will likely remain an airman/NCO (Non-Commissioned<br>Officer) for your career. If being an Air Force NCO is the career path<br>you want to pursue, enlisting is your path. You'll enlist and almost<br>immediately go to Basic Training. From there, you'll go off to a tech<br>school where you will learn the skills you will need in your career<br>field. Then you will be deployed to an operational Air Force Base where<br>you will do that job.<br><br>What's the big difference between enlisting and becoming an officer?<br>It's more than just whether or not you salute others, or you are being<br>saluted. For example, officers have one career field they can pursue<br>that enlisted members cannot: pilot training. In the Air Force, only<br>officers fly planes. Enlisteds are flight crew members, work the flight<br>line, work aircraft maintenance, etc., but they don't drive the bus.<br>Some other differences: officers make more money. That may not be<br>important to you; it's just a fact. They live in nicer houses, if you're<br>lucky enough to get base housing. They also have advanced degrees right<br>out the gate. If you go ROTC, you will complete a 4-year degree before<br>accepting your commission into the Air Force. This means you'll start<br>out with a Bachelor's degree and will immediately be placed into a<br>leadership role. It may not be a huge one (my first shop had six<br>enlisted troops in it), but it's leadership. This is experience that<br>translates directly to the civilian world, and you're getting it from<br>day one.<br><br>As an enlisted member, you will be an NCO, and in time, will become a<br>mentor to younger enlisted members. You may even directly supervise<br>them. But as an officer, you are a *leader*. Whether you see it or not,<br>whether you believe it or not, your enlisteds will look to you for<br>leadership and guidance. Is that the challenge you're looking for? If it<br>is, perhaps the officer path is the right one.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
