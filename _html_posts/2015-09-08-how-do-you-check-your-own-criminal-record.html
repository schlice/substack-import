<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If you\'ve ever been arrested, you have a criminal record.<br>If you\'ve ever been charged with a crime, you have a criminal record.<br>If you\'ve ever been a defendant in a criminal court case, you have a<br>criminal record.\<br>\<br>If none of these things are true, don\'t worry, you don\'t have a<br>criminal record.\<br>\<br>But what comprises a \"criminal record\" only matters to the agency<br>doing the checking. Some agencies perform \"national agency checks\"<br>which, along with checking NCIC, also looks at things like credit<br>history.\<br>\<br>To be fair, however, you can\'t really run a check on your own criminal<br>record. Not everyone has free and open access to NCIC.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
