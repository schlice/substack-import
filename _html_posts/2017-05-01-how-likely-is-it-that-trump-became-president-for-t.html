<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So you think that Trump left his multi-million dollar salary as CEO of<br>the Trump Corporation so that he could make a \~\$200K salary as<br>President? Not likely at all.<br><br>Also considering the fact that he has pledged to donate his entire<br>Presidential salary to charity (which he has done), it's extremely<br>unlikely that he's "doing this for the money."<br><br>Interestingly, I think you'd have a hard time convincing anyone that his<br>ego drove him to be President. I think it's his conviction to what he<br>believes is the best course of action for the country rather than his<br>ego. It's his ego that tells him that he's a good president and that<br>he's doing the right thing, but it's his love for his country and his<br>belief that he knows what's best that is really driving him. I'm not<br>sure he is President simply because he has a big ego.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
