<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Since you are talking about trying to find a way out of jury duty,<br>you'll only buy yourself a reprieve for that particular day, not a "get<br>out of jail free" card to get out of jury duty.<br><br>You'll be excused for the day and ordered to report on another day in<br>the court's calendar for that season. Continued attempts to get out of<br>jury duty will not be looked upon favorably.<br><br>And in all of your scheming to get out of jury duty, think about this:<br>if you are falsely accused of a crime and they were picking a jury for<br>your trial, would you want your potential jurors to have the same<br>contempt for the system as you do, and to try their hardest to get out<br>of serving on your jury? Even if they did get seated on the jury, would<br>they be the most impartial people available?<br><br>Perhaps you'd be better served by doing your civic duty (it's literally<br>once a year at most --- our jurisdiction used to call it the "one day,<br>one trial" system) and just serving as requested. One of the things that<br>makes the American legal system a good one is the fact that you are<br>tried by a jury of your peers. Someone has to be the *peer* when someone<br>else is on trial. You'd want a good peer to be there for you, so it only<br>follows that you should be the good peer for someone else.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If someone gets sprayed by a skunk (on purpose) before going to jury<br>duty, what would likely follow?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
