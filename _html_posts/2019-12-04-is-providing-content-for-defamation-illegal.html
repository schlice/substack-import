<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is providing content for defamation illegal?<br><br>In general, providing content that is later used to defame someone is<br>not illegal.<br><br>There are some certain circumstances in which the content provider could<br>also be held responsible for defamation. Primarily, if the content<br>provider is providing content *knowingly*, that it's going to be used in<br>a defaming manner, then the content provider could also be held<br>responsible for defamation, and could become a party directly in a<br>defamation action.<br><br>Beyond that, it could be argued that merely providing non-confidential<br>unprotected information is a First Amendment protected act.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
