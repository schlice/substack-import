<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Should atheism be illegal since it ruins society?<br><br>First of all, good luck making atheism illegal in the United States, as<br>the First Amendment protects your right to practice whatever religion<br>you choose, or no religion at all. You'll need a constitutional<br>amendment to undo the First Amendment if you wanted to make atheism<br>illegal.<br><br>Secondly, your assertion that "atheism ruins society" is completely<br>unsupported by fact. At worst, atheism may have personal consequences.<br>Atheism has never been shown to have an impact on society.<br><br>You may be trying to assert that you think that religion is important to<br>a society. However, the United States was not founded on religion, it<br>was founded on freedom. Granted, the framers of the Constitution may<br>have been religious men (even this is unclear), but they chose to ensure<br>that no one could force religion on anyone. Freedom was more important<br>than belief.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
