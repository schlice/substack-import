<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In the military, you are basically \"under contract\" to<br>work for them, and a \"breach\" of that contract can get you separated.<br>If you don\'t meet military standards, you can be separated. Normally as<br>a civilian, you are an \"at will\" employee, and if either the employer<br>or you don\'t want to work there anymore, you can leave.\<br>\<br>There is substantial financial investment in training an individual in<br>the military services. Generally, the services are required to opt for<br>rehabilitation before separation, which civilian employers are not<br>required to do. Basically, the bar for \"being fired\" in the civilian<br>world is much lower than the bar for being separated from active<br>military service.\<br>\<br>There are two types of separations one can be awarded: punitive<br>discharges, or administrative separations. Punitive discharges can only<br>be awarded by court-martial (regular or special) and are either<br>dishonorable (general court martial) or bad conduct (general or special<br>court martial). These are the biggies, and are things that you would<br>normally be arrested for, and could potentially be tried in civilian<br>courts for as well.\<br>\<br>Administrative separations occur much more frequently, as all honorable<br>discharges are an administrative separation. Enlisted personnel can be<br>separated with a *characterization of service* (characterized<br>separation) or *description of separation* (uncharacterized separation)<br>depending on the facts of the particular case. For example, an<br>uncharacterized separation would be someone who has served for less than<br>180 days (i.e. leaves from Basic Training). This is considered an<br>\"Entry Level Separation\" and there is no characterization of service<br>at all.\<br>\<br>Administrative separations contain a characterization and a basis. The<br>*basis* is the reason for which a person is being administratively<br>separated. Many things such as weight control, pattern of misconduct,<br>convenience of the government for parenthood, completion of required<br>military service, etc. can be a basis for separation. Included with the<br>basis will be a characterization of service which refers to a quality of<br>the individual\'s military service. Characterizations can be one of<br>three: Honorable, General, or Under Other Than Honorable Conditions<br>(UOTHC). The character of one\'s departure from the military has many<br>consequences, from ability to receive retired pay to re-entry into<br>another service to receiving VA benefits or educational assistance.\<br>\<br>As long as a member\'s conduct meets the military\'s requirements for<br>normal conduct and their job performance meets standards, the discharge<br>will be Honorable. Members will be entitled to all post-separation<br>benefits, and will also be permitted to re-enlist in another service (if<br>available).\<br>\<br>General (Under Honorable Conditions) discharges occur when a military<br>member\'s job performance outweighs the positive aspects of their<br>military record, or a military member\'s conduct outweighs the positive<br>aspects of their job performance. Members will likely be able to get VA<br>benefits, but will not be able to get educational benefits. They also<br>will not be able to re-enlist in another service.\<br>\<br>UOTHC discharges usually occur when there are significant departures<br>from normal military conduct which don\'t rise to the level of<br>court-martial, or have not been frequent or severe enough to rise to the<br>level of court-martial. Acts or omissions that endanger military members<br>or the United States would generally be considered for OTH discharges.<br>In most cases, the member will not be able to get VA benefits, and will<br>not be able to re-enlist in another service.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
