Shouldn\'t you be able to protect your<br>belongings? (United States)**<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>It's not illegal to defend your property. It's just that state laws vary<br>when defining how much force you are allowed to use when defending your<br>property. Most laws allow you to use "reasonable and appropriate" force<br>to defend your property, but specifically disallow you from using<br>deadly force while defending your property unless your life is<br>threatened and not just your property.<br><br>As an example, see Colorado Revised Statute 18--1--706, Use of physical<br>force in defense of property.<br><br>Check your state laws regarding what level of force you can use to<br>defend your property in your state.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
