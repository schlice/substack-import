<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First off, the whole argument about magazine size is a red herring,<br>perpetrated by people who have no clue about firing weapons. They get<br>their ideas about guns from Hollywood, where bad guys actually wield<br>fully automatic weapons and spray thousands of rounds from a 30-round<br>magazine without ever changing mags. It's pure fantasy. A single<br>30-round magazine is no more deadly than three 10-round magazines.<br>Period. The whole argument is silly.<br><br>Secondly, we need to define what "large magazines" are. Since there is<br>no definition, it should stand to reason that a "large magazine" is one<br>which is bigger than the standard sized magazine. For an AR-15 (since<br>they seem to be the current target these days), a 30-round magazine is<br>standard. Therefore, a "large magazine" would be larger than 30 rounds.<br>But I assume that by "large magazine" you consider it to be any number<br>of rounds in one magazine that you find objectionable. So let's figure<br>out how a manufacturer determines how many rounds to put in one<br>magazine.<br><br>The short answer is efficiency. Based on the type of ammunition, the<br>"standard magazine" holds enough rounds to be efficient without being<br>too heavy and changing the firing characteristics of the weapon. If the<br>magazine is too heavy because it has too many rounds, it makes the<br>entire weapon unwieldy. If you have too few rounds in one magazine, it<br>becomes more unwieldy to carry multiple magazines to hold the same<br>number of rounds.<br><br>It often seems that the arguments for smaller magazines center around<br>the idea that "you simply don't need that many bullets." The question<br>becomes: by whose standards? In my opinion, I need at least one more<br>bullet than the bad guys have. They also hold the opinion that one<br>bullet equals one dead person who should not be dead. Again: by whose<br>standards? If he was shooting at me, I can shoot back at him. The entire<br>argument surrounding "high-capacity" magazines is simply a red herring.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
