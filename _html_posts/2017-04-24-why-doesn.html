<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because the First Amendment has nothing to do with offending anyone.<br><br>We have expanded the definition of the First Amendment beyond its<br>original scope. Recall that the Bill of Rights was designed to enjoin<br>the government from restricting or infringing on specific rights that<br>the framers felt deserved enumeration. The First Amendment was designed<br>to prevent the government from infringing on the people's right to speak<br>out against their actions. If you did that in England before the US was<br>founded, the King would have you arrested and probably beheaded. The<br>framers wanted to make it clear that government was by the people and<br>for the people, and they should not be free from criticism.<br><br>We have expanded the Bill of Rights to mean rights which are individual,<br>that no *person* should be allowed to violate, not just the<br>*government.* This is where some of our confusion stems from. The Bill<br>of Rights was not written to protect your feelings about certain speech,<br>or to address what one person says to another person. It was only<br>written to prevent the government from suppressing your ability to speak<br>out against them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
