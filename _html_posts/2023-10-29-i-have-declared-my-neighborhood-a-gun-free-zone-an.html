<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Everyone here is telling you that you are a troll, which you are. But<br>let\'s pretend to give you a good answer.<br><br>The one stubborn coward actually isn\'t cowardly. He\'s protecting his<br>home and his family, as is his right. And there is nothing cowardly<br>about a man standing up for his family and protecting them.<br><br>Anyway, so how do you get him to give up his guns? You show him that you<br>can protect him better than he can. He can only respond to threats<br>within seconds. You have to show him that you can respond within<br>milliseconds or microseconds, and with better accuracy and less chance<br>for collateral damage or accident.<br><br>Once you do that, he\'ll see that he doesn\'t need his guns, because<br>crime no longer exists for him.<br><br>Simple. But not so much.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
