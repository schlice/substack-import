<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Colorado just signed on to the National Popular Vote Initiative. Do<br>you agree with this?**<br><br>The National Popular Vote (NPV), at best, is a potentially legal (but<br>probably not) end-run around the Constitution. At worst, it's a<br>flaunting of the law to bypass the design the framers instituted without<br>following the Constitutional process, and an outright denying of the<br>will of the people.<br><br>The idea is to convince the states to assign their electoral votes to<br>the winner of the "national popular vote," which really doesn't exist<br>today. I mean, we can track how many people voted for which party in<br>each state election, but we don't have a national election. We have 51<br>state elections. We have 51 elections because it decentralizes control<br>over elections, a key benefit of the Electoral College.<br><br>There are many problems which are caused by a national popular vote.<br>First though, could you imagine this system having been in place in<br>2004? Could you imagine California willingly handing over its electoral<br>votes to a Republican? The "other foot" test (coined by Harvard Law<br>Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz) applies here: if the shoe is on the<br>other foot, would it still be acceptable? If a Republican wins the<br>popular vote, will you still go along with the policy? I doubt New York<br>would calmly give all of its electoral votes to a Republican without a<br>riot on their hands.<br><br>Additionally, each state's electoral code is different from every other<br>state. There are different rules about everything, from early voting to<br>absentee voting, to felon voting and qualifying for the ballot. A<br>state's election code only applies to that state. Thus, the election<br>code in California only applies to California voters. A vote passed in<br>California has no effect on a vote cast in Texas.<br><br>However, under NPV, a vote in California will affect the outcome of the<br>vote in Texas, thus denying at least one of these states their state<br>sovereignty. The existence of a different election code in one state<br>will now always affect a voter in another. Why should a voter in New<br>York get more or less time to vote than a voter in Texas? Why should a<br>voter in Colorado get to do a mail-in ballot while a voter in Florida<br>must physically attend a polling place if they are able? Why does one<br>state use paper ballots and another use electronic machines? Every one<br>of these differences between states represents an opportunity to file a<br>lawsuit claiming unfair treatment. The list of possible complaints<br>caused by differences in state election codes could go on forever.<br><br>> And think of the opportunities for voter fraud if NPV is passed!<br>> Currently, an attempt to steal a presidential election requires phony<br>> ballots to appear or real ballots to disappear in the right state or<br>> combination of states, something that is very hard to anticipate. But<br>> with NPV, voter fraud anywhere can change the election results \-- no<br>> need to figure out which states you must swing; just add or subtract<br>> the votes you need \-- or don\'t want \-- wherever you can most easily<br>> get away with it.<br>><br>> And finally, if NPV is adopted, and winning is only about getting the<br>> most votes, a candidate might concentrate all of his efforts in the<br>> biggest cities, or the biggest states. We could see the end of<br>> presidential candidates who care about the needs and concerns of<br>> people in smaller states or outside of big<br>> cities.\[1\](#DzEds){#cite-DzEds .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-DzEds){.citation_index} [[The Popular Vote vs. the<br>Electoral<br>College](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4b4a82&url=https://www.prageru.com/video/the-popular-vote-vs-the-electoral-college/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="prageru.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
