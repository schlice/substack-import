<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Fascinating.<br><br>So it seems that you believe that prayer is something you do to get a<br>desired outcome, as if God is some sort of cosmic vending machine: you<br>put the money into the coin slot (prayer), you push the right<br>combination of buttons (finely-tuned prayer) and the item comes out the<br>little door at the bottom (the ideal item).<br><br>The question reveals that the questioner has a serious misunderstanding<br>of the purpose of prayer.<br><br>If you stop and think about it, God doesn't need us to pray. He already<br>knows everything we need. *So why do we pray?* Do we pray because we<br>hope to *influence* God to do something He wasn't going to already do?<br><br>Here's an example. Let's say we pray for God to heal someone who is<br>sick. If that person gets better, was it God who did it in response to<br>our prayer, or was that person just going to get better anyway, whether<br>we prayed or not? The truth is that there is no way to ever know.<br><br>So why bother? If we're not "changing God's mind" by praying, why do we<br>do it?<br><br>Primarily, we pray because He told us to. We are being obedient in<br>bringing our needs to Him, *even though He already knows our needs*.<br>Therefore, if we are commanded to pray, and He already knows what we<br>need, then clearly the prayer doesn't get us something we didn't already<br>have. *It is the very act of prayer that God wants*. He wants to<br>hear from us, not because He doesn't know what we need, ***but because<br>He wants us to understand that we need Him.*** We submit to His will,<br>and we know that through Him all things are possible. Therefore, praying<br>is less about asking for something that we need, and is more about<br>acknowledging that He is the one who makes all things happen.<br><br>So does God ever do something in response to prayer? Absolutely! *But<br>not in the way you're thinking.*<br><br>Let's go back to the sick person. God knew, for all eternity, how that<br>sick person would end up. But at the same time, God knew, for all<br>eternity, whether you would pray for that sick person. So God took that<br>prayer into account when, for all eternity, He decided how to respond to<br>that prayer. So the prayer is not wasted. The prayer is definitely taken<br>into account, and God does not "change His mind" since He eternally knew<br>whether you would pray for them.<br><br>God generally answers prayer in one of four ways:<br><br>- No: God can say that what you are praying for is not what He wants<br>  for you, or what He wants for someone else, and so He *answers* your<br>  prayer with "no."<br>- Slow: God may say that what you are praying for *is* what He<br>  wants for you, or what He wants for someone else, but the ask is not<br>  in God's time for that thing to happen. You need to wait and continue<br>  to pray.<br>- Grow: God may say that what you are praying for is what He wants<br>  for you, or what He wants for someone else, but ***you are not<br>  ready*** for that thing to happen. Perhaps you need to *grow* more as<br>  a believer before you are ready to receive that prayer.<br>- Go: God may say that what you are praying for is what He wants for<br>  you, or what He wants for someone else, it is in His time, and you are<br>  ready to receive that prayer, and God does what you are asking.<br><br>So what have we learned? God is not a vending machine. God does not<br>"change His mind." But God does take our prayers into consideration.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
