<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If someone is doing a drive by at my house in Mississippi, am I<br>allowed to shoot back or am I only allowed to take cover?**<br><br>While it may be *legal* to return fire (which is debatable), it is<br>extremely *unwise*.<br><br>Yes, you are being threatened with deadly force (i.e. you are being<br>fired upon) so it is most likely legal to return fire. But firing on a<br>moving vehicle in a densely-populated neighborhood is immensely stupid.<br>One of the RULES of firearms (which you should know if you have one) is<br>KNOW YOUR TARGET AND WHAT'S BEHIND IT. What's behind your target?<br>Houses? With people in them? It's probably not a good idea to fire when<br>you could potentially be throwing lead into your neighbor's house.<br><br>Now, if your drive-by turns into a firefight into a *stationary* car<br>(i.e. they stop in front of your house), now it's a different story. Now<br>you're not shooting at a moving car. Now you're shooting at a stationary<br>target. Hope you have one of those evil AR-15s. You could use a little<br>bit of that evil at that point.<br><br>But a moving vehicle will just keep on moving. Get the information from<br>the vehicle (license, occupants, etc) and let it go. Take cover and wait<br>for it to pass.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
