<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Joe, you\'re absolutely right. There really is no excuse<br>for police to hit the wrong address. It\'s just sloppy police work, and<br>I can\'t abide sloppy work. I won\'t even pretend to make excuses for<br>it, because it\'s nothing but excuses. It happens far more often than it<br>should.\<br>\<br>As far as I understand it, thankfully, no one has died (yet) from police<br>hitting the wrong house. There have been some close calls, and there<br>have been some shots fired, but the intersection of the Castle Doctrine<br>and the No-Knock Warrant is a dangerous intersection<br>indeed.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Someone-prank-calls-911-They-send-police-to-my-address-it-is-1-am-and-I-am-sleeping-I-injure-kill-the-cop-thinking-he-is-a-criminal-What-happens-The-cop-cops-didnt-yell-Police-when-coming-into-my-property/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
