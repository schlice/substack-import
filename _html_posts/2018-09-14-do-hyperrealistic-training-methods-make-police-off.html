<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do hyperrealistic training methods make police officers more paranoid<br>and likely to use deadly force on the job?**<br><br>So, now I'm *really* confused.<br><br>First it was that police officers were using deadly force because they<br>*didn't have enough training*.<br><br>So we get them more training. Even *so-called hyper-realistic* training.<br><br>Now, we have the audacity to say they have had *too much*<br>training???<br><br>The article points out the problem with this exercise:<br><br>> *But what about the consequences of a mistake? After all, that dark<br>> object in the suspect's hands could be a wallet, not a gun. The<br>> occasional training scenario may even make that point. But officers<br>> are taught that the risks of mistake are less---far less---than the<br>> risks of hesitation. A common phrase among cops pretty much sums it<br>> up: "Better to be judged by twelve than carried by six."*<br><br>But the article's solution says that officers need to be taught "beyond<br>the gun belt." They need to be taught not only that there will be risks,<br>but also "the likelihood of those risks materializing." So, to translate<br>into human-speak, they're basically telling the officer that they<br>*shouldn't* shoot because it's really unlikely that the other person is<br>actually armed. It's statistically more likely that the object in that<br>person's hands *actually is* a wallet, not a gun.<br><br>Also, the article says that police should be taught about how<br>"unconscious racial bias" leads officers to perceive a greater threat<br>from black men than from others. So again, translating to human-speak,<br>we should pause before shooting because our stupid brains are<br>unconsciously tricking us into thinking that the person is actually<br>dangerous because he's black.<br><br>**And that moment's hesitation, while we wrestle with what our instincts<br>tell us versus what our new *socially-conscious,<br>politically-correct* training tells us, we're shot. And instead of<br>going home to our families in our cars, we're going home to our families<br>in the coroner's van, all because we hesitated.**<br><br>But that's okay, right? It's okay that a police officer dies instead of<br>a suspect, because "the officer signed up to do a dangerous job."<br><br>Seriously, I searched the entire job description for a police officer,<br>and I literally did not see anywhere in it where it says, "Gets killed<br>when necessary." Yes, the job has risks. But the only job where you sign<br>up to give your life when needed is the Armed Forces of the United<br>States. You do not sign up to die for someone breaking the law when you<br>join the police force. Granted, you'll do whatever it takes to protect<br>civilians, including standing in the way of bullets, but when it comes<br>down to me or him, I'm going home in my car.<br><br>Additionally, that officer is *still* a US citizen, and has the same<br>right of self-defense as any other US citizen. He has every right to<br>perceive a threat to his life (regardless if that threat is induced by<br>training or experience or general life experience) and to act<br>accordingly. Any citizen in the same situation would be able to react in<br>exactly the same way and still claim self-defense. Or are you actually<br>going to try to claim that a police officer has *less* of a right to<br>self-defense because he's wearing a certain uniform or working for the<br>government? I have never heard of a situation where a government<br>employee *loses Constitutional guarantees* simply because they work<br>for the government. As a trained military member, I *constantly*<br>perceive threats all around me. So does my training make me more likely<br>to shoot someone in self-defense than anyone else? Do I need to be<br>*re-trained* that those threats that I've been *trained to see* really<br>are just my brain playing tricks on me?<br><br>Thankfully, the law doesn't work that way. The law regarding<br>self-defense says that *I need to perceive that my life is threatened*.<br>It has no bearing on the legality of the self-defense claim whether the<br>threat was *actually real or not*. The only factor is whether or not I<br>perceived a threat. My perception is colored by my life experience, and<br>everyone's life experience is different. Hey, I've got a great idea:<br>*don't threaten people and you won't get shot.*<br><br>I just keep coming back to that one phrase: *better judged by 12 than<br>carried by 6.* If this phrase is true, and cops believe it, then nothing<br>is going to change, and any of this "feel-good" training may make *you*<br>feel better, but it will only make cops dead-er.<br><br>But again, some are probably okay with that. Because racism and<br>statistics, but mostly racism.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
