He has *intentionally* forfeited his own life.<br><br>*Has the infant in the womb been afforded the same due process?*<br><br>Who is the advocate who represents that infant? Has that infant been<br>afforded a rigorous defense? Who is the judge who signs off on the<br>verdict sheet for the infant?<br><br>Pro-lifers prioritize the protection of human life, but when the<br>individual does not, no one can help him.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What is the right to life\'s stance on capital punishment?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
