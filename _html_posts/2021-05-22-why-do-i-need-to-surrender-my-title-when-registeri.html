<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You don't always; it depends on the state you are in.<br><br>Many states allow you to keep your existing title. Nevada, for example,<br>allows you to register your vehicle and get a Nevada license plate<br>without a Nevada-issued title. Florida, on the other hand, requires you<br>to surrender your old title and pay to get a Florida-issued title before<br>you can register the vehicle in the state. Some states, like New York,<br>require a new title when you pay off your car loan, but you can register<br>your car with an out of state title.<br><br>When it is not mandatory to re-title your vehicle, it might be a good<br>idea anyway. It might make it easier when you go to sell your car.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**Why do I need to surrender my title when registering my vehicle to a<br>new state (USA)?**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
