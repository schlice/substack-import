<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>To be fair, it's not "legal" in any state because the Federal government<br>still has it listed on Schedule I. What states have done is to remove<br>any criminal penalty for its possession in that state. Colorado put this<br>provision in their State constitution. But don't mistake that for a<br>state making something legal that the Federal government says is<br>illegal, because the 14th Amendment says that's not possible.<br><br>This means that, until the Federal government can get out of its own<br>way, states will be the ones taking the lead on this, decriminalizing<br>marijuana at the state level, until most states no longer carry any<br>penalties for its possession.<br><br>It will be a very long time before the Federal government removes<br>marijuana from Schedule I. It's going to be a long, uphill battle just<br>to get them to move it to Schedule II so it can be prescribed by a<br>doctor. For reference, cocaine and opium are on Schedule II (and to be<br>fair, a big part of the opioid crisis is derived from prescription<br>abuse).<br><br>Whether or not employers stop testing for marijuana remains to be seen.<br>Alcohol is legal but you can't be drunk at work. So even for legal<br>things, employers can still choose to ban them, and can fire you if you<br>are caught using them. If it remains illegal at the Federal level,<br>regardless of what states do, employers who do business across state<br>lines will likely still prohibit its use because of such interstate<br>commerce (which is Federally governed).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
