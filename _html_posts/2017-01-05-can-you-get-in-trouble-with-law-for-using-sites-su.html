<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can get in trouble using sites like Quora!<br><br>Remember this general rule: *It's not necessarily the site you visit,<br>but it's what you do with that site which may be illegal.*<br><br>*Could* you get in trouble for using sites like Putlocker and<br>Kisscartoon? Yes, it is conceivable that you could get in trouble.<br>Assuming that it is illegal in your jurisdiction, which it likely is.<br>Consuming improperly licensed content is a violation of the copyright of<br>that content, and so the distribution of that content is illegal, and<br>consuming that content is also illegal.<br><br>*Is it likely* that you will get in trouble? No, it's not likely. The<br>copyright holder will issue a DMCA takedown notice, and the distributor<br>of the content will be required to remove it from their site. Usually,<br>the online provider is indemnified themselves, under the DMCA's "Safe<br>Harbor" provisions. But the person who uploaded the content is most<br>definitely liable, and the online provider would be obligated to provide<br>all relevant information to law enforcement agencies regarding if a<br>subpoena is issued.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
