<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>God *is* the standard. God *is* morality. So if God does<br>something, it is *de facto* moral.<br><br>You're probably thinking, "Yeah, but God kills people! How is that<br>moral?"<br><br>It is true that God has directly killed, or has instructed His people to<br>kill, thousands, including women and children. And as you may recall,<br>God killed the *entire population of the world* at one point, save for<br>Noah and his family.<br><br>"Right!" you're probably thinking. "If God kills innocent people, that's<br>murder! Why can God get away with murdering people?"<br><br>In order for God to commit murder, He would have to act "unlawfully." We<br>must recognize that God is God.<br><br>> *His works are perfect, and all His ways are just. A faithful God who<br>> does no wrong, upright and just is He --- Deuteronomy 32:4 ESV*<br><br>*see also Psalm 11:7; 90:9*<br><br>God created man, and as man's creator, He expects man to obey Him<br>(Exodus 20:4-6; Exodus 23:21; 2 John 1:6). When man sins (acts in<br>disobedience of God), he faces God's wrath (Exodus 19:5; Exodus<br>23:21-22; Leviticus 26:14-18).<br><br>> *God is a just judge, and God is angry with the wicked every day. If<br>> \man\ does not turn back, He will sharpen His sword; He bends His<br>> bow and makes it ready --- Psalm 7:11-12 ESV*<br><br>You're probably saying, "Yeah, but what about those women and children?<br>When God wipes out whole cities, that *has* to be murder!" However,<br>**the Bible does not detail one instance where God killed "innocent"<br>people**. In fact, compared to God's perfect goodness and holiness,<br>there is no such thing as an "innocent" person. We are all sinners<br>(Romans 3:23), and the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23a). God would<br>be *completely justified* in wiping us all out. The fact that He has not<br>done so shows that while God is *just*, He is also *merciful.*<br><br>Back to the flood, God's justice was clearly on display, because He had<br>already judged the entire world before He flooded it:<br><br>> *Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,<br>> and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil<br>> continually --- Genesis 6:5 ESV*<br><br>So yes, morality is objective. Following God's law is objectively moral,<br>and if God declared it to be moral, it is moral.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
