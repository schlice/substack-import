<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Most of the rules which cannot be enforced are rules that run afoul of<br>state or local laws. This often happens when a builder and their<br>property management company cover more than one state. Often they have<br>"boilerplate" rules that they then proceed to tailor for each state and<br>each neighborhood, but sometimes they miss a change in those rules<br>before the neighborhood is established. That rule would be<br>unenforceable.<br><br>*(And before you say, "Ha! That makes the whole thing illegal!" every<br>one of these contracts has a "severability" clause, which says that if<br>any one part of it is ruled illegal, then the rest of it is still in<br>force)*<br><br>For example, in Florida, you are permitted by state law to place alarm<br>company signs in front of your house. HOAs routinely try to control what<br>signs you can put in your yard, and some HOA rules prohibit signs when<br>the state permits them *and* the state law says specifically that no one<br>may restrict the placement of the signs. Florida law also similarly<br>permits all Floridians to fly American flags, and again, the law says<br>that no HOA may restrict those flags.<br><br>In other areas, HOAs can tell homeowners *how* they can install certain<br>things while not outright *restricting* those things. For example, HOAs<br>can tell homeowners where they can install solar panels, but they cannot<br>restrict homeowners from installing solar at all. Similarly, they can<br>tell you where you can install a satellite dish, but they cannot<br>restrict you from installing satellite dishes at all. The only issue<br>would occur if the approved locations for the satellite dish do not<br>permit usage of the service at all, in which case the HOA's rule would<br>be unenforceable.<br><br>Finally, there is a common misconception that HOAs cannot issue fines<br>when homeowners violate their parking rules, including parking on public<br>streets. This is a source of tremendous confusion for homeowners,<br>because most people conflate "parking fines" with "parking tickets."<br>HOAs do not issue "parking tickets" for public streets, but they can<br>issue you HOA fines for breaking HOA rules. You can break HOA rules<br>anywhere within the purview of the HOA: on private property, on<br>HOA-owned property, and even on public streets.<br><br>Remember that HOA rules are governed under state *contract law*. When<br>you sign your HOA covenants, you are essentially signing a contract and<br>agreeing to abide by the rules. Those rules may include where and when<br>you are allowed to park within the area of the HOA, including where and<br>when you may park on public streets.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
