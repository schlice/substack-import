<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is unreasonable to say the majority of American citizens are suffering<br>from "Stockholm Syndrome"? Considering there is ample evidence to<br>indicate the State does not actually care for them: foreign invasions,<br>taxation at gunpoint, laws on the books?**<br><br>Of course it's unreasonable.<br><br>First, American citizens are not prisoners. They are free to elect a new<br>government at the next election cycle, and they do so with great<br>regularity. They can elect representatives who can undo the policies<br>which they find uncaring, and so far, they have not done so.<br><br>Second, the state is under no legal obligation to "care for" its<br>citizens. It can work in their best interest, but not everyone is going<br>to be best served by what the state does. The state tries to maximize<br>the benefits to everyone, but the state is not designed to be a "benefit<br>dispenser." The state is designed to maximize the ability for everyone<br>to live as they choose. The state is designed to *promote* the<br>general welfare, not *provide* it.<br><br>And I agree, the 16th Amendment should be repealed and replaced with a<br>national sales tax on new items and services, with a rebate given to all<br>citizens refunding taxes up to the poverty line, thus retaining a<br>progressive system, and the poor still will pay no tax. Then you won't<br>have "taxation at gunpoint." If you don't want to pay tax, buy used<br>items instead of new ones. Congratulations, you didn't pay any tax.<br>Taxes on essentials are refunded to you (ahead of time, so it's<br>technically a "prebate" and not a "rebate).
