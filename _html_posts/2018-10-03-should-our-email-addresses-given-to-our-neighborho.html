<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should our email addresses given to our neighborhood homeowners<br>association be used to invite us to a political gathering or is this<br>crossing the line?**<br><br>The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends."<br><br>When you gave your email address to the HOA, they should have told you<br>why they needed it. There should have been a Privacy statement which was<br>given at the time they took your email. If you signed up using your<br>email on a website, the Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy on the<br>website should contain information relating to what the website can do<br>with your email address. Depending on what those documents say will<br>determine whether or not the HOA can give your email address to someone<br>else. According to the law, then when you receive one message from that<br>third party, you can opt-out of email and it should stop and they should<br>not further distribute your address anywhere else without your<br>permission.<br><br>More importantly to the HOA, if it is the HOA composing and sending the<br>message that is inviting you to the gathering (politics aside), the<br>message is legal because it is considered a "relationship" message under<br>the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. You already have an existing relationship with<br>the HOA, so they are allowed to send you messages.<br><br>When it comes to politics, it actually has *extra* protections as<br>"non-commercial" email. Political and religious emails are universally<br>considered to have extra First Amendment protections, because they are<br>expressly non-commercial.<br><br>Therefore, while it may be an unwanted intrusion into your email inbox,<br>under the currently accepted rules, it doesn't cross any lines.<br><br>You might consider talking to the HOA and informing them that you would<br>like to opt-out of any non-HOA related marketing emails. The CAN-SPAM<br>Act (if they're in compliance) should allow you to do that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
