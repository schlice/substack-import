It's sorta<br>like a statute of limitations for HOAs. If the HOA has not formally<br>requested, in writing, that the homeowner fix something which is not in<br>keeping with the Governing Documents, within one year, it becomes<br>permanent.<br><br>You will need to check your state and local laws to see if you have such<br>a provision. If your HOA is making you re-file for changes made years<br>ago, it might be time to consult with a real estate attorney in your<br>area who specializes in HOA law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
