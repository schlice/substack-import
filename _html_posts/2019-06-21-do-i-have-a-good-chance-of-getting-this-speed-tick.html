<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do I have a good chance or getting this speed ticket dismissed? A cop<br>pulled over for going 66 mph in a 65 mph zone and this seems incredibly<br>silly. I don\'t even think radar guns can be this accurate.**<br><br>Unfortunately, they are. And if you're thinking of the ***cosine<br>effect***, the net effect of this would *not* be that the gun would read<br>higher than your actual speed, but that the gun would read slower than<br>your actual speed by a mile or two.<br><br>[[Miles Gordon\'s answer to What is the margin of error of police<br>radar?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-margin-of-error-of-police-radar/answer/Miles-Gordon-3)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>So unless you're going to argue that the gun was miscalibrated, it's<br>unlikely that you could say that the margin of error of the radar gun<br>caused it to read faster than the car was actually travelling.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
