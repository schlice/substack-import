The Commission on Presidential<br>> Debates is biased and has refused to enact simple and commonsense<br>> reforms to help ensure fair debates including hosting debates before<br>> voting begins and selecting moderators who have never worked for<br>> candidates on the debate stage.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
