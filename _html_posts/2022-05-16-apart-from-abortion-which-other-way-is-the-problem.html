<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(US answer only)*<br><br>First of all, this is a poor argument. Ectopic pregnancies are not<br>viable. The egg needs to implant in the uterus to be viable, not in the<br>Fallopian tube.<br><br>Additionally, a ruptured Fallopian tube can cause fatal internal<br>hemorrhaging. Thus, the life of the mother is at risk. The odds of<br>surviving an ectopic pregnancy (roughly 60 million to one) are<br>outweighed by the risk to the mother for continuing the pregnancy<br>(massive internal hemorrhaging due to ruptured Fallopian tubes). Thus,<br>to save the mother's life, the pregnancy would be terminated.<br><br>Every state which has a post-*Roe* abortion ban (either total or<br>partial) has an exception to save the life of the mother. Medical<br>procedures to save the life of the mother are never illegal, and that<br>includes aborting a pregnancy to save the mother's life. They weren't<br>even illegal *before Roe*. And they're still not illegal.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Apart from abortion, which other way is the problem of ectopic pregnancy<br>supposed to be solved?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
