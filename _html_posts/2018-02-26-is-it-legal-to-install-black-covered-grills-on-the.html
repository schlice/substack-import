<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it legal to install black-covered grills on the headlight, tail<br>light, and indicators?**<br><br>Generally, any modifications you make to the car cannot impede the<br>operation of any required features. You can *possibly* install black<br>grills on the lights. Each state has different requirements for how much<br>light must be visible and at what distances, and what treatments may be<br>applied to lights. Check with your state laws regarding safety equipment<br>and what modifications you are allowed to make.<br><br>**Will I need to pay a fine to the Motor Vehicle Department if I install<br>them?**<br><br>If you willfully violate your state's laws and you receive an equipment<br>violation from your police department, you don't pay the DMV. You pay<br>the state, since you violated a state law. Generally, your remittance<br>goes back to the state department of revenue.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
