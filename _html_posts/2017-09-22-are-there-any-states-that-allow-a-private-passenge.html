<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, there are some. I happen to live in one.<br><br>Colorado allows some verified volunteer first responders to have red and<br>blue lights to respond to emergency locations. I know a few members of<br>our county Search and Rescue (SAR) team who have lights and sirens in<br>their POVs so that they can get down to the staging area to buzz out to<br>a mountain rescue.<br><br>This is addressed in state law (of course). Colorado Revised Statute<br>42-1-102(6) (emphasis mine):<br><br>> *"Authorized emergency vehicle" means such vehicles of the fire<br>> department, police vehicles, ambulances, and other special purpose<br>> vehicles as are publicly owned and operated by or for a governmental<br>> agency to protect and preserve life and property in accordance with<br>> state laws regulating emergency vehicles; said term also means the<br>> following if equipped and operated as emergency vehicles in the manner<br>> prescribed by state law: (a)* ***Privately owned vehicles as are<br>> designated by the state motor vehicle licensing agency necessary to<br>> the preservation of life and property; or (b) Privately owned tow<br>> trucks approved by the public utilities commission to respond to<br>> vehicle emergencies.*<br><br>As always, there is [[a<br>form](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e60d73&url=https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/DR2490.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="colorado.gov"}]{.qlink_container} you have to fill out, and<br>authorization stickers are provided for the vehicle. Also, the relevant<br>sections of law are on page 2.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
