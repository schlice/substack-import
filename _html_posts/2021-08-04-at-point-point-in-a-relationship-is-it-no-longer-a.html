So this idea of when you may have sex only<br>applies to those who believe in the concept of sin as something which<br>violates the laws of your particular deity.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>At point point in a relationship, is it no longer a sin to have sex?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
