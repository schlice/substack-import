<br><br><div><br><br># Answers<br><br>## Answer<br><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are two parts to this question:<br><br>- Can your landlord charge you for the dead grass?<br>- Can the HOA fine you for the dead grass?<br><br>1. Can your landlord charge you for the dead grass?<br><br>Whether or not your landlord can charge you for the dead grass depends<br>on a lot of different factors, but primarily you will determine this by<br>looking at your lease. Check your lease to see if the lawn is included<br>in the "rental premises" or if the lease discusses the lawn at all. Some<br>leases only talk about the interior, in which case you may not be<br>responsible for the lawn.<br><br>Since you mentioned that there is a lawn maintenance company, lawn<br>maintenance should be mentioned in your lease. Details such as lawn<br>watering and plant maintenance should be included on the lease. If they<br>are not, you may not be responsible for the lawn.<br><br>Finally, to determine who is responsible for the dead grass, you will<br>need to determine the root cause for the lawn death. There are several<br>factors which are outside of your control, such as:<br><br>- Weather. If you did everything you were supposed to do but the lawn<br>  suffered because of extreme weather, you may not be responsible for<br>  the death.<br>- Pests. Bugs in the lawn are not your fault. If you fail to notify the<br>  landlord about the issue when you see it, however, you could be liable<br>  (we'll talk about that in a second).<br><br>But even if you are not responsible for maintaining the lawn, you are<br>responsible for notifying the landlord if you notice that problems do<br>exist. Failing to notify your landlord of problems you see could be<br>classified under neglect. If you find bugs in the lawn, or if you<br>notice the lawn is dying, it is your responsibility to notify the<br>landlord as soon as possible so they can fix the problem. Ensure that<br>you have some recorded communication (i.e. an email or text you sent<br>them, etc) showing you attempted to contact the landlord about issues<br>you found.<br><br>Or it is entirely possible that you caused the lawn to die. You may<br>have had something parked on the lawn, or you have a pet who damaged the<br>lawn with waste or digging. In those cases, you can be charged for the<br>lawn replacement.<br><br>\<br><br>2. Can the HOA fine you for a dead lawn?<br><br>The short answer is yes, the HOA can indeed charge the tenant for a dead<br>lawn, but usually the HOA charges the *homeowner* regardless of whether<br>or not they live in the house. Generally, the homeowner would pass those<br>fines on to the tenant if the tenant was actually responsible for<br>maintaining the lawn.<br><br>Check the Governing Documents for the HOA. It may indicate who is<br>responsible for maintaining the property (i.e. the owner or the tenant),<br>and who the HOA will fine for issues. If it does not, inform the HOA<br>that you are not responsible for maintaining the lawn. If they fine you<br>anyway, you will have to pass those fines on to the landlord. You can do<br>that by withholding the fine amount from your rent, but the landlord<br>would have to agree that you are not responsible for the lawn or the<br>fines. Communication with your landlord will be key.<br><br>If your landlord is not being cooperative, you may have to engage a real<br>estate attorney in your local area who specializes in property rental<br>law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
