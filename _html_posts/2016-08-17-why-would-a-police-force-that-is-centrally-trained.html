<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Laws which are enforced by police are state-level laws, and police in<br>the United States work for the state, not the Federal government. The<br>Federal government does not have the authority to operate a police force<br>at a state level.<br><br>This would be a good idea if we didn't live in a federation of (mostly)<br>independent states, and instead lived in the United STATE of<br>America. The Federal government has already grown bigger than the<br>Constitution allowed it to, and the people have accepted it. This<br>sometimes leads people to believe that states are irrelevant and<br>everything can be done by the Federal government. If the Constitution is<br>the law of the land, then this is most definitely not true.<br><br>So when you do see a federal police force take over, it's either because<br>the Constitution has been amended, or it has been so summarily ignored<br>that you now live in a police state.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
