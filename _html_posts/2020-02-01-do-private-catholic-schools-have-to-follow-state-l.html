<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do private Catholic schools have to follow state laws about what has<br>to be taught**<br><br>In the United States, students must be taught to a certain level. This<br>level is determine by standardized testing, not by "what is taught."<br>States largely allow districts to develop their curricula, and to teach<br>it as they see fit, so long as student achievement on standardized<br>testing remains high.<br><br>Private schools are generally not bound by any curriculum rules which<br>might be set by a school district, although their students must still<br>meet a minimum average on standardized testing.<br><br>(EDIT) Thanks to [[John<br>Milhaven](https://www.quora.com/profile/John-Milhaven)]{.qlink_container}<br>for pointing out that I forgot my usual legal tagline: every state is<br>different. Even though many states can operate similarly, all states can<br>administer their education programs exactly as they choose, within<br>Federal law, which does not specify that a school must teach any one<br>specific thing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
