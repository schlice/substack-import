<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Can human rights be licensed?*<br><br>Most assuredly not.<br><br>You cannot be forced to register before you are able to exercise a human<br>right. If you have a right because you are human (the definition of a<br>human right), you need not *do* anything in order to exercise that<br>right. That right is always afforded to you simply because you are<br>human. No special process needs to take place before you can exercise<br>that right.<br><br>*However,* the State has a responsibility to ensure the safety of its<br>people. It may *limit* or *reasonably* *restrict* the exercising of that<br>right if doing so impinges upon the rights of others (which is called a<br>*compelling state interest*), so long as the restriction is done in the<br>least restrictive way to accomplish the state interest.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
