<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you get \"swatted\", the 911 call that generated the SWAT response<br>was unlawful. Does that mean you have the right to resist an unlawful<br>arrest?**<br><br>We have said it many times on Quora. Only a judge can determine if an<br>arrest is unlawful. Judges are involved *way, way after* the actual<br>arrest takes place.<br><br>An arrest is *presumed to be lawful* if the police officer is acting<br>under color of law, and he has probable cause to effect an arrest. That<br>makes the arrest, *de facto*, lawful, until a judge says that it is<br>otherwise.<br><br>And even if the SWATting occurred, the arrest would still be lawful<br>because the police only have to meet the probable cause standard at the<br>time that the arrest was made. Using that standard, the arrest itself<br>was still lawful, but the state would not press charges since you were<br>the victim of an unlawful 911 call.<br><br>Therefore, since only a judge can determine if an arrest is unlawful,<br>you have no right, under law, to resist the actions of the police. Do<br>what they tell you, and "tell it to the judge."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
