<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, let's answer one question. For any question that begins with "Can<br>God..." the answer is "Yes, God can." There is nothing that God can't<br>do. Can God destroy souls? Yes, God can.<br><br>Second, when it says in Matthew 10:28 that God destroys *souls*, the<br>word "soul" doesn't refer to the immortal part of us that remains after<br>we die. The word \"soul\" is a translation of the Greek word *psuche*<br>and from the Hebrew word *nephesh*. Both words mean \"a living,<br>breathing creature,\" referring to man or animal. \"Soul\" never means<br>something *immortal* inside of man or animal.<br><br>To make things more confusing, the word translated \"life\" in Leviticus<br>17:11 comes from the same Hebrew word translated \"soul.\" So that<br>passage could just as correctly be translated as, \"For the soul of the<br>flesh is in the blood.\" In Mark 10:45, it says that Jesus gave His<br>"life" as a ransom for many, but that word is the same one translated as<br>"soul." Even more to the point, KJV translates Isaiah 53:12 as<br>"\b\ecause He poured out His soul unto death," while NIV translates it<br>as, "because he poured out his life unto death\.\" Remember that the<br>blood gives life, so Jesus pouring out His blood is the same as Jesus<br>pouring out his life. So different translations of the Bible, which<br>originate from different Hebrew revisions of the Old Testament, will<br>translate that word differently. But in both cases, "soul" refers to the<br>physical life of humans.<br><br>Only God can destroy the physical body *and* the soul (life). No man can<br>do this. Any killing that man does is only temporary (sometimes called<br>the "first death"). Luke 12 relays Jesus' words at another time on this<br>topic:<br><br>> \"I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body<br>> and after that can do no more. But I will show you whom you should<br>> fear: Fear him who, after the killing of the body, has power to throw<br>> you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him." (4--5 NIV)<br><br>So Jesus is talking about the "second death" which God can do, which He<br>says is God "throwing you into hell." *That* is the destruction of<br>the soul (life) which is referred to in the Bible. Jesus says that this<br>is the death to fear. And it is only Jesus' shed blood which can save us<br>from that fate.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
