<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I searched the DSM-V for a mental disease or defect called "belief in<br>God" and I couldn't find any.<br><br>I did, however, find one called schizophrenia: "a psychotic disorder<br>characterized by disturbances in thinking (cognition), emotional<br>responsiveness, and behavior\.\"<br><br>So at its basest level, one is a mental disease, and the other is not.<br><br>But, you're probably saying, doesn't "belief in God" fall squarely<br>within the psychopathology of *delusion?* That's unlikely. The DSM<br>defines "delusion" as a false belief based on incorrect inference about<br>external reality that is firmly sustained despite what almost everybody<br>else believes and despite what constitutes incontrovertible and obvious<br>proof or evidence to the contrary. Belief in God is not usually out of<br>keeping with the patient's educational, cultural, and social background.<br>It is also not held with "extraordinary conviction" either. Even the<br>religious acknowledge the uncertainty of life, but faith drives their<br>belief. Finally, with over 2.3 billion believers around the world, it<br>certainly isn't something that only a small group believe and that<br>"almost everybody else believes" something other than religion. Clearly,<br>belief in God does not fit the definition of delusional or flawed<br>thinking.<br><br>It's also not a personality disorder. The way that faith is expressed,<br>and to which faith one believes, is very much influenced by the person's<br>personality, it is not the personality that *creates* the belief. The<br>personality doesn't cause faith; the faith exists outside of the<br>personality.<br><br>So one is a faith and a belief, and the other is a mental disease. The<br>two are mutually exclusive, even though people with faith and beliefs<br>can also experience similar mental diseases.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What is the difference between believing in God and schizophrenia?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
