<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Where does the notion that a cop can go a whole career without drawing<br>a gun except on the range come from?**<br><br>Your question is flawed. There is no notion that a cop can go a whole<br>career without drawing a gun except on the range.<br><br>There *is*, in fact, a notion that a cop can go a whole career without<br>*firing* a gun except on the range. And it's more than just a<br>notion. It's provable fact, supported by statistics.<br><br>Cops routinely draw their firearms during the normal course of a career.<br>In some cities, it may be almost daily, maybe even multiple times in a<br>single shift. But it is fewer than 1% of police officers who will<br>actually fire their weapons outside of the range.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
