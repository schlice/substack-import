<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If the VP of the USA does not wear a mask in public, why should<br>anyone? Should not he (and Trump) be setting a good example?**<br><br>This is a great question.<br><br>Why do we wear masks in public? Is it to protect others, or is it to<br>protect us?<br><br>We wear masks for both reasons. We want to protect ourselves from<br>pathogens, and we want to avoid introducing infections that we don't<br>know about to others. It's a *barrier*. It works both ways.<br><br>For Pence, he is regularly tested for coronavirus. We know he does not<br>have it. So we know he is not spreading it.<br><br>And if everyone else is wearing masks (to avoid picking up the virus,<br>and to avoid spreading it to anyone else), *if one person does not wear<br>a mask, does it really matter?* Pence wanted to be able to look people<br>in the eye (which you can still do with a mask) and he wanted to talk to<br>people and express emotion, which is challenging to do from behind a<br>mask. Pence weighed all this, and chose to forego a mask.<br><br>So what was the message Pence was sending?<br><br>Right or wrong, he did send a message:<br><br>*I am unconcerned whether or not I get the coronavirus, but I am<br>regularly tested and I know I am not spreading the virus to anyone<br>else.*<br><br>While he's right, he probably should have worn a mask to stay in<br>compliance with Mayo Clinic's policy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
