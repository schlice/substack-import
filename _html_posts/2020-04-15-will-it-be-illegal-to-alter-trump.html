<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will it be illegal to alter Trump\'s \"signature\" on my \$1200 check,<br>as he himself is not giving us the money personally?**<br><br>People appear to have the horrible misconception that Trump will somehow<br>be signing your checks.<br><br>This is Fake News.™ If you read this from a website, consider this your<br>first indication that you're reading Fake News™ from that site.<br><br>What will actually happen is that up in the corner of the check,<br>right underneath where it says "Economic Impact Payment", it's going to<br>say "President of the United States Donald J. Trump". It's still a<br>completely valid check. You can absolutely take it to the bank and get<br>\$1200 in cash. It will be made out to you, and signed by the Treasury<br>Department.<br><br>The text on the face of the check just identifies why you're getting it.<br>When you file your tax return, you get a check which looks exactly the<br>same, except the text in the corner doesn't say "Economic Impact<br>Payment," it says "Federal Income Tax Refund". The text doesn't change<br>anything about the legality of the check.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
