<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with all legal answers, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>In most cases, properly used sandbags will not place you into legal<br>jeopardy, but the operative word there is "properly." Sandbags should<br>only be used to protect your *structure*, so if they are going to be<br>used at all, you can only use them to keep the water out of your house.<br><br>But let's say you have *a lot* of sandbags. Couldn't you just use them<br>to keep floodwaters off of *your entire property?* In most cases, no you<br>cannot do this.<br><br>Assuming that you live in a neighborhood with other houses, the<br>*overland grading* performed when the house was built is designed to<br>move large amounts of water between and around properties effectively.<br>If you modify this drainage plan, either through landscaping *or<br>with the use of sandbags*, you could be liable for diverting that water<br>in such a way as to cause unintended amounts of water to trespass on to<br>your neighbor's property. Under the doctrine of *contributory<br>negligence,* you could then be liable for part of the repair bill for<br>your neighbor's property.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
