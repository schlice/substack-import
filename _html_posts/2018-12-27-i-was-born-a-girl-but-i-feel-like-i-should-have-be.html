<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I was born a girl but I feel like I should have been born a boy. I\'ve<br>been questioning my gender for ages but I was wondering if anyone knew<br>if this was a sign of gender dysphoria?**<br><br>Gender dysphoria is a *disorder* (although many of the modern medical<br>associations have quietly disassociated themselves from that word)<br>wherein which a person feels that they do not fit their birth gender. It<br>has some very definable characteristics:<br><br>1.  A marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and<br>    primary and/or secondary sex characteristics<br>2.  A strong desire to be rid of one's primary and/or secondary sex<br>    characteristics<br>3.  A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics<br>    of the other gender<br>4.  A strong desire to be of the other gender<br>5.  A strong desire to be treated as the other gender<br>6.  A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions<br>    of the other gender<br><br>There is treatment available for gender dysphoria. However, you didn't<br>mention how old you are. You said you've been questioning your gender<br>for "ages" but you didn't mention how many ages. This is important<br>because treatment for gender dysphoria is markedly different if you are<br>a child as opposed to an adult.<br><br>- *Children with gender dysphoria:* treatment typically involves a<br>  multi-disciplinary team of health care professionals, which may<br>  include a pediatrician, a psychiatrist, other mental health<br>  professionals, a pediatric endocrinologist (specialists in hormone<br>  conditions in children) and an advocate. Treatment may focus primarily<br>  on affirming psychological support, understanding feelings and coping<br>  with distress, and giving children a safe space to articulate their<br>  feelings. Parents of children with gender dysphoria may also benefit<br>  from counseling. **For many children the feelings do not continue into<br>  adolescence and adulthood.**<br>- *Adolescents and adults with gender dysphoria:* treatment options<br>  include counseling, cross-sex hormones, puberty suppression, and<br>  gender reassignment surgery. Some adults may have a strong desire to<br>  be of a different gender and to be treated as a different gender<br>  without seeking medical treatment or altering their body. They may<br>  only want support to feel comfortable in their gender identity. Others<br>  may want more extensive treatment including hormone treatment and<br>  gender reassignment surgery leading to a transition to the opposite<br>  sex. Some may choose hormone treatment or surgery alone.<br><br>Individual therapy can help a person understand and explore their<br>feelings and cope with the distress and conflict. Couples therapy or<br>family therapy may be helpful to improve understanding and to create a<br>supportive environment. Peer support groups for adolescents and adults<br>and parent/family support groups can also be helpful.<br><br>*(Source: American Psychiatric Association:* [[*What Is Gender<br>Dysphoria?*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ed773b&url=https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="psychiatry.org"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
