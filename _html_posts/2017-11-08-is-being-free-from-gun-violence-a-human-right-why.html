<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is being free from gun violence a human right? Why do so many US<br>citizens still support their government given the violation of human<br>rights?**<br><br>So it's clear from your question that you're targeting the US, so I will<br>frame my answer squarely around the US. Other countries treat this issue<br>differently.<br><br>Here in the US, our rights are defined by the Constitution, not the UN<br>or any other declaration of rights outside of the Bill of Rights.<br>Therefore, the only recognized "human rights" you are afforded in the<br>United States are defined in our Governing Documents, the Declaration of<br>Independence and the Constitution.<br><br>**In the United States, you do not have the right to be free from<br>harm.**<br><br>There is a right to life, which begs the responsibility upon others not<br>to unlawfully take your life from you, but there is no "right" to be<br>free from harm.<br><br>But if that's the case, you're asking right now, how does that square<br>with the right for people to own weapons which are specifically designed<br>to take life? The answer to that question is very simple: **there are<br>some situations in which it is legally permissible to take a life.**<br><br>If you have the right to life, and no one has the right to unlawfully<br>take that life from you, you have the concomitant right to defend your<br>life from anyone who might attempt to do so. Remember that the laws and<br>regulations in the United States are based on personal accountability<br>and personal responsibility, so no one else but you is responsible for<br>your safety unless prior arrangements have been made.<br><br>Therefore, if you have the right to defend your life against someone who<br>might attempt to unlawfully take it from you, you must be allowed to use<br>equal force to the force that is being presented to you. If this is<br>true, then you have the right to use any amount of force necessary, up<br>to and including deadly force, to defend your life.<br><br>At this point (I have the right to use deadly force to defend my life),<br>what difference does it make which tool I use to defend my life? The gun<br>is arguably the tool that will cause the least amount of collateral<br>damage if employed correctly. The correct employment of a firearm is why<br>carry permits generally require some level of training before they are<br>issued. The gun is very directed and targeted, unlike a bomb or a<br>grenade, which are very indiscriminate. The gun is the most effective<br>tool to use to stop someone from doing what they are intending to do. No<br>other self-defense tool is as guaranteed to stop a threat to your life<br>as the gun.<br><br>Additionally, the gun is "the great equalizer." It levels the playing<br>field: it puts the octogenarian on par with the 250-pound mugger. It<br>puts the solo homosexual on par with the car full of drunk college kids<br>with baseball bats. And it puts the single woman alone at night on par<br>with the male attacker lurking in the shadows. Only the gun can do this;<br>no other self-defense tool can do this.<br><br>If we are to be truly free, then we must be allowed to defend ourselves<br>from any threat. No one should have the right to tell us what threats<br>from which we are permitted to defend. Clearly, this means that on some<br>rare occasions (and it is rare, despite the wall-to-wall media<br>coverage), some whack-a-doodle with a gun will go shoot up a church. Is<br>this an acceptable risk? For freedom to exist, **these risks must be<br>acceptable.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
