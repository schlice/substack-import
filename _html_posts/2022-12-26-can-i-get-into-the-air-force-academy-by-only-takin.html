<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, every situation is different. But in general, I can tell<br>you that only taking honors classes and not playing any team sports<br>won't make you extremely competitive to gain admission into the Air<br>Force Academy.<br><br>The Academy is definitely looking for "hi-po's" --- *high potential*<br>candidates. Not only must you be at or near the top of your class<br>academically, you need to show proven leadership and constant<br>participation in either team or individual sports, and work in your<br>community, including volunteer activity.<br><br>You actually don't even have to take all AP classes. You just have to<br>consistently excel in the classes you do have, along with doing all the<br>other things I mentioned.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
