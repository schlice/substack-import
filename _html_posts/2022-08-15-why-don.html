<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why don't atheists realize that their faith in a lack of God has even<br>*less* proof than the theist has?<br><br>If we exist (and we do), and we are not self-existent, then we must have<br>been created by something. The Law of Causation states that we must have<br>a cause. Even Hume said, "I never asserted a proposition so absurd as<br>that something should arise without a cause."<br><br>That cause must be eternal, because if it is not, then *it* has a cause.<br><br>Therefore, we have a necessary, and eternal, cause.<br><br>There are two possibilities: an eternal universe, or an eternal<br>creator. Our universe is either self-existent, or someone created<br>our universe. Our universe was either created, or it was not. The Law of<br>Noncontradiction states this.<br><br>To date, all key scientific and philosophical evidence points to the<br>fact that our universe had a beginning (the Big Bang). If it had a<br>*beginning*, then it had a *cause*, and thus cannot be our creator.<br><br>Therefore, the only logical conclusion is to believe that an eternal<br>creator created us.<br><br>Atheists must hold on to the belief that we were created by the<br>universe, in the face of increasing evidence showing that the universe<br>is not eternal and cannot have created us.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why don\'t theists realise their faith in God doesn\'t meet the burden<br>of proof requirements to justify a belief in God?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
