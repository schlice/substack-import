<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Before we can discuss a "burden of proof," we have to figure out what<br>"proof" is acceptable when you are discussing an infinite, immaterial<br>being that exists outside of the physical universe, and is thus not<br>subject to its laws.<br><br>What "proof" can be provided that the questioner will accept?<br><br>Will they only accept evidence of the material? Not only is that<br>position disingenuous (since materialism as a philosophy is false), but<br>it is not possible with an immaterial God. God is not "measurable." You<br>can't "detect" God. So the evidence is going to be philosophical and<br>logical rather than physical.<br><br>As limited human beings, therefore, we must understand that we don't<br>possess the type of knowledge that will provide us with absolute, 100%<br>proof of God's existence. But really, outside of the knowledge of our<br>own existence (I know I exist because I can question my own existence),<br>*everything* falls into the realm of probability.<br><br>And yes, some faith is required to believe the proposition that God<br>exists. But isn't some faith required to believe *any* worldview? Even<br>pantheism and atheism? Atheism claims that there is no god. But how can<br>the atheist *know*? Had the atheist investigated every argument and<br>evidence of the existence of God? Can he answer every objection to<br>atheism? Of course not, and indeed it would be impossible to do so.<br><br>So the atheist, just like the theist, deals in the realm of probability<br>instead of the realm of absolute certainty.<br><br>So the question is not one of *proof*. The question is one of<br>*probability*, and which side has more evidence for their conclusion;<br>which conclusion is more reasonable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
