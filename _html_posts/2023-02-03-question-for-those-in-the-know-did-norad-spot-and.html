title: '"Question for those in the know. Did Norad spot and ID the Red Chinese spy
  balloon way before it reached the sovereign space of the U.S.? If so why no military
  action? Do you support destroying it? Just asking."'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not at first, but once it gained some altitude, they undoubtedly saw it,<br>long before it breached the ADIZ.<br><br>The question, of course, is why didn\'t they shoot it down. And the<br>answer to that question is probably far more political than military.<br><br>There\'s probably not much you can believe coming out of Washington<br>these days, but one thing is absolutely certain. If that balloon posed<br>any actual, physical, kinetic threat to the people of the United States,<br>it would have been shot down over the ocean before it even arrived at<br>our shores.<br><br>From there, the real reason why it was allowed to continue on its<br>journey gets a little bit murky. The truth of the matter is, even if it<br>is an intelligence gathering device, it is not any more advanced than<br>the spy satellites that China already has flying over the United States.<br>So they can\'t gain any new or different information using this method.<br><br>So then why wasn\'t it simply destroyed?<br><br>Politics.<br><br>Even though China allowed this balloon to breach our sovereign airspace,<br>China would undoubtedly claim force majeure, and sure enough, they did.<br>Therefore, if we shot it down because we claim that China was<br>deliberately violating our airspace, China\'s force majeure statement<br>would immediately be followed by the downing of the balloon being seen<br>by China as a hostile act, an overt act of war.<br><br>Compound this with the threat that falling debris poses to people on the<br>ground along with the fact that *capturing* the unit intact would be far<br>more valuable than *destroying* it.<br><br>Another very real possibility is that our current leadership in the<br>White House is simply vapor locked when it comes to dealing with China.<br>They couldn\'t make a decision if they had to, and by the time they had<br>come to some consensus, the balloon had already breached the mainland<br>and was flying over populated areas.<br><br>Whatever the reason they chose not to shoot it down, we can be certain<br>of a few things. It\'s no threat to us on the ground. Its intelligence<br>gathering capability is not any greater than any of their spy satellites<br>that they already have, which makes its presence here even more<br>bewildering. But ultimately, there\'s no denying that capturing the unit<br>intact would be far more valuable to us, intelligence-wise, then<br>destroying it.<br><br>Believe it or not, the US actually may be playing the long game here. In<br>other words, China is playing checkers, while the United States is<br>playing 4D chess.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
