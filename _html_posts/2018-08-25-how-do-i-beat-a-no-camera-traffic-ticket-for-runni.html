<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do I beat a no-camera traffic ticket for running a red light? The<br>light was yellow as I was driving under it.**<br><br>At least in Colorado, the light has to be red *before* you enter the<br>intersection. Your state may be different. You'll have to check the laws<br>in your state.<br><br>If the light was yellow when you entered the intersection, and your<br>state's laws specify that the light must be red before you cross the<br>stop line, you can challenge the officer's view of your tires with<br>respect to the stop line. Find the officer's position relative to your<br>car, and challenge the fact that he could clearly see your front tires<br>at the time that the light turned red.<br><br>If the officer had a clear view of your tires and he says you were not<br>across the stop line when the light turned red, it's his word against<br>yours. There's probably not much you can do other than pay the fine and<br>do better next time. Don't try to run yellow lights.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
