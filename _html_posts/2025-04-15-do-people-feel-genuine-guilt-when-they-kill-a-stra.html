<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Most well-adjusted people would feel genuine guilt for doing something<br>they know is wrong. However, there are some people who ***do not<br>feel guilty* about doing what they *know* is wrong.**<br><br>Clearly, we need to explain this a little more, and this all ties in to<br>what we know as the Moral Law. We intuitively know that all people are<br>impressed with a fundamental sense of right and wrong. We call that "the<br>Moral Law." Everyone knows, for example, that love is better than hate<br>and that courage is better than cowardice. University of Texas at Austin<br>professor J. Budziszewski writes, "Everyone knows certain principles.<br>There is no land where murder is virtue and gratitude vice." C. S. Lewis<br>wrote, "Think of a country where people were admired for running away in<br>battle, or where a man felt proud of double-crossing all the people who<br>had been kindest to him. You might just as well try to imagine a country<br>where two and two made five."<br><br>In other words, everyone *knows* **there are absolute moral<br>obligations**. An absolute moral obligation is something that is binding<br>on all people, at all times, in all places. This is the foundation of<br>the Moral Law.<br><br>This does not mean, however, that every moral issue has easily<br>recognizable answers or that some people don't deny that absolute<br>morality exists. There are indeed difficult problems in morality, and<br>people suppress and deny the Moral Law every day. It just means that<br>there are basic principles of right and wrong that everyone knows,<br>whether they will admit it or not. Budziszewski calls this intuitive,<br>inborn knowledge of right and wrong "what we can't not know," in his<br>book by that title.<br><br>We can't not know, Budziszewski writes, that it is wrong to kill<br>innocent human beings for no valid reason. Most people would feel guilty<br>if they were to kill an innocent person in this way. However, some<br>people may *deny* what they know to be true and commit murder anyway.<br>But deep in their hearts they *know* murder is wrong. **Even serial<br>killers *know* murder is wrong; they just may not feel guilt<br>about it. They may rationalize it or explain it away, but they**<br>*know* it is wrong.<br><br>Like all absolute moral laws, murder is wrong for everyone, everywhere:<br>in America, India, China, Japan, the UK, and in every other country.<br>Murder is wrong whether you have been taught that murder is wrong, or<br>whether you have lived on an isolated island nation which has no contact<br>with the outside world. That's what the Moral Law tells every human<br>heart.<br><br>This understanding leads us to the undeniable conclusion that while<br>everyone knows murder is wrong, some people have the inability to feel<br>guilt, or have the ability to rationalize what they know is wrong, and<br>murder anyway.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
