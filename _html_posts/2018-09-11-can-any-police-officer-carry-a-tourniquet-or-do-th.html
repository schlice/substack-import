<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can any police officer carry a tourniquet, or do they need training?<br><br>Every police officer carries multiple tourniquets. They usually have<br>shoes with laces (there's a tourniquet). They usually wear a belt<br>(there's another tourniquet). And since they get first aid training in<br>the police academy, they usually have a specialized tourniquet in their<br>first aid kits. The law only requires training on the items carried on<br>their duty belts, but they do get first aid training.<br><br>Everyone, not just police officers, should know what a tourniquet is,<br>when to use it, how to use it, and what items from which they can<br>fashion a tourniquet. You don't need to carry a specialized tourniquet,<br>although you can.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
