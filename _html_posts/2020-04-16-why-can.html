<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why can\'t President Trump impose a national lockdown like India?<br><br>Wow, a lot of answers, a lot of speculation, a healthy dose of TDS<br>(which always appears when Trump's name is in a question) and still no<br>one has actually touched on the right answer:<br><br>The President can only do what the Constitution allows him to do.<br><br>There is no power granted to the Executive branch which allows the<br>President to issue an order that all states must follow. Period.<br><br>The President could declare a "national emergency," which he has done<br>before, but all this does is activate certain provisions of other<br>Federal laws. Unless there is a Federal law which allows the President<br>to issue binding orders to the states in cases of national emergencies,<br>and I'm not aware of one if it does exist, the the President simply<br>doesn't have the authority to issue a "national lockdown."<br><br>The Constitution exists to define and limit the power of the Federal<br>government. Any power or authority not expressly granted to the Federal<br>government belongs to the states, and to the people, respectively.<br><br>Simply put: **the President can't impose a national lockdown because the<br>Constitution hasn't authorized him to do it.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
