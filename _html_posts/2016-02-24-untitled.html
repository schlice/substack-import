<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*They are demanding Apple build a backdoor into their product.*<br><br>I\'m sorry that I must take exception at this point, because what you<br>are saying is patently false.<br><br>I know you truly believe that the FBI wants complete and unfettered<br>access to everyone\'s smartphones all the time without a warrant, but<br>that\'s simply not the case.<br><br>If you read the court order, the FBI is not asking for a backdoor.<br><br>A \"backdoor\" means something built in to the operating system that<br>allows the FBI to decrypt the contents of the phone at will, without any<br>intervention by anyone, with their own special \"key.\"<br><br>***This could not be further from the truth, and it is disingenuous of<br>you to claim such.***<br><br>What the FBI wants to do to THIS ONE PHONE is the following:<br><br>1.  Remove the \"10 strikes and you\'re wiped\" feature.<br>2.  Remove the time delay between incorrect PIN entries<br>3.  Enable external keyboards for PIN entry<br><br>You also claim that \"the FBI will have the software and can use it on<br>any phone.\" This too is untrue. The order states that Apple can keep<br>the software at their headquarters. It never has to leave. In fact, all<br>the work to weaken the security posture of the phone will be done at<br>Apple\'s headquarters.<br><br>It will be the FBI that then breaks into the phone **not by defeating<br>the encryption**, but by using a \"brute-force attack\" against the<br>phone, repeatedly guessing passcodes at a rapid rate (using an external<br>keyboard and hacking software) until the phone is unlocked. The<br>encryption algorithms will never be touched.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-the-FBI-break-into-the-San-Bernardino-shooters-phone-Is-it-actually-that-secure-or-is-this-just-a-ploy-to-make-Apple-submit/answer/Craig-Weiland<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
