<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sure, anything is possible. But it is highly unlikely. Living a lie is<br>not mentally healthy for anyone, and eventually it will catch up to you.<br>Being forced to live in cognitive dissonance, violating the very tenets<br>of your own belief, just to keep your job, isn't good for anyone, let<br>alone a priest or a pastor who is supposed to be guiding other people<br>through the tenets of a faith in which they themselves do not believe.<br><br>You're literally claiming that a priest or a pastor does not practice<br>what they preach. While it's certainly possible, I find it unlikely.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
