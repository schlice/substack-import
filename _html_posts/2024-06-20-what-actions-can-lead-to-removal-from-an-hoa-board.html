<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As always, your specifics are going to be outlined in your Governing<br>Documents. Removal from the Board is dependent on the rules set up in<br>your particular HOA, and this is normally going to be found in your<br>Bylaws.<br><br>In my past HOA, any conviction for any fiduciary crimes was instant<br>removal from the Board. Also, if your account was not current (you<br>weren't paying your dues), you could be removed from the Board.<br><br>Finally, there are some state-level laws which can lead to HOA Board<br>members being removed. For example, in Florida, the homeowners can vote<br>independently to remove a Board member for any reason whatsoever, at any<br>time. If that form is delivered to the Board, the Board member in<br>question is automatically removed from the Board; no vote or meeting<br>necessary. The Board can appoint a replacement to complete the removed<br>member's term.<br><br>War story alert: In my last neighborhood, a Board member resigned in<br>lieu of being thrown off the Board by homeowners. She was about to be<br>removed because of her racist, bigoted, xenophobic, expletive-laden<br>tirade that she went on in a gathering outside of my home, in which she<br>intelligently screamed to my Puerto Rican neighbor, "Go back to your<br>f\*\*\*n country!" to which he replied, "I'M AMERICAN!!!" And that was<br>the *tame* interaction. Anyway, the next day, the petition to remove her<br>from the Board began to circulate and would have *easily* gathered the<br>required number of signatures, but she submitted her resignation in lieu<br>of being forcibly removed from the Board by the homeowners.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
