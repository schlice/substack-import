<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I received a ticket in Missouri from a red light camera. It included<br>photos of my truck, my plates, and my friend in the driver seat. Since<br>my friend was operating my vehicle am I obligated to incriminate him if<br>I go to court to fight the ticket?**<br><br>No. You are only obligated to prove that you were not the driver. You<br>are not obligated to incriminate the actual driver; you are only<br>obligated to prove that the driver was not you.<br><br>And you are only obligated to prove that you were not the driver because<br>Missouri local laws surrounding red light cameras are all over the<br>place.<br><br>[https://www.bleyevanslaw.com/blo\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=732324&url=https://www.bleyevanslaw.com/blog/missouri-strikes-down-red-light-camera-ordinances/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bleyevanslaw.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>> In [[*Sarah Tupper v. City of St.<br>> Louis*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6350a2&url=https://www.courts.mo.gov/file.jsp?id%3D90869){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="mo.gov"}]{.qlink_container}, the Court found that St.<br>> Louis' red-light camera ordinance was unconstitutional because it<br>> shifted the burden of proof to the defendant, typically the owner of<br>> the vehicle, requiring them to prove that they were not the driver of<br>> the car at the time that it ran the light, as opposed to requiring the<br>> prosecutor to prove that the defendant was the driver.<br><br>So whichever city or town gave you the red light ticket has an<br>unconstitutional system in place, because it has shifted the burden of<br>proof to you, requiring you to go to court and prove you were not the<br>driver of the car at the time it ran the red light.<br><br>If you want to *truly* fight this, get yourself an attorney and make<br>the claim that the locality where you got the ticket has an<br>unconstitutional red light camera ordinance in accordance with *Sarah<br>Tupper v. City of St. Louis.*<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice.
