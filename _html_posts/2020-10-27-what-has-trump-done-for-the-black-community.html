<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Has President Trump done good things for the black community?<br><br>Depends on what you consider "good things." I'm a conservative, so I<br>think that if I have more opportunities to earn my keep, that's a good<br>thing.<br><br>And Trump *absolutely did that* for the black community.<br><br>- Under Trump's economic plans, black unemployment (pre-COVID) was at<br>  its lowest recorded levels *in history*. Not just in this term.<br>  Not just in the last decade. ***Ever. Since they have been recording<br>  black unemployment numbers.***<br>- Trump has contributed *more money than asked for* to HBCUs<br>  (historically black colleges and universities). HBCUs are colleges and<br>  universities which were established before the Civil War which were<br>  created to primarily serve the black community.<br>- Trump was instrumental in creating Opportunity Zones:<br><br>> Since being enacted by President Trump, nearly 9,000 Opportunity Zones<br>> have been designated across the Nation, encompassing nearly 35 million<br>> Americans.<br>><br>> As of the end of 2019, Opportunity Zones have attracted \$75 billion<br>> in funds and driven \$52 billion of new investment in economically<br>> distressed communities, creating at least 500,000 new jobs.<br>><br>> Private equity investments into businesses in Opportunity Zones were<br>> nearly 30 percent higher than investments into businesses in similar<br>> areas that were not designated Opportunity Zones.<br>><br>> As a result of these new investments, approximately one million<br>> Americans will be lifted from poverty.\[1\](#VIRsK){#cite-VIRsK<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>- But he did more. Rather than just creating Opportunity Zones and<br>  forgetting about them, he directed federal agencies to prioritize<br>  their locations inside distressed areas, including Opportunity Zones.<br>  In the past, the federal government located facilities in central<br>  business districts. Doing this further enhanced Opportunity Zones<br>  without increasing costs to taxpayers.<br><br>So I'm not sure what you consider to be "good things for the black<br>community," but if you consider more opportunities for higher education,<br>more jobs, and more money in your pocket to be a good thing, then that<br>answer should be yes.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for<br>everyone.*<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-VIRsK){.citation_index} [[President Donald J.
