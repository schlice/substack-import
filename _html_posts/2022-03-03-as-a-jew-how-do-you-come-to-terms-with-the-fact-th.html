<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(NOTE: I understand I'm not Jewish; however, the sacred texts we are<br>discussing are also a part of the Christian Bible).*<br><br>So to answer that question, you must first answer this question:<br><br>What gave you the idea that God is in the protection business?<br><br>In other words, where did you get this idea that believing in God<br>guarantees you a trouble-free life?<br><br>There's certainly no reference to it in the Torah (or in the Christian<br>Bible's Old Testament, same books). People have this idea that once you<br>believe in God, all your troubles cease, and I don't understand the<br>source of that belief. As if God walks in front of you with his great<br>cosmic leaf-blower, sweeping away all troubles from your path.<br><br>So tell me: what gave you the idea that God was supposed to prevent bad<br>things from happening to Jews?<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>As a Jew, how do you come to terms with the fact that God didn\'t<br>protect His Chosen People (the Jews) from Hitler\'s holocaust or even<br>prevent / stop it? Does a part of you think the Jews were punished?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
