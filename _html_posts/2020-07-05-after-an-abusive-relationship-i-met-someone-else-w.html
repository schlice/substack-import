His ex arrives back on the scene & he says she broke it off as<br>trust had broken down. He feels he owes it to himself to see where it<br>can go. Can it really work out with them?**<br><br>*Really* work out? Like forever?<br><br>Anything can happen. But how likely is it to *actually* happen*? Not<br>very likely.*<br><br>I can tell you from personal experience. Once trust is gone, it is<br>incredibly hard to get it back.<br><br>They may say they want to work it out, they may say they want to try<br>again, but deep down inside, there will always be trust issues between<br>them.<br><br>Maybe they\'re the kinds of people that can get past their trust issues.<br>Some people can. But not everyone. And many people will forever retain<br>the scars of broken trust.<br><br>The only way to be able to truly trust someone again is to start over.<br>With someone else.<br><br>So can it work? Yes, it can work, for the right kinds of people. But for<br>the vast majority of us, broken trust will never heal completely. We<br>just learn to live with it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
