<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Fundamentally, isn\'t the desire to be the president in the first<br>place a prima facie indicator that someone isn\'t quite right in the<br>head?**<br><br>Yeah, you're right. All those assays in elementary school should be<br>carefully screened by a psychiatrist, and anyone who answers that they<br>want to be the President should be shipped off to a psych ward.<br><br>And cops, too. Those racist bastards should all be taken out back and<br>shot, right? Who needs them? Who needs Presidents? They're all mentally<br>insane, right?<br><br>/s<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
