<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Politically speaking,* in today's climate, a complete pro-life stance<br>is unworkable. The public feeling for rape victims precludes "forcing"<br>them to continue their unwanted pregnancy, so the platform actually ends<br>up being "pro-life with a few exceptions."<br><br>*However, if you frame it correctly,* the pro-life position is a<br>workable platform. To date, no one has done so. To frame it correctly,<br>you must look at the argument from an equal rights view. If you are<br>to claim that everyone has equal rights, you must logically include<br>unborn babies in that group. A baby has as much right to life as its<br>mother. The mother's rights and the baby's rights are equal. No one's<br>rights "trump" anyone else's rights. The rights compare equally, in all<br>cases. Rights always compare equally in every other case of rights as<br>they are listed in the Bill of Rights, why suddenly in this case does a<br>person not have the right to life because of an intersection with<br>someone else's rights?<br><br>This means that bodily autonomy has limits. And the limit of the<br>mother's bodily autonomy is at the fetus. The mother's right to bodily<br>autonomy does not reduce the baby's right to life. The mother using her<br>body to care for and grow the baby does not limit the baby's right to<br>continued existence. The fact that the mother may not have wanted to end<br>up pregnant does not limit the baby's right to life.<br><br>But of course, this is the point that the pro-choice people trot out the<br>edge cases, like the 13-year old rape victim who is now pregnant. But<br>you can't use the edge to ignore the middle. While I certainly feel for<br>the 13-year old, I also feel for the baby, who didn't ask to be in this<br>situation either, but here we are.<br><br>But we're not ready for that discussion yet.<br><br>From a practical standpoint, "pro-life with a few exceptions" is the<br>appropriate platform to run on, and it is the stance that the majority<br>of state laws are implementing, in advance of the overturning of *Roe*.<br>Abortion on demand is mostly illegal (some states allow it early in the<br>pregnancy) but past a certain point, abortion becomes illegal unless<br>there is a reported rape, or when the physical life of the mother is at<br>risk.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
