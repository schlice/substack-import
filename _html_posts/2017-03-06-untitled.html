<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*So you are saying any method i use i will have the same problem (an app<br>to read...)?*<br><br>You got it! The problem is not so much the QR code, it's that you need<br>to have something on the distant end to decode whichever code you use.<br>The native camera app on nearly all smartphones, by itself, does not<br>read QR codes (or any barcode, for that matter). You need an app for<br>that.<br><br>Suggestion: Underneath your QR code, you should add some text which says<br>something like, "To read this code on your smartphone, download a QR<br>code reader from your App Store." It's not ideal, but at least if<br>someone wants to get the URL, this is how they can do it.<br><br>An alternative might be to shorten your URL and add that to your flyer.<br>So if you have, for example, a SurveyMonkey survey, and it has the<br>massive SurveyMonkey URL, you can use a URL shortening service like<br>[[Google URL<br>Shortener](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=66f86a&url=http://goo.gl){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="goo.gl"}]{.qlink_container} or [[bit.ly URL<br>Shortener](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=532929&url=http://bit.ly){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bit.ly"}]{.qlink_container} to shorten the URL into<br>something manageable, like<br>[http://goo.gl/U7dfQ2(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5563b2&url=http://goo.gl/U7dfQ2){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container} (that's not a real<br>link, but that's how short your new link would be, and it would look<br>something like that).<br><br>Good Luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-open-a-URL-from-an-image-on-paper-Is-there-a-way-besides-QR-codes/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
