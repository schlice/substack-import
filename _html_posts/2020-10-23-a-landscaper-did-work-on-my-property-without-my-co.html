<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**A landscaper did work on my property without my consent, and is now<br>billing me. What do I do?**<br><br>Today in Law 101, we will be discussing *verbal contracts*.<br><br>A verbal contract can have the same force of law as a written one, and<br>you can sue over breach of contract with a verbal agreement just as you<br>can with a written agreement.<br><br>The problem with verbal agreements is one of details. The court has to<br>be able to extract the key details of the contract, which may be<br>difficult when the two parties do not agree on what those key details<br>were. They may not even agree that a verbal agreement existed at all.<br><br>The person wanting the agreement enforced now finds himself in the<br>unenviable position of not only proving that a verbal agreement existed,<br>but that it contained exactly the key details he is claiming.<br><br>This is why landscapers work on written orders. They provide written<br>estimates, which do not become finalized until signed and returned.<br>*Then* work can begin. It's more time consuming to do it this way, but<br>it leads to happier customers, and no misunderstandings about what work<br>was requested and what work was performed.<br><br>The court will also look at whether or not you knew the work was<br>ongoing. It's a lot easier to claim that you didn't want the work to be<br>done if you didn't know the work was ongoing. If you knew the work was<br>ongoing *and you did nothing to stop it* (for example, if one of the<br>employees spoke to you or someone in your house), you again will have a<br>difficult time convincing the court that you did not authorize the work<br>to be completed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
