<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is eternity and a qualified never.<br><br>A police officer can stand in front of your house (on public property,<br>like the sidewalk) for as long as they please.<br><br>The amount of time they stand there has absolutely zero bearing on<br>whether they have the right to enter your property. They never have<br>the right to enter your property without your permission or against your<br>will without one of two conditions¹ being met:<br><br>1.  They are holding a warrant giving them the right to enter your<br>    property.<br>2.  Exigent circumstances exist.<br><br>What are *exigent circumstances?* The legal definition of *exigent<br>circumstances* is "emergency situations where immediate action is needed<br>to prevent harm, destruction of evidence, or escape, justifying a<br>warrantless search or seizure. There are three conditions which can<br>trigger exigency:<br><br>- Someone is being harmed and cries out for help.<br>- Officers are aware of evidence of a crime which, if they needed to<br>  wait for a warrant before they enter, has a reasonable likelihood of<br>  being destroyed.<br>- Officers are aware of the presence of a wanted person in the property<br>  who, if they needed to wait for a warrant before they enter, has a<br>  reasonable likelihood of escape.<br><br>It is at least conceivable that an officer may be standing on the<br>sidewalk outside of your home waiting for a wanted person to exit, or<br>waiting to see if exigency will develop. Or maybe he submitted the<br>details to get an emergency warrant and he's just waiting for the judge<br>to approve the warrant before he enters.<br><br>\<br><br>¹ Anyone can reasonably enter the boundaries of your property and<br>approach your door and ring your doorbell to inquire about a matter that<br>they may be legally entitled to inquire about. This is called the<br>implied invitation to do business at your front door. For example,<br>UPS can enter your property to drop off a package. The Jehovah's<br>Witnesses can ring your doorbell to inquire about your relationship with<br>Jehovah. The fact that you have a clear path to your front door and a<br>doorbell is an "implied license" to enter your property. You can turn<br>them away, at which point they must vacate your property or they would<br>be considered trespassing. You have tacitly permitted this minor<br>incursion onto your property by having a front door and a doorbell.<br><br>This implied invitation is limited in scope. It generally permits a<br>visitor to approach the home via the front path, knock promptly, wait<br>briefly to be received, and then leave if not invited to stay longer.<br><br>You can revoke this implied invitation by posting "No Soliciting" signs<br>or "No Trespassing" signs (or by simply telling them to leave), and<br>failure to do so immediately may be considered trespassing and reported<br>to police.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
