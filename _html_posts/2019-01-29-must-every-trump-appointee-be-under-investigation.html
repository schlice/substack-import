Brett Kavanaugh<br>\'likely\' to be investigated for perjury.**<br><br>Brett Kavanaugh cannot be impeached for perjury, because he wasn't on<br>the Supreme Court during the time he supposedly perjured himself.<br><br>The Constitution says that Supreme Court justices "shall hold their<br>offices during good behavior" and this is taken to mean that behavior<br>*before* they held their offices does not count towards their<br>impeachment. Only behavior *while they hold their offices* is<br>impeachable.<br><br>So unless someone is going to argue that Kavanaugh perjured himself<br>*while on the Court*, then Constitutionally he cannot be impeached for<br>perjuring himself before he was on the court. He wasn't actually *on the<br>court* until he was approved by the Senate and sworn in by the<br>President; therefore, his nomination hearings do not apply to perjury<br>charges.<br><br>Therefore, he can't be impeached for any alleged perjury during his<br>nomination hearings.<br><br>And yes, every Trump appointee must be investigated because Orange Man<br>Badâ„¢.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
