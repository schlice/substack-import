<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**A man in California with +1000 guns was arrested, what exactly is he<br>charged with?**<br><br>A quick Google search found that the man was licensed to own the<br>weapons, and there is no limit to the number of weapons you can own, but<br>he was charged with unlawfully selling weapons, which is a California<br>charge.<br><br>Sometimes, the quantity of something makes you a potential dealer. For<br>example, possessing more cocaine than you can possibly consume yourself<br>gets you charged with possession with intent to distribute. This case is<br>similar. While there is no limit to the number of guns one person can<br>own, when you have illegal sales *and* a quantity of guns this large,<br>you have the potential for federal charges of selling guns without being<br>a registered gun dealer.<br><br>(EDIT) More details are emerging about this particular story. It seems<br>that this man definitely was a Federal Firearms License (FFL) dealer,<br>however certain firearms are illegal to sell in California. It appears<br>that the man possessed some of these prohibited weapons. It is unknown<br>from the details of the story whether or not the man attempted to sell<br>one of these prohibited weapons, but we do know that he was in<br>possession of them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
