<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We don\'t have retributive justice in America. That\'s why Justice wears<br>a blindfold. She only weighs the facts, nothing more. Your desire for<br>retribution plays no part in her decision.<br><br>People would like a retributive justice system here. These people are<br>the same ones who say \"justice was not served\" when a court finds<br>someone not guilty, when \"clearly, everyone I know says he was totally<br>guilty\" and we have to have \"an eye for an eye\" for what he did.<br><br>That\'s not justice. That\'s vengeance. Do you want justice, or do<br>you want revenge? Do you want to take from them what they took from you,<br>or do you want the *right* person to be convicted?<br><br>If you\'re only looking for revenge, it wouldn\'t make much difference<br>to you if the person might not be guilty. If *you* think he is guilty,<br>he must be guilty, and the court was obviously biased, or the whole<br>system is rigged, or something.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
