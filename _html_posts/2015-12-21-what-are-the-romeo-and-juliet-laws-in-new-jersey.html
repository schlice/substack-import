<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>New Jersey law says that you are guilty of sexual assault if sexual<br>intercourse occurs with an alleged victim who is at least 13 but younger<br>than 16, *and the accused is "at least four years older" than the<br>alleged victim.* This portion of the New Jersey statute is called the<br>\"close in age\" clause, and it says that if you are within four years<br>in age, you are considered \"close in age\" and not eligible for<br>prosecution under this statute. The \"close in age\" clause protects<br>teens engaging in consensual sex from prosecution and registration as<br>sex offenders.<br><br>Therefore, according to the statute, if you are 18 and your girlfriend<br>is 15, you meet the \"close in age\" portion of the New Jersey law, and<br>you would not be eligible to be charged with sexual assault.<br><br>NOTE: I am not a lawyer. I am not telling you that you are<br>guaranteed to never be charged. I am merely providing information on<br>the New Jersey sexual assault statute. If you are accused of sexual<br>assault against a minor, you would have to find help from an experienced<br>criminal defense attorney in New Jersey.<br><br>Note that I\'m also not telling you whether or not your relationship is<br>a good idea. You are 18, I leave that for you to decide. However, it<br>might be in your best interest to hold off on sexual activity until your<br>girlfriend turns 16, at which point you are both able to consent under<br>New Jersey law, and there is no possibility that you can be charged with<br>sexual assault against a minor. Also bear in mind that if you turn 19<br>before she turns 16, you can be convicted. My only advice to you:<br>wait until she turns 16.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
