<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Suspended basically means not actively being worked, but<br>not closed. If new evidence is introduced or discovered, the case may<br>become active again.\<br>\<br>After a set period of time, the case will go \"cold\" and will be<br>archived. It is still not closed. If the crime has a statute of<br>limitations, the case will be closed when the crime hits its date of<br>statute.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
