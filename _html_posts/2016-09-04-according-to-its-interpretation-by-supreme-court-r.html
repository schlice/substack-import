<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, for the purpose of this answer, we will consider a "known<br>law-breaker" to be someone who has been adjudicated by a court to have<br>broken a law.<br><br>The Constitution lists only as its requirement that the individual be a<br>US citizen in order to be protected by it. Unless you somehow lose your<br>citizenship when you break the law, you are still protected by the<br>Constitution, even after doing so. While some of your rights are<br>curtailed while you're in jail, even inmates still have Constitutional<br>rights, though not many.<br><br>There are only a few very well controlled times that anyone's rights can<br>ever be curtailed, and even in those cases, the curtailment of your<br>rights is very limited and specific. Most of these are all accomplished<br>at a state level. The primary and most well-known circumstance under<br>which you can have your Constitutional rights curtailed is when you are<br>convicted of a violent felony. Some of the rights you may lose,<br>depending on state:<br><br>- The right to vote (also known as disenfranchisement)<br>- The right to purchase and/or possess firearms<br>- The right to sit on a jury<br>- Employers are allowed to discriminate against convicted felons and not<br>  offer them employment simply because they are a convicted felon,<br>  although they are not required to do so<br>- The right to work in certain occupations, such as any job with the US<br>  government, law enforcement, child care, or any occupation which<br>  requires a professional degree or certification<br>- Parental rights are often severely curtailed when a parent is<br>  convicted of a felony. Felony is a big red flag to family court<br>  judges, usually driving them to award rights and custody to the other<br>  parent.<br>- And while it's not necessarily a loss of rights, convicted felons have<br>  a very difficult time doing anything that requires paperwork of any<br>  official capacity, including signing leases and loans.<br><br>Domestic violence is another area in which rights get curtailed. In<br>my state (Colorado), if you are involved in legal proceedings regarding<br>domestic violence, the court is required to issue a protective order to<br>put the opposing parties "in their corners" while the case is ongoing.<br>Colorado passed a law in 2013 that says that if you are convicted of<br>domestic violence, you lose the right to purchase and/or possess<br>firearms. That same law also triggers when you have a domestic violence<br>protective order issued against you. This means that once legal<br>proceedings for domestic violence begin, you lose possession of your<br>firearms, and the offender is required to surrender his firearms within<br>24 hours of being served the protective order.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
