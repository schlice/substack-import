<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you stay silent in a court setting where you are supposed to be<br>giving a testimony on the witness stand? Could there be legal<br>consequences to that? Is that considered perjury?**<br><br>It's not perjury. It's a different offense: contempt of court.<br><br>If you have been called to testify and you have been placed under oath,<br>and you are asked a question, you are expected to answer that question.<br>You are expected not to lie (since you have been placed under oath).<br>Lying would be perjury.<br><br>But if you have been called to testify and you sit silently, the judge<br>will direct you to answer the question. Remaining silent and failing to<br>answer the question after the judge directs you to do so is considered<br>contempt of court. Contempt is a process crime, and if a judge finds<br>you in contempt, you can be fined, or jailed. Immediately. As in the<br>deputy in the courtroom will arrest you on the spot and take you to the<br>county jail. You will be held there until you agree to testify. Which<br>could be a long time if you're stubborn.<br><br>You might be remaining silent because if you answer the question, you<br>would be admitting that you committed a crime (for example, the only way<br>you could know that the defendant was robbing a jewelry store was if you<br>were there or you conspired with him). The 5th Amendment says that you<br>cannot be a witness against yourself, so you can assert at that point<br>that answering that question would violate your rights under the 5th<br>Amendment, or to use shorthand, you can "plead the 5th." In general,<br>this doesn't happen, because the prosecutor would have offered you an<br>"immunity agreement" whereby you acknowledge that you did something<br>illegal, but under your agreement, you won't be charged for it because<br>you agree to testify against the defendant.<br><br>If instead you are asked a question and you don't answer completely, or<br>you don't actually answer the question, or you are otherwise combative<br>or uncooperative when answering, the attorney can ask the judge to<br>declare you a "hostile witness." If that happens, the attorney is then<br>allowed to ask you leading questions, which either imply the answer<br>(such as, "You saw my client at the club that night, correct?"), or<br>challenge your testimony (such as "Didn't you say in that email that you<br>saw my client at the club that night? No? Here's a copy of the email,<br>please read the highlighted section"). In general, leading questions are<br>only allowed during cross-examination, but if you are declared a hostile<br>witness, this exception is made.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
