My landlord is saying I am responsible for<br>the removal and replacement of a tree that died.**<br><br>First of all, what does your lease say?<br><br>If the lease does not say anything, then in general, the renter is<br>responsible to maintain all of the area he rented. If you routinely mow<br>the lawn, it's because you rented the house and the property around it.<br><br>However, while the renter may be tasked with "maintaining" the tree, the<br>renter does not "own" the tree. The landlord ultimately owns the tree,<br>as the landlord owns all of the property. If a water heater dies, it's<br>not the tenant's responsibility to replace it, because the landlord owns<br>it. Similarly, if a tree dies, it's not the tenant's responsibility to<br>replace it, because the tenant doesn't "own" the tree.<br><br>If the landlord is claiming that you killed the tree, he should replace<br>it and then sue you to get the amount of the tree back. He shouldn't be<br>relying on you to remove and replace the tree.<br><br>[[Overview of Landlord-Tenant Laws in North<br>Carolina](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=328e91&url=https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/overview-landlord-tenant-laws-north-carolina.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nolo.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>In NC, you do have the right to "repair and deduct" if the landlord will<br>not fix the problem. In your case, if the tree is large and its death<br>poses a hazard (i.e. a falling tree could damage property), you can<br>remove the dead tree and deduct the cost of that maintenance from your<br>lease payments (and you're not responsible for planing a new tree,<br>either). Be sure you understand what that may mean for your future<br>leasing of the property, though.<br><br>[[Tenant Options if Your Landlord Won\'t Make Major<br>Repairs](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=39bb55&url=https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/free-books/renters-rights-book/chapter7-5.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nolo.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>It means you may end up having your lease terminated, and a negative hit<br>on your credit. It also means you may end up in small claims court.<br><br>You could also reach out to your renter's insurance company and ask them<br>what they think you should do. It's possible that your renter's<br>insurance policy would cover this; however, this is really unlikely.<br><br>If this all seems too much to try to sort though, you might want to<br>consider retaining a local real estate attorney in your area.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.
