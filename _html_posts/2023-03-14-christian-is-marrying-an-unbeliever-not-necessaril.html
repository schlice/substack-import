<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Marrying an unbeliever is not, in and of itself, a sin. But it is<br>strongly warned against, because it could very easily lead you into sin.<br><br>The analogy given is a team of oxen.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-1bb840895de28a815f3cb0dcede74614){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-1bb840895de28a815f3cb0dcede74614" master_w="640"<br>master_h="478"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(Image courtesy* [[*Melinda Young<br>Stewart*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a27fb7&url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/melystu/5427881833){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="flickr.com"}]{.qlink_container} *- Flickr)*<br><br>Notice the yoke between them? In order for the cart to move forward,<br>the oxen need to move together, in the same direction. What do you think<br>would happen if the oxen went in two different directions? That cart<br>probably wouldn't go very far, would it. But even if they move the same<br>direction, if one ox is significantly stronger than the other, or<br>significantly larger or taller, they are considered to be "unequally<br>yoked" and cannot perform the task they are set to. They would always<br>operate in opposition to each other.<br><br>Paul uses this analogy when he makes this argument in his second letter<br>to the church in Corinth. He says:<br><br>> Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness<br>> and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with<br>> darkness? What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what<br>> does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? What agreement is<br>> there between the temple of God and idols? --- 2 Corinthians 6:14--16<br>> NIV<br><br>Paul uses this analogy in a larger message to the church, which was<br>having difficulty with certain aspects of living as a Christian. He<br>discouraged them from being in an unequal partnership with unbelievers<br>because believers and unbelievers are opposites, just as light and<br>darkness are opposites. They simply have nothing in common, just as<br>Christ has nothing in common with "Belial," a Hebrew word meaning<br>"worthlessness."<br><br>For a believer to marry an unbeliever, a similar sort of imbalance would<br>take place, as a married couple becomes "one flesh." It's uniting<br>opposites, which makes for a very difficult marriage, and Paul warns<br>against this, because it is dangerous to the spiritual health of the<br>believer. For the relationship to work, one or the other must abandon<br>his moral center and move toward that of the other. More often than not,<br>it is the believer who finds himself pressured to leave his Christian<br>principles behind for the sake of the health of the marriage.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
