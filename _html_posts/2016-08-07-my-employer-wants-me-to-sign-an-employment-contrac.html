<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes this is legal. Full time just means you get paid for at least 40<br>hours per week.<br><br>Most employment in the US is \"at will\" employment. This means that<br>either you or the employer can terminate the working relationship at any<br>time for any reason.<br><br>This is the opposite. It is considered \"contract employment\" in which<br>you cannot quit without cause for the term of the contract. They can<br>fire you, but it would have to be a good reason for them to lose the<br>money on your training. Hopefully, the contract gives the company some<br>liability if they fire you (like, for example, if you have received<br>expensive industry training, your contract may say that if you quit, you<br>have to pay back the training cost, but if you are fired and it is not<br>for cause, you do not). The point of this type of contact is that they<br>believe they are putting quite a bit of money into your training, and<br>they want to ensure that they get their money\'s worth from you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
