<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Proving medical malpractice is difficult. You basically need to prove<br><br>- The physician and/or other health care providers *neglected* to follow<br>  standard, accepted medical procedures.<br>- Because of this negligence, the physician and/or other health care<br>  providers *misdiagnosed* you.<br>- Because of the misdiagnosis, you suffered preventable physical,<br>  emotional and/or financial harm.<br><br>If you believe that the doctor did not follow standard, accepted medical<br>practices which led to the misdiagnosis, you should definitely engage<br>the services of a medical malpractice attorney where you live. They can<br>help you file a lawsuit and receive compensation for some or all of<br>these potential damages your mom may have suffered because of the<br>misdiagnosis:<br><br>- Mental anguish<br>- Physical pain and suffering<br>- Diminished capacity to enjoy life<br>- Loss of companionship and guidance for family members<br>- Current and future medical expenses<br>- Lost income<br>- Diminished earning capacity<br>- Other damages recoverable under your state's laws<br><br>Seek a consultation with a medical malpractice attorney in your area<br>sooner rather than later, or the time period within which you can bring<br>an action may expire.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>My mom was diagnosed with MS in 2011.
