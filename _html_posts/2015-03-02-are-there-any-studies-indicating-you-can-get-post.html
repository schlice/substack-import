<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'m going to take the opposite stance and say that it\'s<br>unlikely a court case would give you PTSD. The<br>[definition(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=75868b&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} of PTSD:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may develop after a<br>> person is exposed to one or more traumatic events, such as sexual<br>> assault, warfare, serious injury, or threats of imminent death. The<br>> diagnosis may be given when a group of symptoms, such as disturbing<br>> recurring flashbacks, avoidance or numbing of memories of the event,<br>> and hyperarousal, continue for more than a month after the occurrence<br>> of a traumatic event\<br><br>\<br>It goes on to say that people who experience assault-based trauma are<br>likely to develop PTSD than those who experience non-assault-based<br>trauma (the difference between being assaulted vs witnessing an<br>assault). The individual in question must have witnessed or have been a<br>victim of an extreme stressor, such as the ones listed in the<br>definition. The individual would have felt intense fear or horror, or a<br>feeling of powerlessness to control such an event.\<br>\<br>While I absolutely agree that the court cases cited by<br>[Natalie(https://www.quora.com/profile/Natalie-Smolenski)]{.qlink_container}<br>would be traumatic, they would not rise to the level of PTSD.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
