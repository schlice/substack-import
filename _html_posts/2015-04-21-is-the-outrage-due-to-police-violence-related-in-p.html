<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Certainly the technology is a good thing. It will help all<br>sides be better accountable.\<br>\<br>Just look at the introduction of dash-mounted vehicle recorders over the<br>past ten years. The number of complaints of police abuse plummeted when<br>complainants were confronted with the videos of their own police<br>contacts. The typical complaint in our department goes something like<br>this: sergeant and complainant sit down in interview room. Sergeant<br>takes complaint. Sergeant listens intently while complainant explains<br>how rude, disrespectful, racist, and abusive the officer was. Sergeant<br>offers to review the dash cam video with complainant. Dash cam video of<br>actual traffic stop shows officer being professional (if perhaps a<br>little bemused and possibly perturbed) at the rude, disrespectful,<br>racist and abusive complainant. Sergeant explains that it was actually<br>the complainant who was rude, but sergeant still offers to burn CD of<br>the incident for complainant that complainant can use as evidence in a<br>personal lawsuit if they so choose.\<br>\<br>Of course, not all traffic stops go this way. The worst ones end up on<br>TV. Which is all you manage to see these days.\<br>\<br>There are literally tens of millions of public interactions with police<br>every year. Only a handful are ever an issue. Yes, it\'s true, there are<br>some bad cops out there. There are bad people in every profession, since<br>all professions are made up of people, and all people are flawed in some<br>way. There are also bad politicians. Yet we don\'t ask them to wear body<br>cameras and film 100% of their business interactions on a daily basis.<br>We\'re not asking the mayor to wear a body camera. Or the President. And<br>he\'s accountable to everyone in the country. CEOs are only accountable<br>to their Boards of Directors and their shareholders, not the general<br>public. So while you might want more transparency into the boardroom,<br>you\'re not going to get it unless that CEO wants to give it to you. The<br>police, on the other hand, are public servants, so if the public wants<br>the police to wear body cameras, the police will wear body cameras.\<br>\<br>No one is being asked to be held to such a high standard in this<br>country. Why is this? It seems to be the cause *du jour* these days.<br>Police are public servants, like the President, but no one is asking the<br>President to wear a body camera. The military has hundreds of times the<br>firepower that the police have, plus they too are public servants, but<br>no one is asking them to wear body cameras. Something to think about.\<br>\<br>This will be great for eliminating corruption in the police department,<br>right? Because now we\'ll get to see everything the police officer sees.<br>It can\'t be anything but a good thing. Until something happens outside<br>of the field of view of the camera. Or something is too grainy to make<br>out on camera, or the action moves too fast, or the audio is distorted.<br>However, I suspect that even if you see it with your own eyes, you still<br>may not believe it. I suspect that even if Darren Wilson was wearing a<br>camera, people would still not believe that that white racist cop<br>didn\'t shoot a poor innocent unarmed black man in cold blood. What I<br>see as an issue here is that the people have used a few bad apples and<br>ruined the whole bushel. The people have lost faith that their public<br>servants are actually trustworthy. And that\'s a sad state of affairs.<br>The credibility of the police officer has been supplanted by the<br>credibility of the camera. If it\'s not on camera, it didn\'t happen,<br>they will say. What about the days when you took a man at his word?<br>Those days are long gone, as a few bad actors have ruined it for all of<br>us.\<br>\<br>I\'d like to see more incidents where police are vindicated by their<br>body cameras actually make the evening news. I\'d like to see cameras<br>that are sophisticated enough to capture everything. And I\'d like to<br>see less of an \"us vs them\" mentality among the general public when it<br>comes to police. I\'d also like to see a few more zeros at the end of my<br>balance in my bank account and a flying car sometime before I die. But<br>we can all keep dreaming, I guess.\<br>\<br>Thanks for the A2A, I hope I answered at least part of your<br>question.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
