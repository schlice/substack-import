<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a great question, and it would be best answered by a criminal<br>defense attorney in New Jersey.<br><br>Depending on the situation, the New Jersey close-in-age exemption may<br>completely exempt qualifying close-in-age couples from the age of<br>consent law, or it might only provide a legal defense that can be used<br>if you are charged with statutory rape.<br><br>The law does not draw such bright-line distinctions, it only says that<br>the couple must be \"within four years of age.\" It\'s a decidedly gray<br>area, and a prosecutor could press ahead with charges if you\'re 19 and<br>she\'s 15, even if you\'re less than four years apart by birthday. You<br>might win, you might not. I haven\'t found any case law which really<br>shows how the court generally rules in New Jersey, this is why you\'d<br>need a criminal defense attorney<br><br>In my opinion, why risk it? I know it may be difficult, but I really<br>think your best course of action is to abstain for a little while until<br>she turns 16. Then you\'re both in the clear. The line is really fuzzy,<br>and while you might be vindicated, it would still be a lot of time and<br>money if you\'re arrested and charged.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-Romeo-and-Juliet-laws-in-New-Jersey/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
