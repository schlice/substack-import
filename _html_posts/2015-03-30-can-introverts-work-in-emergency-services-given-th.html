<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I would say first that \"emergency services\" covers a<br>broad range of career fields. That said, I would also postulate that<br>introverts *might* have a harder time in law enforcement than in<br>emergency medical services. I think the other contributors here have<br>commented sufficiently on EMS, and I agree with their assessments.\<br>\<br>In law enforcement, you do have to be outgoing. You have to be able to<br>engage with the public, in whatever state they are in, and regardless of<br>how you feel about actually engaging with them. You also have to be able<br>to make life-and-death decisions in very short time spans, but that\'s<br>not a function of introversion.\<br>\<br>Introverts might do well in law enforcement because they would be very<br>calm and methodical when dealing with many varied types of situations,<br>and less likely to \"fly off the handle.\" I\'m not sure they\'d prefer<br>to deal with those situations, but they might do well in<br>them.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
