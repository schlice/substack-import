<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You need to be more specific.<br><br>Equality is good. We want equality. Everyone gets the same<br>opportunity to succeed. To clarify, we call this *equality of<br>opportunity.*<br><br>Equity is bad. We'd like equity, but equity is not required. While<br>everyone has the opportunity to succeed, not everyone will. We call this<br>*equality of outcome*.<br><br>That said, conservatives are all about the government using tax dollars<br>to ensure *equality of opportunity.* They are completely against the<br>government using tax dollars to ensure *equality of outcome.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
