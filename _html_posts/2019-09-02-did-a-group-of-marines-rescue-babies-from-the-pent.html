<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Did a group of marines rescue babies from Pentogon on 9/11?<br><br>I dunno. I wasn't there. I was at home on 9/11, watching aircraft hit<br>the towers on live TV.<br><br>But I do know how to use Google. And as it turns out, Snopes (the always<br>reliable, always fair, never politically leaning fact-checkers that they<br>are) actually had an accurate accounting of what might have been<br>misinterpreted as "marines rescuing babies:"<br><br>> The tale about 40 Marines charging to the rescue (which began its<br>> online life in September 2008), possibly resulted from a mishearing,<br>> misunderstanding, or just plain exaggeration of the actions taken that<br>> day by Army colonel [[Dave<br>> Komar](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8cd997&url=https://youtu.be/XnziZTb47YA){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="youtu.be"}]{.qlink_container} and his staff and rangers<br>> from the National Park Service to assist and protect those who had<br>> evacuated children from the Pentagon's daycare facility. Seven park<br>> rangers were dispatched to assist the group of evacuees, reaching it<br>> at approximately noon. Once there, the park rangers set up a<br>> protective perimeter around the children and blocked one lane of<br>> westbound traffic on the George Washington Memorial Parkway to<br>> increase safety. They then persuaded the driver of an empty tour bus<br>> to help transport the kids to a Virginia Department of Transportation<br>> (DoT) facility where they could better watch over and care for the<br>> tots until parents came to claim their<br>> children.\[1\](#FlmBR){#cite-FlmBR .citation_link}<br><br>Don't believe everything you read on the Internet.
