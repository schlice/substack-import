<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Like the other officers said, very much depends on the<br>orientation when the grab happens, but in all cases is considered life<br>threatening.\<br>\<br>When I stand facing someone, I usually have my hands folded in front of<br>me. What you usually don\'t see is my right forearm resting on the grip<br>of my duty weapon to detect a potential grab. Were someone to try to<br>grab my weapon at that point, they\'d end up with a mouthful of elbow<br>and an arrest.\<br>\<br>If I were in my car, as Officer Wilson was, I can\'t say I\'d act much<br>differently than he did. I am about Officer Wilson\'s size, so I would<br>consider such an assault a life-threatening one and world likely respond<br>using lethal force.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
