<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I can't speak for California directly, but I can speak for HOAs<br>generally.<br><br>As most normal HOA laws go, an association can require you to do nearly<br>anything they choose, so long as it's reasonable and it is applied<br>fairly to all residents.<br><br>So can they require you to recycle? Sure they can. What does that mean<br>for the Association? It means they have to search your trash for<br>recyclables and fine you when you fail to do so.<br><br>They would likely be doing this if they got a discount from the trash<br>company by limiting the recyclables in residents' trash, and the trash<br>company would be deducting from that discount if they found recyclables<br>in there. In turn, the HOA would fine the resident throwing away<br>recyclables (assuming they could identify the perpetrator).<br><br>Remember, your covenants are essentially a "contract" you signed with<br>the HOA at the time you bought your house or condo in the association.<br>The covenants requires you to comply with the Rules and Regulations as<br>written and/or amended following the standard business practices listed<br>in the Policies and Procedures. If the Rules are amended properly, the<br>association can hold you to them, so long as they do it fairly.<br><br>We try to be reasonable and we try to take the opinions of the majority<br>of homeowners into consideration when we make Rule changes, but we do<br>sometimes make decisions as a Board.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
