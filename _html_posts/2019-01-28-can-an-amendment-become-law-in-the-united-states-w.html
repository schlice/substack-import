They become amendments to the<br>Constitution, and the President is not involved in that process.<br><br>Bills can become law without the President signing them. If the bill is<br>presented to the President and he does not sign it, the bill<br>automatically becomes law after 10 days, assuming Congress is in<br>session.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
