<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Well, if it were a Bible verse, it would be true.<br><br>But it's not.<br><br>There is a verse that is often cited out of context (as most Bible<br>verses are), and that verse is 1 Corinthians 10:13. It begins:<br><br>> God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your<br>> ability (ESV)<br><br>This is where people get that pithy catch-phrase, "God won't give you<br>anything you can't handle." First of all, we're not talking about God<br>not giving you anything you can't handle, we're talking about God<br>not allowing you to be tempted beyond your ability, and that's what<br>that piece of verse mentions. But as usual, people miss the context, and<br>as I've said a million times on Quora: **text, without context, is just<br>pretext.**<br><br>The context in this case is the rest of the verse:<br><br>> God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your<br>> ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of<br>> escape, that you may be able to endure it. (ESV)<br><br>So note the reason that you will not be tempted beyond your ability:<br>because God will provide you the ability to *endure* what you are<br>going through.<br><br>So if you need to *endure* what you are going through, will it be<br>more than you can handle on your own?<br><br>*YES!!! Yes it will be more than you can handle!*<br><br>But that's the point! God will indeed give you more than you can handle,<br>because you're not supposed to handle it alone. The point is<br>*whatever God gives you, regardless of your personal ability to handle<br>it,* *you will be able to handle it* *because HE WILL PROVIDE YOU<br>THE ABILITY TO HANDLE IT.*<br><br>So if you're thinking your temptations are simply too powerful, if<br>you're thinking that the "need for sex" is just too great and you have<br>to satisfy it with sinful things, if you're thinking that you just can't<br>handle it alone, **you're right. You can't handle it alone. WITH GOD,<br>YOU CAN.**<br><br>> Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with<br>> God all things are possible." --- Matthew 19:26 NIV<br>><br>> Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a<br>> thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me. Three times I<br>> pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. But he said to me, "My<br>> grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in<br>> weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my<br>> weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why, for<br>> Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in<br>> persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.<br>> --- 2 Corinthians 12:7-10 NIV<br><br>TL;DR: God will indeed give you more than you can handle, but He<br>also gives you the ability to handle anything you have been given.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
