<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Maybe you're willing to roll the dice with some unapproved treatment,<br>but not me. This is my health we're talking about.<br><br>Besides, the largest majority of patients have some form of insurance<br>which assists with drug costs. Manufacturers are more concerned with<br>keeping you on their drug and getting money from insurance than making<br>you pay out of pocket, so they all have payment assistance programs<br>which will cost you little to nothing out of pocket, so long as you stay<br>on the drug and you have insurance of some form (even Medicare<br>qualifies).<br><br>There are also nonprofit assistance funds available to help with<br>financial costs, plus if you are on Medicare, there is gap insurance<br>available, and all of these options are cheaper than paying retail for<br>an approved MS drug.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional medical advice. This answer is for GENERAL<br>INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. If you think you are experiencing a medical<br>emergency, call your local emergency number (in the United States, 911)<br>immediately.
