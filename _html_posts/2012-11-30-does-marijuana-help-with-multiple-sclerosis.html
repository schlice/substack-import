<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [To date, there is very limited research showing a benefit<br>for MS patients. There have been some studies done overseas regarding<br>marijuana\'s effects on pain in MS patients.\<br>\<br>Marijuana\'s active ingredient (THC) attaches to cannabinoid receptors<br>on nerve cells, which has a positive effect on neurological pain. It is<br>said to reduce pain better than analgesics or other man-made pain meds.\<br>\<br>Regardless, there is no conclusive research which shows the long-term<br>impacts of marijuana use, nor is the any safety of efficacy data on its<br>use. While some states allow medical marijuana use, the drug is still<br>illegal under US Federal law.]<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
