<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can I contest a \"special event restriction\" parking ticket on the<br>grounds that the parking app (ParkChicago) accepted the payment, and the<br>city of Chicago cannot both accept a parking fee and also fine for<br>parking?**<br><br>You can, and you might even be successful.<br><br>However, I'm certain that there is "fine print" in there somewhere<br>(probably in the app) which says that you're still required to follow<br>all local ordinances and posted signs at the actual location and<br>ParkChicago is not responsible to inform you every time a space is<br>unavailable due to local government action.<br><br>For example, if you paid for a spot on a street that the police have<br>closed, can you barge into the closed street and park there simply<br>because the app accepted your payment? The answer to that clear<br>hypothetical is, of course, no.<br><br>Similarly, if the coordination between the local government and the app<br>administrator is not up to snuff, there is probably a clause in the app<br>which states that it's your responsibility to ensure that the street is<br>accessible and the spot is not restricted.<br><br>Now, if you arrived at the spot and it was not marked with a "special<br>event - no parking" sign, then you may have a legitimate grievance. The<br>app accepted your payment, and there was no marking that indicated that<br>the space was closed. But I bet there was signage somewhere that<br>indicated that there was no parking on that street or in that spot<br>because of a special event.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
