<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Police officers retain their police powers whether they are on duty or<br>off duty. The clothing they wear is not relevant.<br><br>Many jurisdictions allow firearms to be openly carried by anyone.<br>Forcing police to not openly carry does not meet the current legal<br>standard, plus there is no reason for such a standard.<br><br>Perhaps you could articulate a reason that such a law would be needed,<br>and perhaps then we can come up with a better solution.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
