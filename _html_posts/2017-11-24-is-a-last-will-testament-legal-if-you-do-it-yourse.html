And most of the answers will depend<br>on where you lived and where you died.<br><br>The rub with wills is proving your will was written by you, before you<br>died.<br><br>If you don't have it notarized or witnessed, your successors will have a<br>harder time proving in court that you wrote it, or that it was actually<br>written before you died, meaning that your will will be much more easily<br>*contested.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
