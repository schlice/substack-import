<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Republicans are saying there is zero evidence that Trump incited the<br>Capitol Hill insurrection and Democrats say that there is overwhelming<br>evidence he did. Who is right or is the truth in the middle?**<br><br>It depends on the standard you follow.<br><br>If you're looking at this from a *judicial* standpoint, Trump is<br>100% legally protected in his speech. Any lawyer trying to charge Trump<br>with inciting a riot would be laughed out of court because his speech<br>was *nowhere near* legally sufficient to warrant criminal charges.<br><br>If you're looking at this from a *political* standpoint, while it<br>doesn't merit impeachment (the Democrats have, indeed, lowered the<br>impeachment bar unconstitutionally low), Trump should have quit while he<br>was ahead. He didn't really need to rile up a crowd of self-proclaimed<br>patriots and Trump supporters into following him along in his tortured<br>logic regarding theft of the election.<br><br>Not to rehash this all, but a quick summation of how we got here: Yes,<br>there was vote tampering. No, there was not *enough* vote tampering to<br>have affected the outcome of any one state election, and even if there<br>was, there wasn't enough vote tampering to affect the entire outcome of<br>the election, and absolutely none of those facts make for a valid, or<br>even a good, reason to storm the Capitol building and attempt to disrupt<br>a Constitutional process. He lost (even if by the narrowest of margins),<br>and he should have admitted that fact. He should have admitted to<br>himself that the bulk of Trump supporters liked his policies (by and<br>large), but they didn't like Trump *the man*. He made a very poor choice<br>in giving *that particular speech* to *that particular crowd* at *that<br>particular time*. Was it impeachable? Of course not. Was it a **really<br>bad idea**? Yes, indeed it was. He should have known that doing so might<br>result in some potentially bad outcomes.<br><br>So if you're thinking legally, his speech was 100% First Amendment<br>protected. If you're thinking politically, as always, there are<br>three sides to the story: the Republican side, the Democrat side, and<br>the truth, which usually lies somewhere in the middle. So probably, some<br>people are allowing the legal side to bleed into their opinion about the<br>political side, and the waters are just muddy again.<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance<br>for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough<br>shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion<br>masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your<br>own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.<br>If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"<br>don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything<br>vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a<br>block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
