<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What powers would Trump gain by declaring a state of emergency?<br><br>Congress has delegated at least 136 distinct statutory emergency powers<br>to the President during a time of declared war or when he declares a<br>national emergency.<br><br>> Emergency presidential powers are dramatic, and range from suspending<br>> all laws regulating chemical and biological weapons, including the ban<br>> on human testing (50 U.S.C. § 1515, passed 1969); to suspending any<br>> Clean Air Act implementation plan or excess emissions penalty upon<br>> petition of a state governor (42 U.S.C. (f) § 7410 (f), passed 1977);<br>> to authorizing and constructing military construction projects (10<br>> U.S.C. (a) § 2808 (a), passed 1982) using any existing defense<br>> appropriations for such military constructions (\$10.4 billion in<br>> FY2018); to drafting any retired Coast Guard officers (14 U.S.C. §<br>> 331, passed 1963) or enlisted members (14 U.S.C. § 359, passed 1949)<br>> into active duty.\[1\](#HSTBP){#cite-HSTBP .citation_link}<br><br>Note all of the references to Federal laws in here. It's important to<br>remember that Trump only gains the powers *which were authorized by<br>Congress.* Clearly, however, he only gains the powers in the laws which<br>are specifically related to the national emergency. He is required to<br>declare which laws he is implementing and for what reason.<br><br>In this case, Trump is invoking the powers in 10 USC §2808(a)<br>authorizing military construction projects.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-HSTBP){.citation_index} [[National Emergencies Act -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eaf2df&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Emergencies_Act){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
