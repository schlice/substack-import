<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Jerry Nadler now says it\'s \"likely\" that the House will subpoena<br>John Bolton. Given that Donald Trump\'s Senate impeachment trial is not<br>going to end with Trump\'s removal from office, why?**<br><br>Because they didn't get him, and they can't let it go. Also because<br>they're hoping that Bolton will live up to his promise and ignore<br>Trump's order of executive privilege and testify anyway.<br><br>They tried to get him with Russia, they tried to get him with Mueller,<br>and they tried to get him with Ukraine, and none of it worked. They've<br>been trying to get him since election day, and they failed.<br><br>Every time they take a swing at Trump, they miss and hit the American<br>people instead.<br><br>There's only so many times you take a punch before you swing back. House<br>Democrats would do well to recognize this.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
