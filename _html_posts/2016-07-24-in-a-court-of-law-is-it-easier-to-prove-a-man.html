<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ah, a common misconception about the law. In a court of law, ***you<br>never prove innocence.*** You only prove whether someone is "guilty" or<br>"not guilty." It's not the difference between "guilty" and "innocent."<br>It's "guilty" or "not guilty." That's a very very important distinction<br>to make, because "not guilty" does not necessarily equal "innocent."<br>"Not guilty" simply means that the required elements to prove that the<br>particular crime has been committed have not been proven beyond a<br>reasonable doubt. It *does not* mean that the defendant is<br>"innocent" or even that he's a "good person." It simply means that the<br>evidence presented is not enough to convict the defendant of that crime:<br>not guilty of that crime. Doesn't mean he didn't do it. It just means<br>there isn't enough evidence to overcome the reasonable doubt that he did<br>it.<br><br>A prosecutor must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that someone is<br>guilty. A defense attorney must show reasonable doubt. The<br>prosecutor has to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and he has to do<br>it with solid facts, evidence gathered by the police, etc. The defense<br>attorney doesn't have to do any of these things. He simply has to show<br>that the evidence, as presented, leaves holes, questions unanswered,<br>etc.<br><br>As a jury, you have to find that the evidence outweighs the reasonable<br>doubt. It's the "scales of justice" metaphor: the prosecutor piles his<br>evidence on one side of the scale, and the defense piles its reasonable<br>doubt onto the other. If the jury believes that the scale tips in favor<br>of the evidence, the jury returns a guilty verdict. If they believe the<br>scales tip in favor of reasonable doubt, the jury returns not guilty.<br><br>This is oftentimes why you see a defendant ruled "not guilty" in a<br>criminal trial, and then be found to be "liable" in a civil trial. While<br>a criminal trial requires evidence "beyond a reasonable doubt," the<br>evidentiary requirement in a civil trial is much lower. You only have to<br>show by a "preponderance of the evidence" that the person is liable. You<br>may not be able to prove the crime of murder, but you can prove wrongful<br>death. This is what happened to OJ Simpson. The criminal circus, er,<br>court could not find him guilty of murder, but the civil court found him<br>liable for wrongful death, and awarded monetary damages to the families.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
