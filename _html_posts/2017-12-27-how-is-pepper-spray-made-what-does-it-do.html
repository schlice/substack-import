<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Most commercial pepper sprays have as their active ingredient *oleoresin<br>capsicum* (OC), which is the oil from hot peppers. That's why it is<br>called "pepper spray." The oil is suspended in an inert fluid along with<br>a propellant in the can. It sprays out in a stream and can usually reach<br>10 to 15 feet from the sprayer.<br><br>For most people, it's very painful, and the effects are relatively long<br>lasting, as the oil is difficult to remove from skin without solvents.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
