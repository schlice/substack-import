<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How do I get into West Point as an international student (Canadian)?<br><br>Here's the answer from West Point's website, with emphasis added by<br>me:<br><br>> To apply for admission to West Point, contact the [[U.S. Defense<br>> Attach√©<br>> Office](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=73304e&url=http://www.usembassy.gov/){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="usembassy.gov"}]{.qlink_container} at the American Embassy<br>> in your country. This office serves as the link between the student,<br>> the host nation and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.<br>><br>> **Applying to West Point takes more time than applying to other<br>> colleges. Don't wait until deadlines are looming and it's too late to<br>> meet them.** You will continuously update it over the course of the<br>> following year. Print the [[Application<br>> Timeline](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f4e387&url=https://www.westpoint.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/ADMISSIONS/Admissions%2520Timeline.pdf){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="westpoint.edu"}]{.qlink_container} and use it as a guide<br>> through the process .<br>><br>> **The application process for international students is essentially<br>> the same as that for U.S. citizens**, with a few key differences.<br>> General requirements include:<br>><br>> - Be sponsored by a national-level government official.<br>> - Be between the ages of 17 and 22.<br>> - Not be married or pregnant, or have any legal obligation to support<br>>   children.<br>><br>> Up to 60 international cadets may study at West Point at any given<br>> time. Eligible countries are selected on an annual basis by the U.S.<br>> State Department and the U.S. Department of Defense. The American<br>> embassies notify invited nations to nominate up to six candidates per<br>> country to compete for admission to West<br>> Point.\[1\](#nhCjG){#cite-nhCjG .citation_link}<br><br>If you're competitive now, then you have a shot. Granted, it's a really,<br>really slim shot, but it's a shot nonetheless. Think of it this way: if<br>you can easily be accepted into RMC, you have a chance to be accepted at<br>West Point.<br><br>Also, note that it takes longer to be accepted as an international<br>student than it does as a US citizen, so the Application Timeline is<br>extended. Use it as a guideline, but don't hold yourself to those dates<br>as a minimum. Have everything ready well before those dates.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-nhCjG){.citation_index}<br>[https://www.westpoint.edu/admiss\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d8004d&url=https://www.westpoint.edu/admissions/prospective-cadets/international-cadets){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="westpoint.edu"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
