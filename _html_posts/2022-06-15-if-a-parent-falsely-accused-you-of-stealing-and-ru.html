<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Lawsuits generally cause friendly communications to cease.<br><br>That's right, I would sue them for slander. Slander is a false statement<br>which defames another person. I would have to prove the harm to the<br>court, but if it ruined my reputation, I would easily be able to prove<br>it.<br><br>Slander is one form of defamation. As the defamed party, I could<br>seek damages for any lost earnings, future lost earning capacity, and<br>other lost business or economic opportunities that I suffered or that I<br>would be likely to suffer as a result of the defamatory statement.<br><br>TL;DR: False statements against me are grounds to lose a friend. False<br>statements which ruin reputations are grounds for a lawsuit.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If a parent falsely accused you of stealing and ruined your reputation,<br>would you cease all communication with them?<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice.
