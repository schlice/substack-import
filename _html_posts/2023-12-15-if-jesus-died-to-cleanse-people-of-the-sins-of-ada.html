<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What makes you think that Eve's sins weren't forgiven?<br><br>Genesis 3:21 explains that God made clothes out of animal skins for Adam<br>and Eve to wear. Most scholars believe that this was the first animal<br>sacrifice, and a foreshadowing to the blood sacrifice of Jesus to<br>forgive the sins of the world. In other words, *God covered Adam and<br>Eve's sins with blood.* In other other words, this means that God<br>included them in the salvation provided by Jesus.<br><br>Therefore, it's a good bet that both Adam and Eve were saved and did go<br>to heaven when they died.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
