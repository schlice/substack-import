<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it legal for a job application to ask about disabilities? I\'m<br>applying for a bartender position at Sheraton (U.S.) and it lists 18<br>different physical/mental disability examples.**<br><br>This may be an example of Federal reporting on people with disabilities.<br>It's a little different than the employer specifically asking you about<br>any disability you may have. Most job applications contain some Federal<br>reporting, and they often contain a list of examples of potential<br>disabilities. At the end of the list, they give you the option to say<br>"Yes, I have a qualifying disability," "No, I do not have a qualifying<br>disability," or "Decline to Answer."<br><br>This is only for Federal reporting of people with disabilities. **At any<br>time, you can Decline to Answer and it will not affect your ability to<br>apply for the position.** These questions are for Federal reporting on<br>the hiring of persons with disabilities, and is not illegal to ask such<br>a general question. In no way does it have any applicability to whether<br>or not you receive a job offer. It would be a violation of the Americans<br>with Disabilities Act for this information to influence your ability to<br>receive a job offer. You can always decline to answer if you are<br>concerned about this.<br><br>It's similar to the questions regarding your ethnicity. The employer<br>cannot deny your application because of your race, but the Federal<br>government reports on the number of minorities who apply for, and who<br>are accepted for, jobs. Again, you can select "Decline to Answer" and it<br>will in no way affect your ability to apply for, or be selected for, the<br>position.<br><br>When it comes to disabilities, the employer can tell you the basic<br>physical and mental requirements of the job, and then they can ask you<br>one basic question about disability in relation to the job for which you<br>are interviewing:<br><br>> Can you perform the essential functions of the job, with or without<br>> reasonable accommodation?<br><br>That's it. If you answer no, they can probably look elsewhere. But if<br>you answer yes, they cannot otherwise deny you the position because of<br>disability.<br><br>An employer can require a post-offer medical exam, but it cannot<br>withdraw the job offer simply because you are found to have a<br>disability. They can withdraw the job offer only if they can show<br>that you are unable to perform the essential functions of the job (with<br>or without reasonable accommodation), or that you pose a significant<br>risk of causing substantial harm to yourself or others.<br><br>For example, let's say Sheraton requires a post-offer exam and you are<br>found to have epilepsy. Sheraton is worried that being around knives and<br>glassware that you could injure yourself or others. You show that your<br>epilepsy is well controlled on medication, and you can show work history<br>which proves that you can accomplish the essential functions of the job.<br>Sheraton cannot withdraw the offer because of your disability or they<br>would be in violation of the ADA.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
