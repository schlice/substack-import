<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's stop and think about the idea of a sex strike.<br><br>So what you're saying is, you want to voluntarily stop doing the thing<br>that we want you to stop doing, thereby reducing abortion rates by<br>reducing the incidence of unwanted children? I mean, if you're married,<br>this doesn't really apply to you, but it does apply if you're single.<br>You're going to *voluntarily stop having sex outside of marriage*, is<br>that what you're saying?<br><br>I say: *I'm 100% for it.*<br><br>Here's a novel approach you might think of employing: ***don't have sex<br>with randos.*** Perhaps you should try something wacky, like *saving sex<br>for the person who you are going to marry. And then have children with<br>that person, children you actually want to keep.*<br><br>We can call it something like, oh I dunno, traditional values. What<br>a radical, novel concept. I know, shocking, right? Sorry, didn't mean to<br>throw all of these new ideas on you all at once, but I'm sure you can<br>handle it.<br><br>TL;DR: "Watch out, or I'm going to start following traditional values!"<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
