<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>In order to enlist in the US Armed Forces, you have to be a citizen or a<br>permanent resident of the United States (which does not necessarily<br>require citizenship). From our friends over at<br>[about.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f5ff60&url=http://usmilitary.about.com/od/joiningthemilitary/a/noncitizenjoin.htm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="about.com"}]{.qlink_container}:<br><br>> You must be categorized as a \"legal permanent immigrant,\" with<br>> permission to work in the U.S. That means the individual must have an<br>> I--551 (Permanent Residence Card). I--551 cards issued after 1989 are<br>> only valid for 10 years and must be renewed. Applicants with expired<br>> cards keep their permanent residence status; however, they must apply<br>> for renewal of their permanent residence status I--551 card and must<br>> obtain verification in the form of an original receipt from the U.S.<br>> Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) indicating that the<br>> applicant has paid for an I--90 (Application to Replace Permanent<br>> Resident) renewal application prior to enlistment.<br><br>In order to become a commissioned officer in the US Armed Forces, you<br>must be a citizen of the United States. Therefore, your only option as a<br>non-US citizen is enlistment.<br><br>As an interesting side note, service in the US Armed Forces in this way<br>gets you expedited naturalization if you actually want to become a US<br>citizen.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
