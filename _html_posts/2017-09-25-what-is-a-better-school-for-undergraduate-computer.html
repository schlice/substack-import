<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Stanford traditionally ranks higher than USAFA as an engineering school.<br><br>But if you're comparing the two schools and trying to figure out which<br>would be a better choice *if you want to be a computer engineer,*<br>then the correct answer is not a military academy.<br><br>*You go to a military academy to become a military officer.* You are<br>an officer first, and a career second.<br><br>That doesn't mean that USAFA is a bad engineering school. Far from it.<br><br>> The Air Force Academy ranks high among the nation\'s top universities<br>> in engineering and liberal arts courses, according to the 2015 Best<br>> Colleges Ranking report released Tuesday by U.S. News & World Report.<br>><br>> Specifically, the Academy has the nation\'s fifth-best undergraduate<br>> engineering program, and its second-best aerospace, aeronautical and<br>> astronautical program, a position it maintains for the 14th<br>> consecutive year. The Academy has the nation\'s second-best computer<br>> engineering program, its third-best electrical engineering program and<br>> its sixth-best in mechanical engineering<br>> program.\[1\](#sABqx){#cite-sABqx .citation_link}<br><br>But I return to my original point. If you want to be a computer<br>engineer, go to any college except for a military academy. If you want<br>to be a military officer, go to a military academy.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-sABqx){.citation_index} [[Air Force Academy ranks high in<br>Best Colleges Ranking<br>report](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e37a33&url=http://www.usafa.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/619300/air-force-academy-ranks-high-in-best-colleges-ranking-report/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="af.mil"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
