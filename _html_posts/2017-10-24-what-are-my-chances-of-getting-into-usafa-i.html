<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Based on just what you've given us, your entrance package is pretty<br>competitive already. Remember that the Academy is looking for that<br>"well-rounded" person, who not only excels as a student-athlete, but is<br>also involved in the community and who has shown leadership potential<br>and the ability to make it at the Academy. Remember, sustained<br>participation in select activities over the course of your high school<br>career is preferred. Demonstrated leadership in athletic and<br>non-athletic extracurricular activities will be crucial, but don't worry<br>if you don't excel in all areas.<br><br>Just remember you're trying to put the strongest package you can<br>together for admission. And if you haven't taken [[Scott<br>Parman](https://www.quora.com/profile/Scott-Parman)]{.qlink_container}'s<br>advice yet, it's time to get on to the [[Academy<br>Admissions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d1e87d&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} website and look<br>it over. Also, f[[ind your Admissions Liaison<br>Officer](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3baf43&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/outreach-programs/find-your-admissions-liaison-officer/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} and start working<br>directly with him/her. That person will assist you through every step of<br>the admissions process.<br><br>I will tell you though, based on what you have here, you are already a<br>pretty strong candidate. You're on the right track! Work with your ALO<br>to "fine-tune" your path, which will only make you an even stronger<br>candidate.<br><br>Thanks for asking, and good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
