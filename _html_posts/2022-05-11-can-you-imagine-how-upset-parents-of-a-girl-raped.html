<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Can you imagine how upset parents of a girl raped and forced to have a<br>> baby would be?<br><br>Can you imagine how unfair it is to kill the victim of a crime instead<br>of the perpetrator?<br><br>Since we're talking about the less than 1% of abortion cases, let's do<br>that.<br><br>For the states which make no exceptions for rape or incest (of which<br>there are only a handful), *why do you think it's okay to kill a baby<br>who is just as much an innocent victim of the crime as the girl?*<br><br>To be fair, I think state laws should have exceptions for rape and<br>incest, but I'm not the state. I'm not going to defend what a state<br>legislature decides, I'll leave that to them to defend. But I just<br>wanted to remind you that the baby is as much an innocent victim as the<br>girl is. The baby's life is no less valuable because it was the product<br>of a rape. Rape doesn't change the girl's value as a person, does it? Is<br>her life worth less because she was raped? Of course not. *So why is the<br>baby's?*<br><br>Just something to think about when you demand to kill the baby because<br>the father didn't get permission to have sex.<br><br>> Is it fair to be in a position of spending thousands to get an out of<br>> state abortion?<br><br>No, it is not. This is what civil court is for. Civil lawsuits are<br>designed to make you whole again, and they do that through *financial<br>compensation*.<br><br>So in this case, you spend thousands to go out of state to get an<br>abortion, and when you come back, you sue the rapist for pain and<br>suffering, as well as to reimburse you the costs of the abortion trip,<br>if you decide to abort the baby (see the first point above).<br><br>I added that last part because, at last survey, almost 50% of women who<br>were raped and became pregnant *decided to keep their babies*. So it's<br>not universal that *every* rape victim wants to abort their babies.<br><br>You must be on guard for the logical fallacy of going to the extreme to<br>avoid the middle. Yes, a situation like this would be tragic. **But what<br>drives policy? The extreme corner case, or the vast majority of cases?**<br>We don't discount the extreme cases, but they don't drive policy,<br>either.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can you imagine how upset parents of a girl raped and forced to have a<br>baby would be? Is it fair to be in a position of spending thousands to<br>get an out of state abortion?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
