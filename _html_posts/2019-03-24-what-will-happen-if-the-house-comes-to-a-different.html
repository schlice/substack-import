<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What will happen if the House comes to a different opinion on the<br>Mueller reports, evidence?**<br><br>Once the (majority of the) report is released, the House is free to do<br>whatever it feels is necessary, including re-investigating everything<br>that was already investigated.<br><br>It would be unwise for them to do so.<br><br>As reported by the Attorney General, the Special Counsel's office<br>"...employed 19 lawyers who were assisted by a team of approximately 40<br>FBI agents, intelligence analysts, forensic accountants, and other<br>professional staff. The Special Counsel issued more than 2,800<br>subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants, obtained more than 230<br>orders for communication records, issued almost 50 orders authorizing<br>use of pen registers, made 13 requests to foreign governments for<br>evidence, and interviewed approximately 500<br>witnesses."\[1\](#JEnKT){#cite-JEnKT .citation_link} And after all of<br>that evidence, the Special Counsel found that there was no Russian<br>collusion.<br><br>The Special Counsel did not render a decision on the question of<br>obstruction of justice, and instead forwarded all of the information<br>they gathered to the Attorney General. After his careful review, AG<br>William Barr determined that there was not enough evidence that proved<br>beyond a reasonable doubt that the President had obstructed justice, and<br>so has decided not to impanel a grand jury. He made this decision<br>without consideration as to the Constitutional question of whether or<br>not you can even indict a sitting president.<br><br>If the House proceeds with investigating again what was already<br>investigated, those (including the President) who called the Special<br>Counsel's investigation a "witch hunt" and "sour grapes" for his 2016<br>election victory will certainly conclude nothing better about this, and<br>they would be justified in doing so.<br><br>Nevertheless, the House is certainly free to do this (and Rep. Schiff<br>has repeatedly asserted that he will be doing so, this information<br>notwithstanding).<br><br>*If they do*, and *if they come to a different conclusion*, they are<br>free to file Articles of Impeachment for a vote of the full House. If<br>the Articles of Impeachment pass the House, the Senate will hold a trial<br>to determine whether or not the President should be removed from office.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-JEnKT){.citation_index} [[Read the Mueller report<br>findings: Barr's letter to<br>Congress](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=234947&url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/read-the-mueller-report-findings-barrs-letter-to-congress){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="foxnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
