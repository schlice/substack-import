<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why isn't the Cosmological Argument enough proof that God exists?<br><br>The Cosmological Argument is very simple:<br><br>1.  Everything that has a beginning has a cause.<br>2.  The universe has a beginning.<br>3.  Therefore, the universe has a cause.<br><br>That's it.<br><br>Premise 1 is the Law of Causality, one of the foundational laws of<br>science. Even the outspoken atheist David Hume said, "I never asserted<br>so absurd a proposition as that something should arise without a cause."<br>So Premise 1 is true.<br><br>Is Premise 2 true? We know from a tremendous amount of scientific<br>research that the whole, entire universe (that means all of time, space,<br>and matter) began at a single point. We have colloquially called this<br>the "Big Bang." There is a lot of scientific data which supports the<br>veracity of the Big Bang: the second law of thermodynamics, the<br>expanding (and accelerating) universe, the radiation echo from the Big<br>Bang, galaxy seeds, and the most convincing of all, Einstein's Theory of<br>General Relativity. All of this data (and more) point unequivocally to<br>the understanding that the universe had a beginning.<br><br>Still, some deny that the Big Bang was actually the beginning of time,<br>space, and matter. Maybe matter began then, but time and space existed<br>before, they say without any evidence of this. And maybe they're right.<br>But when you have two maybe's, it's generally best to go with the<br>"maybe" that has the most proof. And right now, Einstein's Theory of<br>General Relativity (which has now been proven accurate to five decimal<br>places) states that *everything* began at a single point. Nothing<br>existed before that point. You didn't have matter in any sort of state<br>before that point because it would have had to exist *someplace* and<br>there was no space for the matter to exist in. The matter would have had<br>to exist in a time before the Big Bang, but there was no time before the<br>Big Bang, so that theory is out.<br><br>Einstein was an atheist, and he was greatly troubled by his own<br>findings, which were showing him that the universe was finite. In fact,<br>he was so troubled by this, that he introduced a *cosmological constant*<br>(think of it as a "fudge factor") into the theory, to show that the<br>universe was actually static and infinite.<br><br>However, his fudge factor didn't last long. In 1919, British cosmologist<br>Arthur Eddington conducted an experiment during a solar eclipse which<br>confirmed that the universe wasn't static, but indeed had a beginning.<br>Eddington, also an atheist, said of the discovery, "Philosophically, the<br>notion of the beginning of the present order of nature is repugnant to<br>me...I should like to find a genuine loophole." And by 1922, Russian<br>mathematician Alexander Friedmann had officially exposed Einstein's<br>fudge factor as a mathematical error. Einstein, in his haste to disprove<br>his own theory, *had actually divided by zero*.<br><br>Einstein was *so shook* by his own discovery that he became a theist! In<br>1929, he traveled to California to visit the Mount Wilson Observatory,<br>where he saw with his own eyes the red shift in the movement of<br>celestial objects indicative of them all moving away from a central<br>point. It was then that he knew: the universe must have a beginning, and<br>thus a Beginner. He subsequently described the cosmological constant as<br>"the greatest blunder of my life." He said that he wanted "to know how<br>God created the world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon,<br>in the spectrum of this or that element. I want to know His thought, the<br>rest are details."<br><br>So we know that everything that had a beginning had a cause, and that<br>the universe had a beginning. So therefore, the universe must have a<br>cause. So Conclusion 1 (numbered 3 above) must also be true.<br><br>But this leaves us with yet another question: what (or Who) caused the<br>universe? Does it have to be God? Does this even prove that a god<br>exists? Well, let's go back to the Law of Causality for assistance. The<br>Law of Causality also states that an effect must resemble its cause. So<br>can we tell anything about the creator of the universe (the cause) from<br>the universe (the effect)? Actually, we can tell quite a lot. We know<br>that whoever created the universe must be someone who exists outside of<br>it (because He created the universe and is therefore not bound by it).<br>It also must be someone who is timeless (as He exists outside of time<br>and is also not bound by it). So we are looking for an infinite being<br>who exists outside of the universe.<br><br>What else can we tell about Him from His creation?<br><br>- He must be supernatural in nature (as He created time and space).<br>- He must be powerful (incredibly).<br>- He must be necessary (the maker must be self-explanatory).<br>- He must be omnipresent (He created space and is not limited by it).<br>- He must be immaterial because He transcends space/physical.<br>- He must be personal (the impersonal cannot create personality).<br>- He must be infinite and singular as you cannot have two infinites.<br>- He must be diverse yet have unity as unity and diversity exist<br>  simultaneously in nature.<br>- He must be intelligent (supremely). Only cognitive being can produce<br>  cognitive being.<br>- He must be purposeful as He deliberately created everything.<br>- He must be moral (no moral law can be had without a giver).<br>- He must be caring (or no moral laws would have been given).<br><br>That said, does any religion of the world describe such a Creator? The<br>answer is yes, the Abrahamic God of the Bible does in fact fit these<br>criteria completely.<br><br>\<br><br>The only other point I want to make about the atheistic belief that<br>there is no god is how justifiable that position is. Since the atheist<br>asserts that the believer's position is unsound, it is only fair to turn<br>the same question back on him, and look at just how "sound" the atheist<br>position is.<br><br>The claim made by atheism ("no god") is untenable from a philosophical<br>perspective. As legal scholar and philosopher Mortimer Adler says, \"An<br>affirmative existential proposition can be proved, but a negative<br>existential proposition\--one that denies the existence of<br>something\--cannot be proved.\" For example, let's say that I said that<br>purple eagles exist, and you said that purple eagles do not exist. I<br>would need to find only one example of a purple eagle to prove my<br>assertion. You would have to comb the entire universe and literally be<br>in every place at once to ensure you have not missed a purple eagle<br>somewhere and at some time, which is impossible to do. This is why<br>intellectually honest atheists will admit they cannot prove God does not<br>exist.<br><br>We also must discuss the seriousness of the truth claims made by atheism<br>and the amount of evidence required to warrant such conclusions. For<br>example, if someone puts two containers of lemonade in front of you and<br>says that one may be more tart than the other, since the consequences of<br>getting the more tart drink would not be serious, you would not require<br>a large amount of evidence in order to make your choice. However, if to<br>one cup the host added sweetener but to the other he added rat poison,<br>then you would want to have quite a bit of evidence before you made your<br>choice.<br><br>This is where a person sits when they are deciding between theism and<br>atheism. Since belief in atheism could possibly result in irreparable<br>and eternal consequences, it would seem that the atheist should be<br>mandated to produce weighty and overriding evidence to support their<br>position, but they cannot. **Atheism simply cannot meet the test for<br>evidence for the seriousness of the charge it makes.** Instead, the<br>atheist and those whom they convince of their position slide into<br>eternity with their fingers crossed and hope they do not find the<br>unpleasant truth that eternity does indeed exist and that such a place<br>is an awfully long time to be wrong. As Mortimer Adler says, "More<br>consequences for life and action follow from the affirmation or denial<br>of God than from any other basic question."<br><br>TL;DR: Providing proof doesn't upset theists at all. The problem comes<br>when people refuse to accept the proof.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
