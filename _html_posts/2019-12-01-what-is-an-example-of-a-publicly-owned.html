The restroom is<br>publicly owned, as it's in a government building; but it is a private<br>space, as it is one of the commonly accepted private spaces in any<br>building.<br><br>Public housing might be another example of a government building in<br>which private spaces exist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
