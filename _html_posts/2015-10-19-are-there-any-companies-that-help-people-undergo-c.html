<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The problem is what happens to you at the point in time at<br>which you are frozen. Your metabolic functions cease, so a doctor could<br>legally declare you dead. Therefore, the cryo company would be complicit<br>in unlawfully ending your life, with forethought, but without malice.<br>This would be Murder 2 in most jurisdctions in the United States.\<br>\<br>As I understand it, the whole cryo idea assumes that at the point you<br>are \"thawed,\" science will be able to fix not only your incurable<br>disease, but also fix the damage caused by the freezing process (cell<br>walls burst as the plasma within them freezes and expands). They will<br>then be able to bring you back to life, perhaps in a new body, because<br>the old one will most surely be damaged beyond repair by the freezing<br>process.\<br>\<br>So what they do is get your body as soon as is humanly possible after<br>you die to provide you with the best chance of having some form of<br>viable tissue after you are thawed.\<br>\<br>Therefore, this scheme would only work in states in which assisted<br>suicide is legal, such as Washington, California, Oregon, or Vermont (as<br>of October, 2015). A doctor at the cryo facility would have to give you<br>the button which initiates the freezing process. He would then be giving<br>you the tools to take your own life.\<br>\<br>Currently, to the best of my knowledge, none of the assisted suicide<br>laws cover cryogenics. Additionally, I know that the law in some states<br>(such as Vermont) require that you have an incurable disease and less<br>than 6 months to live as diagnosed separately by at least two<br>doctors.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
