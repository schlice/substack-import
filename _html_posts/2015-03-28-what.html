<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [My grandpa was a New York cop, and my dad was also a New<br>York police officer, and later detective. Growing up, I was always in<br>the police station. I knew many of the cops and detectives who worked in<br>the precinct, in the ESB (Emergency Services Bureau), and in the squad.<br>I was always around cops, and they were like family to me. I saw their<br>good sides and their bad sides. I watched the modernization (and<br>subsequent militarization) of the police force; I watched the transition<br>from revolvers to 9mm pistols. I watched the veterans squawk and blanch<br>at the changes, and the younger guys accept it more readily. Remember<br>*NYPD Blue*, where Jimmy Smits\' character carried a 9mm, and Dennis<br>Franz\'s character carried a S&W Chief\'s Special .38? Yeah, that show<br>actually got that part exactly right. I can attest to that.\<br>\<br>So when I was walking home from school and I rounded the corner and saw<br>police cars at my house, it was no big deal. There was always police<br>cars at my house. When my dad was in ESB, there were occasionally large<br>police tow trucks at my house (you\'ve seen the ones, that can pull a<br>Sherman tank). All of which was no big deal.\<br>\<br>But a crime scene truck? That one was new.\<br>\<br>And boy, there sure are a lot of cars here today, wonder what\'s going<br>on.\<br>\<br>Then I saw my mom crying because they took her engagement ring. Along<br>with the TVs, the 8-track (that was a huge blow - how was I going to<br>play my Meat Loaf album, which they conveniently left behind?), the<br>stereo, and my dad\'s service revolver. They politely left his duty belt<br>though. I was fine with the support and protection we received (because<br>it was great). I felt violated and scared and hollow when I saw my mom<br>crying. But I was never scared of the police.\<br>\<br>I was, however, scared of my dad. I can remember one time my friends and<br>I riding our bikes around one of the \"sumps\" (rainwater reclamation<br>sumps) that the county maintained throughout town. They were big<br>fenced-off pits in the ground, roughly a 1/8 acre plot of land with a<br>6\' flat rim at ground level and steeply sloped sides sunk a good 12\'<br>into the ground, sorta like an in-ground swimming pool. Stormwater<br>drains emptied into these sumps so that rain water could be reclaimed<br>into the water table (where our drinking water came from). They were<br>almost always bone dry. And great places for kids to ride dirt bikes.<br>Except that no one but county DPW (Department of Public Works) workers<br>was allowed in there. We\'d often build dirt bike tracks around the rim<br>and spend our days racing and jumping and generally not bothering<br>anyone.\<br>\<br>Until one day when we apparently bothered someone and they called the<br>police. We were all brought out of the sump one at a time and they took<br>our names, addresses, phone numbers, and schools where we attended. The<br>officer wrote them down on a yellow legal pad. Then he told us to go on<br>home.\<br>\<br>I wasn\'t scared of what the police were going to do. I was scared that<br>my dad would find out because he was Supercop and he\'d find out<br>eventually (or so I had worked myself up to think). I initially thought<br>the officers would recognize the name and go tell him, but you don\'t<br>work the precinct in which you live, so they apparently weren\'t aware<br>of him in our home precinct. Then I thought he or someone he knew would<br>be reading the blotter and see my name come across and he\'d come home<br>furious. I waited for him to come storming into my room when he came<br>home from a shift and be madder than Hell. Turns out he never found out,<br>and after a week or so of worrying when the boom was going to fall, it<br>never did.\<br>\<br>So as a kid, I didn\'t break the law because I was more scared of my dad<br>than I was of any punishment the police could give me.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
