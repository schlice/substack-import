<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If I'm a job seeker, why would you *not* tell me the salary range that<br>your job pays? I may be looking at the totally wrong job, and I may<br>spend weeks progressing through your interview process until I find out<br>that your position doesn't pay me nearly what I'm worth, or more<br>specifically, what I need to make. It only *benefits* a company to<br>provide the starting salary range up-front so that you only get<br>candidates who are willing and able to accept that salary to do that<br>work.<br><br>Please explain how disclosing a good-faith starting salary harms an<br>employer. So far, the only complaint posed by recruiter groups is one of<br>First Amendment reasoning, not that it harms the business, just that the<br>recruiter has the right to not disclose the starting salary.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Colorado has a law stating employers have to publish salary ranges, so<br>some companies will not hire in Colorado for remote positions.
