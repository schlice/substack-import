<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Mukbang by itself, or by its nature alone, is not sinful. It's a show<br>about eating.<br><br>However, mukbang promotes unhealthy eating habits, and could potentially<br>glamorize gluttony. A study found that people who frequently watch<br>mukbang may be more susceptible to having poor eating habits and feel<br>the impulse to eat food whenever it can be<br>seen.\[1\](#kbbla){#cite-kbbla .citation_link}<br><br>This is the danger that Christians face. Christians can watch mukbang,<br>but they should be on guard, especially if they already have poor<br>impulse control. It may lead them to the sin.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is Mukbang a sin in Christian law? If it is a sin, which one of the<br>seven deadly sins describe it best?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-kbbla){.citation_index}<br>[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3561a1&url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1460458220901360){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="sagepub.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
