Is<br>there any other process that you can think of that would reduce or<br>eliminate a potential political agenda?**<br><br>Unfortunately, no.<br><br>The Framers were actually very keenly aware that the impeachment process<br>could someday become political, since impeachment is necessarily a<br>political process, not a legal one.<br><br>What they did instead is to make the bar for *removal from office* very<br>high. You need a *supermajority* of Senators to remove a President from<br>office.<br><br>What this *should* tell you is that the Framers knew that the power to<br>pass Articles of Impeachment could be politicized (as we're seeing<br>today). You can tell that it's politicized because the desire to impeach<br>falls squarely along party lines. There's no consensus in Trump's case<br>(as we've had with every other impeachable offense) that an impeachable<br>offense has taken place.<br><br>Currently, the only remedy when a House politicizes the impeachment<br>process is to remove those Representatives at their next election.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
