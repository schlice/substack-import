Will the FBI, police, or CIA go to your<br>house if you do such things?**<br><br>Since it's not illegal to play porn games (unless someone can show me<br>where it is a crime to do so) unless you're underage, then no, no one is<br>going to do anything at all.<br><br>The worst that could happen would be that if the website was not taking<br>adequate precautions to ensure that only those of legal age play their<br>games, then the website operator could be the target of an<br>investigation, not the random thousands on the Internet who might play<br>it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
