<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do police radar/laser speedometers work while the police car is<br>already in motion?**<br><br>You asked two questions. I'll answer them individually.<br><br>1.  **How do\es\ police radar work while the police car is already in<br>    motion?\<br>    \**<br>    The police car's in-car mounted RADAR system reads the speed of its<br>    surroundings to determine the speed of the vehicle. It can do this<br>    since it is "always-on" and it can determine the "speed" of the<br>    largest variety of objects in its beam, computing the speed of all<br>    of those similar objects as the speed of its surroundings, which<br>    means that that is the speed of the cruiser. It then uses some<br>    rather un-complicated maths to read the speed of the target vehicle,<br>    convert it to the vehicle's actual speed (either in addition to or<br>    subtracted from the cruiser's speed), and puts several numbers up on<br>    the screen: the speed of the cruiser, the speed of the *fastest*<br>    vehicle in its beam, and the speed of the *closest* vehicle in its<br>    beam.<br>2.  **How do police laser speedometers work while the police car is<br>    already in motion?\<br>    \**<br>    They do not. LIDAR requires the police cruiser to be stationary. The<br>    officer aims and scans vehicles using a "scope" not unlike a hunting<br>    scope. This allows the officer to accurately measure speed of<br>    individual vehicles. LIDAR can't be used in a moving vehicle since<br>    the LIDAR unit does not "know" the speed of its surroundings. It is,<br>    unlike RADAR, an "instant-on" beam, which only activates when the<br>    officer pulls the trigger to activate the beam. It can only tell the<br>    speed of the object upon which it is focused.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
