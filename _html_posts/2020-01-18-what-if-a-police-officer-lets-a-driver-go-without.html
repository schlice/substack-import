<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What if a police officer lets a driver go without a license,<br>registration, and insurance because of financial situations, and then<br>that person gets in an accident, could the cop and the police department<br>be sued?**<br><br>Yes, the department could indeed be sued, and the plaintiff would likely<br>be victorious.<br><br>That's why a cop will never let someone continue to drive a car who<br>doesn't have a license.<br><br>Now, I'm not talking about someone who simply doesn't have their license<br>on their person, but otherwise has a valid license which is verified.<br>That person has merely committed a traffic infraction and is fined. They<br>can even (usually) get the charge dismissed if they go to the courthouse<br>and prove that they had a license on the day they were stopped.<br><br>I'm also not talking about someone who is driving on an expired (but<br>otherwise valid) license. That's also a traffic infraction, and you get<br>fined for that.<br><br>I'm talking about someone who either never had a license before, or<br>someone who is driving on a suspended or revoked license. That's not a<br>traffic infraction; that's a misdemeanor traffic violation in most<br>states. Not only is the officer not letting you go, but you're going to<br>jail. AND EVEN IF the officer decides not to press that charge, and<br>instead charges you with a simple traffic infraction, he *still* can't<br>let you drive away, because you have no valid license. You either have<br>to call someone who does have a valid driver's license to drive your car<br>home, or you have to call a tow truck to get it home, but you're not<br>driving away from that scene. If you're financially strapped, the<br>officer can tag the car and have the city tow it to the impound lot, but<br>again, if you have no valid license, you're not driving away.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
