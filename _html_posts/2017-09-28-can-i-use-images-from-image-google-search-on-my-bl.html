<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is a definite *maybe.*<br><br>First, you have to determine what your blog post is about. Are you<br>reporting on the picture? Are you providing facts about the picture?<br>This may be considered *fair use* if you need the picture in order to<br>comment on the picture.<br><br>Is it just supposed to be a "stock photo" in your blog post? The picture<br>may be protected by copyright, and using it without permission may get<br>you a DMCA Takedown notice. Be sure you use Google's filter to show you<br>only "Free to Use" photos when you search. In Google Images, click on<br>Settings \> Advanced Search. Scroll down to the section titled, "Then<br>narrow your search by..." and look at the "Usage Rights" section. Be<br>sure to select a choice that includes "free to use or share."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
