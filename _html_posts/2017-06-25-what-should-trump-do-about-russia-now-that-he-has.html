<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Jeh Johnson, the former Secretary of Homeland Security, just finished<br>testifying in Congress. Congressman Mike Conaway from Texas questioned<br>him:<br><br>> CONAWAY: "One of our purposes this morning was to reassure the<br>> American public with \regard\ to the 16 election and also secondly<br>> look at what we do in future elections going forward. You said in your<br>> opening statement, in your prepared remarks that to your knowledge<br>> there was no vote tallying changes, that no one's vote was voted one<br>> way and recorded some other way. Is that still your opinion with<br>> respect to the 16 election?"<br>><br>> JOHNSON: Based on everything I know, that is correct. I know of no<br>> evidence that through cyber intrusions, votes were altered or<br>> suppressed in some way.<br><br>The Washington Post published a piece entitled, "[[Obama's secret<br>struggle to punish Russia for Putin's election<br>assault](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f36e1c&url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/world/national-security/obama-putin-election-hacking/?utm_term%3D.a127e01a734e){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="washingtonpost.com"}]{.qlink_container}." Wow, sounds pretty<br>serious, doesn't it? Sounds like, first of all, Obama was dealing with<br>it before Trump was even President, or even a candidate, and secondly,<br>he did nothing about it. Nevertheless, in this "hard-hitting expos√©,"<br>the following quote is written:<br><br>> Despite the dire warnings, there were no meltdowns in the United<br>> States' voting infrastructure on Nov. 8, no evidence of<br>> hacking-related fraud, crashing of electronic ballots or manipulation<br>> of vote counts.<br><br>So from the testimony of various and sundry former officials, and from<br>the *totally unbiased* reporting at the ever-ethical New York Times,<br>there was no election tampering.<br><br>What exactly does "meddling" mean anyway? Does hacking DNC computers and<br>giving the results to WikiLeaks constitute "meddling?" If so, I'm *glad*<br>for that meddling, if you're *glad* that Edward Snowden can leak<br>classified documents that get people killed to WikiLeaks. What's<br>good for the geese...<br><br>Anyway, there's nothing to see here. This is literally the biggest piece<br>of fake news nonsense non-story that I can remember. There is literally<br>no election tampering. Everyone admitted it. There's nothing to see.<br><br>So why are we still talking about it?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
