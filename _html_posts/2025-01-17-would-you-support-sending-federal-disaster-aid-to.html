<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, yes 1000% yes, and I'm a conservative.<br><br>Get this straight: **we should never ever condition disaster aid to<br>PEOPLE based on their political affiliation. NEVER.** Just like it was<br>wrong for FEMA to skip over Trump supporters' houses when distributing<br>relief for Hurricane Helene here in North Carolina, it would be equally<br>wrong to skip people's houses in Democratic blue areas, or even houses<br>with Biden or Harris stickers or lawn signs or whatever. That part is<br>all wrong. We. Help. People. Full stop.<br><br>Now if we're talking about GOVERNMENTS, disbursements for disasters<br>*in progress* should also have no conditions.<br><br>HOWEVER, I would absolutely CONDITION *future* disaster aid money on<br>making sure it goes to places which actually PREPARE for DISASTERS, like<br>making sure hydrant systems have multiple redundant pressure pumps and<br>sufficient water behind them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
