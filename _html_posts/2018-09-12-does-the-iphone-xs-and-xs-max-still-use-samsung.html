<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can tell a lot from a launch event from the information that they<br>give, but you can tell just as much from the information that they<br>*don\'t* give.<br><br>For example, in today\'s launch event, Apple did not tell you the exact<br>milliamp hour (mAh) rating of any of the three phones batteries. They<br>only said some obscure things like "this phone will last for 1.5 hours<br>longer than the iPhone 8.". If they had made great strides in their<br>battery technology, or they had included a battery that was incredibly<br>larger than the battery in the iPhone X, they would be making a big deal<br>of it. The fact that they did not says that the new batteries probably<br>aren\'t very much bigger than the batteries in the current iPhone X.<br><br>To answer the question, Apple didn\'t say specifically in today\'s<br>launch event that they were using an AMOLED panel from a different<br>manufacturer than Samsung. You would think that if Apple had chosen an<br>AMOLED panel from a different manufacturer than Samsung, they would make<br>a bigger deal about it (considering that Samsung overall is a direct<br>competitor). The fact that they haven\'t leads me to believe that<br>Samsung is still the manufacturer of the new phone's AMOLED panel.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
