<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would you eat at "Cracker Barrel" after discovering it fired an<br>employee for giving a 73 yr old homeless veteran a corn muffin?**<br><br>Actually, that's not really what happened. So before we go off the<br>rails, let's get our story straight.<br><br>[[Vietnam veteran, 73, loses job at Cracker Barrel after giving muffin<br>to needy<br>man](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=893ec3&url=https://www.foxnews.com/us/vietnam-veteran-73-loses-job-at-cracker-barrel-after-giving-muffin-to-needy-man){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="foxnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>The 73 year old was a Vietnam veteran. He was actually the employee<br>giving a muffin to a homeless person.<br><br>This was in violation of store policy, and he's violated store policy on<br>more than one occasion. This was his fifth violation of store policy.<br><br>Cracker Barrel said the following about his termination:<br><br>> *Mr. Koblenzer has worked as a host at Cracker Barrel's Sarasota store<br>> since April 2011. During the time he was employed, he violated the<br>> Company's policies regarding consuming food without paying or giving<br>> away free food, on five separate occasions. Mr. Koblenzer received<br>> multiple counselings and written warnings reminding him about the<br>> company's policies and the consequences associated with violating<br>> them. On the fifth occasion, again per Company policy, Mr. Koblenzer<br>> was terminated.*<br>><br>> *Cracker Barrel is grateful for and honors Mr. Koblenzer's service to<br>> our country as we honor all service men and women and their families.*<br><br>If you want to buy food and give it away, that's your business.<br><br>But you can't give away company food without paying if it violates<br>company policy, regardless of how kind-hearted you are.<br><br>So would I still eat at Cracker Barrel? Sure.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
