<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not sure what you mean by "leaves the property." Are you saying that the<br>person sells their house and leaves without paying their dues?<br><br>Part of the disclosures during a home sale is confirmation of a clean<br>account in the HOA. If the previous homeowner hasn't paid their dues,<br>those back dues will have to be paid before the HOA will provide a<br>certificate of account for the sale.<br><br>In other words, if you're running a balance due with the HOA, you won't<br>be able to sell your house.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
