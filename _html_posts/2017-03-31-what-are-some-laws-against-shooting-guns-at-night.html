<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Most jurisdictions don't have "time of day" requirements for shooting,<br>unless you're referring to outdoor, unlit gun ranges, which probably<br>won't operate without daylight.<br><br>Most jurisdictions are governed by both noise ordinances, and location<br>ordinances.<br><br>For example, most jurisdictions have noise ordinances which bar nuisance<br>noise, usually between the hours of 11 PM and 7 AM local time.<br><br>Some jurisdictions (mostly cities) have rules about discharging firearms<br>within their city limits (i.e. you can't do it unless you're in a<br>location specifically designed for firing weapons, such as a gun range).<br>As an example, we have several gun ranges (both indoor and outdoor)<br>located within city limits. Even though you're inside city limits and<br>there are city ordinances which prohibit discharging firearms within<br>city limits, gun ranges are specifically exempted from that ordinance.<br><br>Even locations which have no specific restrictions against time of day<br>will often state that you must shoot in a way that does not endanger<br>people or property. Shooting at night arguably does both of those, as<br>proper shooting etiquette requires you to know what is downrange, as<br>well as what is behind your target. If you shoot at night, you may not<br>be able to effectively see downrange, so you may still run afoul of the<br>limited laws that many unincorporated county areas do have.<br><br>If you plan on going shooting, make sure you have looked up and<br>understand your local laws surrounding when and where you can shoot, and<br>how you are required to transport your weapons. It is entirely the<br>shooter's responsibility to understand all applicable laws when engaging<br>in shooting sports.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
