<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Destruction of legal tender is a Federal offense (18 USC ยง 333).<br><br>However, *are you likely to be arrested for it?*<br><br>The problem these days is that it's akin to burning the US flag. This is<br>also a Federal offense (4 USC ยง 5), however several SCOTUS rulings have<br>determined that burning the flag in protest is a protected form of<br>speech under the 1st Amendment. You could similarly claim a 1st<br>Amendment exception when burning your money in protest.<br><br>The only recourse that the government may offer when it comes to burning<br>money is that it actually costs about US\$0.05 to produce each piece of<br>legal tender, so there is actually a cost to burning money, beyond the<br>face value of the note itself.<br><br>However, unless we're talking burning *massive amounts of money,*<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-dd305a35b6a67e3089517913741a833a){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-dd305a35b6a67e3089517913741a833a" master_w="658"<br>master_h="444"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>it's highly unlikely that anyone would ever arrest you for burning a few<br>bills.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
