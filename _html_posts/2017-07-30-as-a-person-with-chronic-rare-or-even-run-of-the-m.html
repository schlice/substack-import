<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>With MS, you don't know. Because you don't know which symptoms are<br>actually their own diseases, or which ones are caused by MS.<br><br>So a lot of the medical issues I had in my 20s, but especially bowel and<br>memory issues, either went undiagnosed (the brain fog), or misdiagnosed<br>(irritable bowel syndrome). There is a good chance that these symptoms<br>were actually being caused by MS.<br><br>The key is exactly what [[Wendy<br>Burnett](https://www.quora.com/profile/Wendy-Burnett)]{.qlink_container}<br>mentioned: early diagnosis and treatment. When I was diagnosed with MS,<br>the guidelines said that you couldn't be conclusively diagnosed unless<br>you had two symptoms disseminated by time and space; time being at least<br>six months, and space being separate body systems. At the time, I only<br>had one symptom and a positive MRI. This was not enough to conclusively<br>be diagnosed as MS; it was called "probable MS."<br><br>However, if you start on the MS medication when you are only "probable,"<br>you are essentially "admitting" to the medical world that you *do* have<br>MS, which also means admitting to your insurance carriers (medical,<br>life, etc) that you have MS, which could potentially have some financial<br>impact. So there may be incentive to delay the start of treatment. But,<br>the "conservative" approach is to "conserve" as much brain tissue as<br>possible, which would mean getting on medication right away, even if the<br>"probable" diagnosis would essentially be converted to a "definite"<br>diagnosis simply by ordering the medication.<br><br>My doctor wisely advised me to start on the medication right away. As it<br>turns out, since my diagnosis, researchers have discovered that earlier<br>treatment does, in fact, delay the onset of advanced courses of the<br>disease, such as Secondary Progressive MS. In other words, the sooner<br>you start on the medication, the longer that advanced courses of the<br>disease will take to appear. Also, the clinical guidelines for<br>diagnosing MS have changed since I was diagnosed. With more faith in the<br>accuracy of MRI readings, you can now be clinically diagnosed with MS<br>with one symptom and a positive MRI.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
