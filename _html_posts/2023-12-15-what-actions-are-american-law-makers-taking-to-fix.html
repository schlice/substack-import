<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Absolutely nothing.*<br><br>- All fifty states have laws which allow breastfeeding in any public or<br>  private location.<br>- Thirty-one states specifically exclude breastfeeding from public<br>  indecency laws.<br>- Thirty states have laws related to breastfeeding in the workplace.<br>- Twenty-two states exempt breastfeeding mothers from jury duty or allow<br>  their duty to be postponed.<br>- Four states have endorsed or encouraged the development of a<br>  breastfeeding awareness or education campaign.<br><br>It seems that American lawmakers are *doubling down* on breastfeeding,<br>rather than considering it public indecency.<br><br>\<br><br>It would only be a miscarriage of justice if the justice system came to<br>an *unjust* conclusion. So is it *unjust* that we consider breastfeeding<br>to not be public indecency? The answer comes down to how society feels<br>about breastfeeding, and how society feels that laws should convenience<br>those who take offense at seeing such things. Countries do this<br>differently. In Australia, laws encourage mothers to be considerate of<br>those around them who might see them feeding their babies, while in the<br>US, those encouragements don't exist. The law encourages mothers to<br>breastfeed and not feel uncomfortable about doing so.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
