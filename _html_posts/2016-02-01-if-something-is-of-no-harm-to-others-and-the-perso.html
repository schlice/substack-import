<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Thanks for the A2A. Note that this is written from a US legal<br>perspective; other countries may believe differently.<br><br>Nothing is \"automatically covered\" by individual rights. In the United<br>States, the only rights protected are the ones in the Constitution.<br>Everything else is fair game and is open to restriction by either the<br>Federal government or by state governments. This includes drugs.<br><br>Drugs in the United States are classified based on their potential for<br>abuse, and their medicinal benefit, as proven through sanctioned<br>studies. Schedule I drugs have a high potential for abuse, and have no<br>documented medicinal uses. Marijuana, LSD and magic mushrooms in the<br>United States are listed on Schedule I.<br><br>Schedule II drugs have a high potential for abuse, but have documented<br>medicinal benefits (and can thus be prescribed by a doctor). It is<br>interesting to note that both heroin and cocaine are on Schedule II.<br><br>(EDIT) The question was amended to state that \"the ban on use of<br>psychedelics is a violation of the human rights to belief and spiritual<br>practice, full development of the personality, and free time and play.\"<br><br>1.  While psychedelics are used as part of spiritual practice, they are<br>    not required in order to be spiritual, so they don\'t fall under<br>    First Amendment religious protections. The Native American tribes of<br>    the United States made a successful case that peyote should be<br>    exempted from Schedule I because it is an integral part of their<br>    religion. If a religion used a psychedelic as an integral part of<br>    its belief, it may also apply for an exemption, but beyond the<br>    Native Americans, none have done so. By the way, the Native American<br>    \"peyote\" case was what prompted then-President Clinton to sign the<br>    Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which Hobby Lobby successfully<br>    used to bypass the contraception requirement in the Affordable Care<br>    Act.<br>2.  There is no concrete evidence to suggest that the personality of a<br>    human being does not \"fully develop\" without psychedelics.<br>3.  Free time and play are not unduly limited by disallowing<br>    psychedelics. If you believe that your free time and play are<br>    limited because psychedelics are illegal, you are free to move to<br>    Austria, where magic mushrooms are legal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
