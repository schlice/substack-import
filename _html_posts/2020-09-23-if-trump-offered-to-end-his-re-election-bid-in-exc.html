<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If Trump offered to end his re-election bid in exchange for an<br>uncontested approval of his SCOTUS pick, would you take the deal?**<br><br>Why would he do that? He already has enough votes in the Senate to<br>confirm his SCOTUS pick.<br><br>Democrats do not want to support his SCOTUS pick, whether he ends his<br>re-election bid or not. Their dissent of his pick is not rooted in his<br>re-election campaign, but in the views of his pick. Those views won't<br>change based on his re-election campaign. Democrats will continue to<br>oppose his SCOTUS pick, whether he's running or not. But he doesn't need<br>them to agree; he has enough votes to confirm his pick without them.<br><br>It would be horrible to take away the opinions of Democrats simply<br>because Trump decides not to run.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
