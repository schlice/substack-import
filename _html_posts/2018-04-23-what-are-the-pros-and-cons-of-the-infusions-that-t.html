<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are the pros and cons of the infusions that treat multiple<br>sclerosis? I'm worried about the side effects.**<br><br>I spent 18 months on Tysabri.<br><br>On the plus side, it controlled my MS better than any other medication I<br>was on before, or have been on since. In fact, while I was on Tysabri,<br>my brain was actually able to heal, and some of my lesions *shrank*.<br><br>On the downside, Tysabri is broken down by the liver. That's not<br>necessarily a bad thing, except my depression medication that I was on<br>at the time was *also* broken down by the liver. The liver's level of<br>processing is reactive in that as medication increases that the liver<br>needs to break down, the liver takes some time to ramp up its action.<br>Same is true when the medication level reduces. This means that for a<br>week or so, the liver will either be breaking down too much, or not<br>enough.<br><br>Consequently, I was good for the first few weeks following my infusion.<br>But as the level of Tysabri started to taper off, my liver was working<br>too hard and it broke down more of my depression medication than it<br>should have. Result: mood swings. *Extremely unpleasant* mood swings.<br>Not for me, but for everyone else around me. You could always tell when<br>it was a week before my next infusion, or so I was told.<br><br>I know you've heard already about the risk of PML. Remember that you<br>only risk PML if you are JC positive. I have been (and continue to be)<br>JC negative, so there was no risk of PML for me. Your mileage may vary.<br><br>I didn't have any other adverse reactions to the infusion. I would get<br>the infusion before lunch, and be back to work in the afternoon.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
