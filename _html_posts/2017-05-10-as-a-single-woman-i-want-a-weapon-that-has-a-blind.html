I agree with the<br>other posters: get a gun. Learn how to use it. It will save your life.<br>You can always stick a tac light on the rail, or heck, carry a mini<br>light too.<br><br>But since you asked, this is a device which has a light, an alarm, and a<br>less-than-lethal weapon to stop an intruder.<br><br>The biggest problem that exists here is that in order to use this tool,<br>you have to be close enough to reach out and touch your assailant.<br>That's at least six feet too close for my taste. That's hand-to-hand<br>range, and I don't like putting you in that position. Therefore, I do<br>not recommend this device.<br><br>But as I said, you asked, so I delivered.<br><br>Now, if you're willing to forego the alarm, I offer you this:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-23a27a29ae8b9f71637e26475e79560b){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-23a27a29ae8b9f71637e26475e79560b" master_w="600"<br>master_h="400"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>The [[TASER<br>Strikelight](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fa5e81&url=https://www.axon.com/products/taser-strikelight){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="axon.com"}]{.qlink_container}: a combination flashlight and<br>stun gun. But this suffers from the same fatal flaw: you have to be<br>within striking distance to use it.<br><br>So therefore, if you change the design just a little, and make the light<br>portion a little smaller, you get this:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-ef8ae163f6ff0e150804959eb944f059){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-ef8ae163f6ff0e150804959eb944f059" master_w="600"<br>master_h="400"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>The [[TASER<br>Bolt](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60b4eb&url=https://www.axon.com/products/taser-bolt){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="axon.com"}]{.qlink_container}. Legal for carry in most<br>states. 15-foot range, well out of reach of an assailant. Has a<br>flashlight, but still no alarm.<br><br>Please strongly consider the Bolt for your personal protection needs.<br><br>No, I do not work for Axon, the company which makes the TASER.<br><br>(EDIT) Since I'm being asked, in the United States, [[it's legal in most<br>states](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8f3cbd&url=https://buy.taser.com/taser-state-requirements){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="taser.com"}]{.qlink_container} to own, carry, and conceal a<br>TASER. TASERs are legal to own in 45 states and Puerto Rico with little<br>to no restrictions. They are currently banned from civilian ownership in<br>Washington DC, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New York, and New<br>Jersey. Know the law for your state before you buy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
