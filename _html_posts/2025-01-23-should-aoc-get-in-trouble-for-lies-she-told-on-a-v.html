<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So long as you understand what we mean by "get in trouble."<br><br>AOC posted a video on TikTok and Instagram explaining why she wasn't<br>going to be attending the inauguration.<br><br>"All these journalists are like, 'Congresswoman, are you going to the<br>inauguration? Congresswoman, are you going to the inauguration? Are you<br>going to the inauguration?" she said in her video.<br><br>"Let me make myself clear," she concluded. "I don't celebrate rapists.<br>So no, I'm not going to the inauguration tomorrow."<br><br>It's important to note that ABC News just settled with Trump over a<br>defamation lawsuit wherein George Stephanopoulos repeatedly claimed<br>Trump had been "found liable for rape" and "defaming the victim of that<br>rape."<br><br>Trump and Debra O'Connell, the president of ABC News Group and Disney<br>Entertainment Networks, signed the out-of-court settlement for \$15<br>million over Stephanopoulos' repeated defamatory claims.<br><br>There's no reason to think that Ocasio-Cortez can't be similarly sued<br>for defamation after claiming that Trump is a rapist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
