<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If I accepted Jesus Christ into my heart does that mean I will go to<br>heaven but what if I continue to sin. And do we have to be baptized to<br>go to heaven?**<br><br>Let's take these one at a time.<br><br>**If I accepted Jesus Christ into my heart does that mean I will go to<br>heaven**<br><br>Not necessarily. If by "accepting Jesus Christ into your heart" you mean<br>that you agree that you are sinful and have fallen short of the grace of<br>God, you accept that Jesus died for your sins, and you accept this gift<br>and you choose to live your life as he wants you to live (presumably by<br>accepting Jesus into your heart), then yes, you are saved.<br><br>but what if I continue to sin.<br><br>Then you are human.<br><br>We are all sinful by our very nature. We even started this process by<br>admitting that we are all sinners and have fallen short of God's grace.<br>We can do nothing to achieve salvation by ourselves. It is only through<br>God's grace that we are saved.<br><br>But ask yourself this question: *if you have truly accepted Christ as<br>your personal savior and you are actively trying to pattern your life<br>after his, shouldn't your daily conduct* *change**? Shouldn't your<br>sinfulness* *improve**?*<br><br>The answer is that it should.<br><br>We may keep committing new sins. I amaze myself at all the ways I manage<br>to sin, despite my best efforts.<br><br>But being a sinful person, and being sinful *and then continuing to<br>commit the same sins over and over again* are two totally different<br>things.<br><br>If you truly have Jesus in your heart and you commit your life to his<br>direction, you should see your sinful state improve.<br><br>And do we have to be baptized to go to heaven?<br><br>No. Accepting Jesus as your lord and savior in the way we already<br>described is what saves you. God's grace saves you, not baptism.<br>However, baptism is an outward sign of our commitment to be "buried" to<br>our sinfulness and to be "raised up" to live in glory with him. The<br>Bible commands that we be baptized, but baptism doesn't save us from<br>sin. Grace does.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
