What does it entail?**<br><br>Yes it can be done. Check with the laws in your state and in your city<br>to determine what exactly needs to be done.<br><br>You will need the assistance of a real estate attorney who has knowledge<br>of association laws in your jurisdiction. If you have 100% agreement and<br>signatures from all of the owners, you can usually dissolve an<br>association.<br><br>Some things will need to be handled, like ownership of community<br>property. Many times, community property can be charitably donated, or<br>disposed of in other ways. Handling other things which were paid for by<br>the association will still need to take place, such as the water bill<br>for your community landscaping. If you're planning on separating the<br>landscaping out into individual meters, the city will have to come in<br>and do that work, and they will charge you for it. Plus, there are the<br>attorney's fees and the filing fees with your city or county.<br><br>So while it is not free, and while there are some things you will have<br>to take care of, it can be done.<br><br>Your first step is finding a real estate attorney who can handle the<br>transaction.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
