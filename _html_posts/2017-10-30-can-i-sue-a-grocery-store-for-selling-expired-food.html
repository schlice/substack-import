<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Remember, in many cases, it is the manufacturer (through their<br>distributors) who directly stock store shelves, not always store<br>employees. So in some cases, the food makes it to the store shelves<br>without the store even touching it.<br><br>Also remember that some foods spoil before their expiration dates due to<br>faults in the manufacture or delivery process. Those foods should be<br>returned to the store for refund. The store will take it up with the<br>distributor.<br><br>If you found expired food on the shelf, but haven't purchased it yet,<br>immediately take it to the customer service desk at the store. You<br>should expect to see a store employee accompany you to the area in the<br>store where the expired stock is located, and you should expect to see<br>it immediately removed from the shelf. If you get a lukewarm response<br>(or no response at all, or worse, someone re-stocking the expired item),<br>call your regional health department and inform them of the issue.<br><br>If you inadvertently consumed expired food, you're probably going to be<br>okay. If it's only a few days past expiration, you should be fine. Be<br>more careful when you buy things. You should be checking the expiration<br>on everything you pick up in the store.<br><br>If you inadvertently consumed expired food and it made you sick, you<br>might be able to sue the store for damages, but it's likely they will<br>simply settle with you and pay your out-of-pocket medical costs,<br>assuming you can prove when you bought it and when the expiration date<br>was. They probably won't push too hard which is why I said they'll<br>likely settle out of court.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
