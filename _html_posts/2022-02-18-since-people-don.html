<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Your premise is incorrect.<br><br>Police don't wear Body-Worn Cameras (BWCs) for *your* protection; they<br>wear them for *theirs*.<br><br>The evidence collected from a BWC doesn't go to *you* to prove that the<br>police are trustworthy. The evidence collected from a BWC goes into an<br>investigation into whatever the officer was called to investigate. The<br>video becomes *evidence* which helps the District Attorney to make his<br>or her case. The evidence is for *their* benefit*, not yours.*<br><br>As an aside, it's probably at least a little bit comforting to you that<br>the police are recording their own actions so that they are<br>disincentivized to lie about what you said or did, but that's not why<br>the police spend millions in taxpayer dollars to fund these cameras and<br>their associated data storage costs.<br><br>More often than not, the primary use for non-evidentiary video is to<br>show police supervisors *exactly* what a complainant said/did during a<br>contact, especially following the filing of a formal complaint. "Ah, so<br>you believe Officer Jones was rude to you during your last traffic stop?<br>Let's pull up his video feed and see what happened." Most times, the<br>video exonerates the officer. *Not every time,* mind, but most times.<br>Even if the department doesn't take action, they will usually burn you a<br>copy of the video, so you can take it to your own attorney if you still<br>choose to make a case against the department (which you have the right<br>to do).<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Since people don't trust the police, the police are required to use body<br>cameras. Do you think poll workers should be required to wear body<br>cameras?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
