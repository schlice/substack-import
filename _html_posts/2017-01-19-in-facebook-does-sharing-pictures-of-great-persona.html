<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You said you share "copyleft picture quotes" but then you apply your<br>page watermark. It sounds like you could be heading for trouble.<br><br>A "copyleft" is intended to be the opposite of a "copyright." Instead of<br>all rights to the image being reserved, on the contrary, all rights are<br>freely given to redistribute the image, so long as any derivative works<br>are also freely given.<br><br>So why a copyleft instead of just releasing something to the public<br>domain?<br><br>In the public domain, anyone can similarly use the image. But public<br>domain works can be re-packaged into proprietary works, which can then<br>be subject to copyright.<br><br>Copyleft works are specifically prohibited from being re-packaged into<br>any derivative work for which a copyright can be applied. Copyleft says<br>that anyone who redistributes the image, with or without changes, must<br>pass along the freedom to further copy and change it. Copyleft<br>guarantees that every user has freedom.<br><br>If the original image is subject to "copyleft," you are free to<br>redistribute it, re-package it, and even modify it, so long as the same<br>"copyleft" applies to the image.<br><br>In other words, you cannot watermark the image unless it is a "copyleft"<br>watermark. You cannot restrict redistribution of a copyleft image by<br>placing your own copyright on it. This violates the letter and the<br>spirit of a copyleft.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
