<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Logically:<br><br>1.  Hanging is no longer a legal method of execution in Colorado.<br>2.  Holmes was not sentenced to death; he was sentenced to life without<br>    parole.<br><br>Therefore, two reasons why he would not be hanged are that he was not<br>sentenced to death, and he cannot be legally hanged even if he was<br>sentenced to death.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
