<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's easy to sit in judgment of the officers who did not stop the<br>detective from effecting an arrest. But those officers were in a really<br>tough spot. If you're going to intervene when a detective is working,<br>you had better be right, otherwise it's your own badge on the line. I<br>bet most of those officers were at least a little unsure that what he<br>was doing wasn't okay. Additionally, was he *beating* her like Rodney<br>King? Was he *abusing* her? No, he effected an arrest. It might have<br>been wrong, and it might have been legally misguided, but was it<br>something that they needed to physically step in and stop? Without<br>specific guidance about that, it would be really challenging for an<br>officer to step in and say, "Hey Detective, I think your judgment about<br>the facts of law here are slightly uninformed."<br><br>Also, I understand it was an incredible burden on Nurse Wubbels to be<br>arrested (and probably a traumatizing experience), but look at what the<br>outcomes will be:<br><br>1.  Detective Payne will most certainly be relieved of duty and will<br>    likely be fired. However, a review will need to be conducted. What<br>    in God's name could they possibly be *reviewing? Don't we have<br>    everything we need on body cam?* The standard used will be<br>    knowledge at the time. The question the review board will be<br>    asking is, "What should Detective Payne have known at the time he<br>    made the arrest?" In order to answer that, they will have to review<br>    his entire training curriculum from the Academy and every refresher<br>    training he has ever had. They will have to determine if he has ever<br>    been presented this material regarding getting physical samples from<br>    patients. If he has, then he "should have known" that she was<br>    factually correct in her determination.<br>2.  Nurse Wubbels will most certainly sue the department for false<br>    arrest, and false imprisonment, as well as compensation pain and<br>    suffering. She will likely settle out of court for an undisclosed<br>    sum. That sum will not be paltry. I say this not to minimize what<br>    Nurse Wubbels has been through, but she will be compensated for her<br>    trouble. Handily, I might add.<br><br>So in the end, this will all work out exactly as it should. The<br>detective who has a distinct lack of evidentiary knowledge will be<br>relieved of duty, and the nurse who was incorrectly arrested will get a<br>windfall.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
