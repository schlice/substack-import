<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**As a Christian, does it bother you that life doesn\'t seem to give you<br>much more than it does the non-believer?**<br><br>If it does, then you're looking at life incorrectly.<br><br>Look, I get it, because I see it every day. Evil people with hate in<br>their hearts win. Every day. They accumulate much more material wealth<br>than I do. They have beautiful homes, nice cars, and generally easy<br>lives. And I struggle, daily. I struggle with my vices. I struggle with<br>my finances. And I struggle to keep my family moving forward towards God<br>in a sea of sin.<br><br>But part of the problem is that it's an illusion. As you know, people<br>have a public persona that they show every day, but in private, they are<br>entirely different people. Some public personas are very close to their<br>private ones, and some are very different. I suspect that for many<br>worldly people, their public personas are very much different than their<br>private ones.<br><br>The other part of the problem is that the accumulation of treasure on<br>earth is folly. Jesus told the parable of the surplus grain:<br><br>> And he told them this parable: "The ground of a certain rich man<br>> yielded an abundant harvest. He thought to himself, 'What shall I do?<br>> I have no place to store my crops.'<br>><br>> "Then he said, 'This is what I'll do. I will tear down my barns and<br>> build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain. And I'll<br>> say to myself, 'You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take<br>> life easy; eat, drink and be merry.'<br>><br>> "But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life will be<br>> demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for<br>> yourself?'<br>><br>> "This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves<br>> but is not rich toward God." --- Luke 12:16--21 NIV<br><br>On a side note, it's important to note that the man didn't do anything<br>to make the crops grow; God did. The man only reaped the benefits of<br>God's work, but the man decided to take the credit and store up God's<br>outpouring.<br><br>This passage goes on:<br><br>> Then Jesus said to his disciples: "Therefore I tell you, do not worry<br>> about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will<br>> wear. For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes.<br>> Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom<br>> or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than<br>> birds! Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life?<br>> Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the<br>> rest?<br>><br>> "Consider how the wild flowers grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I<br>> tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of<br>> these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is<br>> here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will<br>> he clothe you---you of little faith! And do not set your heart on what<br>> you will eat or drink; do not worry about it. For the pagan world runs<br>> after all such things, and your Father knows that you need them. But<br>> seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well. ---<br>> Luke 12:22--31 NIV<br><br>The pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father knows that<br>you need them. **But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given<br>you as well.**<br><br>God will provide you with what you need in this life. Don't worry about<br>what others have. You will get what you need in this life, and you will<br>be rewarded in the next.<br><br>The people who are *of* this world will excel *in* this world. But when<br>it comes to the next, they are sorely lacking, in my opinion. I honestly<br>don't know, because that's between them and God. But usually, you can<br>tell how well someone relates to God by how well they relate to God's<br>children here on earth. And if their relationships with God's children<br>here on earth is any indication, these folks are lacking in the<br>"relationship with God" category.<br><br>Jesus even warned us that this would be an issue.<br><br>> If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you<br>> belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do<br>> not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That<br>> is why the world hates you. --- John 15:18--19 NIV<br>><br>> I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In<br>> this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the<br>> world. --- John 16:33 NIV<br><br>Our job is not to adapt ourselves to this world, because we have been<br>chosen from the world. We are not a part of it. We are indeed a people<br>set apart. So don't fret about the material things of this world that<br>you don't have, and the life which simply doesn't compare to that of the<br>non-believer. Your heart is set on a *different* prize.<br><br>Don't store up your treasures on earth. Store up your treasures in<br>heaven, where it counts.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
