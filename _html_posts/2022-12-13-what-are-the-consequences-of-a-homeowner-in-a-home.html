<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Regardless of the reason you choose to refuse to pay dues, refusing to<br>pay dues for any reason results in bad juju for you. You will be charged<br>late fees, and when your account balance gets large enough, the HOA will<br>turn your account over to the attorney, and you will face collections<br>and potential liens on your property until you pay. If your balance gets<br>large enough, the HOA and the attorney can decide to foreclose on your<br>property and use the proceeds of the sale to repay what you owe.<br><br>Now to the second part of your question. If Board members are<br>mismanaging funds, what can you do? If your Governing Documents has a<br>recall provision, you can call for a recall election to remove the Board<br>member. Your Governing Documents may also have a provision to remove a<br>Board member from the Board with a certain percentage of homeowner<br>signatures. My HOA has the latter, and we removed a Board member using<br>that process (in actuality, we never completed the forced removal, as<br>the Board member in question resigned in lieu of being forcibly removed<br>from the Board).<br><br>Short of recalling or forcibly removing the Board member(s), just don't<br>re-elect that Board member(s) at the next election. Remember, there's no<br>requirement for the Board to do perfect work. If you think you can do<br>better work, or if you think you can manage money better than the<br>current Board, feel free to run against them and state your case to the<br>homeowners. There's no standard for money management for Board members<br>other than "don't do anything illegal." So if you think you can do<br>*better*, then feel free to run against them and do better.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
