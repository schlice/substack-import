<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Assuming that tax breaks which *ONLY* affect the top tax brackets or<br>*ONLY* *the largest of* corporations actually existed, they would<br>still benefit the citizens of the country.<br><br>How? *Innovation.*<br><br>You only have a cell phone in your pocket because rich people bought<br>very expensive ones back in the late 80s and early 90s.<br><br>You only have a flat-screen TV in your house for under \$500 because<br>some rich person bought the first plasma TV at \$14,995 in 1997.<br><br>Without those first few capital investments, there would be no market<br>for those devices. That infusion of capital, that recognition of the<br>market for the technology, spurred the R&D necessary to make the devices<br>smaller and more efficient, taking the phone from the car phone to the<br>DynaTAC bag phone, and into the phones you have today.<br><br>So yes, some rich person needs to buy that technology first so that you<br>and I can enjoy better, smaller, and cheaper versions of the same tech<br>later.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
