<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can Trump pardon Roger Stone after the judge went through Stone\'s 7<br>felony crimes in her court?**<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Now that Stone has been convicted and sentenced to 40 months in Federal<br>prison, the President can pardon him. He'll wait for the judicial<br>process to move forward, but the President has already characterized<br>Stone's prosecution as a "miscarriage of justice." We fully expect Trump<br>to pardon him, or at the very least, commute his sentence.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
