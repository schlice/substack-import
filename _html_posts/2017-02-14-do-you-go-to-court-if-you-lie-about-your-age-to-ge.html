<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I know we're talking about hypotheticals here, but let's just give you<br>the short answer: you can't do it.<br><br>It's not like you fill in your age on a form and they take you at your<br>word.<br><br>At the recruiters these days, you have to show a lot of personal<br>documents: your Social Security card, your birth certificate, your<br>drivers license, your high school transcript, etc. Then they do basic<br>background checks on you. Back in the day, the documentation requirement<br>was much lighter, and background checks did not move at the speed of<br>digital. Today, it would take a lot of falsification to actually be able<br>to join the military while lying about your age. You have to spend quite<br>a bit of money to get a good fake birth certificate which you could then<br>use to get a real fake driver's license, Social Security card, etc. Good<br>documents are not cheap, so trying to lie about your age to get into the<br>army is a pretty expensive proposition for someone who is younger than<br>18.<br><br>Back in the day, you could lie on your application and it wouldn't have<br>been so closely checked. Today, it's nearly impossible to get into the<br>military underage. Today, you'd be quite quickly discovered as a liar at<br>the recruiter's office, and you would be asked to go find employment<br>somewhere else. Probably politely, but there are no guarantees. The<br>military isn't big on liars.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
