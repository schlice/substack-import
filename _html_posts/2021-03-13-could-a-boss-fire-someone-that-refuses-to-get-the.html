<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can your employer fire you for refusing to get the Covid<br>vaccine?**<br><br>Thanks for the A2A,<br>[Judith(https://www.quora.com/profile/Judith-687)]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>Unpopular opinion coming here, because I see a lot of answers which<br>are flat-out wrong, and I'll explain why.<br><br>First, let me express my opinion. In my opinion, I believe the vaccine<br>is safe enough for the majority of the population to take and suffer no<br>ill effects. In my opinion, in this rare time in our history (it's not<br>unprecedented; just not common), everyone should do what they can to<br>slow the spread of the virus. As a person who, in the words of my<br>neurologist, is at "extreme risk" for contracting the virus, I have been<br>authorized to get it myself, and I plan on doing so.<br><br>Now that my opinion about the vaccine is out of the way, let's get down<br>to the legalese:<br><br>**Your employer cannot mandate you take a vaccine which has not been<br>fully approved by the FDA. Similarly, your employer cannot fire you for<br>refusing to get any of the current COVID-19 vaccines.**<br><br>The current (as of March 2021) crop of COVID-19 vaccines has been<br>approved under an *Emergency Use Authorization* (EUA). Medications<br>which receive an EUA have not been fully tested; they have not gone<br>through the FDA's full, required suite of phased pharmaceutical testing.<br>When the FDA grants an EUA, it does so because there exists a public<br>health emergency, and it *believes* (not knows) that the benefits of the<br>drug outweigh the risk of having a vaccine that is not completely<br>tested. However, when Congress chose to give the power to grant EUAs to<br>the FDA, they also chose to require that everyone who takes an emergency<br>vaccine *does so only based upon their own personal choice*. In other<br>words, no one can be *compelled* **to take a vaccine covered by<br>an EUA.** This is not my opinion. This is the Federal law surrounding<br>EUAs.\[1\](#xGYLP){#cite-xGYLP .citation_link}<br><br>Therefore, anyone who is terminated because they refused to take a<br>vaccine covered only by an EUA is *unlawfully terminated*.<br><br>Employers in the US would do well to learn this fact. You can use COVID<br>vaccination status as a valid screening item when you hire someone,<br>***but you may not use vaccination status as a reason to terminate<br>someone's employment, and you may not require your employees to get a<br>vaccine covered only by an Emergency Use Authorization.***<br><br>Let's be clear. Once the FDA grants final approval for any vaccine, an<br>employer can then require you take it, or they can fire you.<br><br>However, while the vaccine is covered by an EUA, an employer would be at<br>odds with federal law if they require employees to get it.<br><br>Employers may feel free to *strongly encourage* employees to get<br>vaccinated, so long as<br><br>1.  their encouragement is not viewed as coercive<br>2.  the employer makes it crystal clear that the decision regarding<br>    whether to receive the vaccine is voluntary,<br>3.  any statements by the employer about the vaccine comply with the<br>    requirements in the EUAs and the related regulations for these<br>    products.<br><br>**TL;DR: Because the current crop of COVID-19 vaccines is only covered<br>by an Emergency Use Authorization and has not been fully approved by the<br>FDA, you take the vaccine at your own risk and by your own choice, and<br>employers may not force employees to be vaccinated.**<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice.
