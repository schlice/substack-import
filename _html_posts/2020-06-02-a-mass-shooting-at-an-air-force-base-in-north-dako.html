<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**A mass shooting at an air force base in North Dakota resulted in the<br>deaths of two men. Why do Nazi Trump supporters still defend the Second<br>Amendment when it causes nothing but pain and death?**<br><br>I almost didn't answer this question because the question itself is so<br>full of hate. So I copied the question into my answer so that if anyone<br>decides to soften the language in the question any, you can see how it<br>was originally written.<br><br>So let's pick this one apart, shall we?<br><br>- A mass shooting<br><br>Let's look at the first line from [[the press release from the<br>base](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f9bd13&url=https://www.grandforks.af.mil/News/Article/2203272/fatal-shooting-occurs-at-grand-forks-air-force-base/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="af.mil"}]{.qlink_container}, and you judge for yourself<br>whether or not this is a mass shooting:<br><br>> GRAND FORKS AIR FORCE BASE, N.D. \--<br>><br>> A shooting incident at approximately 4:30 a.m. today has left two<br>> 319th Reconnaissance Wing active duty military members<br>> dead.\[1\](#EmPaR){#cite-EmPaR .citation_link}<br><br>I'm extremely saddened that two Air Force airmen were killed. But a<br>*mass shooting*? I don't think so.<br><br>- **Why do Nazi Trump supporters still defend the Second Amendment when<br>  it causes nothing but pain and death?**<br><br>I'm unsure what those three statements have to do with each other<br><br>- Nazi<br>- Trump supporter<br>- Supporter of the Second Amendment<br><br>I'm reasonably certain that not all Trump supporters are Nazis. Some may<br>be, but I'd guess that most are not. I'm also reasonably certain that<br>not all people who support the Second Amendment are Trump supporters,<br>nor are they members of the [[American Nazi<br>Party](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1e8ce0&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Nazi_Party){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. In fact, I think, dear<br>questioner, you'll have a hard time finding even one person who falls<br>into all three buckets above.<br><br>Let's assume, therefore, that you were just spouting hyperbole with the<br>whole "Nazi" thing and temporarily ignore it. So you're left with:<br><br>- **Why do Trump supporters still defend the Second Amendment when it<br>  causes nothing but pain and death?**<br><br>This one I can answer:<br><br>*Because it doesn't cause anything even close to pain and death.*<br><br>The vast majority of criminals aren't buying legal guns. So even if you<br>were to abolish the Second Amendment and make gun ownership illegal,<br>criminals will still buy guns, and they will still use guns. The only<br>people who won't are law-abiding citizens. Guns won't go away. They'll<br>just be the exclusive tool of the criminal and the mass shooter. They<br>won't get much harder to buy, either, since the black market will be the<br>exclusive place to purchase a gun. Remember, *if guns are outlawed, only<br>outlaws will have guns*.<br><br>Additionally, guns save more lives than they take. Even wildly incorrect<br>estimates say that roughly five times more lives are saved by guns than<br>are taken, and that's without a single shot being fired. So saying that<br>guns cause "nothing but pain and death" is inaccurate at best,<br>intentionally inflammatory at worst.<br><br>You should work on formulating better questions if you want good<br>answers.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-EmPaR){.citation_index} [[Fatal shooting occurs at Grand<br>Forks Air Force<br>Base](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f9bd13&url=https://www.grandforks.af.mil/News/Article/2203272/fatal-shooting-occurs-at-grand-forks-air-force-base/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="af.mil"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
