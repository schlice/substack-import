<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The actual problem here is that not everyone who calls themselves<br>*Christian* is actually saved.<br><br>A Christian who has been saved cannot lose his salvation. Most, if not<br>all, of what the Bible says happens to us when we receive Christ would<br>be invalid if salvation could be lost. Salvation is the gift of God, and<br>God's gifts are "irrevocable" (Romans 11:29). A Christian cannot be<br>un-newly created. The redeemed cannot be unpurchased. Eternal life<br>cannot be temporary. God cannot renege on His Word. Scripture says that<br>God cannot lie (Titus 1:2). God will "give you a new heart and put a new<br>spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a<br>heart of flesh." (Ezekiel 36:26 NIV). That new heart can *only* love<br>God. If that is true, seeing a Christian living in sin and hypocrisy<br>might cause us to question whether or not that heart has actually been<br>changed.<br><br>More evidence of the same thing is found elsewhere in the Bible. The<br>Bible says unequivocally that a true Christian will not live in a state<br>of continual, unrepentant sin (1 John 3:6). The Bible also says that<br>anyone who departs the faith is demonstrating that he was never truly a<br>Christian (1 John 2:19). He may have called himself Christian. He may<br>have been religious. He may have attended church, said the prayers, and<br>sang the songs. He may have put on a good show, *but he was never born<br>again by the power of God.* The redeemed of God belong "to him who was<br>raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God" (Romans<br>7:4). Nothing can separate a child of God from the Father's love (Romans<br>8:38--39). Nothing can remove a Christian from God's hand (John<br>10:28--29). God guarantees eternal life and maintains the salvation He<br>has given us. The Good Shepherd searches for the lost sheep, and, "when<br>he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home" (Luke<br>15:5--6). The lamb is found, and the Shepherd gladly bears the burden;<br>our Lord takes full responsibility for bringing the lost one safely<br>home.<br><br>> By their fruit you will recognize them (Matthew 7:16).<br><br>A good tree will not produce bad fruit. A bad tree will not produce good<br>fruit. So if you see good fruit, you know it comes from a good tree. A<br>person who calls themselves Christian who lives a sinful and<br>hypocritical life is likely not saved, despite his belief that he is.<br><br>TL,DR: A so-called Christian living in sin and hypocrisy may not<br>necessarily be saved in the first place.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
