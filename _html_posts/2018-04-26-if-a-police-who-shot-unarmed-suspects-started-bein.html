<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a police who shot unarmed suspects started being killed in<br>retribution by friends and family en masse, what would happen?**<br><br>It sounds like "your version" of what happened is all that matters.<br>However, the only person whose voice matters is the judge (and the jury<br>as one voice).<br><br>As we've said a bzillion times on Quora, ***unarmed does not equal not<br>dangerous***. Just because a person is unarmed does not mean that he<br>cannot cause grave bodily injury, and police are under no obligation to<br>incur grave bodily injury simply because a person is not in possession<br>of a physical weapon. If that were the case, and police were not<br>authorized to shoot anyone without a weapon, criminals would immediately<br>dump their weapons and they'd know that they could not be shot<br>(legally).<br><br>But that's all beside the point since that's not what you asked. You<br>asked what would happen if mobs of civilians started murdering police<br>officers because they felt that police actions (and court rulings) were<br>"unjust." It kills me when families get on television after a trial and<br>say that "justice was not served." What they really mean is that<br>*revenge* *was not served.* Justice was, however, served. If a fair<br>trial took place and the officer was found not guilty, then justice is<br>served. You may not like the outcome, but that's not the basis of<br>justice. The family is instead looking for a *pound of flesh* to atone<br>for the death of their relative. They want *retribution*, not *justice*.<br><br>So to answer the question: if mobs of civilians started murdering police<br>officers because they felt that police actions (and court rulings) were<br>"unjust," martial law would follow, and you'd really get to see what a<br>"police state" looked like.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
