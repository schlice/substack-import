<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Even those who have never heard the name Jesus have had the truth<br>written on their hearts. All people are accountable to God whether or<br>not they have "heard about Him."<br><br>The Bible tells us that God has clearly revealed Himself in nature<br>(Romans 1:20) and in the hearts of people (Ecclesiastes 3:11). The<br>problem is that the human race is sinful; we all reject this knowledge<br>of God and rebel against Him (Romans 1:21-23). If it were not for God's<br>grace, we would be given over to the sinful desires of our hearts, which<br>shows us how useless and miserable life is apart from Him. He does this<br>for those who continually reject Him (Romans 1:24-32).<br><br>He has given us free will so that we can freely choose Him, for love<br>must be freely given, it can never be coerced.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
