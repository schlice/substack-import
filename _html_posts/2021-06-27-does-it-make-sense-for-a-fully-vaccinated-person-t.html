<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You're asking a question about "what makes sense" and that answer varies<br>from person to person. Some fully-vaccinated people are so concerned<br>about "showing care for others" that they still wear masks in public<br>just to show that they are not a risk to others. Some got vaccinated but<br>believe that fully-vaccinated people can still carry the disease and<br>spread it to others, so they choose to wear a mask to forestall that<br>possibility.<br><br>So does it make sense? That's for each individual to decide for<br>themselves. I think masks will stick around for quite a while, as we<br>normalize the ability for each and every person to decide for themselves<br>what is best for them.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Does it make sense for a fully vaccinated person to wear a mask in<br>public indoor settings like supermarkets (I don\'t ask for an answer<br>from a legal standpoint)?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
