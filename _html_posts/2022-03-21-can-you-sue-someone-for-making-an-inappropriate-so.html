<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the United States, you can sue anyone for anything. So the only<br>question that remains is how likely are you to prevail.<br><br>And as with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>If you make an inappropriate song about *a specific child*, and you can<br>show that the child in question could be harmed by the song, you can sue<br>for the damage that will come to the child, as well as for defamation of<br>character.<br><br>If you make an inappropriate song about *unspecified children,* it's<br>unlikely that your lawsuit will prevail. There really aren't any decency<br>standards for music (except for broadcast music over the radio), so<br>saying that something is "inappropriate" is purely opinion. The last<br>attempt to do so was the Communications Decency Act of 1996, and much of<br>that was struck down so that only speech that was not subject to the<br>First Amendment was unlawful.<br><br>TL;DR: Most music is considered "artistic expression" or "artistic<br>works" and are thus protected under the First Amendment. It is unlikely<br>that suing someone for an inappropriate song would prevail, unless it is<br>an inappropriate song about a specific person.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can you sue someone for making an inappropriate song about a child?<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice. This answer is for GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.<br>Seek the advice of a licensed attorney in the appropriate jurisdiction<br>before taking any action that may affect your rights. If you believe you<br>have a claim against someone, consult an attorney immediately, otherwise<br>there is a risk that the time allotted to bring your claim may expire.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to legal questions are intended<br>third-party beneficiaries with certain rights under Quora's* [[*Terms of<br>Service*](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
