<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it possible to sue a store for discrimination for not letting me<br>shop there (with no explained reason)?**<br><br>You certainly can. It's unlikely you will prevail.<br><br>Why?<br><br>The store will come up with an excuse.<br><br>It will likely be something like you looked like a prohibited person. A<br>simple case of mistaken identity, that's all. A harmless accident.<br><br>Additionally, you can only sue for discrimination if the discriminating<br>reason is<br><br>1.  Something not prohibited by law (i.e. discrimination due to race,<br>    color, religion, sex, or national origin)<br>2.  Something not universally restricted (i.e. "no shoes, no shirt, no<br>    service" is legal discrimination against the shirtless and the<br>    shoeless).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
