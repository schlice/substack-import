<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Who has the burden of proof in a debate on the existence of God?<br><br>The burden of proof lies with the one making the claim.<br><br>So if I make the claim that God exists, I must back it up with some<br>evidence.<br><br>If you make the claim that God does not exist, you similarly must back<br>it up with evidence.<br><br>> What are some arguments that can be used in this regard?<br><br>I can only speak for making the claim that God exists. I can't prove<br>that God does not exist --- no one can. Author and philosopher Mortimer<br>Adler said, "An affirmative existential proposition can be proved, but a<br>negative existential proposition---one that denies the existence of some<br>thing---cannot be proved."<br><br>Making the claim that God exists involves using logic and reason<br>(inductive reasoning). Most of what we know today, we know through<br>inductive reasoning, or induction. And induction can never be 100%<br>proven, it can only be highly likely. Or as we say in the legal world,<br>true beyond a reasonable doubt.<br><br>To make the proof that God exists, you must first ask the right<br>question, and that question, the most basic question in the universe, is<br>*why am I here?* Why do I exist, instead of nothing at all? First of<br>all, I know I exist. I know I am not an illusion, and I know that I am<br>not self-existent (eternal). Therefore, my existence must have a<br>*cause*. Everything that has a beginning has a cause. Even the outspoken<br>atheist David Hume said, "I never asserted so absurd a proposition as<br>that something should arise without a cause." From that, we derive the<br>Law of Causality, which states that very principle: *everything that<br>has a beginning has a cause.*<br><br>So logically, what we know so far:<br><br>- Something exists.<br>- You can't get Something from nothing, and you are not self-caused.<br>- Therefore, some necessary and eternal entity caused us to exist.<br><br>Even the atheists do not deny this logic. They simply claim that the<br>universe is that eternal cause. However, to date, all scientific and<br>philosophical knowledge tells us that the universe had a beginning.<br>You've probably heard of the Big Bang, right? Yeah, that was the start<br>of the universe. And if it had a beginning, it had a cause, and is<br>therefore not eternal.<br><br>So continuing our logic from above:<br><br>- The only two sources of eternality are an eternal universe, or an<br>  eternal creator.<br>- The universe had a beginning, and is not eternal.<br>- Therefore, an eternal creator exists.<br><br>If you want to disprove one of these logical statements, you must do so<br>with evidence, as each of these statements has its own evidence.<br><br>You can come up with *hypotheses* about things like sources of<br>eternality (maybe the universe continually expands and contracts<br>eternally), but you must provide some evidence for this, since all<br>evidence to date says that the universe exploded into existence out of<br>nothing, and before that, nothing existed, not time, space, or matter.<br>So if you are going to say that something existed before the Big Bang,<br>you have to explain how Einstein's Theory of General Relativity is wrong<br>when it proves that all time began at the Big Bang.<br><br>So there you have it, a basic proof for the existence of a creator being<br>we call God. Now this doesn't say anything about the type of god it is,<br>or any other details, it's just the logical set of proofs which get us<br>to the point which proves that a god exists.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
