<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In the US, can a homeowners\' association be found grossly negligent<br>for theft if it fails to install surveillance cameras to deter crime?**<br><br>In general, no.<br><br>> Gross negligence is a conscious and voluntary disregard of the<br>> need to use reasonable care, which is likely to cause foreseeable<br>> grave injury or harm to persons, property, or both. It is conduct that<br>> is extreme when compared with ordinary negligence, which is a mere<br>> failure to exercise reasonable care.\[1\](#lSFGk){#cite-lSFGk<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>It is common knowledge that cameras might *deter* crime, but they do not<br>*prevent* "grave injury or harm to persons, property, or both." Failure<br>to install cameras, therefore, is not gross negligence.<br><br>Additionally, from an HOA perspective, a camera must be *monitored 24x7*<br>if you want it to function to deter crime. Therefore, the HOA would have<br>to pay a monitoring company to monitor your cameras, which would likely<br>substantially raise your dues.<br><br>Now, if you're willing to pay substantially higher dues, let your HOA<br>know that you're willing to absorb the cost and you want security<br>cameras and the monitoring company which will be required to monitor<br>those cameras. I presume the HOA would poll the membership to ensure<br>that *everyone* is willing to pay the increased dues. Not only periodic<br>dues would increased, but their may be a capital improvement outlay that<br>may be necessary in order to facilitate the infrastructure changes<br>necessary for a complete camera system, and the HOA may need to budget<br>that in to another year's budget, especially if they don't have a<br>capital expenditure reserve available to spend against.<br><br>However, failure to install surveillance cameras is not conduct which<br>rises to the level of gross negligence.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-lSFGk){.citation_index} [[gross<br>negligence](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b6f80c&url=https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/gross%2Bnegligence){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="thefreedictionary.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
