<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I wanted a U-Haul truck and allowed a friend to use it after I did.<br>She kept the truck for 7 days, can I sue her for the days she kept the<br>truck that needed to be paid for?**<br><br>In the United States, you can sue anyone for anything in small claims<br>court.<br><br>The question is whether or not you have a chance of recovering any of<br>your money. And that answer comes down to how you left it with her when<br>you let her use the truck.<br><br>- Did she know when the turn-in date was?<br>- Did she know she had to turn in the truck by that date?<br>- Did she know that you would continue to accrue charges for every day<br>  that she kept the truck?<br>- More importantly, did you make it clear to her that the truck was in<br>  fact due on that date and that you would be incurring continuous<br>  charges until it was turned in?<br><br>If you can prove that you made it clear to her that you would be<br>continuing to accrue charges for the entire time she had the truck, you<br>may be able to get her to reimburse you for the overage you paid during<br>her use of the truck.<br><br>If you can't prove it conclusively, you should at least be able to prove<br>that she *should have known* that a rental truck was, well, rented, and<br>that you were paying for it, and you should at least be able to get her<br>to pay *part* of the cost of the truck over those days.<br><br>So now, what does this all mean? I won't say that you'll be able to get<br>her to pay for 100% of the cost of the truck unless you had her sign an<br>agreement with you (which I'm certain you didn't do --- had I been in<br>that situation, I probably wouldn't have made her sign something<br>either). So you might be able to get part of the cost of the extra days<br>reimbursed, but I don't see you getting everything back.<br><br>Now, let's look at what this lawsuit will cost you: besides court costs,<br>you'll also lose a friend. You can't sue a friend and expect to stay<br>friends.<br><br>So: is getting reimbursement for *part* **of what those extra<br>days cost you worth losing a friend over?**<br><br>Maybe it's worth it to you, maybe it's not. That part is up to you. But<br>one thing is for certain: in my mind, it would have to be a lot of money<br>before I was willing to throw away a friendship over it.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.
