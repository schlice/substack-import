<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is suicide illegal and if it is, why?<br><br>*(US-only answer)*<br><br>Historically, most states in the US had suicide listed as a felony, but<br>it was very rarely enforced. It was illegal because people sometimes use<br>laws to try to influence behavior, so in order to try to prevent people<br>fro committing suicide, they made it illegal. But committing an illegal<br>act has far-reaching consequences for the survivors, so today, most<br>states have decriminalized the act of suicide, although as late as 2018,<br>a Maryland man was convicted of attempted suicide. In some states, it is<br>still considered to be a "common law crime," which means it still causes<br>issues for the decedent's family in recovering money in a lawsuit. But<br>most states have decriminalized it.<br><br>However, while it is technically not illegal to commit suicide, it is<br>most definitely a felony in nearly every state to "aid, advise or<br>encourage another person to die by suicide." A small handful of states<br>have decriminalized *physician-assisted suicide*. Oregon is one of these<br>states. In Oregon, a patient must be diagnosed as having less than six<br>months to live, be of sound mind, make a request orally and in writing,<br>have it approved by two different doctors, then wait 15 days and make<br>the request again. A doctor may prescribe a lethal dose of a medication<br>but may not administer it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
