<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can "Double Jeopardy" be a loophole for murder?<br><br>It was this very "loophole" which prompted the writer of the 1999 movie<br>*Double Jeopardy* starring Ashley Judd. In the movie, Judd's character<br>was arrested for the murder of her husband, a murder which she did not<br>commit. She was tried, convicted and sentenced. She served out her<br>sentence, but while in prison, she learned that her husband faked his<br>own death and framed her for the murder. The remainder of her prison<br>term became preparation for the time when she would get out and<br>*actually* murder him, in cold blood, in the middle of a crowded street,<br>a murder for which she had already been tried and convicted. According<br>to the writer, the *double jeopardy* rule would protect her because you<br>can't be tried for the same crime twice.<br><br>Except in reality, that's not exactly how it would happen.<br><br>In reality, crimes have an element of *time* associated with them. For<br>example, we know that if you are convicted of a crime, and then in a<br>year they remove that crime from the books, you still have to serve your<br>sentence for that crime, because *at the time of your action, that<br>action was illegal.* Crimes are associated with the time when they are<br>committed, and the punishments for those crimes are associated with when<br>they are committed.<br><br>In actuality, had the scenario from the movie played out, she would have<br>been arrested, tried and convicted for the *actual* murder, and gone<br>back to jail. The first conviction would have been chalked up as a<br>regrettable incorrect conviction.<br><br>Since the man was actually alive, instead of killing him, she should<br>have had him arrested for filing a false police report, and then sued<br>the living sh1t out of him, taking him and his new wife to the cleaners<br>(since she was apparently loaded).<br><br>But that doesn't make for a great movie plot.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
