<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You\'re right, in most cases, you\'ll be able to go about<br>your day without ever needing your permit.\<br>\<br>But then that begs the question: why are you carrying a gun in the first<br>place? Is it like a pendant that you keep inside your shirt? Only you<br>know it\'s there? You\'ll never show it to anyone? No one will see it<br>unless they see you remove your shirt?\<br>\<br>If, on the other hand, you carry a gun because you are preparing for the<br>worst, being ready in case you may need it, then you may run into<br>trouble. Because once you do use it, or even take it out (brandish it),<br>you now face your own investigation into why you had concealed a weapon<br>in the first place. You will be investigated each and every time you<br>brandish and/or use your weapon, even if you were completely legal in<br>your action. Even if you potentially stopped a mass shooting with your<br>weapon, you would still face weapons charges for unlawfully concealing a<br>weapon. The only way you *might* avoid prosecution is if public opinion<br>was so far in your favor that the DA declined to press charges. Other<br>than that, if you ever hope to actually *use* your weapon for more<br>than just a lump in your waistband, in doing so, you subject yourself to<br>prosecution.\<br>\<br>It\'s a hollow victory when you save your life or the life of another,<br>only to be prosecuted on weapons charges.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
