<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If we can never know for sure whether or not our surgeon is mentally<br>capable of performing our surgery, does it matter?<br><br>If we can never know for sure that our doctor has prescribed us the<br>exactly correct medication at the precise dosage, does it matter?<br><br>If we can never know for sure if the repair crew on our airliner has<br>really truly fixed the problem before we take off, does it matter?<br><br>If we can never know for sure that our pilot got his required 8 hours of<br>crew rest before flying our airplane, does it matter?<br><br>We expect the truth in so many areas of our lives. We expect to be told<br>the truth when we pick up a reference book, read an article, or watch a<br>news story; we want the truth from advertisers, teachers, and<br>politicians; we assume road signs, medicine bottles, and food labels are<br>actually telling us the truth. In fact, we demand the truth for almost<br>every facet of life that affects our money, relationships, safety, or<br>health.<br><br>On the other hand, despite our unwavering demands for truth in those<br>areas, many of us say we aren't interested in truth when it comes to<br>morality or religion.<br><br>There's a huge contradiction here. Why do we demand truth in everything<br>but morality and religion? Why do we say, "That's true for you but not<br>for me," when we're talking about morality or religion, but we never<br>even think of such nonsense when we're talking to a stock broker about<br>our money or a doctor about our health?<br><br>*Does the truth matter?*<br><br>Although few would admit it, our rejection of religious and moral truth<br>is often on volitional rather than intellectual grounds---we just don't<br>*want* to be held accountable to any moral standards or religious<br>doctrine. So we blindly accept the self-defeating truth claims of<br>politically correct intellectuals who tell us that truth does not exist;<br>everything is relative; there are no absolutes; it's all a matter of<br>opinion; you ought not judge; religion is about faith, not facts!<br>Perhaps Augustine was right when he said that we love the truth when it<br>enlightens us, but we hate it when it convicts us. Maybe we can't handle<br>the truth.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-b17cc3a302563441e6ee713541c2a473){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-b17cc3a302563441e6ee713541c2a473" master_w="604"<br>master_h="375"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>The truth is that absolute truth exists, it is knowable, and we can<br>know the truth about God. We may not be able to have 100% certainty, but<br>like our legal standards, we can be certain beyond *reasonable* doubt<br>(even if not beyond *all* doubt).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
