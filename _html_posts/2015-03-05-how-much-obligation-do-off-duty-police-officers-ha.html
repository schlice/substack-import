<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Police officers retain their arrest authority while they<br>are off-duty. Their obligation to protect and serve exists on and off<br>duty. This is why off duty police officers carry firearms. If they<br>witness a crime in progress within their jurisdiction, they are<br>similarly obligated to identify themselves and take action until on-duty<br>personnel can arrive and take over.\<br>\<br>Reserve police officers in my state, when not performing police duties,<br>are *civilians.* They do not have any arrest authority, and are<br>therefore enjoined from acting as peace officers when not on duty.<br>However, they do carry firearms, and their organizations get around the<br>legality of this by providing concealed weapons permits to reserve<br>police officers. Our organization prints the CWP on the back of our<br>police ID cards for our reserve officers. Since they are not active<br>peace officers when not on duty, reserve officers are simply advised to<br>be good witnesses, and with their inside knowledge of police procedures,<br>they generally make excellent witnesses. They would use their firearms<br>in the same way any armed civilian would at the time.\<br>\<br>Enforcing laws outside of your jurisdiction is always tricky, but<br>becomes even trickier if you\'re not on duty. Most organizations would<br>say that you have an obligation to step in if the crime being committed<br>is especially egregious, and waiting for local law enforcement to arrive<br>would create continuing unsafe conditions for the general public.<br>Otherwise, just be a good witness.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
