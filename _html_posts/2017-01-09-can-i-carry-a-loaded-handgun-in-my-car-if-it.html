<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: Yes, but as with everything, there are caveats.<br><br>In Virginia, a handgun must be \"properly secured in a container or<br>compartment within the vehicle\" (ie glove box, center console, trunk,<br>etc). The container or compartment does not have to be locked, the<br>firearm may be within the reach of the driver or a passenger, and the<br>firearm may be loaded.<br><br>For long guns, a \"county or city may by ordinance make it unlawful for<br>any person to transport, possess or carry a loaded shotgun or loaded<br>rifle in any vehicle on any public street, road, or highway within such<br>locality.\" This does not apply "to any person who reasonably believes<br>that a loaded rifle or shotgun is necessary for his personal safety in<br>the course of his employment or business.\" Of course, it also does not<br>apply to law enforcement.<br><br>Also in Virginia, a firearm may be considered \"open carry\" in a<br>vehicle if the firearm is openly visible, though the "container or<br>compartment" law has more legal run-time and is better-established law.<br>Therefore, I would suggest you put the firearm in a container or<br>compartment, such as the glove box, or center console.<br><br>[[Gun laws in Virginia -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b18194&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_Virginia){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
