<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Christians and Muslims are both human. They both live on Earth. They<br>have rights as human beings.<br><br>Oh, did you mean relating in terms of religion? Well, they both believe<br>that their religion is right and the other guy's religion is wrong. They<br>each believe that they will receive salvation and the other guy will<br>not. So they can both relate in that way. They both teach the existence<br>of angels and demons.<br><br>But in terms of their *religions*, they are pretty much diametrically<br>opposed.<br><br>Christianity believes things that Islam does not. For example,<br>Christianity believes that Christ died and was resurrected three days<br>later. Islam believes that Christ never died. Islam believes that Christ<br>was a prophet (a good one), and not deity. But as C.S. Lewis points out,<br>if Christ was not deity, then he was a really *bad* prophet, because he<br>claimed to be God. If he wasn't what he claimed to be, then he was<br>either crazy, or a liar. Hardly a good prophet.<br><br>We should all accept and respect people who have different beliefs than<br>we do. But we should not accept the insane notion that all religious<br>beliefs are true. Because contradictory religious beliefs exist, and<br>mutually exclusive beliefs cannot all be true, we should not pretend<br>that they are.<br><br>In fact, it could be dangerous to do so. If Christianity is true, then<br>it's dangerous to your eternal destiny to not be Christian. Similarly,<br>if Islam is true, then it's dangerous to your eternal destiny to not be<br>Muslim.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>In what ways do you think Christians can relate with Muslims?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
