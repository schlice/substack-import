<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What has the ACLU done to get In God We Trust off our government<br>buildings and currency and stop official prayers from being asked in<br>those same buildings?**<br><br>They have done as much as they can do, but they are fighting an uphill<br>battle.<br><br>Groups trying to remove the phrase from our currency have filed many<br>suits through the ACLU, and the firm has written many *amicus briefs*<br>supporting the removal of the phrase.<br><br>However, they have not been able to overcome the doctrine of<br>*accommodationism,* which is a doctrine which basically states that<br>governments can endorse religious groups so long as they do so equally.<br><br>Also, "In God We Trust" is our *national motto* and has been so since<br>1956. It's been in our national anthem as our "motto" since the poem was<br>penned in 1814 (although it wasn't actually adopted as our national<br>anthem until later). It's not much of an argument to say that you want<br>the national motto removed from the national currency because reasons.<br><br>I'm going to quote a section from Wikipedia just to show you how popular<br>the phrase is in the United States, and how trying to get it removed is<br>a literal fool's errand:<br><br>> According to a 2003 joint poll by USA Today, CNN, and Gallup, 90% of<br>> Americans support the inscription \"In God We Trust\" on U.S. coins.<br>><br>> In 2006, on the 50th anniversary of its adoption, the Senate<br>> reaffirmed \"In God We Trust\" as the official national motto of the<br>> United States of America.<br>><br>> In Florida House Bill no. 1145, Florida adopted \'In God We Trust\' as<br>> the official state motto, effective July 1, 2006.<br>><br>> In 2011 the House of Representatives passed an additional resolution<br>> reaffirming \"In God We Trust\" as the official motto of the United<br>> States, in a 396--9 vote.<br>><br>> In 2013, a federal court rejected a challenge, brought by Michael<br>> Newdow and the Freedom From Religion Foundation, to remove \"In God We<br>> Trust\" from American currency.<br>><br>> On January 31, 2014, purporting to defend religious freedom, the<br>> Mississippi senate voted to add the words, \"In God We Trust\" to the<br>> state seal and the change was made effective on July 1, 2014.<br>><br>> In 2015 the county police department of Jefferson County, Illinois<br>> announced that the words \"In God We Trust\" will be on police squad<br>> cars.<br>><br>> In 2015, the Freedom from Religion Foundation demanded that local<br>> authorities remove decals of the motto from Childress, Texas Police<br>> Department patrol vehicles. In response, Police Chief Adrian Garcia<br>> told the organization, in a written letter, to \"go fly a kite.\"<br>><br>> In March 2017, Act 911, sponsored by State Rep. Jim Dotson, made it a<br>> requirement of Arkansas state law for schools to display posters with<br>> the national motto (\"In God We Trust\").<br>><br>> Also in March, the same requirement was enacted in Kentucky schools<br>> for the 2019--2020 school year requiring the slogan to be displayed<br>> \"in a prominent location.\" To protest the requirement, Fayette<br>> County Public Schools (Kentucky) in Lexington, KY complied by posting<br>> a framed United States one-dollar bill which bears the slogan.<br>><br>> In early 2018, Kimberly Daniels, a pastor who currently serves as the<br>> representative for Florida House of Representatives District 14 as a<br>> member of the Democratic Party, introduced HB 839, a bill that<br>> requires public schools to display the motto \"In God We Trust\" in a<br>> conspicuous place. On Tuesday, January 23, 2018, the bill received<br>> unanimous approval from the House PreK-12 Innovation Subcommittee.<br>> Later, in a vote on February 21, 2018, the bill passed 97 to 10 in the<br>> House. As part of Florida\'s March 2018 K-12 education law, Gov. Rick<br>> Scott mandated that all public schools post the state motto (\"In God<br>> We Trust\") in a prominent location.<br>><br>> In March 2018, a bill requiring Tennessee schools to prominently<br>> display the national motto (\"In God We Trust\") sponsored by Rep.<br>> Susan Lynn passed the state House with 81 of the 99 members voting in<br>> favor of it.<br>><br>> In June 2019, the Bakersfield, California City Council voted 4--2 to<br>> put an \"In God We Trust\" sticker on the city\'s police and fire<br>> vehicles. The issue was debated for two hours by 19 people including a<br>> lawyer from the ACLU.<br>><br>> Also in 2019, South Dakota and Louisiana passed bills that require<br>> public schools to display the motto \"In God We Trust\".<br>><br>> On March 3, 2020, the Oklahoma House of Representatives passed a bill<br>> that would require public buildings in the state to display In God We<br>> Trust.<br>><br>> Later that year, on June 30, Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves signed<br>> into law a bill requiring that the state\'s flag, which had contained<br>> the Confederate battle emblem, be replaced with a new one containing<br>> the phrase \"In God we trust.\" Preliminary designs for the new flag<br>> are expected to be introduced to the public on September, 2020.<br>><br>> As of 2020 Kansas, Indiana, and Oklahoma are looking at similar<br>> bills.\[1\](#UZVRc){#cite-UZVRc .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-UZVRc){.citation_index} [[In God We Trust -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4cdd74&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_God_We_Trust){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
