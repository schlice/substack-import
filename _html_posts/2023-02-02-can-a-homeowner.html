<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, and usually the process is fairly tightly controlled.<br><br>In most HOAs, modifications to dues can only be discussed during a<br>Budget Meeting. In Florida, budget meetings must be a separate meeting<br>from a regular Board meeting or the Annual Meeting. During the Budget<br>meeting, the Board will distribute the annual budget¹ and will discuss<br>what costs they know will be changing. They'll discuss whether or not<br>the Board plans on absorbing those changes from operating reserves or<br>whether the need exists to raise dues.<br><br>They're not challenging conversations, and they're completely necessary.<br>In order to retain the accommodations that homeowners in that<br>neighborhood want, they have to be maintained, and that ongoing<br>maintenance must be paid for. Water (one of our biggest costs) changes<br>rates every year. Insurance costs go up, those increases must be paid<br>for.<br><br>We can always discuss eliminating amenities in order to reduce dues, but<br>not many people are really interested in removing the amenities they<br>currently enjoy.<br><br>\<br><br>¹ In Condo Associations in Florida, the annual budget must be delivered<br>to residents well before the meeting, something like 30 days. In<br>Homeowner's Associations in Florida, this requirement does not exist. We<br>still deliver a budget to homeowners before the meeting, usually around<br>48 hours before.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
