<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Sadly, it *is* just you. Because so many people conflate<br>\"increaing police budgets\" with \"militarizing the police\" that we<br>can\'t get any further funding for police. Costs go up, funding remains<br>flat. So we do the only thing we can: cut services. Increase the sectors<br>the fewer officers we have left have to patrol. In our county, we have<br>sectors where over 5,000 homes are served by TWO deputies. People are<br>unhappy with response times. Yet they continually vote against<br>increasing the police budget. Instead, they fund city park tennis court<br>renovations. Hey, I\'m all for pretty tennis courts. But at the expense<br>of an extra patrol officer?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-do-law-enforcement-officers-think-about-President-Obamas-decision-to-federally-fund-50-000-body-cameras-for-police-officers/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
