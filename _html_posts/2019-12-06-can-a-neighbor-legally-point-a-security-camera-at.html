If so, how can I stop it?**<br><br>*(US Answer Only)*<br><br>In the vast majority of cases, yes.<br><br>In general, if he can see it from his property, he can point a camera at<br>it. It's no different than if he stood at that point on his property and<br>looked at yours. Unfortunately, the security camera which can see into<br>your property can also be used for legitimate security purposes. Unless<br>he has it mounted to the fence and it *only* sees in your yard, he can<br>use it in his yard for lawful surveillance of his own property, even if<br>it *incidentally* captures your own yard.<br><br>In most jurisdictions, as far as looking *into* your home is concerned,<br>if his camera is in a lawful location on his own property, you need to<br>ensure that you are exercising your right to privacy inside your home by<br>drawing the blinds. Some jurisdictions *may* consider that a "peeping<br>Tom" violation, but most do not.<br><br>How can you stop it?<br><br>- Plant tall trees<br>- Install an infrared spotlight on the side of your house or garage<br>  pointing into his. It won't be visible to anyone but the camera, and<br>  it will blind the camera from seeing anything in your yard.<br><br>Or the most radical solution of all:<br><br>- Talk to your neighbor. Tell him that you don't mind that he's using a<br>  security camera, but you're concerned that it is looking into your<br>  yard. You are well aware that it's not technically illegal, but maybe<br>  he could find another vantage point to mount his camera that still<br>  accomplished his security needs without needlessly incidentally<br>  viewing your property.<br><br>\<br><br>Hi readers, I'm moving!
