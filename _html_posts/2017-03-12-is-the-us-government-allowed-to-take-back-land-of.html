<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question, but the Homestead Act did not<br>provide for any remaining ownership of land granted under it by the US<br>government. Once that land was given, it was deeded to the homesteader.<br>When you hold the deed and there are no riders on the deed, you own the<br>land. Period. To the best of my knowledge, the government did not retain<br>any ownership in the land deeded to homesteaders under the Homestead<br>Act.<br><br>Additionally, the Homestead Act was sunsetted by the Federal Land Policy<br>and Management Act of 1976. This officially ended homesteading in the<br>United States (except in Alaska, where it continued until 1986).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
