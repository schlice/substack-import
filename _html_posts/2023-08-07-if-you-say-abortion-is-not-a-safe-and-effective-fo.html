<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The question itself is a non-sequitur. The first part of the question is<br>completely unrelated to the second part of the question.<br><br>But I understand what you're trying to ask. You're asking why pro-life<br>people claim that abortion is not a safe and effective form of birth<br>control.<br><br>For now, I'll ignore the non-sequitur and try to answer your question.<br>In order to do that, we need to define how safe and effective *other*<br>forms of birth control are in relation to abortion. So let's do that.<br>Let's review all of the available forms of birth control, and let's talk<br>about how safe they are, and then how effective they are:<br><br>- *Coitus interruptus*: or in English, "pulling out." This form of birth<br>  control is mostly safe. As far as my research goes, no one has died<br>  from pulling out. Safety, however, includes other factors, such as<br>  prevention of sexually-transmitted infections (STIs). This method is<br>  completely ineffective at preventing STIs, so it cannot be considered<br>  to be completely safe. Effectiveness, however, varies, but on average,<br>  *coitus interruptus* is only about 80% effective at preventing<br>  pregnancy. The pre-ejaculate actually does contain sperm cells, so the<br>  possibility exists that pregnancy may still result even when<br>  intercourse is interrupted before climax. However, the main reason why<br>  *coitus interruptus* fails is when *coitus interruptus* becomes<br>  *coitus almostus interruptus.* Failing to pull out in time is the<br>  number one reason why the pull-out method fails.<br>- *Condom:* Condoms are also nearly 100% safe if used correctly (very<br>  few people in history have died from condom use, unless there was a<br>  previously undiagnosed latex allergy which isn't effectively treated),<br>  and if they are used *totally perfectly*, they are about 98%<br>  effective. Typical effectiveness is about 87%. This is usually due to<br>  the condom tearing during sex, or intercourse continuing following<br>  ejaculation causing the sperm to leak out.<br>- *Hormone-based birth control:* Hormonal birth control, when used<br>  perfectly, can be up to 99% effective at preventing pregnancy. In<br>  typical usage, however, it is only about 91% effective. For most<br>  healthy women, hormonal birth control is safe for long-term use. But<br>  for some women (especially women who smoke), hormonal birth control<br>  carries a risk of blood clots, which can cause pulmonary embolisms,<br>  heart attack or stroke.<br>- *Abortion:* Abortions are 0% effective at preventing pregnancy. They<br>  do prevent *birth*, so abortions are about 99% effective at preventing<br>  birth. They are not 100% effective, as there are cases of babies<br>  surviving the abortion process. In terms of safety, however, the<br>  numbers are not quite so encouraging. According to the World Health<br>  Organization, 60% of all unintended pregnancies end in an induced<br>  abortion. Around 45% of all abortions are unsafe, of which 97% take<br>  place in developing countries. Unsafe abortion is a leading -- but<br>  preventable -- cause of maternal deaths and morbidities. It can lead<br>  to physical and mental health complications and social and financial<br>  burdens for women, communities and health systems. 78,000 women die<br>  each year globally from unsafe abortions.<br><br>Therefore, we can say the following about abortion:<br><br>- Abortion is an *effective* method of birth control, at nearly 99%<br>  effectiveness.<br>- However, of all of the methods available, abortion carries the highest<br>  risk of complications, so therefore, we cannot say that it is a *safe*<br>  method of birth control.<br><br>There are other methods of birth control which are just as effective and<br>much more safe than abortion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
