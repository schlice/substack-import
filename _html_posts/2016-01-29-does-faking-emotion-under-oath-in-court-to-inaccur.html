Therefore, perjury is more specifically focused on facts<br>related to questions you are asked.<br><br>You can be as much of a drama queen as you like on the stand. If it<br>sways the jury, all\'s the better. But it\'s not a lie to fake emotion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
