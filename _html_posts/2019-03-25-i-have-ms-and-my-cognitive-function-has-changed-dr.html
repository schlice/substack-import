<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I have MS and My cognitive function has changed dramatically yet there<br>are no changes on my MRI. How can this happen? Is there any treatment<br>for it?**<br><br>Thanks for your question.<br><br>Cognitive changes (such as the ability to learn and remember<br>information, organize, plan and problem-solve, focus, maintain and shift<br>attention, understand and use language, accurately perceive the<br>environment, and perform calculations) are common in MS. More than half<br>of all people diagnosed with MS will experience some cognitive change.<br><br>Certain areas of cognition are more likely to be impacted than others by<br>the MS disease course:<br><br>- Information processing (dealing with information gathered by the five<br>  senses)<br>- Memory (acquiring, retaining and retrieving new information)<br>- Attention and concentration (particularly divided attention)<br>- Executive functions (planning and prioritizing)<br>- Visuospatial functions (visual perception and constructional<br>  abilities)<br>- Verbal fluency (word-finding)<br><br>Cognitive changes are not correlated with other disease activity. People<br>with mild motor function changes can have a great deal of cognitive<br>changes, while people with severe motor function issues may have very<br>little cognitive impairment. What we do know about cognitive changes:<br><br>- Changes can occur at any time --- even as a first symptom of MS ---<br>  but are more common later in the disease.<br>- Cognitive function correlates with number of lesions and lesion area<br>  on MRI, as well as brain atrophy.<br>- Cognitive dysfunction can occur with any disease course, but is<br>  slightly more likely in progressive MS.<br>- You are more likely to experience cognitive dysfunction (the first<br>  signs or new changes) during an exacerbation.<br>- Cognitive changes generally progress slowly. They are unlikely to<br>  improve dramatically once they have begun.<br><br>Now, on to what you can do.<br><br>First thing, talk to your neurologist! There are a great deal of<br>interventions that can be implemented which will assist your cognitive<br>functioning. And based on what we know about the growing science of<br>[neuroplasticity(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4ddb25&url=https://www.thebestbrainpossible.com/your-life-shapes-your-brain/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="thebestbrainpossible.com"}]{.qlink_container}, there is a<br>chance that the brain can be "re-wired" to work around the damaged<br>areas, and to basically learn new ways to function.<br><br>However, with all of this, cognitive changes are not routinely discussed<br>or adequately treated. This is one of the major "unmet" areas of MS<br>treatment, because people tend to not talk about it with their<br>neurologists.<br><br>Your neurologist will order a series of cognitive tests to evaluate your<br>cognitive ability and make recommendations on rehabilitation, which<br>includes a combination of restorative and compensatory<br>activities.<br><br>> Restorative activities can include learning and memory exercises:<br>><br>> - Combine modes of learning: You will be more likely to remember<br>>   something if you "see it, say it, hear it, write it, do it." It's<br>>   okay to give yourself extra time.<br>> - Repeat & verify: Repeat what you hear and verify that it is<br>>   correct to improve your attention and memory.<br>> - Spaced rehearsal: Repeat and practice information at intervals<br>>   spread out over time to improve your ability to store information.<br>> - Build associations: Use memory aids! For example, to remember<br>>   the name of someone you just met, associate her/his name with a<br>>   friend or family member of the same name, or with a place, color or<br>>   event that sounds like the new name.<br>><br>> Compensatory activities that help make up for functions that are<br>> no longer working well may include:<br>><br>> - Consolidate and centralize! Designate one place in your home as<br>>   the "Grand Central" information center. Include your master<br>>   calendar, mail, bills, phone messages, to-do lists, keys, wallet,<br>>   shopping lists and more.<br>> - Plan: Post a calendar large enough to display everyone's<br>>   appointments, activities and social engagements, and reminders! Keep<br>>   pens or markers hanging right beside it. Or use a computer program<br>>   set up with reminders for routine tasks (synchronize it with your<br>>   mobile devices so you have your appointments with you while on the<br>>   go).<br>> - Record: Dictate your to-do list, notes or other things to<br>>   remember on a digital voice recorder (available on many phones).<br>> - Remind: Use checklists, the alarm on your watch or phone, your<br>>   kitchen timer, and more.<br>> - Eliminate or remove yourself from distractions. Turn off the TV,<br>>   music and whatever else is "on" when speaking with someone in person<br>>   or on the phone. Background visual and noise distractions can make<br>>   learning or remembering more difficult. If you can't eliminate the<br>>   distraction (for example, people talking at a party) then ask, "Can<br>>   we talk in a quieter place?"<br>> - Take a break. If you are having difficulty concentrating, take a<br>>   breath and refresh.<br>> - Do one thing at a time. Avoid switching back and forth from one<br>>   topic or task to another. Finish or find an appropriate stopping<br>>   place in what you're working on before you switch to something<br>>   else.\[1\](#zGzrV){#cite-zGzrV .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-zGzrV){.citation_index} [[Cognitive<br>Changes](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=869adf&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms/Cognitive-Changes){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
