<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You've got a lot of answers here, and *most* of them are right.<br><br>Ultimately, whether or not they can do this depends on *why* they are<br>asking you to change the windows.<br><br>- If the reason is, as you say, simply because the windows are old,<br>  then there must be some clause in the Governing Documents which states<br>  that homes can only have windows newer than X years old and the HOA<br>  can make you change them.<br>- The reason may also be because the windows *look old*. Remember that<br>  it is in, in fact, the HOA's job to maintain the look of the<br>  neighborhood. And if your windows look *obviously old* and are<br>  objectively an eyesore (which I doubt, but the HOA could make that<br>  case), they might be able to make you update them. At least the ones<br>  in the front of the house, anyway.<br><br>Whatever reason they cite must be something that they are allowed to<br>regulate. If they are not allowed to regulate whatever their reason they<br>cite because the governing documents do not specifically support that<br>reason, then they cannot force you to do so using that reason.<br><br>But be prepared for a legal fight if they persist. The only way to stop<br>them from forcing you is with the help of a lawyer.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
