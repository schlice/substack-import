<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How does your home owner\'s association handle meetings?<br><br>For our HOA (as is the norm for most moderately-sized HOAs), the meeting<br>date, time, and location is publicized to all the owners, usually on a<br>website or bulletin. Homeowners are all invited to attend the monthly<br>meetings. The Board can go into "executive session" if they are going to<br>discuss matters pertaining to individual homeowners, so as to maintain<br>privacy. Only Board members are allowed to attend executive session<br>portions of meetings.<br><br>Once a year, we hold an Annual Meeting and review the budget, priorities<br>for the year, and futures. We will also vote on new Board members. All<br>homeowners are invited to the Annual Meeting, which we usually hold in a<br>nearby school gymnasium or meeting area. We will send out proxy cards in<br>advance of the meeting if you can't attend but you want your vote to<br>count. You can proxy your vote to any Board member, or the Board<br>President by default.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
