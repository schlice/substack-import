It's not a crime that occurred *before* the creation of<br>the Special Prosecutor.<br><br>But Mueller is not really directly going after Cohen because he lied to<br>Congress. Of course, he's prosecuting that crime, but that's not what<br>he's after.<br><br>He's trying to build a case.<br><br>He's trying to establish that very tenuous link between Trump and the<br>Russians in the run-up to the election.<br><br>Trump did have a plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow in 2016. Those<br>plans were scuttled before the Iowa caucus. Michael Cohen lied to<br>Congress about his involvement with those plans.<br><br>We can see that Mueller is beginning to create a narrative through his<br>investigation and through the ancillary charges he is filing.<br><br>But was this particular charge a *game-changer?*<br><br>Most definitely not.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
