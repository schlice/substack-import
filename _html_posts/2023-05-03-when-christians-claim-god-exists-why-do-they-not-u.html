<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because the proof that convinced *me* isn't the proof that will convince<br>*you*.<br><br>Tell me the kind of proof you're looking for, and we can discuss it.<br><br>Some things you're simply never going to prove. If you're looking for<br>*physical, empirically-testable* proof that a creator God exists, you're<br>never going to find it, as God exists outside of the physical,<br>empirically-testable realm.<br><br>But that does not mean that there is not scientific proof that God<br>exists. It does mean that you can't narrow your terminology so much that<br>you specifically exclude the kinds of proof which prove an unseen<br>creator God exists.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
