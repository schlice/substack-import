I need<br>my 83yr young Mom, a long time sufferer, to consider new medications.<br>Her speech is being affected and I think she could benefit from new<br>medications.**<br><br>Thanks for your question,<br>[Marcia(https://www.quora.com/profile/Marcia-Lupo-1)]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>MS treatment from the 60s to today are like the most polar opposites you<br>can think of. Fire and ice. Wet and dry. Old and new. I have answered a<br>similar question<br>[previously(https://www.quora.com/What-advances-have-been-made-in-the-treatment-of-Multiple-Sclerosis/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container},<br>but I'll answer here as well.<br><br>In the 60s, we didn't have any medications which actually treated the<br>disease itself. We could only treat the symptoms caused by relapses when<br>they happened, and we didn't even do that effectively. We had steroids<br>for the inflammation during a relapse, and we could treat the symptoms<br>individually, but we had nothing to actually touch the disease. In the<br>60s, the disease advanced unfettered.<br><br>Then, we had a revolutionary breakthrough, and things took off.<br><br>In the 90's, a class of drugs formerly used to treat cancer patients was<br>approved to treat MS. That class of drugs is called *interferons*. Two<br>interferons, interferon-1A and interferon-1B (based on the original<br>proteins from which they are derived) were marketed as Avonex and<br>Betaseron respectively. This was the first time we had a medication<br>which could actually slow down the progression of the disease and lessen<br>its impact. This was revolutionary in the treatment of the disease.<br><br>But its effects were limited. Interferons only seemed to be effective on<br>relapsing forms of the disease, and efficacy (how effective the drug is)<br>was not wonderful. Those with progressive forms of the disease were<br>still out of luck.<br><br>We have advanced even further since then. We now have some medications<br>which are approved to treat progressive forms of MS. We even have one<br>medication specifically designed for a symptom of MS (Ampyra is<br>specifically designed to help MS patients who have difficulty walking),<br>and that's a first. All of our other treatments for symptoms were<br>originally targeted at other diseases.<br><br>Our medications have advanced beyond interferons. We have synthetic<br>proteins (Copaxone) and medications which prevent immune cells from<br>crossing the blood-brain barrier (Tysabri). We have oral medications now<br>(Tecfidera, Aubagio, Gilenya), rather than just intra-muscular (IM) or<br>sub-cutaneous (SC) injectables. The aforementioned Tysabri is an<br>infusion, administered at an infusion center every four weeks. The<br>newest infusion-based medication (Ocrevus) is administered by infusion<br>once every six months.<br><br>This is all great news for MS patients. However, I want to caution you.<br>Our suite of MS medications only slows down the progression of the<br>disease and lessens the impact of relapses. It does nothing to reverse<br>the disease course. We can't yet rebuild myelin or remove the plaques<br>(scleroses) on nerve fibers. If there is significant gliosis (damage) to<br>oligodendrocytes, we cannot reverse that damage. And while this may be<br>challenging to hear, it's unlikely that at your mother's age, starting<br>on a new regimen of MS medication (which comes with a whole host of side<br>effects and risk factors) would be seen as beneficial.<br><br>Clearly, this is something that your mother should discuss with her<br>neurologist, but I would be remiss if I didn't warn you what the answer<br>will likely be.<br><br>That said, we have plenty of advanced treatments to help with symptoms,<br>and like I mentioned, Ampyra is approved to treat walking issues in MS<br>patients. So while our MS treatments themselves may not be appropriate,<br>there have been incredible advances in treating the symptoms of the<br>disease, and she may benefit from those treatments in easing her<br>symptoms. There have also been advances in speech therapy, and she may<br>benefit from a visit to a Speech and Language Pathologist (SLP) to help<br>her work through her speech issues. Even if they can't treat the damaged<br>area of the brain, other areas of the brain will frequently take up the<br>slack --- with training and therapy. A SLP can help with that.<br><br>Despite what I've said, this is not a diagnosis. It's still worth<br>her time to discuss these new medications and treatments with her<br>neurologist, and for her to learn how they might help her live better<br>with MS.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
