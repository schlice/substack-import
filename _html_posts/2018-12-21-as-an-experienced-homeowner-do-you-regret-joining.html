<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**As an experienced homeowner, do you regret joining a HOA (Homeowners<br>Association)?**<br><br>First of all, you don't "join" an HOA. You buy a house in a community<br>which is controlled by an HOA. If you buy that house, you have no choice<br>but to join. You can't "opt out" of he HOA.<br><br>No one likes being told that they did something wrong. And no one enjoys<br>violating the rules. HOAs get a bad reputation because it seems that<br>most of the time, you don't hear from them unless you've done something<br>wrong.<br><br>But if you know the rules and you live by them, HOAs serve a valuable<br>purpose. They keep home values high. They do this by making sure that<br>your neighbors don't trash their houses, and they charge them money when<br>they do.<br><br>Everyone buying a house in a covenant controlled community should be<br>fully aware of what they're getting into. You have to sign the covenants<br>when you buy your house, and you get a paper copy of the R&R (Rules and<br>Regulations) and the P&P (Policies and Procedures) for your<br>neighborhood. In Colorado, we separated those documents. In most states,<br>it's one document: the PPR&R (Policies, Procedures, Rules &<br>Regulations). You also get the covenants, which are on file with the<br>city or county.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
