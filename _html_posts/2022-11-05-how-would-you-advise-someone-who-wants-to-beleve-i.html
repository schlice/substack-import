<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think such a person should do a lot of serious soul-searching.<br><br>- Why do they "want to believe" in God?<br>- What is stopping them from believing in God?<br><br>God's never going to be overt about Himself, because He gave us free<br>will. He wants us to love Him willingly. He never wants to coerce us<br>into belief, or love. So He has left enough evidence in this life to<br>convince anyone *willing to believe,* but He has also left just enough<br>ambiguity so as to not compel the unwilling.<br><br>So it's not about God. God is unchanging. It's about us. If we don't<br>believe, it's because we choose to not believe.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
