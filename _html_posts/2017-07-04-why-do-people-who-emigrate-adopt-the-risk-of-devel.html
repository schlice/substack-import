<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's clarify a little.<br><br>Epidemiological studies have shown that you take on the risk of the new<br>region in *your* lifetime if you move to that region before age 15. The<br>new risk will be seen in the *next generation* if you move to the region<br>beyond age 15.<br><br>This may mean that by the time you turn 15, the risk factors for<br>developing MS are already fixed in your body. Either you have them and<br>are at higher risk, or you don't and you are at lower risk. Don't forget<br>that people primarily develop MS between ages 20 and 50.<br><br>Geographically-speaking, this age also correlates very closely with the<br>age at which increased levels of Vitamin D no longer provide significant<br>prophylaxis against MS. In other words, you needed significant Vitamin D<br>levels before age 16 for it to provide some prophylaxis against the<br>disease. So it's possible that there could be a correlation between<br>where you grow up and how much Vitamin D is generated by your skin in<br>that region. This has yet to be confirmed, though.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
