<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [At 22, you are a legal adult in the UK.\<br>\<br>Your dad is under no obligation to permit you to continue to live at his<br>house once you have reached the age of majority, which is 18 in the UK.\<br>\<br>It\'s time to either move out, or sign a lease agreement with your dad<br>whereby you pay him rent to continue to live there. At that point, you<br>have some legal rights, but without a lease agreement, you have none.<br>You live there at the pleasure of the homeowner, who can evict you at<br>any time.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
