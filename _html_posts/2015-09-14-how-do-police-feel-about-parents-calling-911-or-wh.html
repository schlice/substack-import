<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The 911 system is reserved for true emergencies. This is<br>why 911 operators answer the phone with \"911, do you have an emergency<br>to report?\" Calling 911 when you do not have an emergency to report is<br>not only illegal, but keeps a 911 operator from answering the call for a<br>true emergency, potentially delaying emergency response for a true<br>emergency.\<br>\<br>Parents should also not use the police as their parental crutch. They<br>should learn to be better parents, not teach their kids to be afraid of<br>the police.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
