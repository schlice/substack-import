<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is yes they can, so long as there is a valid reason for them<br>to do so.<br><br>For example, Governing Documents may require that the owner use their<br>home in the HOA as a primary residence, especially if that HOA disallows<br>rentals, or only allows rentals with Board approval. In that case, it<br>would be appropriate, if questions were to arise, that the HOA ask for<br>proof that the owner actually lives at the residence.<br><br>How the HOA plans on validating that the owner actually lives at the<br>residence, I cannot say, nor can I say what evidence the HOA would find<br>acceptable.<br><br>So while I think the rule is problematic to enforce, there is nothing<br>inherently wrong with an association having a rule which says that<br>owners must use their homes as their own primary residence, and thus<br>demanding some form of proof validating the same.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
