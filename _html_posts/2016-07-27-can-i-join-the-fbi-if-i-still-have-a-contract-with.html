<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Question details:*<br>><br>> *If I had a bachelor's degree and signed an 8 year contract with the<br>> military (6 active and 2 inactive) and already finished the 6 active<br>> years and now I'm inactive. The military already told me it shouldn't<br>> be a problem, but will the FBI allow me to join or do I have to finish<br>> the other 2 years?*<br><br>You can join the FBI if you are a member of the Inactive Reserve. You<br>can also join the FBI if you are a member of the Active Reserve as well<br>(i.e. one weekend a month, two weeks over the summer).<br><br>Bear in mind that if the United States goes to full-scale war and we<br>begin activating Reservists, you could be activated. You would follow<br>all of the protocols that any Active Reservist would follow. You will<br>maintain your position in the FBI for as long as they can afford to<br>leave your position vacant. They do have the authority to backfill your<br>position, and when you return from Active Duty, you must then be given<br>an equivalent position at an equivalent grade (not the same position)<br>with equivalent pay and no loss of time in service or benefits.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
