<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In 19 states, you must have insurance, regardless of how much money you<br>have.<br><br>In 31 states, you can purchase a surety bond in lieu of insurance, which<br>pays out up to its face value if you are at fault in an accident. The<br>amount of the bond you need to carry varies by state. If the bond pays,<br>you have to pay the money back into the bond, with interest. But on the<br>plus side, the bond is associated with the driver, not the car, so you<br>can drive any car with a surety bond.<br><br>Only two states (NH and VA) allow you to drive without any insurance.<br>But in New Hampshire, you can expect to pay up to \$50,000 for<br>liabilities and \$25,000 for property damage if you are at fault, and<br>they will suspend your license until you do, if you elect to not carry<br>insurance. So hopefully, you have enough money laying around. In<br>Vermont, you can drive without insurance if you pay a fee of \$500 per<br>year. However, drivers are still responsible for the damages they cause<br>in an accident, and that can rack up really quickly.<br><br>Also, fleet owners who own more than 25 vehicles can be self-insured.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Do you legally need car insurance if you have enough money?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
