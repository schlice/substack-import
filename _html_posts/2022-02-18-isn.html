<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, it certainly would be strange...if it were true.<br><br>Would you happen to have a tally of "offenses" committed by each that<br>you might be able to share with us?<br><br>Then, after you do that, ask yourself: *by whose standards are you<br>judging "offenses?"* Are they *your* standards? The standards of today's<br>society? Or are they God's standards?<br><br>In other words, it's up to you to declare the source of your morality, a<br>morality which must apply equally to God and man, such that you can find<br>God lacking.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Isn\'t it strange that the benevolent God actually commits more offenses<br>than the evil Satan throughout the Bible?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
