<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The name for the real system which uses hydrogen and oxygen in the air,<br>and incites an exothermic reaction resulting in heat and water is called<br>a "fuel cell." [[Fuel cell<br>vehicles](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=10f1dd&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell_vehicle){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} have already been<br>produced and sold.<br><br>Some of the problems with fuel cell vehicles:<br><br>- Hydrogen infrastructure. As of March, 2016, there were only 23<br>  publicly-accessible hydrogen refueling stations in the United States,<br>  and 20 of them were in California.<br>- Sustainability. While hydrogen is definitely clean to use, it is not<br>  necessarily clean to produce. Sometimes, hydrogen is the by-product of<br>  natural gas production, and if it is bottled and distributed, its<br>  actual production impact is negligible. And even better, hydrogen can<br>  be produced and bottled right at the fueling station using<br>  electrolysis or other methods to split water atoms and produce<br>  hydrogen. Currently, the challenge is getting the cost of such<br>  equipment low enough that the cost of selling hydrogen offsets the<br>  cost of producing it and makes it a competitive alternative to fossil<br>  fuels.<br>- Energy loss. Volkswagen\'s Rudolf Krebs said in 2013 that \"no matter<br>  how excellent you make the cars themselves, the laws of physics hinder<br>  their overall efficiency. The most efficient way to convert energy to<br>  mobility is electricity.\" He elaborated: \"Hydrogen mobility only<br>  makes sense if you use green energy\", but you need to convert it<br>  first into hydrogen \"with low efficiencies\" where \"you lose about<br>  40 percent of the initial energy\". You then must compress the<br>  hydrogen and store it under high pressure in tanks, which uses more<br>  energy. \"And then you have to convert the hydrogen back to<br>  electricity in a fuel cell with another efficiency loss\". Krebs<br>  continued: \"in the end, from your original 100 percent of electric<br>  energy, you end up with 30 to 40 percent. This is not the same sort of<br>  efficiency you get from fossil fuels.\[1\](#BsGmq){#cite-BsGmq<br>  .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-BsGmq){.citation_index} [[Fuel cell<br>vehicle](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=10f1dd&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell_vehicle){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
