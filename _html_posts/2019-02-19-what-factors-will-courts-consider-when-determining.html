<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What factors will courts consider when determining whether Trump's<br>emergency declaration to build a wall is constitutional?**<br><br>This will be a quick case.<br><br>It's highly unlikely that the courts will rule the National Emergencies<br>Act is unconstitutional. Let's take a brief look at the history of the<br>National Emergencies Act.<br><br>Presidents were declaring national emergencies well before the National<br>Emergencies Act was passed, but those emergencies were *endless*, and<br>the President was assuming power that he did not have, but no one<br>stopped him because *he's the President*. This is partly because we in<br>the United States have elevated the Presidency to such a level that we<br>basically have, almost, an elected king. Did we mean to do this? Some<br>may have, but I think it's mostly unintentional. Regardless, presidents<br>assume authority they do not have, and if no one stops that President<br>from doing so, then presidents will continue to assume that authority,<br>unchecked. This happened with sending troops places because he's the<br>Commander in Chief, even though Congress is supposed to be able to<br>declare wars. So Congress passed the War Powers Act to check the<br>President, and add some procedure around limited Presidential<br>deployments and reporting back to Congress later.<br><br>When it came to national emergencies, Congress did the same thing in<br>writing the National Emergencies Act. They put in place some mandatory<br>reporting requirements, and gave themselves a way to limit national<br>emergencies by giving Congress the ability to review active national<br>emergencies and to end them with a joint resolution. However, in doing<br>so (both with the War Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act),<br>Congress essentially provided the legal framework under which presidents<br>are *authorized under law* to declare national emergencies. To that end,<br>Congress essentially *legalized* and *codified* the process to declare<br>national emergencies.<br><br>Congress also delegated certain Congressional powers to the President to<br>use during periods of national emergency. They wrote those powers into<br>the law. There are approximately 470 Federal laws which contain<br>provisions which a president can activate during time of war or declared<br>national emergency. Over 130 specific powers are granted to the<br>president to use during those national emergencies. Congress did not<br>put any guardrails around the President in his ability to declare a<br>national emergency. They give wide latitude to the President to<br>determine when a national emergency is necessary.<br><br>Presidents have other things they can do besides declaring national<br>emergencies, also codified in law. They can declare "public health<br>emergencies" which release certain money to the Department of Health and<br>Human Services. They can declare areas of "natural disaster" which<br>releases money to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), among<br>a few other things codified in law that presidents can do without<br>Congressional approval.<br><br>Since the National Emergencies Act was passed, presidents since Carter<br>have declared 54 national emergencies, 28 of which are still active.<br><br>The argument they are trying to make now is that Congress allotted a<br>certain amount of money to the border barrier, and Trump is using his<br>declaration of a national emergency to bypass Congress and get more<br>money for something the people do not want, and this is an<br>unconstitutional allocation of money, which is not allowed under Article<br>I.<br><br>However, there is a strong case to be made that the President is<br>specifically aiding the military in their counterdrug and illegal<br>immigration issue on the southern border, which is a different mission<br>than the one for which Congress allocated funding. Additionally,<br>Congress already granted this authority under the National Emergencies<br>Act, and now that he is doing something they don't approve of, they want<br>to declare it unconstitutional.<br><br>If there is a strong odor of abuse of power with a president<br>overstepping his authority in using the National Emergencies Act when<br>Congress wouldn't give him enough money, there is just as strong an odor<br>of bad faith in Congress wanting to declare the National Emergencies Act<br>unconstitutional just because a president is doing something they don't<br>like.<br><br>The correct thing for Congress to do is to impeach the President for<br>abusing his power, not to try to go through the courts to declare<br>unconstitutional a law that they wrote. I think they're not going to be<br>happy with the results.<br><br>But why go this route instead of impeachment? This Democratic House<br>*just can't give Trump a win*. They simply cannot allow him to build the<br>wall. If he gets this campaign promise enacted, he is virtually<br>guaranteed to win re-election in 2020. If he gets this, he's a shoo-in<br>for a second term. The only way the Democrats have a shot at re-taking<br>the White House in 2020 is to deny him the wall.<br><br>Oh, don't misunderstand. They will impeach him anyway, right before the<br>2020 elections. My crystal ball says that Mueller will release his<br>findings in the summer of 2020, and the Democrats will have Articles of<br>Impeachment passed through the House by September. They're hoping, of<br>course, that the specter of impeachment will cast enough of a cloud over<br>Trump that they can pull out a win.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
