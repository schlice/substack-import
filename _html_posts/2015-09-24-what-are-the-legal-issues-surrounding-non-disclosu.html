<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Okay, you stated that your spouse did not disclose that<br>she was previously married.\<br>\<br>*What difference would this fact make in any jurisdiction?*\<br>\<br>The only issue I can think of is if the previous marriage was not<br>properly dissolved in accordance with state law. If it was not, then the<br>current marriage may be invalid because she was still legally married<br>somewhere else.\<br>\<br>However, if the previous marriage was legally dissolved correctly, the<br>woman is free to marry again. I can\'t really think of any other legal<br>ramifications.\<br>\<br>If you\'re talking about a state which has fault-based divorce, are you<br>asking if this would be grounds for divorce? It would depend on the<br>state and the rules for what grounds on which a divorce can be<br>petitioned. But I don\'t know of any state that lists \"non-disclosure<br>of previous marriage\" as grounds for divorce.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
