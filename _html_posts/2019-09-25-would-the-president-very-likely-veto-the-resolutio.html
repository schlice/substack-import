<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would the President very likely veto the resolution that was just<br>approved by the U.S. Senate to end Trump\'s border emergency<br>declaration?**<br><br>Yes. The President is expected to veto the resolution ending the<br>national emergency at the southern border.<br><br>Additionally, the Senate passed that resolution 54--41, which is not<br>enough to overcome that Presidential veto.<br><br>So it looks like the national emergency at the southern border will not<br>be stopped by Congress.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
