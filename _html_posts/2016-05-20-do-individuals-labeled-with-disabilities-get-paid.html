<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you are asking as a matter of law, the answer is no. Disabled people<br>do not get paid less because they are "labeled" as disabled.<br><br>If you are asking as a practical matter, then it's possible that a<br>disabled person may not get the same job opportunities or the same<br>promotion opportunities because they were labeled as disabled and some<br>manager believes that the disabled person is somehow unworthy of the<br>additional pay or position. This would also be something not based on<br>any actual job performance. The job performance would be the same as<br>their fully-abled counterparts, but somehow they would be paid less.<br><br>This, by the way, in the United States, is highly illegal and opens the<br>employer up to massive lawsuits for violating the Americans with<br>Disabilities Act.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
