<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is NFL players\' ability to take a knee at games a constitutionally<br>protected right?**<br><br>There is a fine line we walk here. The First Amendment only applies to<br>the government making laws which restrict your right to free speech.<br>Your employer, on the other hand, can absolutely discipline you for your<br>speech if they don't like it, up to and including termination if they so<br>desire.<br><br>Of course, it gets a little more dicey if the government *is* your<br>employer, so there are rules and tests courts use for Federal employees<br>to determine whether or not their speech is protected.<br><br>But in this case, an NFL player is an employee of a private corporation,<br>and that corporation has the absolute right to determine exactly what<br>behaviors you will exhibit while you are working for them.<br><br>So in summary:<br><br>- *Do you have the Constitutional right to take a knee during the<br>  National Anthem?* *Yes, you do.*<br>- *Do you have the right to be free from consequences from your employer<br>  for exercising your First Amendment rights while on the job?* ***No,<br>  you do not.***<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
