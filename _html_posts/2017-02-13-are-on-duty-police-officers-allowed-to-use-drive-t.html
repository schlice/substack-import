<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is generally left to the discretion of the officer. Most<br>departments do not expressly forbid officers from using drive-thru<br>lanes. However, understand that if an officer is getting a meal, he is<br>on a meal break, specifically released from receiving calls, and other<br>officers are covering any calls received in his sector while he is away.<br>So being stuck in the drive-thru line isn't an issue, since the officer<br>will not be receiving calls during that time.<br><br>Officers have to use far more discretion these days, as fast food can<br>all too easily be intentionally contaminated:<br><br>[[Ohio Officer Hospitalized After Finding Glass in His<br>Food](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4bf3c4&url=http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/07/19/ohio-officer-hospitalized-glass-food/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="breitbart.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>This sort of behavior has become all too common for officers today. The<br>only fast food that the officers I know will eat is the kind where they<br>either know the owner of the restaurant very well, or they can watch<br>as the meal is prepared. The fresh Mexican chains (Qdoba, Chipotle) are<br>popular, as well as sandwich shop chains like Subway and Schlotzsky's<br>where your sandwich is prepared while you watch.<br><br>None of that will happen from a drive-thru, so you can expect to see far<br>fewer officers utilizing the drive-thru.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
