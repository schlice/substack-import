<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there a way to create something like a bank in Gmail where all<br>mails from one of my subscriptions will be placed instead of them being<br>mixed with others like it usually is the case?**<br><br>Gmail doesn't really have a concept of "folders," but it does have a<br>concept of "Labels."<br><br>All of your messages come in to one bucket, and labels are applied to<br>them. You can see the one big bucket of mails when you select "All mail"<br>on the left hand side, or type in:all in the search bar. You will<br>see all of your emails, and the labels applied to them. When you look at<br>your "Inbox," you're actually looking at all of the mail labeled<br>"Inbox."<br><br>So what you are asking to do is to label a specific sender's emails, and<br>then "skip the Inbox" (which means it won't apply the label "Inbox" to<br>that message). You can optionally also mark the message as read. Here's<br>how you do it:<br><br>1\. Select one of the target messages using the check mark selector on<br>the left side of the message.<br><br>2\. Pick the "More" menu just above the email list (it's the<br>three-vertical-dot selection on the right-hand side)<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-3d905601bdaf7f72304002f4e19872f4){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-3d905601bdaf7f72304002f4e19872f4" master_w="502"<br>master_h="33"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>3\. Select "Filter messages like this"<br><br>4\. Ensure the sender's email address is the correct one you want to<br>filter, and then click the Create filter button (not the blue Search<br>button)<br><br>5\. On the next screen, it will say "When a message is an exact match<br>for your search criteria:", then choose Skip the inbox (Archive it)<br>and Apply the label: \<choose label\> and choose an appropriate<br>label for your subscription. You can also choose to apply your label to<br>any messages already in your Inbox using the selection at the bottom,<br>which reads Also apply filter to \<X\> matching conversations.<br><br>From that point on, all messages coming in meeting those criteria will<br>be labeled with your label and won't appear in your Inbox. You can click<br>on your label on the left side to see them, or choose All mail to<br>see them as well.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
