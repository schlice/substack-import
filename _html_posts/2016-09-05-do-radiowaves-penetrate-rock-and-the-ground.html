<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Radio waves can traverse through the ground. Assuming they are powerful<br>enough and at the appropriate frequency, they certainly can. For<br>example, we have a device known as *ground-penetrating radar* which<br>can see through soil. Radio waves of sufficient power and at the<br>appropriately low frequency can penetrate soil to fairly impressive<br>depths. Communicating through soil? Probably not. Those types of radio<br>signals are at a much higher frequency and probably won't get very far<br>through any dense material, soil included.<br><br>Most radio waves cannot penetrate solid rock. In general, for a radio to<br>work correctly (a traditional radio we are familiar with), you need<br>*line of sight* between the sender and the receiver.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
