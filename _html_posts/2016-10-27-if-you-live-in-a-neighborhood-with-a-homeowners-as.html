<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is it depends.<br><br>Most residential HOAs only allow you to keep animals which are commonly<br>referred to as family pets. This is mostly for sanitation and to avoid<br>nuisance complaints. This means that beyond dogs, cats and small<br>household critters, you can\'t have it. And there are usually rules<br>about them too.<br><br>However, it\'s entirely up to your HOA. Check your covenants to be sure<br>before you buy that chicken coop.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
