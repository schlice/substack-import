<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can I stop a gun bill from becoming a law, once it\'s passed both<br>house and senate, before the governor signs it (Vermont)?**<br><br>As [[Eric<br>Erickson](https://www.quora.com/profile/Eric-Erickson)]{.qlink_container}<br>mentioned, your best bet is to hire an attorney and file a lawsuit and<br>request the judge file an *injunction* while the lawsuit is in progress.<br>This means that even if the bill is signed into law, it cannot be<br>implemented until the legal challenges are heard.<br><br>Beyond that, you and your friends should vote out the representatives<br>who passed the bill if it's against what the majority of the state<br>wanted.<br><br>However, oddly, you may have better luck mounting a Constitutional<br>challenge *after* it becomes law. Once it does, someone can be affected<br>by the law. This provides you with a critical piece in the lawsuit game:<br>standing. In order to sue, you have to be someone who was actually<br>impacted by the law.<br><br>Therefore, once the bill becomes law, and someone is prosecuted under<br>the law, they can then appeal their conviction on the grounds that the<br>law violates the Constitution. They can do this because they have<br>standing. They have actually been personally affected by the law, and<br>they can then claim that their conviction was unjust because the law is<br>unconstitutional.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
