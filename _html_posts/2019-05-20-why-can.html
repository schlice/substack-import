<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why can\'t Roe v. Wade protect people on a state-wide level?<br><br>This is a great question. I think you're wondering why states are<br>passing laws making abortion illegal.<br><br>Today, they can't do this, and they know it.<br><br>What they are doing is creating a challenge to *Roe v. Wade*, the<br>landmark court decision in 1973 which made abortion legal as a protected<br>right.<br><br>To be clear, I'm not debating the merits or drawbacks of abortion in<br>this thread. Don't be surprised that if you post a comment about<br>"abortion is murder" or "you don't respect women" that your comment gets<br>deleted. This is a legal, Constitutional thread. Want to discuss<br>abortion? Do it in another thread.<br><br>Also, to be fair, *Roe* is a very weak decision, Constitutionally. The<br>basis for *Roe* was a case called [[*Griswold v.<br>Connecticut*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=322921&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griswold_v._Connecticut){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, which found that the<br>Constitution actually contains a right to privacy, when the words "right<br>to privacy" do not exist in the Constitution. They used a very<br>Constitutionally-progressive theory that the "emanations and penumbras"<br>of the Constitution showed that there is a right to privacy, even though<br>one isn't written. I can go into Constitutional Progressivism if you're<br>interested, and how it works, but suffice it to say that there is no<br>right to privacy written in the Constitution; however, SCOTUS found one.<br><br>Once *Griswold* was decided (which was another women's rights case,<br>specifically one that decided on access to contraception), the larger<br>attack on abortion laws could take place, and *Roe* was decided. *Roe*<br>built on the foundation of *Griswold*, arguing essentially that if a<br>woman had a Constitutional right to privacy, then she should have the<br>unfettered ability to decide what to do with her body, which includes<br>the ability to abort the baby growing there.<br><br>*Roe* is a legally unsound decision, because it was decided<br>*specifically discounting whether or not the baby was alive, and<br>therefore had a right to life.* *Roe* basically said that since there<br>are so many dissenting opinions regarding whether or not the baby really<br>is alive, and there are so many points at which we *could* determine<br>whether or not the baby is alive, we're just going to ignore all of it<br>and not even address whether or not the baby has rights (or whether or<br>not we are violating them). Some quotes from the majority opinion in<br>*Roe*:<br><br>> *We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When<br>> those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy,<br>> and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at<br>> this point in the development of man\'s knowledge, is not in a<br>> position to speculate as to the answer.*<br>><br>> *There has always been strong support for the view that life does not<br>> begin until live\' birth.*<br>><br>> *Physicians and their scientific colleagues have regarded that event<br>> with less interest and have tended to focus either upon conception,<br>> upon live birth, or upon the interim point at which the fetus becomes<br>> \"viable,\" that is, potentially able to live outside the mother\'s<br>> womb, albeit with artificial aid.<br>59\ Viability is usually placed<br>> at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24<br>> weeks. The Aristotelian theory of \"mediate animation,\" that held<br>> sway through out the Middle Ages and the Renaissance in Europe,<br>> continued to be official Roman Catholic Dogma until the 19th century,<br>> despite opposition to this \"ensoulment\" theory from those in the<br>> Church who would recognize the existence of life from the moment of<br>> conception. The latter is now, of course, the official belief of the<br>> Catholic Church. As one brief amicus discloses, this is a view<br>> strongly held by many non-Catholics as well, and by many physicians.<br>> Substantial problems for precise definition of this view are posed,<br>> however, by new embryological data that purport to indicate that<br>> conception is a \"process\" over time rather than an event, and by new<br>> medical techniques such as menstrual extraction, the \"morning-after\"<br>> pill implantation of embryos, artificial insemination, and even<br>> artificial wombs.*<br><br>Basically, what this all says is that since, at the time, they couldn't<br>figure out exactly when life began (and therefore rendered the baby<br>*alive* and deserving of human rights), they would punt that question<br>down the road. **However, if science, philosophy, and theology ever do<br>figure it out, the entire basis for the decision in *Roe* would<br>be upended.**<br><br>States passing abortion laws today are stating that ***we do know when<br>life begins, and we do know that the fetus is, in fact, human, and is<br>deserving of human rights.*** Of course, this runs counter to what *Roe*<br>allows, and so they are basically setting up a legal challenge to *Roe*<br>designed to overturn it. They *want* organizations to sue them claiming<br>that their laws are unconstitutional because they violate a woman's<br>right to an abortion as described in *Roe*. They *want* this challenge<br>to get to the Supreme Court so that the current crop of Justices can<br>decide on whether or not *Roe* was a good decision Constitutionally.<br>They waited for strict constructionists to have a majority on the Court,<br>and now that they have it, they are pushing the issue in the only way<br>they can: write a law which violates the "right."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
