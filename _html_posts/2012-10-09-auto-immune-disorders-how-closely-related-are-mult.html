<br/><br/><br/><br/># Answers<br/><br/>## Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Multiple Sclerosis is an autoimmune condition in which the<br/>immune system attacks and destroys the myelin sheath surrounding nerve<br/>fibers. The resultant scars (scleroses) are areas of decreased nerve<br/>transmission through which nerve signals flow more slowly, thus causing<br/>weakness to muscles.\<br/>\<br/>Psoriasis is also an autoimmune disease, but in psoriasis, the immune<br/>system targets and attacks skin cells, causing abnormal cell growth.\<br/>\<br/>Like MS, psoriasis is an immune-mediated disorder, and also like MS, the<br/>cause is not known. It is also possible that the method of disease<br/>action in both diseases may be similar (T-cells producing inflammatory<br/>responses in nerves or skin cells). Finally, there is no known cure for<br/>either disease, however, both diseases can be treated with<br/>immunomodulatory drugs.]<br/><br/>*Disclaimer:*<br/><br/>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br/>substitute for professional medical advice.
