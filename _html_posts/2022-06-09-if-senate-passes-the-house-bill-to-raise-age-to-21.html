title: '"If Senate passes the house bill to raise age to 21 for purchases of semiautomatic
  rifles, does this also mean the military will only accept the applications of those
  21 and over as the new recruits will have to await their 21st birthday?"'

Military<br>members are issued rifles by the military to use in combat, so this bill<br>would not apply to them.<br><br>But *logically* and *morally*, the bill makes no sense when you factor<br>in military members.<br><br>Why is it *logical* that a 20 year old is not mature enough to buy a<br>rifle, but that same person is mature enough to be *issued* a<br>government-purchased rifle and go off to war to defend the country? The<br>logic simply doesn't hold.<br><br>Really, what this bill says is that *unless you join the military and we<br>can personally evaluate you, we don't trust that you're mature enough to<br>own a rifle.* In other words, *because a tiny fraction of people buy<br>rifles and kill people with them, we will take away the ability of<br>anyone to purchase a rifle.*<br><br>But killers never follow laws anyway. Would this have stopped Sandy<br>Hook? Nope, because the killer didn't buy the rifle. He broke into the<br>safe storage, killed his mother, and then went to the school to kill<br>Kindergarteners. So we stop an even smaller percentage of killers from<br>legally obtaining a firearm, but in the process we have stopped large<br>swaths of innocent, law-abiding Americans (who can join the military and<br>vote) from purchasing rifles themselves.<br><br>We keep chipping away at the Second Amendment piece by piece, because we<br>keep allowing the little corner cases to be restricted. Eventually,<br>there won't be any corners left to restrict, and we'll be scratching our<br>heads when the gestapo is knocking on your door demanding you hand over<br>your scary black rifles because no one wants to address the real issues.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If Senate passes the house bill to raise age to 21 for purchases of<br>semiautomatic rifles, does this also mean the military will only accept<br>the applications of those 21 and over as the new recruits will have to<br>await their 21st birthday?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
