<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Necessary? Under what principle?<br><br>In the United States, as hard a pill as it is to swallow, *healthcare is<br>not a right*. Healthcare isn't even a privilege.<br><br>Healthcare is literally nothing more than a business transaction. Just<br>like going into the store and buying shoes.<br><br>A doctor is a practitioner who has spent *years* learning his skill, and<br>in most cases, investing his own money (usually through student loans)<br>to finance his education. He has a family. He gets a paycheck. You have<br>to purchase his services.<br><br>It is not "necessary" that we do anything.<br><br>What we *do* when healthcare is private is that we offer what is called<br>a "social safety net" wherein the poorest people qualify for<br>state-funded healthcare, through taxpayer dollars. In the United States,<br>there are several key programs which provide healthcare for the poor:<br>Medicaid and CHIP (the Children's Health Insurance Program),<br>which provide access to healthcare for millions of people, including<br>low-income workers, families and children, pregnant women, the elderly,<br>and people with disabilities.<br><br>So in a private system, where healthcare is a business transaction, the<br>state provides the backup funding for healthcare for the poorest and<br>neediest individuals.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
