<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The right simply can't explain away a catch-phrase that has been bandied<br>about and is now part of the discussion. The simple fact that *it does<br>not exist* isn't enough to explain it away. You have to explain where it<br>came from and why it is fallacious in order to "explain" it.<br><br>The media-coined term "gun-show loophole" actually originated from the<br>fact that, in most states, private sales between individuals do not<br>require background checks. The media simply didn't make it clear that<br>*inside* the gun show, background checks do take place, but at a<br>gun show, you also have a marketplace of buyers (and potentially,<br>sellers) all in the same place. There is nothing stopping me (a shopper,<br>not a dealer) from, say, watching someone else shopping for a gun and<br>then telling that person that I have a gun out in my car that I'd sell<br>him for less than this one here on the table, and we go out to the car<br>and do a private sale, no background check required. That's the<br>"loophole."<br><br>The problem: it's not a "loophole." A "loophole" in a law is when a<br>specific set of circumstances can be invoked which would controvert the<br>actual will of the law. For example, if a law said that all firearms<br>purchases by anyone required a background check, yet you found a way to<br>make a legal purchase without one, that would be a "loophole" in the<br>law.<br><br>There is no "loophole" in this law because private party sales were<br>specifically excluded from the background check requirement. When<br>the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was<br>started, it was specifically restricted to firearms dealers. There is no<br>general public access to it. As such, it was determined to be<br>prohibitive to force all sellers and buyers to do background checks for<br>every private party transfer or sale, and lawmakers specifically ensured<br>that private party sales would not be subject to the background check<br>provisions. States like Colorado saw fit to pass laws that went ahead<br>and mandated that all private party transfers or sales required<br>background checks conducted by a FFL dealer anyway. These laws are<br>mostly ignored and many of them are simply not enforced. Studies have<br>shown that they wouldn't have prevented any crimes had they been<br>enforced as written anyway. So are "universal background checks" an<br>answer to crime, and somehow the "gun show loophole" is preventing us<br>from stopping crime? No, and no.<br><br>TL;DR: Both parts of the "gun show loophole" trope are incorrect:<br>the sales don't actually occur in the gun show, and it's not a loophole.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
