<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Well, there is one way that you can end up arrested for not paying a<br>fine.<br><br>- You don't pay your fine<br>- The fines accumulate, along with late fees.<br>- The HOA turns your account over to the attorney, who keeps trying to<br>  collect, adding late fees as well as attorney's fees.<br>- Eventually, when your past due balance reaches the minimim level<br>  required by state law, the attorney places a lien on your property.<br>- *Eventually* eventually, when your account goes past due for long<br>  enough, the HOA and attorney forecloses on the lien, selling your<br>  house out from under you to pay for your fines and fees.<br>- But you refuse to leave your home.<br>- At a certain point, the new owner (the bank) will send you an eviction<br>  notice.<br>- You will still refuse to leave your home.<br>- The judge will order the Sheriff to evict you.<br>- You still refuse to leave.<br>- BAM, you're in jail.<br><br>So there you go, that's how you can be arrested by not paying a fine.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
