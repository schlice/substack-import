<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why do some states still use the 3-strikes law?<br><br>So before we talk about why some states still have them, let's define<br>them.<br><br>The "three strikes law" is what most states refer to as "habitual<br>offender" or "habitual felon" laws. Under these sentencing rules,<br>upon conviction for a third felony (rules vary by state), the defendant<br>is subject to a mandatory life sentence, or a mandatory minimum 25 years<br>to life sentence, depending on the state.<br><br>There are variations among the states. In some states, all of the three<br>crimes must be violent felonies before the mandatory sentence is<br>enacted; in others, at least one of the three felonies must be a violent<br>crime before the law is enacted. So in some cases, a defendant could<br>have several previous felonies on the books, and then just commit one<br>violent felony, and face a life sentence.<br><br>The common complaint here is an Eighth Amendment challenge, and comes<br>down to one of *proportionality*. The famous test case in this regard is<br>*Rummel v. Estelle* in 1980. The Supreme Court upheld a Texas<br>three-strikes law under which Rummel was sentenced to life with parole<br>after three property theft felonies, the grand total sum of all three<br>crimes was approximately \$230. While the upholding of the Texas law was<br>certainly notable, what was more interesting was the follow-on. Texas<br>courts (and others) now use the case as a proportionality test, and most<br>commonly they find that the application of the Texas three-strikes law<br>is proportional, "given that Rummel\'s life sentence for a small felony<br>conviction which only involved misappropriation of a small amount of<br>property, enhanced by his two prior convictions both involving similar<br>offenses and both involving small amounts of property, was upheld by the<br>United States Supreme Court."\[1\](#mzMJZ){#cite-mzMJZ .citation_link}<br><br>Ultimately, your question was why do states still have these laws. The<br>reason any state continues in any particular sentencing policy is<br>because *they believe it works*. In any honest analysis of these laws,<br>we find contradictory evidence at best, but some states still believe<br>that these laws reduce crime.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-mzMJZ){.citation_index}<br>[http://www.search.txcourts.gov/S\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bb5558&url=http://www.search.txcourts.gov/SearchMedia.aspx?MediaVersionID%3D3304b8fa-4418-4d4e-a592-9b56e0714e37%26MediaID%3D4bd5a8ee-acad-4f00-8ffd-89122adc70e1%26coa%3D%2522%2520%2B%2520this.CurrentWebState.CurrentCourt%2520%2B%2520@%2522%26DT%3DOpinion){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="txcourts.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
