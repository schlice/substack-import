<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can they be sued? Sure. Anyone can be sued for anything. The question is<br>how likely is it that the aggrieved party will prevail.<br><br>Whether or not they prevail is dependent on many things. One of those<br>things is whether or not the trespassed party was responsible for<br>addressing any known hazards in the pool area. If there was a known<br>hazard that the trespassed party was responsible for addressing, that<br>person did not address that hazard, that person was then trespassed but<br>the hazard remained, and someone else was injured because of the known<br>hazard, the person responsible for the hazard can still be sued. They<br>don't need to be present at the time of the injury in order for their<br>negligence to be responsible for the conditions which resulted in it.<br><br>Of course, the trespassed party would claim, in that instance, that they<br>would have addressed the hazard had they not been trespassed. So they<br>will claim that it was the trespass that resulted in the hazard<br>remaining in place, not their negligence.<br><br>In such a case, the liability incurred by the trespassed person will be<br>reduced because of the fact that they were trespassed. It may not be<br>eliminated completely, but it will most definitely be reduced.<br><br>So can they be sued? Sure they can. Anyone can be sued for anything.<br>Whether or not the aggrieved party will prevail will depend greatly upon<br>the facts of the particular case. But you gotta admit, it's hard to<br>address a known hazard when you've been trespassed from a facility.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If someone has been trespassed from a homeowners association, can that<br>person still be sued for injuries sustained at a common area of the HOA,<br>such as the pool?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
