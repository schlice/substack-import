<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Foot patrol is awesome. It allows officers to get out,<br>know the area that they patrol, interact with citizens, and be \"in<br>tune\" with the community.\<br>\<br>However, foot patrol is *expensive*. It is very manpower-intensive, and<br>thus requires more officers to cover the same area. And in today\'s<br>shrinking-department-budget era and increased scrutiny over the cost of<br>providing police services, departments simply can\'t afford this type of<br>policing.\<br>\<br>This is where I get to shine, because I get to extoll the virtues of<br>*reserve officers.* Reserve deputies in my department are titled as<br>\"highly-trained, community-minded volunteers.\" Reserves receive all of<br>the training that their full-time paid counterparts receive, but they do<br>so at night and on weekends since they have full-time jobs. Reserves are<br>fully certified in firearms, vehicle operations, arrest control, and<br>local and state statutes. They are fully POST-certified as Reserve Peace<br>Officers, and are sworn as deputies by the Sheriff. They are completely<br>indstinguishable from their full-time counterparts with the exception of<br>the \"RESERVE\" rocker above the shoulder patch. Interesting side story,<br>when the department re-worked the uniforms a few years ago, they asked<br>the Reserves if they wanted to wear regular shoulder patches as the<br>\"RESERVE\" rocker is not required by law. The Reserves opted to keep<br>the rocker. Reserves are volunteers, as I mentioned, and receive only<br>their training, firearms, Tasers, ballistic vests, and other uniform<br>accoutrements paid by the department. They pay for everything else,<br>including all their leathers, out of their own pocket.\<br>\<br>Reserves have a proud history, formerly being \"organized\" as the<br>Sheriff\'s Possee. The formalized Sheriff\'s Reserve is now<br>fully-supported, well-trained, and legal. The Reserves are highly<br>motivated, and save the department millions of dollars a year in pay and<br>operating expenses. Expanded use of reserves could \"fill the gap\"<br>where departments need to save money on officer deployment.\<br>\<br>Our problem is that we simply don\'t have enough of them. We have about<br>300 sworn officers, and only about 30 of them are Reserves. We just need<br>more.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
