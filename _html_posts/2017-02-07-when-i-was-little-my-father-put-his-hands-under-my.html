<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Question details:<br>><br>> *He probably didn\'t do it on purpose. He was asleep. He never touched<br>> me after I got my own bed.*<br>><br>> *He had sexual relationships with several women, assaulted another<br>> teenage girl. But he was good to me.*<br>><br>> *I dropped out of a top university and stopped talking to him at 19.*<br><br>I'm going to start with the short answer first. Get help. Find a<br>good mental health professional in your area and go see her. I would<br>suggest finding a woman therapist (I'm assuming you're physiologically a<br>girl).<br><br>Does this mean you're broken? Does this mean you're bad? Does this mean<br>you've done something wrong? No, no, and no.<br><br>So why did I recommend getting professional help?<br><br>*You have a lot of issues to work through.* Some of them: depression,<br>denial, and yes, sexual assault.<br><br>I'll let you in on another little secret: *You were assaulted. He did it<br>on purpose.* You're lucky he stopped when you got your own bed.<br><br>Now that you know this, it's time to get off Quora and find some help in<br>your local area.<br><br>And don't even think of talking to him again until after you've gotten<br>help.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
