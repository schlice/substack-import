<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Let\'s go through the process for the accused in the US,<br>and that should clear up the confusion.\<br>\<br>First, an individual is arrested for committing a crime. If the DA finds<br>that there is enough evidence, they will bring charges. During this<br>time, the suspect is in custody. The 6th Amendment guarantees US<br>citizens a \"speedy trial\" so \"arraignment\" will take place quickly,<br>usually within a week, customarily within just a few days. At the<br>suspect\'s arraignment, he is informed of his charge, is allowed to<br>enter a \"plea,\" and is then informed (in most jurisdictions and for<br>most cases) of whether or not he will be released on bond, released on<br>his own recognizance (ROR), or \"remanded\" to custody until his trial.<br>Whether or not a suspect is remadned, bailed or ROR\'d at ths point is<br>determined by the judge based on the severity of the crime, whether or<br>not he is at risk of \"running,\" and whether or not there is a<br>possibility that he will not return on his court date. Generally,<br>someone with strong ties to the community will not run, and can be<br>released on bail, or even ROR\'d.\<br>\<br>If an individual is remanded to custody until his trial, he goes back to<br>jail until his court date, which can be months away. If a judge remands<br>the individual to custody until his trial, he is held indefinitely until<br>his trial date.\<br>\<br>If an individual is released on bond or ROR\'d, he goes home, and can<br>possibly commit another crime at this time. If the individual commits<br>another crime while out on bond, his bond is immediately forefeit, he<br>returns to custody, and the District Attorney will likely either amend<br>the original charge, adding the new charge, or could seek to either<br>dismiss the original charge, or could also dismiss the new charge, in<br>lieu of revocation of bond. It depends on what the crime is. Regardless,<br>if you commit a crime while you are out on bond, you forefeit your bond<br>and you return to custody until your trial.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
