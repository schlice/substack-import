<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There's a lot of fearmongering going on right now. It would make sense<br>to look at the facts.<br><br>The Reedy Creek Improvement District is not exempt from property taxes.<br>Disney is the largest taxpayer in Florida, paying upwards of \$300<br>million in property taxes to Orange and Osceola counties, and another<br>\$250 million in other state taxes.<br><br>But dissolving the District would revert control of the area back to<br>Orange and Osceola counties, including paying for fire, medical, and 911<br>services. OCSO provides law enforcement in the District, but in a<br>contract deal. Dissolving the District would mean that OCSO would<br>provide the same service, but with no additional revenue to do it.<br>County residents could be faced with a tax increase in order to pay for<br>those services. Disney, as a county business, would be forced to pay<br>higher taxes, just like all the other residents of Orange and Osceola<br>counties.<br><br>But the move wouldn't be neutral for Disney, either. Along with the<br>increased taxes that Disney will be forced to pay, Disney allows<br>construction in the District at the pleasure of the Walt Disney<br>Corporation. If the District is dissolved, things like construction<br>permits, zoning applications, and ecological impact fees would all<br>revert to the respective counties, hamstringing Disney's ability to<br>rapidly grow.<br><br>However, these special districts (there are six of them in Florida which<br>were created before Florida's Constitution was ratified) are granted to<br>*corporations*, and these days, Florida generally looks askance at<br>special improvement districts which were created before the State<br>Constitution and are not necessarily in line with it, but were<br>grandfathered in, being granted to for-profit corporations.<br><br>In doing this now, legislators in Florida are sending a message to<br>Burbank: RCID exists at the pleasure of the State of Florida, and it is<br>by no means immovable. State Rep. Randy Fine (R.-Melbourne Beach) is a<br>sponsor of the bill, HB3C, which eliminates the Reedy Creek Improvement<br>District. "Disney is a guest in Florida," he [[said Monday in a<br>tweet](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8fa71a&url=https://twitter.com/VoteRandyFine/status/1516417533825454083?s%3D20%26t%3DF0mV1S3erBQRx1kVbfP4fA){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="twitter.com"}]{.qlink_container}. "Today, we remind them."<br><br>*So what's likely to happen?*<br><br>If RCID is dissolved, it's very likely that Disney and Orange and<br>Osceola counties will re-negotiate a new special improvement district<br>agreement that allows Disney to keep its control, but one which is in<br>keeping with the State Constitution, and (if I was a betting man) one<br>that keeps Disney's corporate front-office in Burbank out of the<br>political business of the state of Florida (at least publicly). Saying<br>that you'll protect your LGBT employees is one thing. Saying that you'll<br>fight to overturn a duly-enacted Florida state law is quite another.<br><br>(EDIT) It appears the Florida Legislature has passed the bill which will<br>dissolve RCID, and it goes to the Governor's desk for signature. HB3C<br>says "Notwithstanding s. 189.072(2), any independent special district<br>established by a special act prior to the date of ratification of the<br>Florida Constitution on November 5, 1968, and which was not<br>reestablished, re-ratified, or otherwise reconstituted by a special act<br>or general law after November 5, 1968, is dissolved effective June 1,<br>2023. An independent special district affected by this subsection may be<br>reestablished on or after June 1, 2023, pursuant to the requirements and<br>limitations of this chapter."<br><br>At the same time, Disney has vowed to file a lawsuit against the state,<br>claiming that Florida is violating the company's First Amendment right<br>to free speech by the move, and that it violates FS 189.072, which shows<br>that they're literally grasping at straws. Looks like Disney is going to<br>have to renegotiate the terms of RCID.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
