<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Prenuptial agreements can be entered into at any time<br>before you are married. They come into force at the time of a divorce<br>from marriage, so as long as you enter into the agreement at some time<br>before you are married, it is a qualifying prenup. If you enter into an<br>agreement after you are married, it is called a **postnuptial<br>agreement**, but it carries the same weight, and still comes into force<br>at the time a divorce is filed.\<br>\<br>Postnups are gaining in popularity, but as a way to save a marriage, not<br>as a guide for an impending divorce.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
