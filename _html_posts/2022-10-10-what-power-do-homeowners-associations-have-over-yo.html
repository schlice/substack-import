<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The correct answer is that the HOA (which is essentially a contract you<br>enter into, albeit a mandatory one, when you buy a house in a particular<br>neighborhood) is an organization to which you voluntarily *cede* control<br>of certain design aspects of the exterior of your home. That<br>responsibility is borne by the ARB (the Architecture Review Board ---<br>your HOA may call it something different, it's the same thing though).<br>The ARB has complete design control over the whole neighborhood, and<br>they can ensure that it all looks a certain way.<br><br>In such a neighborhood, if you want to make a change to how the exterior<br>of your house looks, the ARB must approve that change.<br><br>In order to enforce its provisions, the HOA also has a *financial<br>interest* over your property, as they become the *first non-mortgage<br>lienholder* on your house. So the primary lienholder on your house is<br>your mortgage holder, and the very next lienholder on your house is the<br>HOA. *The HOA is even in line in front of the IRS if you owe back taxes<br>on your house.* In practice, what this means is that if you owe money to<br>the HOA, they can put a lien on your house, and if you don't pay, they<br>can foreclose on that lien and sell your house out from under you in<br>order to get their money.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What power do homeowners associations have over your property rights?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
