<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Legally, pets are property. You can't threaten my property legally. It'd<br>be like talking to my car, saying, "Car, I'm gonna hurt you." So<br>legally, property can't be threatened.<br><br>However, pets-as-property are not regarded as *fungible*. In other<br>words, if someone damages your car, it can be replaced with original<br>parts or with a totally new car. Pets, not so much.<br><br>Since pets are legally property, you *legally* can't defend property<br>with deadly force. But what you *can* do is **interpose yourself between<br>your property and the attacker**. Then it becomes a self-defense<br>situation, in which case you may defend *yourself* with whatever<br>force is necessary, up to and including deadly force.<br><br>But doing so would be highly legally fraught. You *inserted* yourself<br>into the situation which caused the situation to become a deadly force<br>situation. The situation was not a deadly force situation until you<br>inserted yourself in the middle of it, some might say, in order to<br>*cause* the situation to become one which would result in deadly force<br>where it wouldn't have otherwise.<br><br>Additionally, if your "property" is small and movable (like most pets),<br>creating a scenario which would require deadly force would not be looked<br>upon favorably. While you might escape jail time, you probably won't<br>escape the wrongful death lawsuit which would inevitably follow.<br><br>\<br><br>So that's all well and good, but what can you do?<br><br>Well, you can't use *deadly* force to protect your pets, but you can<br>use *reasonable* force.<br><br>Remember, force is a spectrum. There are lots of things you can do<br>before you reach the handgun to defend your pets from someone<br>physically attacking them. You shouldn't discount the use of pepper<br>spray, or even a pepper ball gun. Pepper ball guns are not lethal force<br>and in nearly every state do not need permits or licenses to carry (your<br>mileage may vary, check your state laws, etc). And pepper spray works<br>equally as well on people as it does on other dogs who might attack your<br>dog. Pepper spray is very effective against dogs.<br><br>As always, check your state laws before you carry anything to be used<br>for self-defense. If you ever have questions, the Internet is not the<br>place to ask them. Ask an attorney in your area.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
