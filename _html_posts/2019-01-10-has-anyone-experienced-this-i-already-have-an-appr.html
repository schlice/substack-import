<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Has anyone experienced this? I already have an approved moral waiver<br>to enlist but was told my waiver needs to be sent up to MEPS first so it<br>could be OK'd and I'd have to wait another two weeks for MEPS.**<br><br>Yes, this is common for some moral waivers.<br><br>You've passed the biggest hurdle --- finding a recruiter who was willing<br>to process your waiver. In general, recruiters won't even file a moral<br>waiver if they don't believe it has a chance of being approved.<br><br>But bear in mind, MEPS can still deny the waiver. Your recruiter<br>approved your waiver, but more serious offenses have to go higher up the<br>recruiting chain before they are approved, so that may be what's going<br>on here.<br><br>The waiver process is *very* subjective, so don't be surprised if it<br>gets denied at MEPS. For example, if the waiver goes up to a Colonel at<br>MEPS who had his house burglarized, and you have a burglary waiver, do<br>you think he's going to approve it?<br><br>If it does get disapproved, you might think about trying a different<br>service. The Army has the reputation of approving the most moral<br>waivers. The Air Force and Coast Guard approve the fewest. The Navy and<br>Marine Corps fall somewhere in between. In that event, it would be worth<br>checking with another recruiter.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
