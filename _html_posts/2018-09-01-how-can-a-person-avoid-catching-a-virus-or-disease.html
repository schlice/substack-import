<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can a person avoid catching a virus or disease from using a public<br>restroom?**<br><br>Excellent question! Public restrooms are known for being germ factories,<br>but it's a reputation they don't deserve. They're not quite as dirty as<br>you might think. Well, some are, and you can visually see which ones are<br>dirty, because they're, well, dirty.<br><br>You'll especially note that Mythbusters tested several public restroom<br>myths, and some were actually found to be true. For example, hot air<br>dryers are less sanitary than paper towels. Not only do they remove less<br>bacteria from your hands, they leave more bacteria around the restroom.<br>Hot air dryers make you, and the restroom, less clean. Toilet seats, on<br>average, have fewer bad bacteria colonies on them than you might expect,<br>so it's unlikely that you would catch serious nasties from them.<br><br>So how do you stay clean in a public restroom? Here's a few tips that<br>might help:<br><br>- Pick a restroom (if you have a choice) that has paper towels in it<br>  rather than just hot air dryers. Often, venues will eschew the paper<br>  to cut down on the trash, but paper is demonstrably cleaner (for you<br>  and the bathroom) than dryers.<br>- Pick a stall that is relatively clean to do your business.<br>- Try not to touch too many surfaces. Use some toilet paper to actuate<br>  the flush handle. If you must touch surfaces when you're done washing<br>  your hands, use any body surface except the palm side of your hand.<br>  Use the back of your hand, your elbow, your forearm, etc. You can turn<br>  on the water with your hand, but don't turn it off with your hand.<br>- Handwashing is the key to cutting down the spread of germs. Wash<br>  your hands with warm water and soap. DON'T RE-CONTAMINATE YOUR HANDS<br>  BY TOUCHING THE FAUCET! Dry your hands with paper towel and THEN USE<br>  THE PAPER TO SHUT OFF THE FAUCET.<br>- Use paper towels, even the same one with which you dried your hands,<br>  to open the door. The dirtiest surfaces in a public restroom are the<br>  door handle and the faucet/toilet handle.<br><br>If there is no paper towel available (i.e. only hot air dryers),<br>understand that your hands are not going to be clean when you leave the<br>restroom; you will need to sanitize your hands somewhere else. I have a<br>hand sanitizer dispenser in my car; when I return to my car, I'll use<br>it.<br><br>Most modern updated restrooms are designed for germ awareness: the<br>faucets, toilets, and soap dispensers are no-touch; the doors open<br>outwards so you're not touching the surfaces on your way out, or there<br>is a paper dispenser right by the door for you to use to open the door,<br>etc.<br><br>Just to reiterate the salient point here: **handwashing is the key to<br>cutting down the spread of germs**. Wash your hands, and realize that<br>not everyone else does. With that in mind, you can use public restrooms<br>and still stay relatively clean and germ-free.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
