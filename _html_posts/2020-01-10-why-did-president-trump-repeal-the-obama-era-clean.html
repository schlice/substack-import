<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why did President Trump repeal the Obama-era clean water rule?<br><br>First of all, you're watching too much mainstream media.<br><br>Second, the pre-Obama Clean Water Act is still in effect. Trump only<br>rolled back Obama's changes to the Act.<br><br>Obama's additions to the Clean Water Act took a good regulation and<br>stretched it way too far, giving the EPA control over more than just<br>water. It gave the Federal government control over vast amounts of dry<br>land by adding terms such as "adjacent waters" and "tributaries" to<br>Clean Water Act coverage. It allowed the EPA to control things like<br>seasonal streams, farm irrigation ponds, roadside ditches and even<br>"connective" dry lands that can turn into "shallow wetlands" when it<br>rains.<br><br>The government's position at the time said that tributaries and adjacent<br>waters can flow downhill into larger bodies of water, and so the smaller<br>adjacent waters must also be regulated.<br><br>However, Obama's move constituted a massive power grab for the EPA, and<br>great uncertainty for farmers and landowners over virtually any land<br>which gets wet. Farmers, ranchers, real-estate developers and pretty<br>much anyone who owned more than an acre of land had to be worried about<br>violating the new rules because it was impossible to know if, for<br>example, the presence of a pond, or even a seasonal pond, on that land<br>wouldn't bring the EPA down on you. And the federal government is not<br>shy about imposing multimillion-dollar fines on farmers just for plowing<br>fields that they determine actually contained "seasonal wetlands."<br><br>Ever since Obama made the changes, they were the subject of state-level<br>lawsuits. Federal district courts stopped Obama's rules from taking<br>effect in roughly half of the states in the US anyway. Trump reversed<br>Obama's changes to the Clean Water Act, which were enacted by Executive<br>Order, and so were reversed by Executive Order, returning some sanity to<br>government.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
