Of course there is!<br><br>***When you can show that the tragedy, act of violence, or other<br>circumstance is the fault OF THE GUN, gun advocates will support banning<br>the gun.***<br><br>Until then, gun advocates are going to focus their efforts on the most<br>likely source of the problem: the gun operator.<br><br>Currently, the gun is as responsible for crime as the fork is<br>responsible for making people fat. To end the obesity epidemic, you have<br>heard no one call for the banning of forks, but a fork has been present<br>at every single instance of obesity. In fact, it was the fork in the<br>person's hand which moved the food into the mouth. If we ban the fork,<br>perhaps the obese won't eat anymore.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
