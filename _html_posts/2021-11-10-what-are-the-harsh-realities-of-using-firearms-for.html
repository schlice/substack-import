<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Every bullet you fire has a lawyer attached to it.*<br><br>Every time you fire your gun in self-defense, you are risking jail time.<br>Doesn't matter if you were fully justified. That's a question of *law*<br>to be decided by a *court*. When you fire your gun outside of the range,<br>expect to be arrested and expect to spend at least the night in jail.<br>Expect to be charged with a crime, and even if you are justified, expect<br>to be sued for wrongful death by the estate of the deceased (if your<br>target died).<br><br>If you carry a gun, you had better have a lawyer on speed-dial.<br>Thankfully, organizations like the [[US Concealed Carry<br>Association](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=40afa4&url=https://www.usconcealedcarry.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="usconcealedcarry.com"}]{.qlink_container} (USCCA) (not a<br>sponsor...yet...call me) exist to provide concealed carry training and,<br>more importantly to this discussion, legal protection to concealed<br>carriers who use their firearms in self-defense. They have a network of<br>attorneys ready to assist you should you be arrested following a<br>self-defense incident. Membership in USCCA is a must if you are going to<br>carry in public. No one tells you this.<br><br>Just as important to the legal representation is appropriate training.<br>Not everyone who knows how to use a gun should be carrying one in<br>public. Specific, tailored training for concealed carriers is essential.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What are the harsh realities of using firearms for self-defense that 2nd<br>amendment rights activists ignore and don't want to discuss?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
