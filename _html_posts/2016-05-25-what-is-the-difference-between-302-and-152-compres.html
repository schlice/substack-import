<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>30:2 is newer guidance than 15:2. The increased chest compressions is<br>newly mandated by the Red Cross as studies have shown that the blood<br>circulation through the brain is far more critical than the rescue<br>breaths.<br><br>There is also a new "compression-only" protocol that eliminates the<br>breaths altogether.<br><br>A refresher course in CPR and First Aid is probably a good idea.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
