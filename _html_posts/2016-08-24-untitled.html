<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Who determines that validity of that \'reason\'? Who sets the<br>guideline? Who delivers equally reasonably defined punishment when that<br>\'reason\' is defied?*<br><br>The courts determine what the "reasonable man" would do in a similar<br>situation.<br><br>*Who and more importantly when is it determined when that \'reason\' is<br>shown problematic ?*<br><br>If the people find that the courts are upholding a "reasonable man"<br>opinion that does not meet with their version, the people go to the<br>legislature to write a law directing the court to act in a specific<br>manner when prosecuting a specific crime.<br><br>This is how the government is supposed to work. Whether or not it<br>actually does in practice is another story completely.<br><br>*What happens when it is revealed to citizens that Police\' convictions<br>for that \'reason\' don\'t align with Society\'s depiction or<br>designation of Police\' duty?*<br><br>Citizens go to local government who oversees the police and makes them<br>re-define how the police operate. The police work for the city, the city<br>works for the people. You need a majority of the people to convince the<br>city that there is an issue.<br><br>If the city still does not agree, you replace the city government with<br>one that is favorable to your point of view.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-police-made-their-first-three-shots-non-lethal-and-loaded-them-with-rubber-bullets-It-seems-like-most-bad-shootings-are-one-or-two-shots-In-cases-where-police-have-to-actually-stop-a-threat-they-just-keep-firing-anyways/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
