<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Autonomous vehicles still have to have a licensed driver<br>behind the wheel to take over in the event of system failure or other<br>unforseen circumstance. This licensed driver will take control of the<br>system and pull the car over. The car will not have a<br>self-stopping-for-police feature; it will be up to the driver to take<br>over for the car and stop it.\<br>\<br>Clearly, there will be fewer speeding violations with self-driving cars,<br>but vehicles can be stopped for any number of reasons. Self-driving cars<br>can still have tail lights out, or expired registration, or tint darker<br>than the legal limit in that jurisdiction.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
