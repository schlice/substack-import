<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> In the United States, are we supposed to presume innocence when<br>> arresting someone even though legally there\'s no such thing as an<br>> arrest without probable cause/suspicion?<br><br>Yes, because probable cause or reasonable suspicion do not equal guilt.<br>Guilt is only determined by a competent court of appropriate<br>jurisdiction.<br><br>This does not mean that we do not have evidence that you committed a<br>crime. It also doesn't mean we don't have probable cause to believe that<br>the evidence points to you being the one who committed the crime. Those<br>are all exactly what they seem: evidence of a crime, and evidence that<br>you are the person who committed the crime.<br><br>But even with evidence (which may provide probable cause to effect an<br>arrest), you are still considered innocent until proven guilty in court.<br>This allows for the due process you are guaranteed under the 5th and<br>14th Amendments of the Constitution.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
