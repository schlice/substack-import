<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the United States, the problem is not with the correctional system.<br>The problem is with the medical community.<br><br>The largest quantity of the prison population is there [[because of<br>drugs or drug-related<br>offenses](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ee4045&url=https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_offenses.jsp){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bop.gov"}]{.qlink_container}. By orders of magnitude. And<br>most of those are drug users, not drug dealers.<br><br>Fundamentally, this is due to a flaw in the medical system, which<br>chooses to treat drug addicts as \"bad actors\" instead of people with a<br>disease. Medical science has, as of today, been unable to quantify the<br>exact mechanisms within the brain which are affected by the disease of<br>addiction. Since they have been unable to do so, addicts are not treated<br>as patients. Since the medical community does not see them as ill, the<br>only other choice for their behavior is, well, choice. The addict must<br>therefore be choosing to do drugs; he is not unable to control himself<br>because of a disease. Therefore, if he does not have a disease, he must<br>be a criminal.<br><br>For this reason, the jails are teeming with drug addicts.<br><br>When the medical community can finally find the exact pathways in the<br>brain which are affected by addiction, we can start to treat addicts as<br>patients instead of prisoners. The effect on the prison system<br>will be overwhelming. The government can divert some money that was<br>normally sent to prisons to drug rehabilitation centers, and the effect<br>on drug addiction will be staggering.<br><br>But it all comes down to the greater medical community to fix.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
