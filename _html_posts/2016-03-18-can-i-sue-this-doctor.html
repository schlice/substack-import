<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If a doctor prescribed a medication which was not specifically approved<br>to treat that disease and/or condition, insurance may deny the claim for<br>the drug, since it isn\'t proven to treat the condition listed.<br><br>That doesn\'t mean that it can\'t treat that condition. Obviously, we<br>know it can. We know that it has secondary uses, and may even benefit<br>your grandmother. We know it will help her sleep and treat some memory<br>issues. Therefore, even though it\'s a schizophrenia drug, it can help<br>your grandmother in her case.<br><br>I was looking for something non-habit forming to help me sleep. My RxN<br>prescribed me Gabapentin. Gabapentin\'s official \"on-label\" use is as<br>an anti-seizure medicine. The problem with it is that it is very<br>short-acting. It only works for about four hours. So as an anti-seizure<br>medicine, while it does work, it\'s not often prescribed for seizures.<br>There are much better anti-seizure drugs out there (i.e. more<br>long-acting) However, the drug also induces drowsiness (it\'s a known<br>side-effect of the drug). So she prescribed it to me. It works quickly<br>(within an hour) and only lasts for a few hours in your system. This was<br>ideal for me, and it worked very well as a sleep aid.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
