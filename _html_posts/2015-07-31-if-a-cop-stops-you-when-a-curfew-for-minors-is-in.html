<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content:<br>[[User(https://www.quora.com/profile/User-209198)]{.qlink_container}<br>is right on the money. In every jurisdiction that I know of, you are<br>required by law to identify yourself to the police officer. That means<br>you are not allowed to give a false name when you are asked. You have to<br>give them at the very least your real name. You can\'t lie about that,<br>or you can be arrested for just that crime alone. You don\'t have to<br>answer any other questions if you don\'t want to, but remember that<br>making the police officer\'s job harder will just make your life harder<br>too, and will determine whether you walk home or whether your parents<br>pick you up from the police station. Remember, he\'s trying to determine<br>whether or not you\'re a minor. He still has a job to do.\<br>\<br>For the question, you said \"thinking you are a minor,\" so I\'m<br>assuming you are not. I would think you would want to exculpate yourself<br>as quickly as possible, so I\'d show the officer some form of<br>identification to prove I am not a minor. Officer comes back, says have<br>a nice night, and away you go.\<br>\<br>You only have to show identification (i.e. a driver\'s license) if you<br>are driving a car.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
