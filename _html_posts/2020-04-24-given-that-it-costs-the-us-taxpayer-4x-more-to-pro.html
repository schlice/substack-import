<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Given that it costs the US taxpayer 4x more to produce a new officer<br>through a military academy (USMA, USNA, USAFA) than through ROTC and 8x<br>more than through OTS/OCS, are the Academy grads indeed 4/8x better<br>officers so as to be worth the cost?**<br><br>I am biased, because I am a USAFA grad. But even acknowledging my<br>inherent bias, I can't see how a linear, bottom-line cost model is<br>justified when comparing Academy graduates to college graduates.<br>Requiring Academy graduates to be 4x better because their education<br>costs 4x as much is not a comparison we make anywhere else. Do we assume<br>that a college which costs 4x as much as a community college to produce<br>a graduate who is 4x better at the same field as one produced by a<br>community college? The comparison doesn't hold when we compare civilian<br>colleges against each other. A degree is a degree, regardless of where<br>you get it. Why, then, do we apply this standard to the service<br>academies? Is it solely because the education is paid for out of DoD<br>funding? The comparison hardly seems justified.<br><br>However, let's look at the comparison more closely.<br><br>Part of the reason why the academies cost taxpayers so much more is<br>because room and board as well as tuition costs are all borne by the<br>taxpayer. This amounts to anywhere between \$250,000 and \$300,000 per<br>cadet. ROTC cadets pay their own way through college. But even this<br>isn't a fair comparison, because it fails to take into account tuition<br>assistance at universities, which is quite often Federal dollars as<br>well. The average needs-based financial aid package among undergraduates<br>was approximately \$56,000 in 2019. For many, it is significantly<br>higher.\[1\](#PdSIs){#cite-PdSIs .citation_link}<br><br>So what do you get for that money? You get a leader who has been tested<br>in fire. You get a leader who has more than just knowledge about history<br>and airplanes and how to wear the uniform. You get a leader who has<br>already spent four years immersed in the military to an extent to which<br>any other college graduate could only dream of.<br><br>Does that produce a "better" officer? Depends on your definition of<br>"better." Can you objectively define "better?" With the qualities of<br>character and leadership achieved by Academy graduates, I don't think<br>you can objectively quantify an Academy grad as "better."<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-PdSIs){.citation_index}<br>[https://www.usnews.com/education\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=af97b7&url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/what-you-need-to-know-about-college-tuition-costs){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="usnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
