<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**The Americans with Disabilities Act protects the right for all people<br>to have access to all places of public accommodation whether publicly or<br>privately owned. Wouldn\'t an Order of Protection deprive a person of<br>the right to use public accommodation?**<br><br>The Americans with Disabilities Act does not protect the right for all<br>people to access all places of public accommodation. It simply states<br>that people with disabilities must have *equal access* to all places of<br>public accommodation as those without disabilities. It does not bestow<br>any special rights on the disabled; it simply requires business owners<br>to provide reasonable accommodations to the disabled to make their<br>experience roughly equal to that of a person without disabilities.<br><br>An Order of Protection applies *equally* to people with and without<br>disabilities. Therefore, the provisions of ADA are not violated when an<br>Order of Protection is in place. The Order of Protection would apply to<br>someone with a disability as it would to someone without a disability.<br>Because the order applies equally, both the disabled person and the<br>non-disabled person would still have equal access to the public<br>accommodation, and the rules of ADA are still satisfied.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
