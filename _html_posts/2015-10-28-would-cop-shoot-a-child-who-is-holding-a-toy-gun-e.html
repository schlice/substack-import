CO2 powered BB guns do not, but<br>  they are still classified as toys.\<br>- A can of orange paint will make any gun look like an Airsoft gun.<br>- And what about guns that are actually concealed inside toys?\<br>  Like this one?\<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-86523772fe667157739274360e6588cd){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-86523772fe667157739274360e6588cd" master_w="609"<br>master_h="398"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br>Or this one?\<br>\<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-48337dd674621ba238d7caab05f19ea5){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-48337dd674621ba238d7caab05f19ea5" master_w="500"<br>master_h="281"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br>These are both real firearms.\<br>\<br>One final picture for your consideration:\<br>\<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-072f4252ca750da610810a6ccdfc1449){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-072f4252ca750da610810a6ccdfc1449" master_w="634"<br>master_h="412"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br>More importantly if I\'m a cop, I\'m not going to take the time to<br>notice the gun on the left has a smaller interior barrel which fires CO2<br>powered BBs.
