<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Police are never trained to \"shoot to kill.\"<br><br>Firearms are lethal weapons. That means that any time you use them, the<br>outcome is likely going to be the death of the person on the operative<br>end of the firearm. That\'s understood. But the end result of the<br>shooting is not designed to be death. Yes, a firearm is a lethal weapon,<br>but the \"goal\" of using the firearm is not \"to kill.\" The goal is to<br>stop the perpetrator from doing something, or to prevent that person<br>from doing something, when all other methods of force have failed (or<br>cannot be used \-- if the person is out of Taser range, for example).<br>You don\'t shoot to kill; you shoot to stop the act.<br><br>It seems like a pretty thin difference to be sure, but to understand the<br>difference, think about this: if an officer fires his weapon and the<br>suspect goes down but is still alive, did the officer fail to do his<br>job? Not at all. Does the officer walk up to the downed criminal and<br>\"finish the job?\" Certainly not. The officer successfully stopped the<br>suspect, no one else was hurt, and to top it all off, the suspect is<br>still alive to face charges. Win-win-win.<br><br>If you are going to fire your weapon, and you know that your goal is to<br>stop the act, where do you aim for in order to have the maximum<br>potential to stop the act? Center mass. Never legs, arms, head, etc.<br>Always center mass. Let SWAT take the trick shots. An officer making a<br>split-second decision is always going to shoot to stop the act, and he<br>is going to fire at the point on the body where he has the best chance<br>of doing just that. Suspects who are high on certain drugs (opiates<br>usually, sometimes meth) have a great tolerance for pain (it\'s rumored<br>that certain special forces units use these drugs just before entering<br>combat to keep them fighting through combat wounds). Therefore, leg and<br>arm hits may not stop some suspects; they may keep coming after they are<br>hit. Center mass is the only place that you have the highest chance to<br>stop the suspect, every time.<br><br>Don\'t forget, even if the officer does fire for the legs or the arms,<br>he could hit a major artery and the suspect could easily bleed out long<br>before any medical care could arrive. So even a shot in the leg could be<br>fatal.<br><br>*But my point is, don\'t count on the police doing exactly the right<br>thing to keep you alive in a violent confrontation. My advice is really<br>for the people who might get shot.*<br><br>Again, when the police fire, they aren\'t trying to kill, or even trying<br>to \"not kill,\" or to keep you alive. The police fire because you<br>didn\'t do something you were told to do, or you did something you were<br>told not to do, and the threat to the public in allowing you to<br>continue, and the risk of your death is less of a priority than the risk<br>of you continuing to go on doing what you are doing.<br><br>Lesson to be learned: if you want to find out how far a police officer<br>will go to stop you from doing something they told you to stop doing,<br>ignore them when they give you commands.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-in-the-USA-the-police-are-entitled-to-shoot-someone-who-is-fleeing-and-no-immediate-danger-to-anyone-if-they-have-a-reasonable-belief-that-this-person-had-previously-committed-a-violent-crime/answer/Ed-Caruthers<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
