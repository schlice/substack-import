<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is "it depends."<br><br>Here's a brief, not-complete list of some of the disqualifying mental<br>health conditions. Note that a waiver process does exist, and in<br>general, if you can show that the particular condition has been<br>successfully overcome, you may be able to get a waiver. You will have to<br>work with your recruiter on this. Make sure you are open and honest with<br>your recruiter, and if your condition is disqualifying, take heart: over<br>71% of the American population is ineligible for military service<br>because of some disqualifying condition. ICD codes are listed in<br>parenthesis.<br><br>You should also know that mental conditions are the most rigid standards<br>in the Air Force, more so than any other disqualifying medical<br>condition. Even while the diagnoses of some of these disorders may be<br>subjective, the military is very unwavering in disqualifying candidates<br>due to these conditions.<br><br>- ADD/ADHD or Perceptual/Learning Disorder(s) (315) is disqualifying<br>  unless the applicant can demonstrate passing academic performance and<br>  there has been no use of medication in the previous 12 months. Waivers<br>  may be issued for these disorders.<br>- Organic/functional mental disorders: Current or history of<br>  academic skills or perceptual defects secondary to organic or<br>  functional mental disorders, including, but not limited to dyslexia,<br>  that interfere with school or employment, are disqualifying. However,<br>  applicants demonstrating passing academic and employment performance<br>  without academic and/ or work accommodations at any time in the<br>  previous 12 months may be qualified.<br>- Psychotic disorders: Current or history of disorders with<br>  psychotic features such as schizophrenia (295), paranoid disorder<br>  (297), and other unspecified psychosis (298) is disqualifying.<br>- Mood disorders: Mood disorders such as depression, bipolar<br>  disorder, psychoses, and other unspecified depressive issues are<br>  disqualifying. Any history of mood disorders requiring medication<br>  and/or outpatient care for longer than six months by a mental health<br>  professional is also disqualifying. Also, any symptoms of mood and<br>  mental issues that affect social ability, school, and learning, or<br>  work efficiency are disqualifying. Current or history of adjustment<br>  disorders within the previous three months is disqualifying.<br>- Behavioral disorders: Behavioral disorders history in school and<br>  with law enforcement agencies having to get involved due to dangerous<br>  behavior to self or others is disqualifying. Antisocial attitudes or<br>  behaviors are disqualifying as people who exhibit these symptoms are<br>  typically not adaptive to military service.\<br>  \<br>  Any history of personality disorder that is demonstrated by documented<br>  and recurring inability to remain in a school environment, work with<br>  employers, fellow employees or participate in social groups are<br>  disqualifying.\<br>  \<br>  NOTE: Any psychological testing that reveals a high degree of<br>  immaturity, instability, personality issues, impulsiveness, or<br>  dependency which could interfere with the ability to conform to the<br>  rules and regulations of the Armed Forces is disqualifying.<br>- If a person has a current or history of behavior disorders that<br>  include but not limited to the following conditions:<br>  - Enuresis or encopresis after the 13th birthday is disqualifying.<br>  - Sleepwalking after 13th birthday is disqualifying.<br>  - Eating disorders such as anorexia, bulimia, or other unspecified<br>    eating disorders lasting longer than three months and occurring<br>    after the 14th birthday is also disqualifying.<br>- Speech disorders: Any speech impediment, stammering, stuttering or<br>  other receptive or expressive language disorder that may significantly<br>  interfere with the ability to repeat commands is disqualifying.<br>- Anxiety, self-harm, and phobias: Any history of suicidal behavior,<br>  that includes discussions, gestures, or the actual attempt is<br>  disqualifying. A history of self-mutilation is also disqualifying.\<br>  \<br>  Anxiety issues, either current or historical, or panic, agoraphobia,<br>  social phobia, simple phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorders, other<br>  acute reactions to stress, and posttraumatic stress are disqualifying<br>  for entry into the service.\<br>  \<br>  Any history or current disorder of being dissociative or<br>  de-personalization are disqualifying.\<br>  \<br>  Any history or current somatoform disorders, including, but not<br>  limited to hypochondriasis or chronic pain disorder, are<br>  disqualifying.\<br>  \<br>  Any history or current issue with alcohol dependence, drug dependence,<br>  alcohol abuse, or other drug abuse is<br>  disqualifying.\[1\](#JZkzx){#cite-JZkzx .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-JZkzx){.citation_index} [[Disqualifying Mental Health<br>Disorders and Medical<br>Conditions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=44b0d3&url=https://www.thebalancecareers.com/military-medical-standards-for-enlistment-and-commission-3354046){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="thebalancecareers.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
