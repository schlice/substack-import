<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>They should. Atheism is indeed a religion, but of course, as with all<br>things, this depends on how you classify "religion."<br><br>Atheists tend to hold a very narrow definition of religion, saying that<br>the term only applies to groups who believe in some form of deity, be it<br>a monotheistic deity or a pantheistic deity.<br><br>However, I tend to hold a much broader definition of religion. I<br>consider Monotheism, Pantheism, and Atheism as the three major religious<br>worldviews. Clearly, only monotheism and pantheism believe in God, where<br>atheism specifically does not believe in God. However, all three are<br>very specific worldviews, and they all make mutually exclusive truth<br>claims. Many of those truth claims can be evaluated through scientific<br>and historical investigation.<br><br>For example, most monotheists say that the universe had a beginning,<br>while most atheists and pantheists say that it did not. These are<br>*mutually exclusive claims*: either the universe began to exist, or it<br>did not. They can't both be right. By investigating the history and the<br>nature of the universe, we can reasonably conclude that one answer is<br>right and the other one is wrong.<br><br>Religion is not the only area of inquiry attempting to solve that<br>particular problem: science attempts to solve that as well. So religion<br>and science often are looking at the same questions. The important thing<br>to note is that science and religion are not mutually exclusive as some<br>tend to claim.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
