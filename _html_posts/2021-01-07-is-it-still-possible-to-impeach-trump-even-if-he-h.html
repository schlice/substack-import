<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it still possible to impeach Trump even if he had a couple of weeks<br>left?**<br><br>It is possible, but it is highly unlikely.<br><br>The House has lost the bulk of its majority. It is a much narrower<br>majority that they hold now, much like the razor-thin Senate majority.<br>You only need one Independent in the Senate who believes that the<br>president should be censured instead of impeached and your whole plan<br>goes out the window.<br><br>But it would still send quite the message if Trump ends up as the only<br>twice-impeached president in history.<br><br>That, and his speech yesterday, will be his legacy.<br><br>Everyone knew Trump was reckless, and those who liked him liked him for<br>it. But sometimes, recklessness can be, you know, reckless. Sometimes,<br>that recklessness can get you into trouble.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
