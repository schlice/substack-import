<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's take your two questions one at a time and apply a little good<br>old-fashioned logic.<br><br>> **Why don\'t people who refuse to get vaccinated against COVID-19<br>> think that they can die from the disease or even spread a deadly<br>> strain?**<br><br>The short answer has nothing to do with healthcare or medicine, and has<br>everything to do with *distrust of the government*.<br><br>The government has botched the handling of this pandemic from the<br>beginning. It politicized the virus, and the vaccine. And now it has<br>backed the notion that we need *forced vaccinations* in order to end the<br>pandemic (we'll get to that in a minute).<br><br>If the government would have instead given everyone the cold hard facts<br>from the beginning, about who the vaccine is best suited for, and who<br>might not benefit from the vaccine, and then leave everyone the hell<br>alone and treat them like adults, we'd be better off. That's how you do<br>public health. That's how public health gains trust. That's how public<br>health becomes effective. And that's how the pandemic ends.<br><br>> Everyone must be vaccinated or this pandemic will never end?<br><br>And this is the biggest lie that the government and the media could have<br>foisted upon you. And you bought it.<br><br>Nearly all of the hospitalizations from COVID since May (including with<br>the Delta variant) have been among those who are unvaccinated. There<br>have been a shockingly low number of "breakthrough infections" which are<br>people who have been fully vaccinated and then had gone on to get<br>COVID-19.<br><br>What this tells us is that vaccinated people won't get sick, and<br>unvaccinated people will.<br><br>And that choice belongs with each person.<br><br>Once you're vaccinated, you're covered. That's the bit that the<br>government and the media is fear-mongering around. Yes, there have been<br>the random cases of breakthrough infection, but the exception is not the<br>rule. For the vast majority of those vaccinated, you simply won't get<br>COVID-19 or any of its variants. But we're also finding that people who<br>got COVID are also protected against re-infection, and the variants.<br><br>[https://www.healthline.com/healt\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=184131&url=https://www.healthline.com/health-news/can-you-get-delta-variant-if-you-already-had-covid-19){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="healthline.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>So this tells us that eventually, everyone will either get the vaccine,<br>or will get sick and get better (or die). And this is how the pandemic<br>will end.<br><br>Not endless masks. Not forced vaccinations. Not fear mongering. Good<br>science and honest conversations will end the pandemic.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why don\'t people who refuse to get vaccinated against COVID-19 think<br>that they can die from the disease or even spread a deadly strain?<br>Everyone must be vaccinated or this pandemic will never end?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
