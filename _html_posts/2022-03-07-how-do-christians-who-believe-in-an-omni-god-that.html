<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I was going to write a long diatribe about how justice and mercy work<br>together, how Christians should temper justice with mercy, but then I<br>found this piece over at<br>[GotQuestions.org(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=336f59&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/mercy-justice.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container}, and I just had to<br>share.<br><br>> God's<br>> [justice(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=82be14&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/God-of-justice.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container} and<br>> [mercy(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7b9d77&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/God-is-merciful.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container} are seemingly<br>> incompatible. After all, justice involves the dispensing of deserved<br>> punishment for wrongdoing, and mercy is all about pardon and<br>> compassion for an offender. However, these two attributes of God do in<br>> fact form a unity within His character.<br>><br>> The Bible contains many references to God's mercy. Over 290 verses in<br>> the Old Testament and 70 in the New Testament contain direct<br>> statements of the mercy of God toward His people.<br>><br>> God was merciful to the Ninevites who repented at the preaching of<br>> Jonah, who described God as "a gracious and compassionate God, slow to<br>> anger and abounding in love, a God who relents from sending calamity"<br>> ([[Jonah<br>> 4:2](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=042b08&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Jonah%25204.2){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). David said God is<br>> "gracious and merciful; Slow to anger and great in loving-kindness.<br>> The LORD is good to all, and His mercies are over all His works"<br>> ([[Psalm 145:8--9,<br>> NASB](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=88806f&url=https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Ps%2520145.8%25E2%2580%25939){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br>><br>> But the Bible also speaks of God's justice and His wrath over sin. In<br>> fact, God's perfect justice is a defining characteristic: "There is no<br>> God apart from me, a righteous \just\ God and a Savior; there is<br>> none but me" ([[Isaiah<br>> 45:21](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4eca45&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Isa%252045.21){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). "He is the Rock, his<br>> works are perfect, and all his ways are just. A faithful God who does<br>> no wrong, upright and just is he" ([[Deuteronomy<br>> 32:4](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a39ca5&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Deut%252032.4){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br>><br>> In the New Testament, Paul details why God's judgment is coming: "Put<br>> to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual<br>> immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry.<br>> Because of these, the wrath of God is coming" ([[Colossians<br>> 3:5--6](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=33b794&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Col%25203.5%25E2%2580%25936){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br>><br>> So the Bible showcases the fact that God is merciful, but it also<br>> reveals that He is just and will one day dispense justice on the sin<br>> of the world.<br>><br>> In every other religion in the world that holds to the idea of a<br>> supreme deity, that deity's mercy is always exercised *at the expense<br>> of* justice. For example, in Islam, Allah may grant mercy to an<br>> individual, but it's done by dismissing the penalties of whatever law<br>> has been broken. In other words, the offender's punishment that was<br>> properly due him is brushed aside so that mercy can be extended.<br>> Islam's Allah and every other deity in the non-Christian religions set<br>> aside the requirements of moral law in order to be merciful. Mercy is<br>> seen as at odds with justice. In a sense, in those religions, crime<br>> can indeed pay.<br>><br>> If any human judge acted in such a fashion, most people would lodge a<br>> major complaint. It is a judge's responsibility to see that the law is<br>> followed and that justice is provided. A judge who ignores the law is<br>> betraying his office.<br>><br>> Christianity is unique in that God's mercy is shown *through* His<br>> justice. There is no setting aside of justice to make room for mercy.<br>> The Christian doctrine of penal substitution states that sin and<br>> injustice were punished at the [[cross of<br>> Christ](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=11b53a&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/meaning-of-the-cross.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container} and it's only<br>> because the penalty of sin was satisfied through Christ's sacrifice<br>> that God extends His mercy to undeserving sinners who look to Him for<br>> salvation.<br>><br>> As Christ died for sinners, He also demonstrated God's righteousness;<br>> His death on the cross showcased God's justice. This is exactly what<br>> the apostle Paul says: "All are justified freely by his grace through<br>> the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. God presented Christ as a<br>> sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood---to be<br>> received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness,<br>> because in his<br>> [forbearance(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bcebd3&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/Bible-forbearance.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container} he had left the sins<br>> committed beforehand unpunished---he did it **to demonstrate his<br>> righteousness** at the present time, so as to be just and the one who<br>> justifies those who have faith in Jesus ([[Romans<br>> 3:24--26](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a84e5e&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%25203.24%25E2%2580%259326){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}, emphasis added).<br>><br>> In other words, all the sin from Adam to the time of Christ was under<br>> the forbearance and mercy of God. God in His mercy chose not to punish<br>> sin, which would require an eternity in hell for all sinners, although<br>> He would have been perfectly just in doing so. Adam and Eve were not<br>> immediately destroyed when they ate the forbidden fruit. Instead, God<br>> planned a Redeemer ([[Genesis<br>> 3:15](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=761a99&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%25203.15){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). In His love God sent His<br>> own Son ([[John<br>> 3:16](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=486117&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%25203.16){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). Christ paid for every<br>> single sin ever committed; thus, God was just in punishing sin, and He<br>> can also justify sinners who receive Christ by faith ([[Romans<br>> 3:26](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3b3804&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%25203.26){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). God's justice *and* His<br>> mercy were demonstrated by Christ's death on the cross. At the cross,<br>> God's justice was meted out in full (upon Christ), and God's mercy was<br>> extended in full (to all who believe). So God's perfect mercy was<br>> exercised through His perfect justice.<br>><br>> The end result is that everyone who trusts in the Lord Jesus is saved<br>> from God's wrath and instead experiences His grace and mercy ([[Romans<br>> 8:1](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a8d51d&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%25208.1){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). As Paul says, "Since we<br>> have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved<br>> from God's wrath through him!" ([[Romans<br>> 5:9](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3548b3&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%25205.9){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}).\[1\](#Gqywx){#cite-Gqywx<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>This post highlights that **Christianity is unique in world religions in<br>that God shows mercy *through* justice.** In all other world<br>religions, justice is *set aside* in favor of mercy. Christianity<br>teaches that God is just and does not set aside justice to be merciful.<br><br>*Justice was served at the cross. Jesus took the punishment for our<br>sins, so there was no setting aside of justice. God shows us mercy when<br>he accepts Jesus' punishment on our behalf.* And this is all<br>accomplished because of God's *grace*, which allowed us to get something<br>we did not deserve: *salvation.*<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-Gqywx){.citation_index} [[How do God's mercy and justice<br>work together in<br>salvation?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=336f59&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/mercy-justice.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
