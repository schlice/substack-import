<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**A House transportation committee has concluded that the Trump inspired<br>lax regulatory environment at the FAA led to the 737 MAX fiasco. What<br>other Trump deregulations will come back to bite taxpayers,<br>corporations, etc in the butts?**<br><br>As usual, in an attempt to *BLAME TRUMP FOR EVERYTHING BAD,* you've<br>missed the facts.<br><br>There are absolutely problems at the FAA. A whistleblower complaint<br>published in September 2019 revealed that FAA inspectors were not<br>sufficiently qualified to "certify pilots or to assess pilot training"<br>for aircraft including the 737 Max. This is not a change that occurred<br>at the FAA beginning in 2016. This competency gap has been fomenting at<br>the agency for *decades*. You don't suddenly show up to work one day and<br>you're no longer competent.<br><br>> According to aviation consultant Dr Michael Dreikorn "a perfect storm"<br>> of circumstances are responsible, not least of which is a decline in<br>> standards at the agency.<br>><br>> "The FAA allowed its competencies at the management and technical<br>> levels to become sub-standard," says Dreikorn, a former FAA official<br>> and current principal partner at ASD Experts, an aviation consulting<br>> firm based in Florida. "They don't employ the most experienced<br>> individuals in the industry."<br>><br>> As a result, he says the agency is unable "to push back intelligently<br>> on issues."\[1\](#HGOwu){#cite-HGOwu .citation_link}<br><br>Another significant factor in the crash is the little-known fact that<br>**aircraft makers can certify parts of their own designs with limited<br>FAA oversight.** That's because aircraft require thousands of<br>highly-skilled engineers to create them. You would need at least as many<br>to oversee everything that they do.<br><br>The aircraft manufacturers employ a process called the Organizational<br>Designation Authorization (ODA), which allows them to do just that. Did<br>Trump's administration write this? Nope, implemented in *2005.* And<br>who was it that implemented the ODA? Was it the President? Was it<br>Boeing? Nope, it was Congress who mandated the FAA create the ODA.<br>Fascinating that Congress is scratching its head now, after it created<br>the conditions which led to this disaster.<br><br>There were several other factors that also led to the Max issues with<br>the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS)-induced<br>crashes The problems at the FAA were only one of those.<br><br>And no, Trump didn't cause the problem. Government did, and it happened<br>long before Trump was in office.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-HGOwu){.citation_index} [[What broke the 737 Max? \|<br>Aerospace Testing<br>International](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=67d430&url=https://www.aerospacetestinginternational.com/features/what-broke-the-737-max.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="aerospacetestinginternational.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
