<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We will see illegal abortions increase. But how *unsafe* exactly they<br>are is definitely in question.<br><br>The short answer: *abortion has become safer over the last 60 years, and<br>it's not because it was legalized.* Abortion has become safer due to<br>advances in antibiotics and medical practices.<br><br>The *myth* of "back-alley, coat-hanger abortions" was exactly that, a<br>myth, promulgated by the people trying the hardest to demonize illegal<br>abortions. Stanley Henshaw, who from 1979 to 2013 researched abortion<br>statistics at the Guttmacher Institute, said the following:<br><br>> In the 1960s, the officially recorded number of deaths from illegal<br>> induced abortion was under 300 per year. While there were undoubtedly<br>> other unreported abortion deaths, it is unlikely that the actual<br>> number was over 1,000. The figure of 5,000 to 10,000 is reasonable for<br>> the 1930s, when there were probably more abortions and less effective<br>> treatment of complications. In my opinion, if *Roe v. Wade* were<br>> overturned, women would turn to relatively safe medications that can<br>> be purchased over the Internet. There would be some deaths but<br>> probably not as many as there were in the<br>> 1960s.\[1\](#utHqd){#cite-utHqd .citation_link}<br><br>The safety of abortions is because of advances in medicine, not because<br>of legalization. We will still see illegal abortions happen, but they<br>will likely be by pill, not by coat-hanger. We will still see some<br>deaths, but not even near 300 per year. It will likely be much fewer<br>than even that.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>With the changes in laws about abortions in some of the states in the<br>USA, will this see the rise in unsafe illegal abortions?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-utHqd){.citation_index} [[Dr. Stanley Henshaw: Reflections<br>on Four Decades of Abortion<br>Research](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7235cb&url=https://www.guttmacher.org/perspectives50/dr-stanley-henshaw-reflections-four-decades-abortion-research){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="guttmacher.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
