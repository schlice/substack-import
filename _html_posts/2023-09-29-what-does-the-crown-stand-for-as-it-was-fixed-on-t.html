<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Here's an interesting truth about the Bible: *not everything in the<br>Bible is an allegory*. Sometimes, the words in the Bible mean exactly<br>what they say they mean.<br><br>What *is* symbolic is the thorn. Thorns are used throughout the<br>Bible as a symbol of evil.<br><br>> But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before<br>> you, then it shall be that those whom you let remain shall be<br>> irritants in your eyes and thorns in your sides, and they shall harass<br>> you in the land where you dwell (Numbers 33:55).<br><br>Jesus said:<br><br>> By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from<br>> thornbushes, or figs from thistles? (Matthew 7:16).<br><br>The Apostle Paul had a thorn in the flesh that he asked God to remove (2<br>Corinthians 12:7).<br><br>And of course, the Roman soldiers made a crown of thorns for Jesus to<br>wear.<br><br>But is the crown of thorns symbolic of anything else? Beyond the<br>symbolism of the thorn, no, it's really not. The Roman soldiers were<br>mocking "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews" (the sign they hung above<br>Him on the cross. In fact, if you've ever looked at Catholic crucifixes,<br>you'll usually see a little sign above Jesus that says "INRI." It stands<br>for *Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum* in Latin. Pilate ordered the sign<br>posted above Jesus on the cross).<br><br>So accordingly, while the soldiers were mocking Him, they placed a robe<br>around His shoulders, they placed a "sceptre" of a reed in His hand, and<br>they "jammed" a crown of thorns onto His head. Then they mockingly said,<br>"All hail Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews!" You can hear them<br>derisively laughing amongst themselves while they did this.<br><br>You should be able to tell then how the thorns might relate to evil, and<br>how a crown of thorns, while clearly designed to *hurt*, were also<br>symbolic of evil. The entire display was evil, and the crown of thorns<br>just topped off an entire display of humanity's fall.<br><br>One of the great principles of hermeneutics is to take Scripture in its<br>most natural, normal, customary sense. While trying to discern its<br>meaning, we try to figure out the intended meaning of the passage to the<br>target audience. And in that, *if the* *plain* *sense* *makes*<br>*sense, you've got the* *right* *sense.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
