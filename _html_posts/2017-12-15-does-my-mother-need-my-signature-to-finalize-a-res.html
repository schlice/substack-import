If you are under 18, in most states, your parent or guardian is<br>allowed to file on your behalf.<br><br>It does vary by state. In California, for example, anyone over 12 is<br>allowed to file for themselves. You should [[check your<br>state](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=982fbf&url=http://www.womenslaw.org/laws_state_type.php?statelaw_name%3DRestraining%2520Orders%26state_code%3DGE){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="womenslaw.org"}]{.qlink_container} to see what their rules<br>are for restraining orders.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
