<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm a Christian, and yes, that's what it says. And yes, **Jesus did not<br>condemn slavery, because He didn't need to.**<br><br>As with any historical document, it needs to be read from the context of<br>the community it was addressing. Slave ownership was a common practice<br>long before the time the Mosaic Law was given. The law neither<br>instituted slavery nor ended it. Instead, the law *regulated* it. It<br>gave instructions on how slaves should be treated, but did not outlaw<br>slavery altogether.<br><br>Some people will indeed choose to criticize the Bible because it did not<br>demand an end to slavery or an immediate overthrow of every<br>deeply-rooted sinful custom of the day. But, as Warren W. Wiersbe<br>pointed out, "The Lord chooses to change people and society gradually,<br>through the ministry of the Holy Spirit and the proclamation of the<br>truth of the Word of God"\[1\](#Ubqsl){#cite-Ubqsl .citation_link}<br>Alexander MacLaren wrote that the gospel "meddles directly with no<br>political or social arrangements, but lays down principles which will<br>profoundly affect these, and leaves them to soak into the general<br>mind."\[2\](#uyTWh){#cite-uyTWh .citation_link} Christianity was never<br>intended to be a movement for political change. Instead, it works in the<br>hearts and minds of individual Christ followers, who eventually enact<br>social change and affect political policy. Indeed, in the places where<br>Christianity spread and took firm hold, those Christians eventually<br>brought slavery to an end.<br><br>The fundamentals of the movement which resulted in the eventual end of<br>slavery are indeed in the Bible, which teaches that all men are created<br>by God and made in His image (Genesis 1:27), which condemns those who<br>kidnap and sell a person (Exodus 21:16; cf. 1 Timothy 1:8--10), and<br>which shows that a slave can truly be "a brother in the Lord" (Philemon<br>1:16). Clearly, following the Bible will naturally lead one to abandon<br>slavery altogether.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-Ubqsl){.citation_index} [[Wiersbe Bible Commentary 2 Vol<br>Set: Wiersbe, Warren W.: 9780781445412: Amazon.com:<br>Books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d03d1a&url=https://www.amazon.com/Wiersbe-Bible-Commentary-Vol-Commentaries/dp/0781445418){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-uyTWh){.citation_index} [[The Expositor\'s Bible : A<br>Complete Exposition of the Bible, In Six Volumes, with Index: W.<br>Robertson Nicoll: 9780801066856: Amazon.com:<br>Books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=81d0d3&url=https://www.amazon.com/Expositors-Bible-Complete-Exposition-Volumes/dp/0801066859){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
