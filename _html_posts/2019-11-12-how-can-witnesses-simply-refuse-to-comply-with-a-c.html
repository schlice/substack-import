<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can witnesses simply refuse to comply with a congressional<br>subpoena without consequences?**<br><br>There are always consequences. But it sounds like you might be thinking<br>of "getting arrested" as if a Congressional subpoena is equal in power<br>to a judge's court subpoena.<br><br>News flash: those are two different branches of government.<br><br>In this specific case, you have to remember one very important point:<br>we have three co-equal branches of government.<br><br>The Congress has no direct authority over the White House or the Courts.<br>Similarly, the White House has no direct authority over the Congress or<br>the courts, and vice versa for the courts. Each branch of government is<br>co-equal.<br><br>Congress does have investigative authority, in order to properly perform<br>its legislative function. It has to ensure that laws are working in<br>accordance with the way they were written. To that end, they can<br>subpoena information and testimony as needed to fulfill that oversight<br>function. They can also vote to open an impeachment inquiry and subpoena<br>witnesses and testimony to further that investigation.<br><br>But they're not the police, and they are not judges.<br><br>The White House, if it believes that the content or witness being<br>subpoenaed is protected by executive privilege, has an *obligation* to<br>refuse to comply with the subpoena. Congress has no authority over the<br>Executive, and if the information is truly protected by executive<br>privilege, it must be defended from release.<br><br>And if the Congress insists that executive privilege should not attach,<br>it can petition the court to intervene. Each side would get an equal<br>chance to plead their case, and the court would decide whose authority<br>should prevail in this particular instance. They would also decide if<br>the subpoena was valid and whether or not it can be enforced.<br><br>If a court were to decide such a thing, the Congress could then take<br>their subpoena to a US Attorney, who would hand it over to the FBI or<br>the US Marshall Service to enforce.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
