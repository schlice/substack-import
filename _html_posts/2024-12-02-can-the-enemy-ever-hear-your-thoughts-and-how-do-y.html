<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Satan cannot hear your thoughts. The demons cannot hear your thoughts.<br>If you examine the Bible, you see that any interaction between Satan or<br>demons and people is out loud.<br><br>You will also find in Daniel 2 the story where King Nebuchadnezzar had<br>some dreams. The king then demanded that his magicians tell him what the<br>dreams meant, but crucially, *the king did not tell them the dreams*.<br>The sorcerers could not do it because their normal source of power and<br>information were demons, and the demons were clearly unable to read the<br>king's mind. Not only did Daniel relay the king's dream back to him (as<br>was told to him by God), but he also explained what it meant.<br><br>Therefore, the Bible tells us clearly that Satan and the demons cannot<br>read your mind and they cannot hear your thoughts.<br><br>Satan and his demons can also not see the future. They are not<br>omniscient like God is.<br><br>But, and this is important, **Satan and his demons can put thoughts into<br>your mind.** The Bible clearly teaches that Satan and the demons can put<br>thoughts into your mind. For example, let's look at 1 Timothy 4:1 which<br>says:<br><br>> *Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart<br>> from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and<br>> teachings of demons, \-- 1 Tim 4:1 ESV*<br><br>Also, we can be affected by the promptings of Satan *and not even be<br>aware of it*:<br><br>> *Then Satan stood against Israel and incited David to number Israel.<br>> \-- 1 Chronicles 21:1 ESV*<br><br>If David knew that it was Satan inciting him to take a census of Israel,<br>would he have done it? No, of course he wouldn't have. But since *David<br>thought the idea came from himself, he did it.* This passage teaches us<br>that Satan can plant ideas in our mind *and make us believe that they<br>are our own.*<br><br>If Satan plants an evil thought in our mind, it doesn't come through<br>with a Darth Vader voice. Not at all. We hear Satan's thoughts in our<br>minds *as our own*. If you hear thoughts like "I'm dirty" or "I'm<br>useless" or "I'm ugly," they may sound like you telling yourself that,<br>but *not all thoughts which come into your mind are your own.*<br><br>\<br><br>So how do you stop them?<br><br>1. Understand your position in Christ. Ephesians 1:19--22 tells us<br>that Jesus is seated at God's right hand, "far above all rule and<br>authority, power and dominion." God has placed *everything* at Jesus'<br>feet, and we are told that He is now head over everything.<br><br>Ephesians 2:6 then tells us:<br><br>> *and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly<br>> places in Christ Jesus, \-- Ephesians 2:6 ESV*<br><br>Let that sink in. *We are seated with Jesus! We are seated* ***far above<br>Satan and the demons!* This means you have authority over the<br>demons!**<br><br>2. Use that power! James 4:7 is the most often quoted, and most<br>often *misquoted and misunderstood*, passage describing how to stop<br>Satan.<br><br>> *Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will<br>> flee from you. \-- James 4:7 ESV*<br><br>Let's dig into that a little. People tend to forget about the first<br>part, and you'll often hear them say, "Resist the devil and he will flee<br>from you," but that's incomplete. It's missing a crucial part. *As long<br>as you are submitting to God while you resist the devil*, he *will*<br>flee. Not he *might* flee if he feels like it, not he'll flee but then<br>come back in just a second. He *will* flee from you. This applies to<br>every Christian, no matter how weak or how strong your faith is, or how<br>long or how short a time you have been a Christian. Every believer has<br>the same power and authority over Satan in the spiritual world.<br><br>3. Do not be afraid! There is nothing big about a demon except its<br>mouth. They are like dogs with no teeth: all bark and no bite. Demons<br>are scared to death of Christians who understand the absolute magnitude<br>of power and authority they have in Christ.<br><br>In short, Satan and the demons have no power over us ***except what<br>we give them.***<br><br>Fix your eyes on Jesus and live a righteous life by faith in the power<br>of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>> *We know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on<br>> sinning, but he who was born of God protects him, and the evil one<br>> does not touch him. \-- 1 John 5:18 ESV*<br><br>4. Guard your mind! Take every thought captive. Have you ever heard<br>that before?<br><br>> *We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the<br>> knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ, \-- 2<br>> Cor 10:5 ESV*<br><br>Take every thought captive. Whether it comes from your own memory, a<br>movie, the Internet or a deceiving spirit, test every thought and see if<br>it is true. If that thought isn't true, don't believe it!<br><br>But does this mean we have to relentlessly check every thought to see if<br>it is true? Or search for demons to rebuke every five minutes? If you're<br>in a dark room and you want to see, do you shoo the darkness away? No,<br>you turn on a light! Don't focus on the enemy. Focus on the<br>*truth.*<br><br>> *Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever<br>> is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is<br>> commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy<br>> of praise, think about these things. \-- Phil 4:8 ESV*<br><br>Take heart brothers and sisters. You *can* defeat the devil!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
