<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If, by "start the foreclosure process," you mean that they can send the<br>\$249 debt to the HOA attorney for collection instead of trying to<br>collect themselves, the general answer is yes. Sending the debt to the<br>attorney allows them to place a lien on the property, and if the debt<br>goes uncollected, to foreclose on the lien to pay it.<br><br>Some states limit the amount of money owed before an HOA can send the<br>debt to collections or to the attorney, to prevent runaway HOAs from not<br>working things out before moving to liens and foreclosure. For example,<br>Florida Statutes limit HOAs to \$1000 in debt before a lien can be<br>placed. But most states do not. Most states allow liens to be placed<br>on debts as low as \$1.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
