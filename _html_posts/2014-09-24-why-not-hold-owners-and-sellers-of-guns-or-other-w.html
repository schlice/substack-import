<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Everyone\'s always looking for someone to blame in this<br>country. Heads have to roll. And it never seems to be enough to actually<br>blame the criminal. What made the criminal commit that crime? Is the<br>thought that the criminal would not have committed the crime if he<br>didn\'t have access to your weapon that he stole from your house? I<br>can\'t see how the gun owner is responsible for the bad acts of someone<br>else using his property.\<br>\<br>That said, we should require gun owners to secure their weapons in some<br>way. Technology has come a long way, and small arms gun safes can be<br>opened in complete darkness in a matter of seconds. I can open mine in<br>two seconds flat, and it has a detailed combination which uses<br>combinations of button pushes to get the door open, but when I hit the<br>combination, the door snaps into my hand and the gun is right there. If<br>we provide enough legal \"incentive,\" a gun safe can be included with<br>the purchase of almost every handgun or long gun at very discounted<br>prices. A little government incentive to salesmen, and the safes can be<br>provided free.\<br>\<br>Gun owners would be required to report any theft of weapons to police<br>within 24 hours of the theft of the weapon. Otherwise, there could be<br>some limited transfer of liability for an unsecured weapon.\<br>\<br>But that\'s something that would need a lot of coordination before<br>making it law.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
