<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>God has provided ample proof of his existence, but he has done so in a<br>way that wouldn't impact your free will.<br><br>For example, if God came down from the clouds in a flaming chariot and<br>instantly made all wars cease and zapped Satan and all of his minions<br>away forever and removed all pain and hunger and any bad thing, wouldn't<br>you believe he existed? I mean, how could you *not* believe he existed?<br><br>But if that's the case, *you wouldn't be acting freely*. Any rational<br>person would *have* to believe he exists.<br><br>In other words, God has put us in an environment filled with evidence of<br>his existence, but without his *direct presence* --- which would be so<br>powerful that it would negate our ability to reject him. God has<br>provided enough evidence in this life to convince anyone *willing* to<br>believe, but has left just enough ambiguity so as to not compel the<br>*unwilling*. By doing this, God gives us the ability to freely choose<br>him or reject him without violating our free will.<br><br>That's the purpose of this life --- to choose to love God freely, for<br>love cannot be coerced; it must be freely given.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why is God so evil not to provide proof of his existence but will send<br>me to hell for not believing in him?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
