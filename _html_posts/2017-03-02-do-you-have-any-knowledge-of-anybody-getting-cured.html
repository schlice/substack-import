<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>My answer reflects the majority medical opinion, that there is no cure<br>for MS currently.<br><br>**If you had MS, and you "did something" and cured your MS, you didn\'t<br>have MS.**<br><br>As you know, there are many diseases that look like MS. MS does not have<br>any symptoms that are unique to it. This is one of the reasons that MS<br>is known as \"the great imitator\". So there are a lot of diseases that<br>can look like MS, but be something else entirely. So it\'s highly<br>likely, therefore, that if you did something to \"cure\" your MS, you<br>didn\'t have MS in the first place. You had some other disease that very<br>closely mimicked MS.<br><br>While complementary and alternative medicines are great at helping to<br>manage MS symptoms, they cannot cure MS.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
