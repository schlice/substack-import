<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So if you're trying to "reconcile" the two, then there must be some<br>belief that they are *opposites.* In other words, you must believe that<br>"an all-powerful and benevolent God" cannot exist in the same universe<br>as "evil existing." Therefore, either an all-powerful benevolent God<br>exists and he *allows* evil, or such a God does not exist.<br><br>The first thing we need to do in order to answer this question is to<br>determine the definition of *evil* with respect to God. With God in<br>mind, therefore, evil is "anything that opposes the will of God."<br><br>God didn't create evil, because evil is not a thing that can be created,<br>like a tree or a bird. You can't have a cup of evil, or a box of evil.<br>Evil is not a thing. It is a state of being in contravention with the<br>will of God. For example, we all know that holes exist. But how do you<br>*create* a hole? You have to remove some other material. So a hole isn't<br>a thing so much as a *lack of a thing*. You can think of evil in the<br>same way.<br><br>So how can we reconcile that God, being all-powerful and benevolent,<br>hasn't simply eliminated evil?<br><br>The short answer is He will, but not yet. The Bible details His<br>plans for eliminating all evil and casting Satan and his minions into<br>hell. In other words, He is going to eliminate evil, but in His time.<br><br>It's really hard to comprehend that everything that happens is all part<br>of His good plan for us. It's hard to comprehend how an infant dying<br>from SIDS is all part of His plan. Or how a person who was going to be a<br>doctor for Doctors Without Borders and save hundreds, if not thousands<br>of lives, who was killed by a stray bullet in a gang war is part of His<br>plan. ยน<br><br>But His ways are *so much higher* than our ways, and His thoughts are<br>*so much higher* than our thoughts. We could never hope to comprehend<br>His mind. We're not commanded to not think about it, but we are<br>commanded to not "lean on" our own understanding.<br><br>> Trust in the Lord with all your heart\<br>> and lean not on your own understanding;\<br>> in all your ways submit to him,\<br>> and he will make your paths straight. --- Proverbs 3:5--6 NIV<br><br>\<br><br>The bottom line is that everything that has happened, including the<br>introduction of the first sin into the world, was all a part of God's<br>good plan.<br><br>You can see the outline of God's plan throughout the Bible. Theologians<br>generally chart out this overarching *meta-narrative* like this:<br><br>1.  Paradise (Genesis 1--2)<br>2.  Paradise lost (Genesis 3 - Revelation 20)<br>3.  Paradise regained (Revelation 21--22)<br><br>As you can see, there is a *great deal* of time spent between paradise<br>lost and paradise regained. Not surprisingly, the approximate midpoint<br>of that portion of the narrative is the cross, *which God also planned.*<br><br>Therefore, you must also understand the following:<br><br>- Man's sin was known by God before it happened.<br>- The sending of Jesus to die on the cross to atone for man's sin was<br>  pre-planned.<br>- All people will one day glorify God (Psalm 86:9), and God purposes "to<br>  bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ"<br>  (Ephesians 1:10).<br><br>Here's the pull quote: **we would never know grace if we had never<br>needed grace.** God created Adam and Eve knowing full well they would<br>sin and need grace. They were given free will, and were allowed to make<br>their own decisions. Despite their decision to disobey, it served as the<br>vehicle for God\'s ultimate plan and the manifestation of His<br>unadulterated splendor.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How can we reconcile the concept of an all-powerful and benevolent God<br>with the existence of evil in the world?<br><br>ยน This leads in to another discussion about **why bad things happen to<br>good people**, which I have already answered: [[Bill Stein\'s answer to<br>If is there a god out there why \"it\" wont protect all these full of<br>dreams victims in the terror<br>attacks?](https://www.quora.com/If-is-there-a-god-out-there-why-it-wont-protect-all-these-full-of-dreams-victims-in-the-terror-attacks/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
