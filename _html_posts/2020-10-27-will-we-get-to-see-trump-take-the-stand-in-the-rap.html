Jean Carroll?**<br><br>Even if the case is allowed to proceed, and assuming that Trump is still<br>president at the time the case goes to trial, you will not see the<br>president walk in to a courtroom to testify.<br><br>At best, Trump may provide a video recording of a deposition made<br>somewhere in the White House to accommodate his busy schedule.<br><br>Here's the facts. No sitting president has ever testified in open court.<br>President James Monroe responded to written questions as a witness in a<br>military trial in the early 1800s. President Gerald R. Ford gave a<br>deposition in 1975 in the criminal trial of the woman who aimed a gun at<br>him in San Francisco. President Bill Clinton gave two separate<br>videotaped depositions in criminal cases, but most notably, he gave a<br>four-hour videotaped statement in the Paula Jones lawsuit, which became<br>the first time a sitting president ever gave testimony in a civil case<br>in which he was a defendant.<br><br>If the case is allowed to proceed to trial, Trump will likely be held to<br>the Clinton standard and be forced to provide a video recording of a<br>deposition which will likely take place at the White House.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
