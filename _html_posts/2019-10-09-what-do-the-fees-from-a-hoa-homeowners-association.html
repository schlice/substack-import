<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The last HOA I ran had far fewer amenities. We didn't have a park, a<br>pool, or a playground. But we still had plenty of fees to cover:<br><br>- Water for the common areas, and landscaping for the same. This was our<br>  biggest expense; water in Colorado Springs is not cheap.<br>- Snow removal on the walking paths and common area sidewalks<br>- We contract for neighborhood trash service; it saves money and adds<br>  convenience for homeowners.<br>- General liability insurance on the common areas<br>- Administrative fees paid to our managing agent (the lowest expense we<br>  had).<br>- Legal fees paid to our attorney.<br><br>And that's about it. We have money available for common area wall<br>repair, fence repair, and other maintenance and upkeep. And maybe an end<br>of summer barbecue in one of the cul-de-sacs.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
