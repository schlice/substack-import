For<br>example, I can tell you that I believe that soy is bad for you, and that<br>I believe that sugar will kill you. That's free medical advice.<br><br>But I'm not a doctor, and I'm not pretending to be. I'm only giving you<br>my opinion.<br><br>Medical advice is a diagnosis based on a medical evaluation, and a<br>treatment for that diagnosis. Only a medical doctor can give a diagnosis<br>and prescribe treatments.<br><br>I can only give you my opinion and recommend you go see a doctor.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
