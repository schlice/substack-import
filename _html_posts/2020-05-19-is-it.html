<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it "assault" when someone follows me to the door of the bathroom<br>after I announce I'm going to shower?**<br><br>As always, the answer to legal questions is "it depends."<br><br>The definition of assault varies by state, but in general, a simple<br>assault takes place when someone's intentional act puts you in<br>reasonable fear of imminent harmful conduct. Also in some states,<br>"assault" is called "attempted battery." In some states, assault can be<br>combined with battery (actual harmful conduct) to make a crime called<br>"assault and battery."<br><br>In an assault, the *fear* happens when you believe that the person's<br>conduct will result in imminent harm. You don't have to believe that the<br>person will be *successful* in causing harm, just that the person is<br>*capable* of causing harm.<br><br>Your fear must also be *reasonable*. Something must cause you to believe<br>that the person intended to harm you. If there was a male locker room<br>adjacent to the female locker room, for example, then the simple fact<br>that the person followed you may be nothing more than coincidental<br>timing. So there must have been something else that caused you to<br>believe that the person was contemplating harming you, and that belief<br>needs to be reasonable. Courts use what's called the "reasonable person"<br>test to figure this out. After hearing what caused you to believe the<br>person would harm you, they would say, "Would a reasonable person, in<br>the same situation, believe the same as you?" If a court would answer<br>that question as yes, then your circumstance passes the reasonableness<br>test.<br><br>So in your circumstance, if the person following you to the bathroom<br>after you announce you are going to shower put you in reasonable fear<br>that they were going to harm you, then in most circumstances in most<br>states, that would qualify as a simple misdemeanor assault.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is legal information, not legal advice. This answer is not<br>a substitute for professional legal advice, nor is it a solicitation to<br>offer professional legal advice. This answer does not create an<br>attorney-client relationship. This answer is for GENERAL INFORMATIONAL<br>PURPOSES ONLY. If you ignore this warning and convey confidential<br>information in a private message or comment, there is no duty to keep<br>that information confidential or to forego representation adverse to<br>your interests. Seek the advice of a licensed attorney in the<br>appropriate jurisdiction before taking any action that may affect your<br>rights. If you believe you have a claim against someone, consult an<br>attorney immediately, otherwise there is a risk that the time allotted<br>to bring your claim may expire.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to legal questions are intended third<br>party beneficiaries under Quora\'s* [[*Terms of<br>Service*](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being<br>isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I<br>wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is<br>un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m<br>wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,<br>not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,<br>you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.<br>Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be<br>followed by a block and a mute. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
