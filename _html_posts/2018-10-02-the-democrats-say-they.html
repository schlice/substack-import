<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**The Democrats say they\'re going to impeach Kavanaugh from the DC<br>courts based on the allegations against him. Is this now moving into a<br>legal matter rather than just a job interview?**<br><br>Impeachment is a political process, not a legal one.<br><br>There's not enough evidence in Dr. Ford's testimony to even get a search<br>warrant in an actual court of law. And she even has standing to try.<br>There is no statute of limitations on felony sexual assault in Maryland.<br>The police in Maryland stand ready to investigate anything she wants<br>them to investigate, they've already said so in a public statement. All<br>she has to do is level the charge in Maryland. Oddly, she hasn't done<br>that. Maryland won't investigate without her say so, as they have a very<br>"victim-centered" policy, understanding that some victims don't want to<br>pursue charges, and they respect that.<br><br>Understanding that impeachment is a political process and not a legal<br>one, would Democrats have enough political capital to get an impeachment<br>vote passed? To be honest, if Kavanaugh is not appointed to the Supreme<br>Court because this specter of allegations hangs over his head, is he<br>still fit to serve on the DC Circuit, arguably the second highest court<br>in the nation? I would say that if he's not fit to serve on the Supreme<br>Court, he's not fit to serve on the DC Circuit either, and Democrats<br>would be justified in impeaching him from the bench.<br><br>I mean, they've already burned his life to ash. Why not finish the job<br>and stomp on the ashes? Impeach him from the DC Circuit. He'll never<br>practice law again. He couldn't even be a judge in a city traffic court.<br>He will be completely and utterly ruined. An allegation, completely<br>uncorroborated after seven FBI investigations, can ruin a man's<br>life. Thanks, #metoo.<br><br>We know this isn't a legal matter, but if this is a job interview, it's<br>the worst job interview ever. Either you get the job, or you'll never<br>work anywhere ever again.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
