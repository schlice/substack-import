<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You asked a "should" question, which is you asking for personal opinion.<br><br>I'll get to the opinion in just a minute.<br><br>Just in case you meant to ask the *fact* question of whether or not they<br>will face criminal charges and/or be required to register as sex<br>offenders, the answer to that is "it depends" and it depends on where<br>the crime was committed. Some states hold both youths responsible for<br>child pornography charges. Some hold just one responsible, and some hold<br>neither of them responsible.<br><br>Now, as for whether or not they *should* face criminal charges, I do not<br>believe so. They should face consequences in the *juvenile justice<br>system*, which focuses on rehabilitation and counseling, not just for<br>the children, but for their caregivers. If children are sending each<br>other nudes, there are deeper issues in both of their families which<br>need to be addressed. The adult criminal justice system does not<br>adequately address them, but the juvenile justice system does.<br><br>They absolutely should not be registering as sex offenders. They're<br>barely old enough to understand what sex is. They're not likely old<br>enough to understand the ramifications of sex, or the psychological<br>impact of sex. Because they lack the cognitive ability to understand the<br>deeper implications of sex, I don't think they even *qualify* as "sex<br>offenders." They're simply misguided youth who need a lot of counseling<br>and therapy. Hopefully they get it before they become adults.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>A 13-year-old girl sent a nude to a 14-year-old boy who then shared it<br>with others.
