<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because their ownership of a gun has nothing to do with your feelings.<br>If it did, we'd have to consult with you before we purchased guns. The<br>simple fact that no one is required to consult with you before<br>purchasing a gun should tell you that your feelings have no bearing on<br>anyone's decision to buy a gun.<br><br>Own your feelings. They are yours. Only you can fix them. You cannot fix<br>your fears by removing the source of the fear. You must find out why you<br>are fearful and work to overcome your fear.<br><br>There are probably counselors in your area who can help you with your<br>fears.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
