<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> If the police don\'t have a warrant, can they come into your home?<br><br>Yes. You can invite them, or they can force their way in. Only one of<br>those is legal. I'll let you guess which one.<br><br>> What can you do if they try to enter your home without a warrant?<br><br>Nothing. You let them come in, all the while telling them that you did<br>not grant them permission to come in. Nothing they find will be<br>admissible in court because they did not have permission to enter the<br>home in the first place.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
