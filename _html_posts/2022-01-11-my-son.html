<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, as with all legal questions, there is not "one" answer.<br>Since vaccination requirements for schools are administered at the state<br>level, it is different for every state. There are broad categories of<br>exemptions available, however.<br><br>Medical. All 50 states have legislation requiring certain vaccines<br>for students. Although exemptions vary from state to state, all school<br>immunization laws grant exemptions to children for medical reasons.<br>Doctors write notes of medical exemption, which means that there is a<br>medical reason your child cannot receive the vaccine. If your doctor<br>would not give you a medical exemption, it is because your child is not<br>medically excluded from vaccination.<br><br>Religious. There are 44 states and Washington D.C. that grant<br>religious exemptions for people who have religious objections to<br>immunizations.<br><br>Philosophical. Currently, 15 states allow philosophical exemptions<br>for children whose parents object to immunizations because of personal,<br>moral or other beliefs.\[1\](#bzjUa){#cite-bzjUa .citation_link}<br><br>Check with your state's department of education to see what exemptions<br>are available and what you must do to apply for them.<br><br>You said you refuse to get him vaccinated since it doesn't work. That's<br>not a reason to not be vaccinated. That may be a reason to believe the<br>vaccine is pointless, but it's not a reason to not do it. If it doesn't<br>work, then there's no harm in getting him vaccinated, even though you<br>know it's not going to do anything. It may be a waste of your time, but<br>it's what the school requires, so if you want him to attend public<br>school in your state, you'll need to get him the vaccinations.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>My son\'s doctor refuses to write my son a letter of vaccination<br>exemption for school, how can I force our school district to let him<br>attend because I, his parent, refuse to get him vaccinated since it<br>doesn\'t work?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-bzjUa){.citation_index} [[States With Religious and<br>Philosophical Exemptions From School Immunization<br>Requirements](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=694811&url=https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/school-immunization-exemption-state-laws.aspx){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ncsl.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
