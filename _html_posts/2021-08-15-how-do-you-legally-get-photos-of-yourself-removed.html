<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If the website does not have your permission to post the photo over<br>which you have copyright, you can send them a DMCA Takedown Notice.<br><br>[https://copyrightalliance.org/fa\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=404049&url=https://copyrightalliance.org/faqs/how-to-send-dmca-takedown-notice/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="copyrightalliance.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Larger service provider sites even have DMCA forms online that you can<br>simply fill out.<br><br>Of course, if they still refuse to take it down, you will have to retain<br>a copyright attorney and sue them for violating DMCA. So at a certain<br>point, the answer will come down to "you need a lawyer."<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How do you legally get photos of yourself removed from a website that is<br>displaying them without your consent, and are refusing to remove them?<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice. This answer is for GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. If<br>you ignore this warning and convey confidential information in a private<br>message or comment, there is no duty to keep that information<br>confidential or to forego representation adverse to your interests. Seek<br>the advice of a licensed attorney in the appropriate jurisdiction before<br>taking any action that may affect your rights. If you believe you have a<br>claim against someone, consult an attorney immediately, otherwise there<br>is a risk that the time allotted to bring your claim may expire.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to legal questions are intended<br>third-party beneficiaries with certain rights under Quora\'s* [[*Terms<br>of Service*](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
