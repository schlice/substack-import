<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Besides the fact that the 2016 platform hasn\'t been written yet, the<br>current GOP platform available at<br>[GOP.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cca836&url=http://GOP.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="gop.com"}<br>]{.qlink_container}says exactly the opposite. Consumers should be given<br>flexibility in the insurance companies they do business with: there<br>should be price transparency so people know exactly how much services<br>cost (and therefore, how much the insurance company is charging on top<br>of the cost of the covered service). Consumers should have the option to<br>purchase insurance across state lines, increasing competition and<br>driving down the cost of service.<br><br>To be fair, the GOP platform says about personal health responsibility<br>(emphasis mine):<br><br>> We believe that taking care of one's health is an individual<br>> responsibility. Chronic diseases, many of them related to lifestyle,<br>> drive healthcare costs, accounting for more than 75 percent of the<br>> nation's medical spending. To reduce demand, and thereby lower costs,<br>> **we must foster personal responsibility while increasing<br>> \preventative\ services to promote healthy lifestyles**. We believe<br>> that all Americans should have improved access to affordable,<br>> coordinated, quality healthcare, including individuals struggling with<br>> mental illness.<br><br>So what does this mean? Does this mean higher premiums for people who<br>refuse to take advantage of preventative services? Potentially, yes.<br>This is part of what taking \"personal responsibility\" when considering<br>one\'s own healthcare means.<br><br>Now, assuming you do take personal responsibility for your own<br>well-being and you are still afflicted with a chronic illness, you<br>should be afforded full and open access to quality, affordable<br>healthcare.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
