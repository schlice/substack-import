<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, God cannot "change His mind." This implies that God is both not<br>omnipotent and subject to the constraints of time.<br><br>- If God can change His mind, this indicates that before He changed His<br>  mind, He was lacking some piece of information, then He learned that<br>  piece of information, and the learning caused Him to change His mind.<br>  But God is omnipotent, and omnipotence means that He already knows<br>  everything; He lacks nothing. Therefore, God cannot change His mind.<br>- Also, this would mean that God is subject to time, because there would<br>  have to be a time "before" when God thought one way, and then a time<br>  "after" when God could think a different way. Since God is omnipresent<br>  and not subject to time, there is no "before" or "after" with God.<br>  Everything for God is now: the past is now, the present is now, and<br>  the future is now.<br><br>Second, God did not promise to never destroy the world again. God<br>promised to never *flood* the world again.<br><br>> Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him: "I now establish my<br>> covenant with you and with your descendants after you and with every<br>> living creature that was with you---the birds, the livestock and all<br>> the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with you---every<br>> living creature on earth. I establish my covenant with you: Never<br>> again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood; never again<br>> will there be a flood to destroy the earth." --- Genesis 9:8--11 NIV<br><br>Quite the opposite to your assertion, God promised that He *will*<br>destroy the world again, and the next time He does it, it will be with<br>*fire*, not water.<br><br>The promise that God will destroy the world again was revealed in the<br>Bible:<br><br>> But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will<br>> disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the<br>> earth and everything done in it will be laid bare.<br>><br>> Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people<br>> ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives as you look<br>> forward to the day of God and speed its coming. That day will bring<br>> about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will<br>> melt in the heat. --- 2 Peter 3:10--12 NIV<br><br>After the time of the Great Tribulation, the faithful will be<br>resurrected, and then the earth and everything in it will be destroyed<br>by fire. This is all revealed in Revelation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
