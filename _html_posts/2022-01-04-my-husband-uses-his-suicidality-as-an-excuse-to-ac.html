<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Get help. Not for him, but for you.<br><br>Clearly, he needs help. But if he doesn't recognize that he needs help,<br>and if he doesn't willingly go to get help, no amount of you pressuring<br>him will get him there.<br><br>So go get help for yourself. Learn some new ways to interact with him.<br>Learn some new methods to respond to him. Learn how to set your own<br>boundaries with him. Counseling can be an invaluable way to learn some<br>healthier ways to interact with him.<br><br>And hopefully when he sees just how successful your sessions are at<br>restoring you to some sense of sanity, he'll be convinced that he wants<br>that peace as well.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>My husband uses his suicidality as an excuse to act insufferable towards<br>me and when I react he says that him being suicidal makes me treat him<br>like shit. I don\'t treat him poorly because he\'s suicidal, what do I<br>do?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
