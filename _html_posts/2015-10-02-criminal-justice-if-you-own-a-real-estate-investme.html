<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In most neighborhoods, cities, and states, the owner of<br>the property (as far as the property is concerned) is still held<br>responsible for the conduct of tenants and guests in the property.\<br>\<br>This does not mean that the owner is responsible legally if someone<br>commits a murder in their house. What this means is that if a tenant<br>violates local neighborhood covenants, damages the property, etc., the<br>owner is still liable for that violation, even though his tenant<br>committed it. Therefore, any repairs/refurbishment that is required are<br>the responsibility of the property owner. Generally, owners will charge<br>\"deposits\" which are used to cover some of the costs should the owner<br>discover damage in the property which must be repaired. Deposits<br>generally cost one month\'s rent, and are provided by the tenant<br>up-front. The owner will retain the deposit once the tenant leaves to<br>cover damages.\<br>\<br>Under the terms of the lease agreement, the property owner must, on his<br>own, seek redress for all costs related to the tenant\'s behavior<br>directly from the tenant, as the tenant\'s use of the house is only<br>covered in a lease agreement. The owner is still responsible for the<br>house, and as I mentioned, is responsible for what the tenants of that<br>house do in it. The owner will have to file civil suit to reclaim the<br>costs of repairing the property, as well as reclaiming the lost revenue<br>while the home was being repaired.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
