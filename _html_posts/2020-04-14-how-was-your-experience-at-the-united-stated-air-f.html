<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How was your experience at the United Stated Air Force Academy? Are<br>complaints from Mikey Weinstein\'s Military Religious Freedom Foundation<br>overblown?**<br><br>I have no doubt that some things happened, and Weinstein's organization<br>definitely cataloged those things that happened.<br><br>People should all be aware that the military service academies are<br>staffed with people who come from society. They are not perfect robotic<br>automatons who follow social, religious, and ethical guidance to the<br>letter 100% of the time.<br><br>In other words, people make mistakes. People take things too far. I<br>think everyone understands that.<br><br>The problem I have with Mikey Weinstein: he makes the argument that<br>these problems are foundational and institutionalized, and not<br>just at USAFA, but across the Air Force and the military in general.<br><br>**This is a claim which is indeed overblown, and is, in a word,<br>untrue.**<br><br>Mikey's organization is founded on a strained reading of the First<br>Amendment. The actual words of the First Amendment:<br><br>> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or<br>> prohibiting the free exercise thereof.<br><br>The MRFF mission statement shows exactly where they have gone off the<br>rails (emphasis mine):<br><br>"The Military Religious Freedom Foundation is the sole nonprofit civil<br>rights organization dedicated to ensuring that all members of the United<br>States Armed Forces fully receive the Constitutional guarantee of both<br>freedom of religion and freedom from religion, to which they and all<br>Americans are entitled."<br><br>The First Amendment says two things about religion:<br><br>- Congress can't write a law establishing a Federal religion<br>- Congress can't write a law prohibiting anyone from freely practicing<br>  their religion, or no religion at all.<br><br>A strained reading of that second bullet (with a healthy dose of<br>entitlement and poor logic skills) says, "well, if I have the right to<br>practice no religion at all, then I also have the more broadly-worded<br>'freedom from religion' --- I have the right to be free from any mention<br>of religion."<br><br>This is a Constitutionally unsupported position, primarily because the<br>Constitution (primarily the Bill of Rights) is a compilation of<br>"negative rights" --- things that the government cannot do. The<br>government cannot write a law establishing a Federal religion. The<br>government cannot search your property without a warrant. The government<br>cannot force you to testify against yourself. The Constitution is not a<br>document of "positive rights." It does not grant rights which did not<br>previously exist. In other words, the Constitution doesn't grant you the<br>right to life. The Constitution recognizes that a right to life is<br>pre-existent, and restricts the government from unlawfully taking your<br>life.<br><br>In other words, while the Constitution prohibits the government from<br>establishing a state religion and allowing you to practice whatever<br>religion you choose (or none at all), this does not confer an<br>*obligation* on the government to keep you free from religion if you<br>choose. You may see religious symbols. You may hear people talk about<br>their religion. These may even happen on government property. None of<br>this is prohibited by the Constitution. Only if the government passes a<br>law establishing a state religion would this run afoul of the<br>Constitution. If you don't want to practice religion, don't. You're just<br>as free to go into another room as someone is free to practice their<br>religion in a room.<br><br>Unfortunately, this idea that government has an obligation to keep you<br>free from religion has invaded the minds of military leaders who are<br>just a little bit too worried about what people like Weinstein think.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
