You could certainly write it off as "just getting<br>older," but I have seen the change in myself, and it's not all due to<br>just getting older and changing tastes.<br><br>And it's all kinds of things. Food, activities, people, things I used to<br>enjoy but now don't, etc. It's subtle enough that others don't see it,<br>but I do.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What were some of the more subtle changes you've noticed since your MS<br>diagnosis?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
