<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why hasn\'t the Trump Administration considered protecting businesses<br>that reopen from financial liability if their employees return to work<br>and become infected with Choronavirus?**<br><br>Because it's unneeded.<br><br>Your employment is at-will. If a business opens in accordance with<br>the law, and you freely choose to go work there, you take that risk on<br>to yourself. Clearly, the business must present a "safe" work<br>environment (or as safe as they can make it), but beyond OSHA<br>requirements for a safe workplace, you take the risk of viral infection<br>on yourself.<br><br>In other words, you have imputed additional liability where none exists.<br><br>Businesses already provide health care for their employees who meet the<br>criteria for it. Businesses have taken precautions to prevent the spread<br>of COVID-19 (additional cleaning, reminding customers about separation<br>guidelines, etc). The business is no more responsible for any one person<br>(customer or employee) contracting the virus than the government is for<br>allowing the business to re-open.<br><br>Secondarily, you can't prove that you contracted a virus in any one<br>place, so how can you assign liability when you can't prove that the<br>entity you target had acted negligently?<br><br>**TL;DR: It's no one's fault if you get a virus, unless someone<br>maliciously targeted you with a cough or a sneeze.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
