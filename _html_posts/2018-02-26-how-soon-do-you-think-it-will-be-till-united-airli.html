<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How soon do you think it will be till United Airlines backs out of the<br>public anti-NRA stand too?**<br><br>Delta is doing themselves a terrible disservice by being so limp-wristed<br>on their public stance.<br><br>They're now claiming that taking a stance against the NRA is actually a<br>"netural position."<br><br>> *Delta's decision reflects the airline's neutral status in the current<br>> national debate over gun control amid recent school shootings. Out of<br>> respect for our customers and employees on both sides, Delta has taken<br>> this action to refrain from entering this debate and focus on its<br>> business. Delta continues to support the 2nd Amendment.*<br><br>It takes quite a leap of logic to "take an action" in order to "refrain<br>from entering the debate."<br><br>If they wanted to refrain from entering the debate, they simply would<br>not "pick and choose" which groups to whom they would provide group<br>discounts, instead of doing what they are doing today.<br><br>And it will not go unnoticed when NRA members simply choose to fly some<br>other carrier instead of United or Delta.<br><br>Remember, it's not the NRA's lobbying efforts that have power, it's<br>their constituency.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
