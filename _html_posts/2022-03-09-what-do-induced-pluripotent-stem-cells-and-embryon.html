<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You are referring to induced pluripotent *adult* stem cells and<br>embryonic stem cells.<br><br>What they have in common is that they can both become any cell in the<br>body.<br><br>But they have differences. The big difference: adult stem cells can be<br>harvested from several places in the body, and they are not tumorigenic<br>or immunogenic. Embryonic stem cells can only be harvested from human<br>embryos, and they are both immunogenic and tumorigenic. Additionally,<br>through the harvesting process, the embryo is destroyed. So there is a<br>very large issue regarding the destruction of human life involved.<br><br>Oh, and induced pluripotent adult stem cells have been treating people<br>successfully for years, while embryonic stem cells have yet to treat a<br>single person successfully.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What do induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells have in<br>common?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
