<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are two major ones:<br><br>1.  The first life. In order for macroevolution to occur, you must<br>    evolve *from* something. So macroevolution, even if it is true that<br>    one species can evolve into another, still must start with a living<br>    being which was created out of nothing, and macroevolution cannot<br>    answer how that happened. Intelligent design still explains that<br>    better than macroevolution. Evolutionists will hand-wave that away,<br>    saying that it's irrelevant to macroevolution, but I submit that<br>    it's pointless to investigate macroevolution because it is<br>    impossible for it to have actually occurred without explaining where<br>    the first life came from.\<br>    \<br>    In other words, even if evolution is true, the first life didn't<br>    evolve. Evolution is a pointless discussion if you can't (or won't)<br>    provide evidence to show where that first life came from.<br>2.  DNA. No one can explain how an intelligent message was randomly<br>    assembled, because all of the evidence we have shows us that a<br>    message (specified complexity) comes only from intelligence. DNA is<br>    a perfect example of specified complexity, and evolution cannot<br>    explain how DNA evolved from nothing.\<br>    \<br>    DNA, in computer programming terms, is the world's most complex<br>    piece of software to ever have been created, and yet evolutionists<br>    believe it randomly self-assembled (regardless of the mechanism they<br>    have contrived). They haven't proven that it actually did assemble<br>    that way; it's all theory. They have no evidence. They show how<br>    small steps *could have* assembled and then induce how the larger<br>    process may have happened. But the likelihood of that induction is<br>    extremely small (in other words, the gap between what they know and<br>    what they believe is very large).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
