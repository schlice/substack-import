<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [The fine is based on the offense, not the ability to pay<br>it. The 14th Amendment says the law must be applied equally to all<br>people. That means you can\'t discriminate in your application of the<br>law, no matter how much more fair it might be to fine the rich person<br>more.\<br>\<br>Taxes are specifically authorized by Constitutional amendment to be as<br>they are. If you want speeding tickets to match taxes, you will<br>similarly have to pass a Constitutional Amendment to do<br>it.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-arent-traffic-fines-scaled-according-to-the-income-of-the-driver/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
