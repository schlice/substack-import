<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Since they weren\'t actually convicted of anything,<br>you\'re not really going to find *statistics* that show those numbers.\<br>\<br>You might be better served looking for the number of unsolved murders in<br>the country. Then perhaps you could extrapolate a portion of the<br>population.\<br>\<br>But it won\'t be accurate, because one person can kill more than one<br>other person, go dormant for 10 years, and do it again. You could come<br>close, but you could never get accuracy.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
