<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No it is not.<br><br>The Constitution does not forbid schools from beginning their day with<br>prayer, so long as the prayer cannot be construed as the state<br>*establishing* a state religion, which would violate the 1st Amendment.<br><br>*THAT SAID...*<br><br>In practice, splitting that baby is too difficult to do, and there is<br>strong reason to believe that *prayer* is not ideal in a public school<br>which can host students of all faiths (or no faith at all).<br><br>Instead, if schools start their day with a moment of silence (during<br>which students of faith may pray in their own prescribed manner, or<br>students of no faith may contemplate whatever they choose), this would<br>allow for "prayer time" for those who choose to pray, without unduly<br>"imposing" religion on the non-religious, and not unconstitutionally<br>establishing a state religion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
