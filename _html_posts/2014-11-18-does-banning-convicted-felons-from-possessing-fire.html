<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I think in the event of armed uprising, convicted felons<br>will \"conveniently forget\" that they are convicted felons, and will go<br>visit Big Joe in the alley and buy a MAC-10 for \$100 (no background<br>check, no worries) out of his trunk and participate in the uprising.\<br>\<br>So ultimately I don\'t think that\'s going to be the \"long pole in the<br>tent\" that prevents an armed overthrow of the government. I think we\'d<br>have much bigger problems than the fact that the law doesn\'t allow Joe<br>Felon to buy a gun from the gun store.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
