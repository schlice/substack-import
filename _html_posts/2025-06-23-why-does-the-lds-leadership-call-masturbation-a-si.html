<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm a Christian, not a Mormon, but even Christians call solo<br>masturbation a sin.<br><br>I qualified "solo" because what you do with your spouse together, just<br>the two of you, in a committed marital relationship, is not sinful, and<br>that includes mutual masturbation. And the reason is that, while the<br>Bible does not specifically address masturbation, the Bible does address<br>God's purpose for sex and marriage.<br><br>According to 1 Corinthians 7:2--5:<br><br>> Each man should have sexual relations with his own wife, and each<br>> woman with her own husband. The husband should fulfill his marital<br>> duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. The wife does<br>> not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband. In<br>> the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body<br>> but yields it to his wife. Do not deprive each other except perhaps by<br>> mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to<br>> prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you<br>> because of your lack of self-control.<br><br>Implicit in this passage are these truths:<br><br>- God's plan for sex requires *relationship*, namely, that of a husband<br>  and wife (verse 2). Solo masturbation is sex disconnected from<br>  relationship.<br>- Foundational to God's plan for sex is *giving one's body to another*<br>  (verse 4). Solo masturbation is the keeping of one's body to oneself.<br>- The solution to a time of deprivation is to "*come together*" (verse<br>  5). Solo masturbation is done alone, not together.<br><br>So right away, we see that solo masturbation is not in keeping with<br>God's plan for us, and the answers for married couples are all right<br>there. But there are so many who say that it's good to masturbate by<br>yourself to equalize the libidos of two sexual partners. It releases<br>marital tension when one spouse is more sexually active than another,<br>and therefore builds a healthier marriage, which in itself is<br>God-honoring. The biblical description of sex in marriage, however,<br>doesn't allow for that. It says that the woman yields her body to her<br>husband; it's her responsibility to take care of his needs, just as it's<br>his responsibility to address her needs. In that way, God's plan for sex<br>is that spouses give themselves to each other. Any sexual activity apart<br>from that goal is, therefore, sinful.<br><br>Singles say that it's a *physical need* that they must fulfill or they<br>can't sleep, their work suffers, etc. However, the Bible never presents<br>sexual fulfillment as a need. On the contrary, Paul says to the<br>unmarried, "It's better to stay unmarried" (verse 8). Paul continues in<br>verse 9, where he identifies the proper outlet for single people who<br>struggle with sexual desire: "If they cannot control themselves, they<br>should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion." Paul<br>suggests that self-control (one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit) is the<br>best answer. To singles who lack self-control, Paul does not say, "Let<br>them masturbate;" he says, "Let them marry." Again, marriage is the<br>God-given outlet for sexual tension, not masturbation.<br><br>So, is solo masturbation a sin? The Bible does not directly answer this<br>question, but there definitely are some biblical principles to apply:<br><br>1.  "So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the<br>    glory of God" (1 Corinthians 10:31). If we cannot give God glory for<br>    something, we should not do it.<br>2.  "Everything that does not come from faith is sin" (Romans 14:23). If<br>    we are not fully convinced that an activity is honoring to God, it<br>    is a sin.<br>3.  "I will not be mastered by anything" (1 Corinthians 6:12).<br>    Christians have a responsibility to avoid anything that might<br>    enslave them.<br>4.  "I discipline my body and keep it under control" (1 Corinthians<br>    9:27). Self-denial is difficult, but self-discipline is worth it.<br>5.  "The fruit of the Spirit is . . . self-control" (Galatians<br>    5:22--23). Masturbation is almost always a sign of a lack of<br>    self-control.<br>6.  Do "not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the flesh desires what<br>    is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the<br>    flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to<br>    do whatever you want" (Galatians 5:16--17). We are called to<br>    self-denial, not to self-gratification.<br><br>These truths should have an impact on what we do with our bodies. In<br>light of the above principles, it is doubtful that solo masturbation can<br>be a God-honoring activity. If it could be done with<br><br>- no lust in the heart<br>- no immoral thoughts<br>- no pornography<br>- no self-gratification of the flesh<br>- full assurance that it is good and right<br>- thanks given to God<br><br>then perhaps it would be allowable. But those qualifiers seem to negate<br>the very reasons why people engage in solo masturbation.<br><br>So while I commiserate, I cannot condone, Biblically. For these reasons,<br>I believe solo masturbation is sinful in the vast majority of cases.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
