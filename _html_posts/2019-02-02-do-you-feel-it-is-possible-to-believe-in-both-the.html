<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you feel it is possible to believe in both the 2nd amendment and<br>gun control?**<br><br>No.<br><br>The Second Amendment is unchangeable without a Constitutional amendment.<br>While it is open to interpretation, it can't be changed wholesale.<br><br>Gun control is as nebulous a concept as you can possibly get. What<br>exactly does that mean? Does it mean actual things like universal<br>background checks or does it mean abstract, useless things like banning<br>certain configurations of firearms, magazine capacity limits, waiting<br>periods, and other "feel-good" measures with no actual benefit?<br><br>Without a good discussion regarding what "gun control" looks like, and<br>an agreement on what it is and what it is not, you're never going to be<br>able to come to consensus on what needs to be "controlled."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
