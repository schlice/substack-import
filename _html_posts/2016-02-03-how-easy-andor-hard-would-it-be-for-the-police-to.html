<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you\'re talking about physically locating a phone, rather easy. The<br>cryptophone still has a phone number, and still connects and registers<br>with a cell tower. Therefore, with the proper warrants, the police can<br>get the location of that handset to within a few city blocks of that<br>tower. If you\'re moving, triangulation can actually get them even more<br>precise.<br><br>If you\'re talking about the police\'s ability to read your text<br>messages or listen in on your phone conversations on your cryptophone<br>(as long as you are communicating with someone else who also has a<br>cryptophone), then even if the police have a wiretap warrant, they<br>won\'t hear anything but gibberish, and your SMS messages will be<br>nothing but unreadable text. Your SMS messages and your voice will all<br>be encrypted end-to-end between handsets.<br><br>If you\'re using third-party services from your cryptophone, you may<br>still be able to be monitored through those services, so caution is in<br>order. You will need to use the handset\'s secure mail application, and<br>the receiving party will need to do the same, when using email.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
