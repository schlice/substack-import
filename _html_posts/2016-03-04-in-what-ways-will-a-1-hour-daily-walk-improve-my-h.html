<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is, of course, \"it depends,\" or (actually very<br>appropriately), \"YMMV\" (your mileage may vary). And these comparisons<br>are to doing nothing (i.e. walking fewer than 6,000 steps per day which<br>is technically considered \"sedentary\").<br><br>If you take a *brisk* walk for one hour a day, you will likely<br>exceed 10,000 steps. This is the goal to shoot for: a brisk walk,<br>breaking the 10,000 step mark.<br><br>What will 10,000 steps a day do for me?<br><br>> A 2011<br>> [study(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=15d6d9&url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3169444/){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="nih.gov"}]{.qlink_container} published in the<br>> *International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity*<br>> found walking 10,000 steps a day had a significant impact on body fat<br>> and waist and hip measurements when compared to walking 6,000 steps a<br>> day. Women who averaged more than 10,000 steps were 4 to 6 inches<br>> narrower in their waist and hip measurements and had 40 percent less<br>> body fat than subjects who averaged less than 6,000 steps.<br>><br>> Doing 10,000 steps per day not only helps with weight management but<br>> it can also help reduce blood pressure in women. A 2000<br>> [study(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=393917&url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11131268){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="nih.gov"}]{.qlink_container} published in the journal<br>> *Hypertension Research* found walking 10,000 steps per day or more is<br>> effective in lowering blood pressure, increasing exercise capacity,<br>> and even reducing sympathetic nerve activity in hypersensitive<br>> patients --- regardless of exercise intensity or duration.<br>> Participants\' blood pressure dropped after just 24 weeks of the<br>> 10,000 steps per day program. \1\<br><br>You may have to work up to 10,000 steps. For example, if you walk at<br>about 3 miles per hour, this means that walking for 20 minutes will take<br>you one mile. 10,000 steps is about 5 miles. So at 3 miles per hour,<br>you\'d have to walk for 1 hour and 40 minutes to achieve that goal. So<br>start small, and increase your speed gradually so that you\'re walking<br>faster, closer to 4 miles per hour. Combined with the general walking we<br>do during the day, you can easily achieve 10,000 steps a day.<br><br>Pedometers that track your step count for the day can be more expensive<br>(like a Fitbit) or really really cheap (like a small step-counting<br>pedometer you clip to your waistband, usually for between \$1 and \$3),<br>but clipping it on or putting it on in the morning and wearing it all<br>day will help you achieve that 10,000 step goal.<br><br>*Remember to consult with your doctor before you start* *any*<br>*exercise program.*<br><br>\<br><br>\1\ [[Can Anyone Really Walk 10K Steps Every Single<br>Day?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2a851a&url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/walk-walk-10k-steps-day-challenge-promotes-weight-loss-and-fitness-it-realistic-343268){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="medicaldaily.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
