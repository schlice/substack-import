<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Sam Harris claims Brett Kavanaugh lied and doesn\'t deserve to be on<br>the Supreme Court of the United States, do you agree or disagree? Why?**<br><br>Whether or not Brett Kavanaugh lied is a matter of fact to be decided in<br>a court of law, since we're talking about Federal charges. We do not<br>have the requisite information available to even think about what to do<br>next until we decide what to do *first*. If Congress believes that<br>Kavanaugh lied, then Congress will have to engage the FBI and open an<br>investigation into whether or not Federal charges of lying to Congress<br>can be pursued.<br><br>If Brett Kavanaugh "knowingly and willingly made **materially false<br>statements to Congress,"** meaning that the lies had to be knowingly<br>made (he knew the right answer and he said the opposite with the intent<br>to mislead), and the lies had to be material, that *the lies were of<br>such a significant nature that if he had answered truthfully then it<br>would have changed a yes vote to a no*, then I would absolutely question<br>whether or not he should be allowed to remain a judge at all.<br><br>But we're not even close to being at that point.<br><br>Anyone offering such an opinion is simply bloviating at this point. If<br>Congress has the political will to attempt to prosecute a "lying to<br>Congress" charge, then we'll talk.<br><br>Until then, it's all speculation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
