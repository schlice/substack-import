<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes.<br><br>Want to know the worst part? They don't even have to tell you why you<br>are being arrested. They only have to tell the judge.<br><br>I mean generally, it makes it a little easier when they tell you why<br>you're being arrested, but there is no law (usually, I can't speak for<br>every state) requiring a police officer to tell you why you are being<br>arrested. They simply must be able to articulate their probable cause to<br>a judge.<br><br>The police have to have probable cause to arrest you, which means<br>that they have a reasonable basis for believing that a crime may have<br>been committed. And if they can articulate that probable cause to the<br>judge, their arrest is valid.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
