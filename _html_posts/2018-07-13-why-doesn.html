<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why doesn't Twitter ban nude pictures? Isn't it illegal to look at<br>them in the US?**<br><br>It is not illegal to look at nude pictures in the United States. The<br>First Amendment actually prohibits the government making any laws that<br>would restrict free speech, and nude photographs are generally covered<br>by freedom of expression. They can limit that speech by requiring that<br>Twitter protect that speech from consumption by minors, but they can't<br>pass a law making it illegal to post them.<br><br>Twitter, on the other hand, is not the government. Twitter is a<br>private company, and it can regulate the content on its own platform<br>however it chooses. If Twitter chose to restrict that content or<br>eliminate it altogether, it can absolutely do that if it wants to. But<br>that's a decision for Twitter to make.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
