<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There's a lot of things which are Biblical which Paul doesn't mention.<br><br>- Paul never mentioned "disciples." Does that mean that discipleship<br>  died out with the last of the apostles? Did Paul not believe in<br>  discipleship?<br>- Paul never mentioned "hell" a single time in his writings. Does this<br>  mean that Paul didn't believe in hell?<br><br>This is a logical fallacy called the "argument from silence." It claims<br>that because something is not mentioned, it must not exist. If that's<br>the case, then the entire Christian notion of the Trinity is called into<br>question, because nowhere in the Bible is the Trinity mentioned. But<br>just because you can't find the word "trinity" in the Bible doesn't mean<br>that the truth of the Trinity is not reality, or that it is not<br>discussed at all.<br><br>So back to the question at hand. Just because Paul didn't mention<br>confession of sins does not mean that it is unbiblical or that it<br>doesn't apply to us. This isn't the Bible of Paul; this is the Bible of<br>God. Paul is just one writer of forty who contributed inspired works to<br>the Bible.<br><br>There are plenty of other places where confession of sins is mentioned:<br><br>> *"Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper, but the one who<br>> confesses and renounces them finds mercy." --- Proverbs 28:13 NIV*<br>><br>> *"Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity.<br>> I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the Lord." And you<br>> forgave the guilt of my sin." --- Psalm 32:5 NIV*<br><br>And lest you say, "Well, that's in the Old Testament, it doesn't apply<br>to us," it was actually Paul who said that the Old Testament is God's<br>word:<br><br>> *"All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for<br>> reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; --- 2 Timothy<br>> 3:16 NASB*<br>><br>> *For whatever was written in former days was written for our<br>> instruction, that through endurance and through the encouragement of<br>> the Scriptures we might have hope. --- Romans 15:4 ESV*<br><br>Paul is referring to the Old Testament here, since the New Testament<br>wasn't even written at the time he was writing his letters to Timothy or<br>the Romans. And everything in the Old Testament that is not abrogated or<br>superseded by the New Testament is authoritative as a rule of faith and<br>applies as much as the New Testament to Christians.<br><br>\<br><br>It's a dangerous road to travel when you look at the fact that Paul<br>never mentioned confession of sins, and then use that silence as<br>authoritative. Paul, in fact, was very clear that if believers did not<br>deal with certain sins, especially sexual or adulterous sin, they would<br>never inherit the Kingdom of God.<br><br>> *Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of<br>> God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters<br>> nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the<br>> greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the<br>> kingdom of God." --- 1 Cor 6:9--10 NIV*<br>><br>> *"The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and<br>> debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits<br>> of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy;<br>> drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that<br>> those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God." ---<br>> Galatians 5:19--21 NIV*<br>><br>> *For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person --<br>> such a person is an idolater -- has any inheritance in the kingdom of<br>> Christ and of God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for<br>> because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are<br>> disobedient." --- Ephesians 5:5--6 NIV*<br><br>Be careful not to fall into the false view that both Paul and the<br>scriptures take sin lightly, that sin does not need to be confessed at<br>all, and any sin (including the sin of visiting prostitutes) can just be<br>"settled" by assuring them about their position of righteousness in<br>Christ. The danger is that believers could potentially be careless and<br>flippant about how they treat sins in their lives, and that may<br>eventually lead them to hell. It could also lead believers to the false<br>notion that they can continue to sin indefinitely, because they are<br>certain that the cross absolved them of any sins which they knowingly<br>commit. That's the deadly deception of this notion that many have fallen<br>into.<br><br>Do you think Paul taught about those sins which could disqualify<br>believers from entering heaven in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, Ephesians 5:5-6<br>and Galatians 5:19-21, and then didn't give them a chance to confess and<br>repent? I don't think so. Every sin, even the most heinous, can be<br>repented of and be forgiven by God. That is the true grace of God.<br><br>Paul is effectively warning believers in the three passages above to<br>turn back to God by confessing and repenting of their sins to obtain<br>God's forgiveness in order to not be excluded from heaven. In other<br>words, confession of sins was presupposed to be necessary to Paul,<br>even though he did not explicitly mention it.<br><br>We can also, therefore, assume that Paul taught on the confession of<br>sins, even though it wasn't recorded in his letters.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
