<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can a new traffic signal go up without warning?<br><br>Yes, if that's how your city operates.<br><br>Most cities (and states) follow Federal guidelines for when and where to<br>install traffic signals. The guidelines state what volume of traffic<br>must be present on the streets before a signal can go up, or<br>(gruesomely) how many fatal car accidents have to happen at that<br>intersection before a light can go in.<br><br>Funny story, I remember a planning meeting where state money was being<br>allocated for intersection safety, and the woman said that the only<br>remaining money was to be slated for intersections where death had<br>occurred, and one of our city project managers who was investigating<br>improvements for a particular intersection raised her hand and said, "I<br>have death!" I am reasonably sure that this sentence, uttered anywhere<br>else but this meeting, would have been quite strange.<br><br>Anyway, those guidelines for intersections are just guidelines. If your<br>state chooses not to follow those guidelines, then yes, a city can put<br>up a traffic signal anywhere they choose and any time they have money to<br>spend.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
