<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Separation of church and state. The state cannot impose a law on a<br>church which would violate church rules or beliefs.<br><br>Priests are bound by \"the sacramental seal.\" This is also called \"the<br>seal of the confessional\" or \"the seal of confession.\" From [[the<br>Catholic Education<br>Center](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5e2f23&url=http://catholiceducation.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="catholiceducation.org"}]{.qlink_container} (emphasis mine):<br><br>> The sacramental seal is inviolable. Quoting Canon 983.1 of the Code of<br>> Canon Law, the Catechism states, \"\...It is a crime for a confessor<br>> in any way to betray a penitent by word or in any other manner or for<br>> any reason\" (No. 2490). A priest, therefore, cannot break the seal to<br>> save his own life, to protect his good name, to refute a false<br>> accusation, to save the life of another, to aid the course of justice<br>> (like reporting a crime), or to avert a public calamity. **He cannot<br>> be compelled by law to disclose a person\'s confession or be bound by<br>> any oath he takes, e.g. as a witness in a court trial.** A priest<br>> cannot reveal the contents of a confession either directly, by<br>> repeating the substance of what has been said, or indirectly, by some<br>> sign, suggestion, or action. A Decree from the Holy Office (Nov. 18,<br>> 1682) mandated that confessors are forbidden, even where there would<br>> be no revelation direct or indirect, to make any use of the knowledge<br>> obtained in the confession that would \"displease\" the penitent or<br>> reveal his identity.<br><br>Since the state cannot make a law compelling a priest to violate the<br>teachings of his religion, a priest cannot be compelled to divulge<br>anything he heard in confession, regardless of the benefit of the<br>outcome of such a reporting. Such a law would be in violation of the<br>First Amendment freedom of religion (\"Congress shall make no law<br>respecting an establishment of religion, or **prohibiting the free<br>exercise thereof**\"). This has been interpreted to mean that Congress<br>cannot legislate the practices of any individual religion, or religion<br>as a whole. The Catholic Church holds the seal of confession inviolable;<br>therefore, the state cannot create a law mandating that the church<br>violate that seal.<br><br>On the other hand, psychiatrists and other medical professionals are<br>bound by doctor-patient privilege, which is a *state* construct, not<br>a *religious* one. Inherent in doctor-patient privilege is the notion<br>that a doctor must report someone who is a danger to himself or others<br>to proper law enforcement personnel. This is part of the rules of<br>doctor-patient privilege: under most circumstances, a doctor cannot<br>reveal anything about your personal health to anyone you do not specify.<br>You can specify persons to whom a doctor is allowed to discuss your<br>personal health information (e.g. your spouse); you cannot similarly<br>give a priest the authorization to break the seal of confession.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
