<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This particular trope has always amused me, like Adam was so morally<br>upright and Eve was just such a master manipulator that she *convinced*<br>Adam to eat the fruit against his better judgement...but she was still<br>tricked by a talking snake? How exactly do you square that circle?<br><br>No, Adam was *just as guilty* as Eve. Adam knew, just as Eve did, that<br>eating the fruit was *verboten*. But Adam, just like Eve, succumbed to<br>that most insidious of sins: *envy.*<br><br>The serpent convinced Eve (and Adam by proxy) that God was keeping<br>something from them. That God was somehow "holding back" something that<br>the two had a right to have. And they became *envious* of that thing.<br><br>This was their sin, and they both engaged in it equally. No doubt,<br>the serpent (driven by Satan) was absolutely guilty of tricking them<br>into their envy, using their naïveté and their free will against them<br>(ironically, because he was jealous of God's love for His human<br>creation). But Adam and Eve both knew that eating from the tree was<br>wrong, and they did it anyway.<br><br>No, Eve was not more guilty than Adam. No sin is greater than any<br>other¹. All sin convicts us equally.<br><br>\<br><br>¹ Except for blaspheming the Spirit, which could only be done during the<br>time of Jesus. Only that sin was unforgivable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
