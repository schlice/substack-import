<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Protesters should accept that the election is over, and no amount of<br>protesting is going to change the outcome. If that's why you're<br>protesting, go home. You're wasting your time. The vast majority of the<br>votes have been counted (there are still some absentee ballots which<br>will not be counted in some states, but they don't count, no pun<br>intended). You're not going to find any more under a dinner plate<br>somewhere. That particular part of the election is over.<br><br>Protesters should accept that every citizen in the United States has<br>*one vote*, and they have the right to vote for whoever they choose. If<br>you want to protest something, protest the fact that there were people<br>in the United States who voted for Harambe (the dead gorilla from the<br>Cincinnati Zoo). Protest stupidity. Do not disparage the people who cast<br>their votes, regardless of who they voted for (unless they voted for<br>Harambe; that's just stupid). I find it downright dangerous that we have<br>moved away from protesting against the man and casting aspersions on the<br>people who voted for him. That is not how democracy works. Remember<br>"love trumps hate" from just a few weeks ago? Would you say that calling<br>the people that voted for Trump racist xenophobic bigots is love, or<br>hate? I'm not hearing lots of love there...<br><br>Protesters should not accept anything from the president-elect that<br>they disagree with. If you're going to protest anything at all, protest<br>the policies of the president-elect. You're kinda wasting your time<br>until he actually assumes office and implements policies (since we know<br>that campaign rhetoric and actual policy are two very different things).<br>*Then* you have something to protest! But currently, you're protesting<br>*the media's representation* of the man, and we know the media is<br>spot-on 100% of the time, right? \</sarcasm\> Hey, if you can earn a<br>decent living off of the teat of George Soros, feel free to protest the<br>president-elect every day. Whatever floats your boat. But if you want to<br>tout how "democracy works," the First Amendment allows you to<br>"*peaceably* *assemble."* It says nothing about riots. Rioting is<br>illegal, and if it continues once the president-elect becomes president,<br>expect a crackdown. So stand there with your signs and your chants all<br>you want. Start destroying property or looting stores and expect your<br>"protest" to get shut down.<br><br>I believe that you protesters don't really know the man. I truly don't.<br>I believe you know the media representation of him, but I don't think<br>you really know him. Of course, it's only anecdotal, but I meet people<br>roughly weekly who have spoken directly to him and no one has had an<br>unkind thing to say about him. It doesn't matter what their job is. I<br>spoke to a housekeeper this morning who also sees the disconnect between<br>the man she knows and the man portrayed by the media.<br><br>So perhaps we should think about giving him a fair shake and seeing what<br>kind of policies he implements. Heck, he hasn't even taken office yet.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
