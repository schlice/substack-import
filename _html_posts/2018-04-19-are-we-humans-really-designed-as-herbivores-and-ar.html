<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it true that we humans are only to eat vegetables?<br><br>Let's look at human physiology, and let's see if it is appropriate to<br>categorize humans as herbivores:<br><br>- Human digestive tracts are shorter than herbivores, but longer than<br>  carnivores. Granted, it's closer to herbivores than carnivores, but<br>  it's not exactly either. We do not possess multiple stomachs or chew<br>  cud like herbivores.<br>- Humans cannot produce vitamin C on their own; they can only derive it<br>  from plant sources. Carnivores and some omnivores produce their own<br>  vitamin C.<br>- Humans produce hydrochloric acid, which is totally unnecessary for<br>  herbivores. It allows humans to digest a wide variety of plant and<br>  animal food sources.<br>- Humans cannot digest fiber like herbivores.<br><br>It is clear that we are neither designed to be herbivores nor are we<br>designed to be carnivores. Physiologically, we are more likely mixed<br>eaters (omnivores). Vegetarianism is a lifestyle choice enabled by a<br>first world food chain, not required by physiology.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
