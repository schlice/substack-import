<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So you're saying that God will whip out His big book of "all the people<br>who have wronged you" and will list them off for you?<br><br>Probably not.<br><br>So maybe instead, you can do it yourself! When you get there, you can<br>say, "Hey God, I would have been a much better person if it weren't for<br>X and Y and Z and A and B and C who wronged me."<br><br>How do you think that strategy is going to work for you?<br><br>When you are going through counseling recovering from trauma, you learn<br>to let go of your anger towards others. You learn that you cannot<br>control what other people do; you can only control *how you react* to<br>what other people do.<br><br>So it's not about *them*. It's about *you*.<br><br>**Part of forgiveness is learning to live with the consequences of<br>someone else's sin.**<br><br>Now you might think, "Well gee, that's not fair." And you'd be right.<br>It's not fair. But it is *just*. Because it's not about what they did,<br>it's about how you respond to what they did. So you will have to live<br>your life with the consequences of others' sins.<br><br>The only *real* choice you have is whether to do that in the bondage of<br>bitterness, or in the freedom of forgiveness.<br><br>The other thing you learn in recovery is little catchphrases. One that<br>sticks out in this situation is *Let Go and Let God*. That means<br>it's up to you to let go of your desire for revenge, and let God handle<br>them.<br><br>> Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God,<br>> for it is written, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord."<br>> \-- Romans 12:19 ESV<br><br>Now, God isn't telling you here to forget about what was done. Far from<br>it. What He's saying here is that if you give it to Him, He will ensure<br>that it is not forgotten about. You don't have to be the one to hang on<br>to that guilt and that anger and that desire for vengeance. Give it to<br>God, because He promises that He will repay.<br><br>In other words, even if you let them off the hook, *you're not letting<br>them off of God's hook.*<br><br>When you do that, you free *yourself* from the guilt and the anger and<br>the desire for vengeance. Forgiving and letting God is to set a captive<br>free, *and then to realize that it was you who was captive*. You were<br>being held back by your guilt and your anger. Letting go and letting God<br>is the method by which we let go of all that holds us back, while<br>knowing that God will repay in the end.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
