<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>TL;DR: This is an attempt to capitalize on the fact that the<br>terrorists in San Bernardino used rifles to try to get some scary<br>looking guns off the street.<br><br>Short answer: Nope.<br><br>Long answer: This is yet another re-hashing of the \"scary-looking\"<br>assault weapons ban. Basically, something is classified as a<br>semi-automatic assault weapon if it accepts a magazine and has any one<br>of the following \"scary-looking\" attachments (with appropriate sarcasm<br>inserted):<br><br>- A pistol grip (which clearly makes you a terrorist)<br>- A forward grip (you mean like all rifles and shotguns?)<br>- A folding, telescoping, or detachable stock (because that makes the<br>  weapon more deadly, that\'s for sure)<br>- A grenade launcher or rocket launcher (really?)<br>- A barrel shroud (you mean like all rifles and shotguns).<br>- A threaded barrel (to accept illegal attachments like those scary<br>  \"muzzle brakes\")<br><br>So because it \"looks scary,\" or was \"once used by terrorists,\" it\'s<br>an \"assault weapon.\" And because it fires one round with one trigger<br>pull and then uses the gas to chamber another round (like everything not<br>a revolver or the vast majority of shotguns), it\'s a \"semi-automatic<br>assault weapon.\" Those can no longer be sold under this bill. Wow,<br>that\'s great for the economy. Go free markets, yay.<br><br>This means that all the ones we currently have are \"grandfathered.\"<br>Except that all the grandfathered ones now must be locked. At all times.<br>No exceptions. Even for using it. Yes, that\'s right, even if you are<br>using the weapon for a legal purpose (whoa, is there such a thing?), you<br>can be charged with violating the safe storage clause if it is not right<br>next to you, within reach, at all times.<br><br>It includes only one valid provision: all transfers of \"scary guns\"<br>has to go through an FFL. \<sarcasm\> That\'s good, because those guys<br>never act illegally. And when they do, boy howdy, the BATF is all over<br>them like stink on poo. They totally lose their licenses right away.<br>\</sarcasm\><br><br>No, only a few Republicans will vote for this (we call them RINOs), and<br>not enough for it to pass.<br><br>The definition of insanity: doing the same things over and over and<br>expecting different results.<br><br>Buyback? Are you kidding? Yes, I see they amended the Edward Byrne<br>Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program to include compensation for<br>surrendered \"scary-looking guns.\" But how much will they give? Market<br>value? They can\'t conceivably give market value (because the whole of<br>the Federal government doesn\'t have that much money), and when they<br>don\'t give fair market value for a surrendered gun that is not illegal<br>(i.e. is grandfathered in the first place), they will be sued.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
