<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **How can I tackle (legally, police, women's commission, etc.) my<br>> principal (I am a female staff) who is mentally harassing me every<br>> day?**<br><br>So let's break this down.<br><br>If we're talking about *physically tackling someone*, there is no way to<br>legally do this unless you do so in self-defense, or in defense of<br>someone else. Mental harassment does not constitute a situation which<br>requires a physical response. You would be arrested for assault.<br><br>If we're talking about *tackling the situation,* you're instead asking<br>how you deal with a boss who is harassing you.<br><br>You have a few things you should do:<br><br>1.  *Start with the person.* It amazes me the number of people who don't<br>    directly address the individual and immediately skip to other steps.<br>    Always start at the lowest level and work up. If you need someone to<br>    accompany you because you don't feel safe talking to the person,<br>    bring a trusted co-worker or friend with you when you confront the<br>    principal, and be sure the principal understands that your friend is<br>    simply a third-party observer, otherwise it feels like you're<br>    "ganging up" on him/her. Confronting the person directly is<br>    important. Perhaps they are unaware of what they are doing. Perhaps<br>    the principal is actually a decent person and doesn't know his or<br>    her actions are coming off as harassing. If you can address it<br>    directly, do. Also, when I say "confront," that means address the<br>    issue. It does not mean "be confrontational." Address the *issue*,<br>    not the *person*. The person is not bad; their conduct is bad. Keep<br>    this in mind when you speak to the principal.<br>2.  If you've attempted to communicate your issues to the principal and<br>    it has not helped, *go to your HR group.* Let them know you tried to<br>    address the issue with your principal and he's not budging and the<br>    harassment continues. HR should be able to address the issue. HR<br>    should be able to deal with reprisals as well, which should also be<br>    highly discouraged in any organization.<br>3.  If HR does not address the issue, I suggest you get a lawyer at this<br>    point. Why? Because your next step is to *go to the Legal<br>    department* and advise them that you plan on suing the organization<br>    (I assume it's a school district) for harassment and creating a<br>    hostile work environment, and you're going to actually want a lawyer<br>    present when you talk to the Legal department. Make sure Legal knows<br>    you confronted the principal, and you went to HR to try to get<br>    relief and nothing has worked so far. Perhaps the threat of a<br>    lawsuit would do it. Be advised however, part of your contract when<br>    you hired on may have been to waive your right to sue in favor of<br>    binding arbitration. If this is the case, submit to the arbitration,<br>    but you should definitely come out fine assuming you did nothing to<br>    contribute to the harassment.<br>4.  If, at any point, you decide you don't want to deal with this<br>    anymore, it is up to you to extricate yourself from the situation.<br>    Yes, this means resigning. For your own mental health, if you reach<br>    a point where you simply can't deal with it anymore, take care of<br>    you first.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
