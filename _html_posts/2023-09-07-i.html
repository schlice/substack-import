<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Homeowners* do not form HOAs. *Developers* implement HOAs in the<br>neighborhoods they develop.<br><br>They do this because they want to maintain the look of the neighborhood,<br>as usually the pre-designed look of the neighborhood is one of its key<br>selling points. Also, a high-value neighborhood allows the developer to<br>sell other high-value neighborhoods by pointing back at the<br>neighborhoods they've already developed.<br><br>So if you build a 200-home neighborhood in a craftsman or farmhouse<br>style, someone changing the fa√ßade of their house to beach coastal would<br>definitely look out of place, and would cause nearby houses to lose<br>value, causing the neighborhood as a whole to lose value.<br><br>So developers will implement HOAs to keep the overall look and feel of<br>the neighborhood that they designed so that they can use the<br>neighborhood as a reference neighborhood when the build and sell other<br>neighborhoods.<br><br>\<br><br>But HOAs benefit homeowners as well, even though some people vehemently<br>oppose HOAs "telling them what to do" (even though government zoning<br>rules already tell them what to do, but whatever). Homeowners benefit<br>from a neat, well-kept neighborhood and home values which remain as high<br>as possible. And homeowners do not have to deal with "that neighbor" who<br>paints their house electric blue, or who has six cars on their front<br>lawn, only two of which have wheels, or the one who has trouble with the<br>days of the week and puts their trash at the curb the day after trash<br>collection, leaving it there all week until the next collection, and who<br>thinks that cutting grass is for someone else, instead leaving their<br>lawn to become a jungle of tall weeds. Those things reduce the values of<br>neighboring homes (since no one wants to live next door to that). HOAs<br>address that.<br><br>Also, the neighborhood can benefit from *amenities* like pools and<br>clubhouses, and HOA dues fund those amenities.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
