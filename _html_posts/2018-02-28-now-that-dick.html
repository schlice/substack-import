<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Now that Dick\'s Sporting Goods has joined Walmart in terminating<br>sales of Assault-style Rifles, can it be surmised that these companies<br>are more socially responsible than the US Federal Government?**<br><br>Since the federal government is not in the business of being "socially<br>responsible," and neither is business, it doesn't really matter.<br><br>But if you're comparing apples to oranges, the government is far more<br>socially responsible than business because the government is non-profit.<br>Since businesses are for-profit, they are *de facto* less socially<br>responsible because they are money-hungry greedy capitalists.<br><br>Which makes their recent moves, shall we say, perplexing. I mean, if you<br>legally sell guns, why would you *voluntarily* stop selling the nation's<br>most popular gun? Because you want *more* sales? Sales 101 says that if<br>you want more sales, you should sell things that people actually want to<br>buy.<br><br>Seems a bit contradictory to me, doesn't it?<br><br>So then, why would Walmart and Dick's stop selling things that are<br>literally the most popular things people want to buy?<br><br>It's not because they are trying to make money, that much is clear.<br>Clearly, they are trying to send a message that they are less concerned<br>about *profit* and more concerned about *social image.*<br><br>This is a practice we call *virtue signaling*. Virtue signaling is<br>"the action or practice of publicly expressing opinions or sentiments<br>intended to demonstrate one\'s good character or the moral correctness<br>of one\'s position on a particular issue."<br><br>So Dick's and Walmart are clearly doing this because they are trying to<br>show you, the sheeple (or "sheep-like people" who follow trends blindly,<br>without using your minds), that they have "good character" or "moral<br>correctness," even if it goes against the very nature of what they do.<br><br>Therefore, you might rightly conclude that they are "good people," but<br>they're terrible business owners. Walmart will do fine because they sell<br>enough other stuff, but this move will hurt Dick's, as no one in their<br>right mind will ever buy a gun from them ever again. I think both of<br>them should get out of the gun selling game altogether. That would be a<br>great virtue signal, wouldn't it?<br><br>Dick's and Walmart, take my advice: leave gun sales to the<br>professionals.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
