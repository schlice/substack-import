<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let me ask a countervailing question:<br><br>Is there any evidence of a crime? Clinton was impeached for lying under<br>oath to Congress. That\'s a crime. What crime is implicated by colluding<br>with Russians to convince stupid Americans to not think for themselves?<br>And what magic bullet do Russians have that somehow would make people<br>vote Republican when they are Democrat or Independent? You really think<br>a Facebook ad would do it? If so, we need to find those advertisers,<br>because I have some products to move...<br><br>Seriously, where is the crime? Please, someone tell me.<br><br>And another thing: you appoint a special *prosecutor* when you have<br>a crime to prosecute, not when you conduct a fishing expedition, trying<br>to find a crime. But hey, its only my money you\'re spending on this<br>fishing trip.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
