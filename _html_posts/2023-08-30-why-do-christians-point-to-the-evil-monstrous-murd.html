<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Where do non-Christians get the basis for determining what is evil and<br>monstrous? What moral basis is the non-Christian using to determine that<br>God is somehow evil?<br><br>As to murder, murder is the unjustified killing of a person. Except<br>every time God killed someone (or ordered His people to do it), He<br>already judged them. So is it murder when we kill a Death Row convict?<br>No, because the killing is justified. Same with God.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
