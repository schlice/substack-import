<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How do people hear about Christ?<br><br>Sometimes, someone hears directly from a person. Sometimes, they hear a<br>snippet of something and ask a trusted friend. Sometimes, they hear some<br>obscure thing about Christmas originally being about a person, and not<br>one who wears a big red suit covered in soot, and they ask about it.<br><br>But in all cases, a person truly "hears" about Christ *when they are<br>willing to listen.* When they ask someone about the life of Jesus and<br>why it was literally the most influential life which was ever lived, and<br>they are willing to listen to that account, then they will "hear."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
