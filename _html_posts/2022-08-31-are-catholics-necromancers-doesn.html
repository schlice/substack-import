<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So I can see that you're only looking for Old Testament references, but<br>you asked the question in a Christian space, and we believe the entire<br>Bible is the inerrant word of God as communicated through Biblical<br>writers. So I'll give you the answer, and you can determine if you think<br>the sources are credible or not.<br><br>And also to be fair, I grew up Catholic and went to Catholic high<br>school, but I have been out of the faith for most of my adult life. So<br>Catholics, please speak up if I misspeak.<br><br>First of all, the saints aren't dead, but they are alive in heaven.<br>"He is not the God of the dead, but of the living." (Mark 12:27) Hebrews<br>12:1 says we are "surrounded" by a "great cloud of witnesses." It's what<br>the Apostle's Creed calls the "communion of saints."<br><br>Secondly, Catholics do not worship the saints, but instead ask them<br>to pray on their behalf to God. They see God face to face. Why wouldn't<br>you ask them to pray for you? We ask others for prayers, why not ask the<br>saints for prayers also? Catholics pray to these saints and ask them to<br>intercede on their behalf to God.<br><br>Finally, necromancy is the practice of summoning forth spirits from<br>the underworld to converse with them and to gain secret knowledge.<br>Catholics certainly do not pray to spirits in the underworld, and they<br>most certainly are not trying to gain secret knowledge. Catholics pray<br>to saints in heaven and ask for intercessory prayer.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Are Catholics necromancers? Doesn\'t the Bible say not to contact the<br>dead and even God\'s angels tell people not to bow or worship them. How<br>can dead saints be prayed to? Biblical sources not texts written 100s of<br>years after the apostles<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
