<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>God is omnipotent. That word means God is *fully complete*. He needs<br>*nothing*. Because if He needed something, then He would be<br>*incomplete*. He would be missing something. An "omnipotent" being who<br>needed something would not be omnipotent. Therefore, God needs nothing,<br>not the least of which is praise and worship.<br><br>We don't worship God because He needs it. *We worship God because He<br>deserves it.*<br><br>So what wonderful thing did God do that makes Him worthy of worship?<br>He saved us from ourselves.<br><br>But to understand what happened, you have to know about one of our<br>greatest design features: free will. That feature turned out to be<br>our downfall when Adam and Eve chose to reject Him and break His rules.<br>That act *broke* us. But He wanted us to have that ability to make free<br>choices, because He wanted us to freely be able to choose Him, warts and<br>all. It is this ability to make free choices, **even the ability to<br>reject truth**, which makes us moral creatures and gives us the ability<br>to choose our ultimate destiny.<br><br>So we broke that relationship with God through our own sin. That sin<br>separated us from God. A perfect and holy God does not accept sin in His<br>Kingdom, so that sin separates us from Him.<br><br>So God sent Jesus to take on Himself the punishment for our sin. Jesus'<br>sacrifice took all of our sin (past, present, and future) and reconciled<br>us to God.<br><br>But lest you think that God cruelly sent a patsy to do His dirty work<br>and to suffer to "fix His creation", it's important to remember that<br>Jesus is God.<br><br>So ultimately, **God took upon Himself the punishment that we deserve,<br>so that we could be reunited with Him.**<br><br>Now, we have a restored relationship with Him. Our free will is intact.<br>We can freely choose to love Him or reject Him without violating our<br>freedom. And that freedom is crucial, because love can only be freely<br>given; it can never be coerced. God could never force us to love Him. He<br>needs us to do so freely.<br><br>In other words, He built the perfect system to allow us to make the<br>choice to love Him. While He will always pursue us, He will never coerce<br>us.<br><br>And it is for that reason that He deserves our praise. He deserves our<br>worship. We don't worship Him because He needs it. We worship Him<br>because He deserves it, for what He's done for us.<br><br>I'm reminded of the words to the song:<br><br>*What He's done, what He's done,\<br>All the glory and the honor to the Son!\<br>My sins are forgiven,\<br>My future is Heaven,\<br>I praise God for what He's done!*<br><br>[https://youtu.be/j5lcadt8D2o?si=\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8d8043&url=https://youtu.be/j5lcadt8D2o?si%3DwVxgrMhWaamT3QIv){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="youtu.be"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
