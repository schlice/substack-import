<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: yes.<br><br>Longer answer: You will most likely be attested. You may get convicted.<br>Preemptive defense is not normally permitted (it\'s an assault),<br>unless you can clearly articulate that you were in fear for your<br>safety. It will be up to a jury to decide if your defensive action was<br>reasonable, given that you were not actually attacked.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
