<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not everything in the Bible is *prescriptive.* Sometimes, some things in<br>the Bible are *descriptive*. God telling Adam and Eve to "be fruitful<br>and multiply" was a command given to *them,* not to *you*. It was<br>prescriptive for *them*, but it is descriptive for *you*.<br><br>God would like you to have children, but you are under no *command* to<br>have children. Because if that were true, then sterile men and women<br>would automatically go to hell. Anyone for any reason who did not have<br>children would go to hell, and that condition does not describe those<br>who are destined for eternal torment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
