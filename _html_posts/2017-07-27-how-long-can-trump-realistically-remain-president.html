<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If by "long" you mean throughout his entire four-year term, I say yes, I<br>expect that he will remain for four years. If by "long" you mean two<br>terms, I'm still up in the air about that one.<br><br>Since Trump has not committed an impeachable offense, I see no reason<br>that he will be impeached. Remember the standard for impeachment is<br>"high crimes and misdemeanors." That said, impeachment is indeed a<br>political process, not a legal one, and the definition of "high crimes<br>and misdemeanors" is left to Congress to decide.<br><br>However, with a Republican-controlled Congress, I think you'll be<br>hard-pressed to find many Republicans (except for the dyed-in-the-wool<br>RINOs) who would vote for impeachment, as doing so for them would be<br>political suicide.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
