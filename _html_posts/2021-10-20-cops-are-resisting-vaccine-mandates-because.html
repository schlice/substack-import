<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Thanks for the A2A, [[Pat<br>Dernec](https://www.quora.com/profile/Pat-Dernec)]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>Despite most of the answerers who believe that cops are not being<br>vaccinated because they think themselves "above the law" or because they<br>"are simply too stupid to be vaccinated," those really are not the<br>reasons why cops are not getting vaccinated.<br><br>Cops, by their nature, and reinforced through the work they do, are<br>highly skeptical of everything. Also as a function of the work that they<br>do, they know their rights. When a suspect says, "you're violating my<br>rights!" in most cases they are not. And also in most cases, if they are<br>violating your rights, they know it.<br><br>To that end, most cops who are not getting the vaccine either had COVID<br>already and have recovered and feel they don't need the shot, or are<br>simply skeptical about the vaccines and believe they have the right to<br>control what they put in their own bodies.<br><br>And yes, while they enforce the laws written by the government, they are<br>still skeptical of the government's motivations. This doesn't lead them<br>to blindly follow government edicts, but actually leads to (sometimes<br>unhealthy levels of) skepticism. And they question the motives behind a<br>vaccine mandate.<br><br>While they are getting vaccinated, albeit at lower numbers than the<br>general population, their unions are absolutely against vaccine<br>mandates. Only in the largest departments, which can absorb the loss of<br>officers who will resign before getting the jab, are vaccine mandates<br>even being pursued. Most departments are actually following the CDC<br>recommendation and are offering the "either-or" path forward: either the<br>vaccine, or weekly COVID testing.<br><br>Cops look at this and wonder why the government doesn't follow its own<br>CDC recommendations.<br><br>So it is quite possible in this case that cops are actually "too smart<br>for their own good."<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Cops are resisting vaccine mandates because "The govt. can't tell me<br>what to do". Isn't that a weird flex for people who literally enforce<br>govt mandates on others?<br><br>\<br><br>*This is a contentious and emotionally-charged topic. I have taken the<br>(unusual for me) step of leaving comments open.*<br><br>*Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner. But do not misunderstand, I take this step very<br>cautiously, and I have no tolerance for harassing or inane behavior.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you are simply<br>commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised<br>if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything vaguely harassing in<br>there, and your deletion will be followed by a block/mute, and a BNBR<br>report. I will do this immediately and with no compunction. You have<br>been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
