  to dress?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Actually, these verses are specific to women, but the *broader passages*<br>around them are not.<br><br>These two letters were written for different audiences and different<br>purposes.<br><br>1 Tim 2:9. Paul's first letter to Timothy was to encourage him in<br>leading his church. A large portion of the letter is taken up with<br>Paul\'s comments on the role of women in worship services. Rather than<br>focusing on flashy clothes and dramatic behavior, women are to be modest<br>and godly. In addition, women should not take on specific spiritual<br>leadership roles reserved for men.<br><br>Specifically, this passage (more specifically, 1 Tim 2:9--15, is one of<br>the most controversial passages in the New Testament. And while there<br>are some passages which are slightly unclear, the overall theme of the<br>passage is not: women are not to focus on dramatic appearance or<br>behavior, but to put their efforts into godliness and good works.<br><br>Verse 9 begins with the word *hōsautōs,* which means "likewise." That's<br>a follow-on from verse 8, which applies to men. Paul was talking to the<br>men about prayer and its importance. So when he says "likewise" to the<br>women, prayer and its importance applies to them as well. What he does<br>in verse 9 is to add a *specific* item which caused concern to the<br>community regarding women. Specifically, he addressed how women dress<br>and style their hair for church. Just as it is today, church is not the<br>appropriate venue to wear skimpy attire or to spend an inordinate amount<br>of time and effort on "braiding their hair," which could be costly both<br>in time and money in those days. The idea wasn't to control women. The<br>idea was to suggest that all of that effort put emphasis on the self<br>rather than on worshipping God, which was the whole purpose of church.<br>You don't "dress to impress" for church. Not only does it distract<br>others from the point of gathering together, it distracts the woman<br>herself.<br><br>1 Peter 3:3--9. Peter, in this letter, is teaching about Christian<br>submission to human authorities. He was talking about a Christian wife<br>trying to influence an unbelieving husband. Women of the time felt<br>enormous societal pressure to *compete* for the attention of their<br>husbands, and they would often use jewelry, clothing and hairstyles to<br>attempt to do so. Peter\'s instruction from God urged women to<br>understand, in part, that their husbands would not be won to Christ by<br>their efforts to beautify themselves externally.<br><br>It's not that *we* put emphasis on how women dress. It's that at<br>that time, *they* put emphasis on it, and sometimes it interfered<br>with what they were really trying to accomplish.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
