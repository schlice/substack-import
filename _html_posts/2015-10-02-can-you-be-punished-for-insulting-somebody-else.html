If you use slanderous speech which causes harm to another<br>person, you can be charged with that offense.\<br>\<br>But if you simply insult someone (\"Hey, you\'re ugly\"), that\'s not<br>against the law in the United States, as it is protected by the First<br>Amendment.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
