<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Perhaps I don't understand the question.<br><br>Peace officers wear the badges sanctioned by their departments on their<br>uniforms. Oftentimes, you will see officers in the police equivalent of<br>"fatigues" or "battle dress uniforms" from the military. They are some<br>form of "soft" uniform. All of the devices on those uniforms are muted<br>and usually made of cloth, including the badge. You can only wear the<br>badge, cloth or otherwise, if you are a sworn peace officer. The<br>*composition* of the badge is not relevant. It doesn't have to be metal<br>to be a real badge.<br><br>Therefore, NYPD (or any department, for that matter) can't actually wear<br>"fake" badges. If they are wearing it, it is because their department<br>has provided it to them. Remember, President Obama urged law enforcement<br>to "soften" their appearance to try to ease the tensions between them<br>and the community. You may have seen a move towards a "softer"<br>appearance in uniform stylings. Perhaps you've seen police officers in<br>polo shirts with embroidered badges. If the department approved the<br>uniform, it is not "fake."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
