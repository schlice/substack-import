<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you think that lockpicking is a useful skill for a police<br>officer?**<br><br>No.<br><br>Lockpicking is a useful skill for a locksmith.<br><br>If a police officer needs to enter a locked room, he needs to have a<br>reason to do so (without someone unlocking the door for him). He might<br>be able to do so under what is known as exigent circumstances. If,<br>for example, he hears someone being beaten inside that room, entry into<br>that room is permitted under exigent circumstances, and the officer can<br>use whatever means necessary to enter that room. Picking the lock would<br>be too inefficient a use of time in such a case. He is better off<br>breaking a window and gaining entry that way, or breaking down the door<br>if need be (even though most main entry doors are fairly solid, and<br>breaking them down requires more force than a man can reasonably<br>achieve).<br><br>If an officer needs entry into a locked room, no one is available to<br>unlock the door, and exigent circumstances do not exist, he must get a<br>warrant to enter that room. Once he has warrant in hand, he has two<br>options: break the door, or hire a locksmith. But to be honest, if he<br>has enough time to get a warrant, he has enough time to get a locksmith.<br><br>Therefore, lockpicking is not a necessary skill for a police officer.<br><br>Additionally, an officer who does know lockpicking will always be<br>questioned as to whether or not entry into a locked room took place, and<br>whether or not searches were lawfully executed. Therefore, an officer<br>who knows lockpicking may be the subject of increased scrutiny.<br>Therefore, knowledge of lockpicking may be a *liability* instead of an<br>asset.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
