<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it's not just atheists who<br>deserve to go to hell. In fact, *it's everyone*.<br><br>We ALL deserve to go to hell.<br><br>We are ALL sinners and we have all fallen short of the glory of God<br>(Romans 3:23). We ALL deserve to go to hell.<br><br>But, by God's mercy, we do not get what we deserve. And by God's grace,<br>we get what we do not deserve: eternal life with Him.<br><br>Now, that offer is both unconditional (meaning it is offered freely<br>to anyone) and conditional (it is conditioned on you doing<br>something).<br><br>So what's the condition?<br><br>You have to accept Christ as your Savior. You have to acknowledge that<br>He died to save you. You have to believe in His salvific act on the<br>cross.<br><br>He's holding out a gift for you to take. And all you have to do is take<br>it. We cannot *earn* our salvation. But we can *take* the free gift we<br>are being offered. It will change your life, but most of us would say<br>that that would be a good thing. A free gift that costs you your life.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
