<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>That's a great question, isn't it? If you can earn your own salvation,<br>then why did Jesus have to die? If my method of salvation is at my own<br>hands, then why was a sacrifice necessary?<br><br>These are rhetorical questions.<br><br>The answer is that being good alone will not get you to heaven.<br><br>In fact, it's exactly the opposite.<br><br>We are saved by grace alone, not by works.<br><br>*But*, I hear those who know some passages from the Bible saying, *what<br>about where it says that faith without works is dead? Doesn't that mean<br>your salvation is dependent on works too?*<br><br>NO!<br><br>Your salvation is dependent on Christ alone. But someone who is truly<br>saved will be "a new person in Christ." Their actions in this life will<br>reflect that reality. This is what that passage was trying to say.<br><br>When we are saved in Christ, we will be "born again" and become "a new<br>person in Christ." The works we do are also a reflection of that faith,<br>as they are too a gift from God. Works are the outer reflection of our<br>faith. If you don't see the works, you can safely bet that the salvation<br>and true faith does not exist.<br><br>In the New Testament, works are often referred to as fruit. Jesus said<br>of the topic, "\N\o good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree<br>bear good fruit. Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not<br>pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers. A good man brings<br>good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man<br>brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For the mouth<br>speaks what the heart is full of." (Luke 6:43--45)<br><br>That's a really important statement: *each tree is recognized by its own<br>fruit.* We are *recognized* as Christ-followers by the *fruits* we bear.<br>So our *deeds* will reflect our designation as followers of Christ.<br><br>You are *saved* by faith. You are *recognized as a follower of Christ*<br>by works. Works follow faith; works flow from faith. It is your faith<br>that creates the conditions which allow God to gift you with works. But<br>it is not the works which save you, it is the faith alone which does.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If being good alone would get you to heaven, then why did God send<br>Christ to die at the cross?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
