Circuit) if he is proven guilty of<br>Perjury before Senate Committee?**<br><br>Kavanaugh can be impeached for any reason that Congress considers<br>impeachable.<br><br>Impeachment is a political process, not a legal one. He doesn't need to<br>be proven guilty of perjury (which is a virtual impossibility --- I'll<br>link one of my other answers explaining why below). If he is not<br>approved to sit on the Supreme Court because of these allegations, it<br>also stands to reason that he's not fit to continue to sit on the DC<br>Circuit because of them, and this alone can be grounds for impeachment.<br><br>But just as we've discussed with the President, the impeachment process<br>for other Federal officers is the same. The House must pass Articles of<br>Impeachment (which will be simple if they gain a majority in November).<br>Then, the Senate must have a trial at which the Chief Justice (in the<br>case of a Presidential impeachment) or the Vice President serves as the<br>judge. The Senate must then vote by supermajority (2/3 of the Senators<br>present) to remove him from office.<br><br>In our nation's history, one SCOTUS Justice and fourteen other Federal<br>judges have been impeached. Only eight of the Federal judges impeached<br>were removed from office by the Senate. The SCOTUS Justice, Samuel<br>Chase, was impeached in 1804 but was acquitted by the Senate.<br><br>\<br><br>[[Bill Stein\'s answer to Does it matter to conservatives that Brett<br>Kavanaugh told many provable lies to the Senate Judiciary<br>Committee?](https://www.quora.com/Does-it-matter-to-conservatives-that-Brett-Kavanaugh-told-many-provable-lies-to-the-Senate-Judiciary-Committee/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
