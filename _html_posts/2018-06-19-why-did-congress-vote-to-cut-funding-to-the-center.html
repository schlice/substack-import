<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why did Congress vote to cut funding to the Center of Disease<br>Control's study of gun violence in 1996?**<br><br>Thanks for the A2A. Congress did not cut funding to the CDC for gun<br>violence studies. They saw the first product of that research that they<br>funded, and realized that CDC was actually using data to attempt to<br>influence politics.<br><br>A rider was attached to the 1996 Omnibus Spending Bill called the Dickey<br>Amendment. The amendment simply said:<br><br>> \N\one of the funds made available for injury prevention and control<br>> at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may be used to<br>> advocate or promote gun control.<br><br>The Dickey Amendment has been reauthorized many times, and many<br>different Congresses have attempted to remove it without success. But as<br>you can see by the text of the amendment, it doesn't actually prevent<br>them from doing research.<br><br>In fact, in 2013 and 2015, the CDC has published research into gun<br>violence (consistent with the Dickey Amendment text). The CDC has some<br>of the best data on gun violence. Their [[WISQARS<br>system](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a20d50&url=https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/index.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cdc.gov"}]{.qlink_container} is a go-to for gun violence<br>statistics.<br><br>The Dickey Amendment was clarified in 2018, when a report accompanying<br>the Omnibus continuing resolution re-stated the fact that the CDC can,<br>in fact, conduct research into gun violence.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
