<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If illegal aliens were to receive amnesty, should they still be denied<br>the right to vote?**<br><br>It depends on what "amnesty" looks like.<br><br>In my opinion, illegals should be granted permanent resident alien<br>status (i.e. they should be given green cards). Make them prove that<br>they've been here for X amount of time, they've been good citizens<br>(haven't gotten in trouble), they've paid their taxes, and they can stay<br>as permanent resident aliens.<br><br>Permanent resident aliens are not US citizens, and therefore cannot<br>vote.<br><br>They can stay. They can have jobs. They can pay taxes. They can drive<br>cars. They can raise families.<br><br>But they can't vote until they become citizens.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
