<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In California, you have the right to be free from "intrusion upon<br>seclusion" and "unwarranted and undesired publicity." This generally<br>means that people may not take photos or videos of you in a "private<br>place" without your consent. Whether a particular location is "private"<br>or "public" depends on whether or not you have a **reasonable<br>expectation of privacy** in that location. Note that the *legal*<br>definition of "reasonable expectation of privacy" may not match your<br>personal definition. But generally speaking, the inside of a house is<br>considered private and pretty much everything else is considered public.<br><br>If you are standing on private property inside of a fully fenced-in yard<br>with a minimum of a six foot privacy fence, and there are no neighboring<br>houses which can see into your yard, you may have a reasonable<br>expectation of privacy from someone standing on the ground level outside<br>of your fence. However, if you are in your front yard (still on your<br>private property) but you are fully visible to someone standing in a<br>public place (like the sidewalk), you do not have a reasonable<br>expectation of privacy. Your photograph can be taken without your<br>consent. Your photograph can even be posted online!<br><br>The one thing which cannot be done with your photo would be to *make<br>money*. If your photo is used for commercial purposes, consent must be<br>granted.<br><br>But other than that, the general rule of thumb is "if you can see it,<br>you can shoot it" (with a camera).<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
