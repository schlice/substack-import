<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Depends on whether or not the \"separate desktop\" is on<br>the same computer or on a different computer.\<br>\<br>If you have two screens on the same computer, I *highly* recommend<br>[DisplayFusion(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=df55de&url=http://www.displayfusion.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="displayfusion.com"}]{.qlink_container}. You can set some<br>applications to force to one monitor or another, and you can also set<br>them to start in fullscreen mode. You can also modify the wallpaper<br>individually on each screen, along with a million other functions that<br>are eminently useful. The developer is a small business and he makes<br>continuous changes to the code. He\'s very responsive to user requests<br>as well. One of the best pieces of software I own.\<br>\<br>If your two screens are on different computers, you have to come up with<br>a better option. I can think of a few off the top of my head; most of<br>them get programmed with<br>[AutoHotkey(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=190a0b&url=http://www.autohotkey.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="autohotkey.com"}]{.qlink_container}. You can use AHK to<br>create a utility that runs on startup and places a text file into a<br>shared folder. The other system would be continuously monitoring the<br>folder, and when it saw the text file, it deleted the text file and then<br>started the item in fullscreen. This presumes that you have a shared<br>folder between the two systems.\<br>\<br>If you don\'t have a shared folder between the two systems, you can<br>still use Synergy or Input Director or Ditto or Beyond Copy or any<br>number of network-based clipboard utilities to share your clipboard<br>between the two systems. You can still use AHK to script something that<br>you place on the clipboard which would be replicated to the other<br>system.\<br>\<br>You can also use shared web-based clipboards to perform similar<br>functions. Free ones such as<br>[cl1p.net(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e43a98&url=http://www.cl1p.net){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cl1p.net"}]{.qlink_container} or<br>[Pastie(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=58e152&url=http://www.pastie.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="pastie.org"}]{.qlink_container} are great choices. Same<br>thing: write a utility in AHK that monitors the web-based clipboard. The<br>source system drops something in there, and the target system sees it<br>and grabs it. This one might be harder, because there may be difficulty<br>getting the target system to recognize that text is actually present on<br>the webpage. I\'ll have to work on that one. Perhaps the webpage would<br>issue a change notice if I was staring at it.\<br>\<br>Anyway, there\'s a few ideas for you.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
