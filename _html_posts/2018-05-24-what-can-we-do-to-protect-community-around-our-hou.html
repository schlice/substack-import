<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What can we do to protect community around our house without setting<br>up HOA?**<br><br>Maybe I'm not sure what you're asking. Protect the community around your<br>house from what, exactly?<br><br>As an individual homeowner in a neighborhood with no organized HOA, you<br>have responsibility and authority over *your property*, and that's it.<br>Everything within your property line is your responsibility. Everything<br>outside of your property line is not your responsibility and you can do<br>nothing to protect it.<br><br>If there is common area on which there is no house, it is still owned by<br>someone. It could be owned by a charity. It could be owned by a builder.<br>It could be owned by a property management company. Whoever owns it,<br>find out who it is. City records will show you who owns the property.<br>Talk to that person or organization. See if you can work out whatever<br>"protection" you would like to implement.<br><br>But understand that you have more collective bargaining power when<br>homeowners band together in a city-recognized and legally chartered<br>organization than you do as "a few homeowners."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
