<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can ask, but you\'re better off asking for a signing bonus rather<br>than RSUs that really aren\'t RSUs.<br><br>The whole point of RSUs is to give you stock without giving you stock.<br>It\'s an incentive to stay, because if you leave, any unvested RSUs go<br>away. It\'s an investment in your future, but it also is banking on the<br>company succeeding. It ensures you will do your part to make the company<br>profitable.<br><br>If you want money up front, you\'re looking for a signing bonus, or a<br>hiring bonus, not immediately-vesting RSUs.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
