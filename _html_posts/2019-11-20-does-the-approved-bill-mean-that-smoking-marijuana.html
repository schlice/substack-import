<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does the approved bill mean that smoking marijuana is going to be<br>legal in the military?**<br><br>Regardless of what the bill says, the military can continue to ban<br>marijuana use if its use is inconsistent with the military mission.<br>Additionally, much more study will need to be done before long term<br>safety of its use can be quantified. For those reasons, it's unlikely<br>that the military would permit its use, even if the law were to allow<br>it. It would take quite some time before the military would allow<br>off-duty use of marijuana, if at all.<br><br>Remember too, the bill simply cleared the House Judiciary Committee. It<br>still has to be voted on by the full House (which would easily pass it),<br>and then voted on by the Senate if it has a chance of passing, which<br>right now seems unlikely. Finally, it would have to be signed by the<br>President, who is unlikely to do so even if both the House and Senate<br>pass it.<br><br>Hypothetically, if it did pass, the military would have a hard time with<br>it. But it's a hypothetical. The bill, as it stands, is a dead letter<br>when it hits the Senate. It has a snowball's chance in Hell of passing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
