<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ultimately, I think the Texas law has some challenges it will have to<br>overcome, but I support the rights of states to make rules that best<br>benefit the residents of that state. And I believe that abortion laws<br>are best left up to the individual states to decide.<br><br>Let me explain why I believe this.<br><br>I believe that *Griswold v. Connecticut* was wrongly decided: I do not<br>believe that there is a right to privacy in the Constitution. Since *Roe<br>v. Wade* was based largely on the findings in *Griswold*, I think it was<br>also wrongly decided.<br><br>Does this mean that we should restrict *all* abortions? Personally I<br>think we should, but honest people can disagree about this. Perhaps we<br>impose a limit, like viability. This is precisely what *Planned<br>Parenthood v. Casey* established.<br><br>Texas decided to impose a viability limit, and that limit was *fetal<br>heartbeat*. Texas becomes the ninth state to have a fetal heartbeat<br>law. They join Alabama, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi,<br>Missouri, and Ohio, which also restrict abortion based on fetal<br>heartbeat.\[1\](#YulFw){#cite-YulFw .citation_link}<br><br>As far as the decisions around Constitutionality go, *Roe* is not the<br>governing case law any more. Actually, with respect to privacy, *Roe*<br>tried to balance the right to privacy with the state's ability to<br>restrict abortions. It's the subsequent decisions which tell us more<br>about how abortion can be restricted in the US.<br><br>The main governing case in the US is *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* from<br>1992, which said that restrictions on abortion are unconstitutional if<br>they place an "undue burden" on a woman seeking an abortion **before the<br>fetus is *viable***. The Court upheld what it called the "essential<br>holding" of *Roe*. The "essential holding" consists of three parts: (1)<br>Women have the right to choose to have an abortion prior to viability<br>and to do so without undue interference from the State; (2) the State<br>can restrict the abortion procedure post-viability, so long as the law<br>contains exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the woman\'s life or<br>health; and (3) the State has legitimate interests from the outset of<br>the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the<br>fetus that may become a child.<br><br>Texas, in its new law, has decided to declare *viability* at the point<br>where a fetal heartbeat can be detected. I think that if this law is to<br>be challenged, it will be to determine whether or not a fetus is viable<br>(i.e. can survive outside the womb) at the point at which a fetal<br>heartbeat can be detected. "Heartbeat" is a nebulous term, since there<br>really isn't a heart developed until somewhere between the sixth and<br>tenth weeks of pregnancy. Before the sixth week, there simply isn't a<br>heart yet.<br><br>The Texas law defines a "fetal heartbeat" as the point at which<br>ultrasound can detect what lawmakers describe as a heartbeat, which can<br>be as early as six weeks. However, while they can detect fluttering of<br>the tissue which will eventually become the heart, they actually aren't<br>detecting a "heartbeat," as there really isn't a heart moving fluids<br>yet.<br><br>So I think that this will be the first portion of the law to be<br>challenged: that there is actually a heartbeat, or is it just a<br>fluttering of heart muscle which will eventually become a heart.<br><br>The second portion of the law which will be challenged is whether or not<br>a fetus is viable at the point at which a "fetal heartbeat" is detected.<br>The Supreme Court's standard in *Casey* is that abortion can take place<br>prior to viability, so the Texas law will be challenged on whether or<br>not the fetus is actually viable at the point of "fetal heartbeat" at<br>about six weeks.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Are there any Quorans who actively support the new Texas abortion law?<br><br>\<br><br>*This is a contentious and emotionally-charged topic. I have taken the<br>(unusual for me) step of leaving comments open.*<br><br>*Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner. But do not misunderstand, I take this step very<br>cautiously, and I have no tolerance for harassing or inane behavior.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you are simply<br>commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised<br>if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything vaguely harassing in<br>there, and your deletion will be followed by a block/mute, and a BNBR<br>report. I will do this immediately and with no compunction. You have<br>been warned. Be nice.*<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-YulFw){.citation_index} [[Heartbeat Laws: What You Need to<br>Know](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8b0791&url=https://blog.equalrightsinstitute.com/heartbeat-laws-what-you-need-to-know){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="equalrightsinstitute.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
