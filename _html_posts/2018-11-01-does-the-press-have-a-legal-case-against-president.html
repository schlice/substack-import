<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does the press have a legal case against President Trump for inciting<br>violence against them?**<br><br>Not even close.<br><br>We have a 1st Amendment in the United States, and we're pretty proud of<br>it. We're also pretty protective of it.<br><br>The only way you can be cited for "inciting violence" is if you say<br>words which should reasonably be known to cause "imminent lawless<br>action."<br><br>There's a three-prong test to see if speech can be regulated as inciting<br>violence:<br><br>- Imminence. The speech must reasonably lead to "imminent" action, not<br>  some action at some unspecified future time.<br>- Intent. The speaker must intend on causing imminent lawless behavior.<br>- Likelihood. The speech must be likely to produce imminent lawless<br>  behavior.<br><br>Trump may say mean things about the press. But the government can only<br>restrict his speech if it reasonably incites imminent lawless behavior.<br>Simply strongly advocating a point is not imminent lawlessness. Simply<br>saying that "someone should take care of that issue" does not also<br>incite imminent lawless behavior.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
