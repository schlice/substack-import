<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>To continue to deconstruct your erroneous question, the police have not<br>been acquitted of "wrongdoing."<br><br>The police officer in question was not charged with murder, because his<br>actions did not meet the standard for murder.<br><br>The officer believed that there was an "imminent threat of unlawful<br>force which was intended to, or likely to, result in death or great<br>bodily harm." The District Attorney found that this belief was<br>reasonable, and therefore did not bring murder charges against the<br>officer.<br><br>The officer still faces several further challenges:<br><br>- An internal police department investigation to see if any department<br>  policies were violated. This may coincide with the "use of force"<br>  review that the department will conduct, to see if the officer's use<br>  of force was reasonable. I suspect that they will find that the<br>  conflicting directives the officer gave will factor heavily into their<br>  decision as to what to do with him. They can reprimand him, refer him<br>  for remedial training, or discipline him further, up to and including<br>  termination (i.e. he could get fired).<br>- A wrongful death lawsuit, brought by the family on behalf of Castile.<br>  Again, because it was the officer who induced the situation in the<br>  first place, I suspect he will lose this lawsuit.<br>- Possibly a review by the Department of Justice for civil rights<br>  violations. If such a review occurs, I believe the officer would also<br>  be found to have violated Castile's civil rights.<br><br>I suspect that the sum total of all of this will be losing a wrongful<br>death lawsuit and losing his job.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
