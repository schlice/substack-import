<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In addition to what the other answerers have said, when I look good, I<br>feel good. When I feel good, I am confident, and happy. Self-confidence<br>is at least partially driven by our own appearance, Or at least how we<br>perceive our own appearance.<br><br>Ideally, we don\'t want our self-confidence to be driven by our<br>appearance, however it is true that at least in part, our personal<br>appearance drives our self-confidence.<br><br>Finally, in many industries that are customer-facing, personal<br>appearance standards are required. So it may not necessarily just be<br>because of how we want to be perceived to the world, or how we perceive<br>ourselves, personal appearance standards may be required as a condition<br>of employment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
