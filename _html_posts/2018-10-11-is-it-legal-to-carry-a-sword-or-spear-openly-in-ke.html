It is legal to<br>conceal a pocket knife or a hunting knife. Anything else is considered a<br>"deadly weapon" and cannot be concealed.<br><br>Whether or not you're going to be hassled about carrying a sword or a<br>spear is up for debate, as neither are specifically listed in Kentucky<br>law, as far as I can tell. You'll probably attract some unwanted<br>attention carrying a spear or a sword.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
