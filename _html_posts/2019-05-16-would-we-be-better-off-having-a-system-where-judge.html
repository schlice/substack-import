He<br>is indeed knowledgeable about legal issues.<br><br>However, a jury makes the important decision about whether or not the<br>prosecution met its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The<br>"reasonable person test" is employed, and that doesn't require legal<br>training to determine.<br><br>The right to a trial by jury is one of the reasons the colonies left<br>England in the first place. The Declaration of Independence accused King<br>George of \"depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of trial by<br>jury.\"<br><br>The Constitution has several places which protect the right of trial by<br>jury. Article III says that all trials shall be by jury. The 6th<br>Amendment protected the right to a jury even further, stating "\i<br><br>all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy<br>and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein<br>the crime shall have been committed," and the 7th Amendment protected<br>the same right for civil cases.<br><br>Is a jury important? The Supreme Court<br>[said(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bde58c&url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/391/145/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="justia.com"}]{.qlink_container} of the matter:<br><br>> Those who wrote our constitutions knew from history and experience<br>> that it was necessary to protect against unfounded criminal charges<br>> brought to eliminate enemies and against judges too responsive to the<br>> voice of higher authority. The framers of the constitutions strove to<br>> create an independent judiciary but insisted upon further protection<br>> against arbitrary action. Providing an accused with the right trial by<br>> a jury of his peers gave him an inestimable safeguard against the<br>> corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant, biased,<br>> or eccentric judge.<br><br>Trial by jury is one of the foundations of our legal system and should<br>never be tampered with.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
