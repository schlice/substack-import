<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You are not allowed to lie about someone in a way that<br>causes harm to the person that you lied about. That is the definition of<br>slander. If you lie about someone and they lose their job because of it,<br>that is actionable slander.\<br>\<br>If the statements you say are actually true and you can prove it, you<br>have every right to say them. But if they are lies (called oral<br>defamation) that causes harm to the person being defamed, it is<br>considered slander, and you can face civil punishments.\<br>\<br>Some slanderous statements are actionable *per se*, because the harm is<br>obvious, like saying that someone has a bad disease, or that someone<br>can\'t perform their job, or that someone committed a crime.\<br>\<br>(EDIT) Thanks to [[Catherine<br>Beale](https://www.quora.com/profile/Catherine-Beale)]{.qlink_container}<br>for catching my Latin error which actually changed the text of what I<br>was going for. Time to brush up on my dead<br>languages\...]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
