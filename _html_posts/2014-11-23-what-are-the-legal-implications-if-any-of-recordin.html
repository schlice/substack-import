<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [(EDIT: This answer is directed towards the OP who stated<br>he is outside of the US. Within the US, in certain jurisdictions, it<br>doesn\'t matter what you do with the recording, you may have violated<br>the law simply by creating the recording. If you are in the US, check<br>your local laws before recording a call.)\<br>\<br>Depends on what you plan on doing with the recordings and where you plan<br>on doing it.\<br>\<br>As an example, if you plan on using the recordings in a legal<br>proceeding, the laws vary widely by state. All states require at least<br>one party to the conversation to be aware that the call is being<br>recorded. Less than that requires a warrant in all states. Some states<br>require all parties be aware. Some states require a tone be played every<br>15 seconds while the recording is in progress.\<br>\<br>If you don\'t plan on using the recordings as evidence in a legal<br>proceeding, you are free to record your own conversations for your own<br>archival and storage, so long as you are the only person that hears<br>them. Once others hear them and may act on them, you enter new legal<br>territory.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
