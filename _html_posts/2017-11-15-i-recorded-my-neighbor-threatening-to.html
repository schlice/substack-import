Threatening bodily harm is not always a crime, but in the<br>states where it is, it is called different things. It's sometimes called<br>"criminal threatening" or "intimidation." If intimidation or criminal<br>threatening exists in your state, call the police.<br><br>If there is no intimidation or criminal threatening statute in your<br>state, file for a restraining order, and then file a civil lawsuit for<br>assault and intimidation. Assault in tort is different from "battery" in<br>tort, which is actual physical harm. The "assault" is the words, the<br>"battery" is the action.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
