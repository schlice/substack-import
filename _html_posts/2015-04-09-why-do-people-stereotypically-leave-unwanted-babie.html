It has to do with the Colorado \"Safe<br>Haven Law\" which states that any mother can leave any baby, up to 72<br>hours old, at any fire station or hospital, without fear of being<br>prosecuted for abandonment, no questions asked. So long as the baby is<br>unharmed, you\'re good to go, literally.<br><br>[[Colorado Safe Haven Home<br>Page](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=55d38a&url=http://www.coloradosafehaven.org/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="coloradosafehaven.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>All 50 states have Safe Haven laws on the books.<br><br>The rationale for the fire station is that fire department personnel are<br>more heavily trained as paramedics and EMTs than police. In fact, 70% of<br>calls that firefighters roll on are medical calls, not fires. Fire<br>department rescue vehicles roll on all sorts of medical situations. In<br>fact, some jurisdictions have ambulance services that have teamed up<br>with fire departments and run joint ambulances. Most police departments<br>do not have their own ambulance services, and while police are generally<br>trained as medical first responders, they are not EMT or paramedic<br>certified, while most firefighters are.<br><br>(EDIT) Additionally, fire stations are a better choice for Safe Haven<br>drop points because people feel much more comfortable giving their baby<br>to a firefighter (who cannot arrest them) than to a police officer (who<br>can, but shouldn't in this scenario). Making Safe Haven drop points be<br>police stations might deter some people from using them, so the logical<br>choice is the fire department.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
