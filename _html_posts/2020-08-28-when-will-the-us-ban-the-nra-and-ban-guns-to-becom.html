<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**When will the US ban the NRA and ban guns to become a decent and<br>civilized nation?**<br><br>When the US decides that private organizations can be banned because a<br>portion of the population doesn't like the product they offer, and when<br>the US decides to scrap the 2nd Amendment to the Constitution.<br><br>By the way, forcing a business to close because a portion of the<br>population doesn't like the product they offer is the exact opposite of<br>what a "decent and civilized society" would do. Clearly, if the large<br>majority of the population was disinterested in the product they<br>offered, the company would not make any money and would simply go out of<br>business. The fact that they are still in business after so many years<br>belies your assertion that they should be banned in the first place.<br><br>The simple truth is that **the US is already a decent and civilized<br>nation**. The fact that the media shows you nothing but the negative is<br>nothing more than a perception problem; stories about shootings make<br>people watch their product, which makes them money. And people (like<br>you) do watch when the media talk about shootings.<br><br>The fact is that it's not nearly as bad as the media like to portray.<br>The US is ranked 94th in the world in terms of homicide, nowhere near<br>the top ten. Banning guns probably wouldn't move the needle much. People<br>will always find creative ways to kill others. Just look at the non-zero<br>murder rate in countries who have virtually or completely banned private<br>ownership of firearms. The fact that murder continues means that murder<br>is not made possible by a firearm. Therefore, you cannot make a country<br>"more decent" or "more civilized" by closing a business or removing a<br>tool from its population.<br><br>And in terms of a "decent and civilized" nation, the [[Human Development<br>Index](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=22f26e&url=https://ourworldindata.org/human-development-index){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ourworldindata.org"}]{.qlink_container} lists factors that<br>make a country "civilized" such as *life expectancy, expected years of<br>schooling* of children at school-entry age and *mean years of schooling*<br>of the adult population, and a decent standard of living measured by<br>*Gross National Income per capita* adjusted for the price level of the<br>country. The United States has consistently ranked as one of the highest<br>nations on the HDI. By any measure, the United States is one of the<br>world's most "decent and civilized" nations.<br><br>I would actually argue that the gun IS civilization. I would go<br>farther and tell you that **the most civilized act you can perform in<br>society is to carry a gun.**<br><br>*cue shocked expressions by SJWs*<br><br>Please allow me to explain.<br><br>> Human beings only have two ways to deal with one another: reason and<br>> force. If you want me to do something for you, you have a choice of<br>> either convincing me via argument, or forcing me to do your bidding<br>> under threat of force. Every human interaction falls into one of those<br>> two categories, without exception. Reason or force, that\'s it.<br>><br>> In a truly moral and civilized society, people exclusively interact<br>> through persuasion. Force has no place as a valid method of social<br>> interaction, **and the only thing that removes force from the menu is<br>> the personal firearm**, as paradoxical as it may sound to some.<br>><br>> When I carry a gun, you cannot deal with me by force. You have to use<br>> reason to try to persuade me, because I have a way to *negate* your<br>> threat or employment of force. The gun is the only personal weapon<br>> that puts a 100-pound woman on equal footing with a 220-pound mugger,<br>> a 75-year old retiree on equal footing with a 19-year old gangbanger,<br>> and a single gay guy on equal footing with a carload of drunk guys<br>> with baseball bats. **The gun removes the disparity in physical<br>> strength, size, age, or numbers between a potential attacker and a<br>> defender.**<br>><br>> There are plenty of people who consider the gun as the source of bad<br>> force equations. **These are the people who think that we\'d be more<br>> civilized if all guns were removed from society**, because a firearm<br>> makes it easier for a mugger to do his job. That, of course, is only<br>> true if the mugger\'s potential victims are mostly disarmed either by<br>> choice or by legislative fiat\--it has no validity when most of a<br>> mugger\'s potential marks are armed. **People who argue for the<br>> banning of arms ask for automatic rule by the young, the strong, and<br>> the many, and that\'s the exact opposite of a civilized society.**<br>> A mugger, even an armed one, can only make a successful living in a<br>> society where the state has granted him a force monopoly. \[Remember<br>> that the firearm makes the mugger\'s job *easier*, not *possible*\]<br>><br>> Then there\'s the argument that the gun makes confrontations lethal<br>> that otherwise would only result in injury. This argument is<br>> fallacious in several ways. Without guns involved, confrontations are<br>> won by the physically superior party inflicting overwhelming injury on<br>> the loser. People who think that fists, bats, sticks, or stones don\'t<br>> constitute lethal force watch too much TV, where people take beatings<br>> and come out of it with a bloody lip at worst. **The fact that the gun<br>> makes lethal force easier works solely in favor of the weaker<br>> defender, not the stronger attacker.** If both are armed, the field is<br>> level. The gun is the only weapon that\'s as lethal in the hands of an<br>> octogenarian as it is in the hands of a weightlifter. It simply<br>> wouldn\'t work as well as a force equalizer if it wasn\'t both lethal<br>> and easily employable.<br>><br>> When I carry a gun, I don\'t do so because I am looking for a fight,<br>> but because I\'m looking to be left alone. The gun at my side means<br>> that I cannot be forced, only persuaded. I don\'t carry it because<br>> I\'m afraid, but because it enables me to be unafraid. It doesn\'t<br>> limit the actions of those who would interact with me through reason,<br>> only the actions of those who would do so by force. It removes force<br>> from the equation.<br>><br>> And that\'s why carrying a gun is a civilized act.<br>><br>> ---Maj. L.
