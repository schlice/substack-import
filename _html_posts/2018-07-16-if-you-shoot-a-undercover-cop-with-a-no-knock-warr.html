<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you shoot a undercover cop with a no knock warrant for trespassing<br>have you commited \sic\ murder.?**<br><br>To be fair, the intersection of no-knock warrants and the Castle<br>Doctrine is a dangerous one, indeed.<br><br>But let's clear up a few issues with your question:<br><br>1.  Undercover officers never serve no-knock warrants. There are<br>    over 16,000 law enforcement agencies around this country and I could<br>    never hope to know the rules of every one, but I can tell you this<br>    with absolute certainty. You will never see an undercover officer<br>    serving a no-knock warrant. In fact, you'll rarely see a *uniformed<br>    patrol officer* conducing a no-knock warrant these days. In most<br>    cases, no-knock warrants are executed by SRT or SWAT teams where<br>    available, and even where not available, officers will use riot<br>    shields and will be wearing as much body armor as they can possibly<br>    adorn themselves with and still remain mobile. No-knock warrants, as<br>    you implied, are *dangerous*.<br>2.  Let's explain the difference between an "announced warrant" and a<br>    "no-knock warrant."\<br>    \<br>    Announced Warrant: Officer rings doorbell. Someone answers. Officer<br>    shows person answering the door (assuming the person is over 18) the<br>    search warrant, and officers let themselves in, sometimes over the<br>    objection of the person answering the door.\<br>    \<br>    No-Knock Warrant: Teams are stacked up outside the door, in the dark<br>    (usually the wee hours of the morning when most folks are asleep).<br>    The teams made a silent approach to the door. The officer or two<br>    holding the battering ram are in front. The officer declares, while<br>    swinging the ram, "Police! Search Warrant!" \<BANG!\> The ram hits<br>    the door, and officers storm in. Once they are inside, they continue<br>    to make that loud declaration of "Police" and "Search Warrant" as<br>    they sweep the rooms for threats. It goes from dead silence to very<br>    loud very quickly, and can indeed be disorienting. This is by<br>    design.\<br>    \<br>    No-knock warrants are issued when there is a high likelihood that<br>    evidence will be destroyed or suspects will escape between the time<br>    that officers ring the doorbell and the door is answered. Judges,<br>    with few exceptions, do not issue no-knock warrants lightly.<br><br>So the question remains: **can you shoot a police officer entering your<br>house via a no-knock warrant and *not* be convicted of murder?**<br><br>The answer to that very specific question is yes you can, although it is<br>highly unlikely. It has happened on at least one occasion where a<br>no-knock warrant was not executed well that a homeowner mistook police<br>for home invaders and shot and killed an officer because he was<br>genuinely in fear for his life.<br><br>In most cases, someone shooting at police will be treated as hostile,<br>and won't likely survive such an encounter.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
