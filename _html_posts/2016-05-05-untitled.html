<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think \"clearly a victim\" is a matter of perspective. And I don\'t<br>really see a problem here. If she was \"clearly a victim,\" she should<br>be shellacking the department with lawsuits and taking them for all<br>they\'re worth.<br><br>The problem here is *perception bias*. There are usually three sides to<br>every story. In this case, there\'s *her* side, there\'s the<br>*officer\'s* side, and there\'s the *truth*, which usually lies<br>somewhere in between the two stories. Our experiences are colored by our<br>life histories, and so we often frame what we see by what we know. It is<br>an assistive measure that helps our brains fill in the minor gaps in<br>space and time in our memories. So her version of the story is accurate<br>as far as her brain interpreted the events and recorded them in her<br>memory. In other words, as far as she knows, everything happened exactly<br>as she said.<br><br>Only there\'s a really good chance that it didn\'t.<br><br>Don\'t misunderstand. I\'m not saying she intentionally misrepresented<br>the truth. I believe that she truly believes the entire incident went<br>down exactly as she said it did. But our perception is biased in favor<br>of our beliefs, so while she truly believes everything happened exactly<br>as she said, it\'s likely that it did not.<br><br>And don\'t forget, every time you point at someone, there are three<br>fingers pointing back at you. So while you call others \"the problem,\"<br>you may be nearly as much of \"the problem\" as others are.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-are-people-so-scared-of-cops-and-hate-them-despite-their-great-service-and-self-sacrifice/answer/Christopher-Hawk<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
