<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are the first steps to take if you want to get rid of a<br>neighborhood Home owners Association (HOA)?**<br><br>You will first need to find out what is necessary in your area to<br>dissolve an HOA. It will require a certain percentage of the community<br>to sign their approval of the dissolution, and you will have to meet<br>that minimum standard. For many communities, it's 3/4 of the homeowners;<br>for others, it's 100%.<br><br>You will then need to ascertain a list of everything that the HOA pays<br>for, and all real property that the HOA owns. Usually, the things the<br>HOA pays for are associated with the real property the HOA owns. Common<br>areas can be donated to non-profit organizations, who would then take<br>over the ongoing maintenance of those areas. For example, a playground<br>may be taken over by a non-profit organization, who would then be<br>responsible for paying for things like watering the grass, paying for<br>the general liability insurance on the area, upkeep of equipment, etc.<br><br>If the HOA owns roads, the roads would revert back to city/county<br>ownership, and the city would have to agree to annex that property. This<br>part could take some time. Your attorney can help you with all of that.<br><br>On that note, you will do all of this with the assistance of a licensed<br>real estate attorney in your area who specializes in HOA law. This<br>attorney will also need to be paid, along with the filing fees to file<br>the HOA dissolution documents with the city/county.<br><br>The place to start, therefore, is a comprehensive survey of all property<br>owners in the community, since you will need all of their help to<br>dissolve an HOA.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
