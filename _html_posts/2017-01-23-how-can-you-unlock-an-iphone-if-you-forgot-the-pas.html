<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are a few ways. None of them are wonderful.<br><br>1.  Continue entering wrong passwords until the iPhone is wiped,<br>    assuming that it was set to wipe after a certain number of incorrect<br>    passwords. Once it is wiped, restore from the most recent iCloud<br>    backup.<br>2.  Use someone else's phone or a tablet to log into<br>    [iCloud.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f30a9e&url=http://iCloud.com){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="icloud.com"}]{.qlink_container} with your iTunes<br>    credentials and wipe your phone remotely. You'll find the remote<br>    administration options under "Find my iPhone" assuming that it was<br>    enabled on the iPhone in question. Again, once it is wiped, restore<br>    it from the most recent iCloud backup.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
