<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>1.  First, they need to win back the House. You only need a simple<br>    majority in the House to pass Articles of Impeachment.<br>2.  Then, they need to find an impeachable charge. But after Clinton and<br>    Trump, what is considered "impeachable" is considerably less these<br>    days, so this may not be too difficult.<br><br>But that said, because of Clinton and Trump, "impeachment" is utterly<br>meaningless. It's almost a "badge of honor" having been impeached.<br><br>It takes the Senate to remove a President from office, and that takes a<br>2/3 majority of the Senate to do. So even if he is impeached, he won't<br>be removed from office unless he does something so reprehensible that<br>even his own party would want to distance themselves from him.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How possible will it be for the GOP to impeach President Joe Biden?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
