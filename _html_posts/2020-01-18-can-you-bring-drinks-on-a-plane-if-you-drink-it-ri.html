<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you bring drinks on a plane if you drink it right in front of the<br>TSA agent\'s face to prove that it\'s a drink?**<br><br>First of all, the problem isn't bringing drinks on a plane. The problem<br>is bringing drinks through the security checkpoint. You can bring drinks<br>on a plane; you just have to buy them inside the sterile area.<br><br>Wanna hear the cool logic about why not?<br><br>If I'm a suicide bomber, and I want to use a liquid bomb, I'll be happy<br>to drink some of the liquid in front of you.<br><br>Because I'm going to die in a horrible mid-air explosion anyway. So<br>what's a little bit of poison before I die?<br><br>If I'm truly committed to the cause, I'd be *happy* to drink poison in<br>front of you.<br><br>So that's the logic.<br><br>But here's the good news: you can bring *empty bottles* through the<br>security checkpoint and fill them once you get inside. Many large<br>airports have "bottle stations" which deliver filtered water straight<br>into your bottle.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-ce5bdc02b2e265e47c665a57ac5721c6){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-ce5bdc02b2e265e47c665a57ac5721c6" master_w="374"<br>master_h="653"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Some even have integrated drinking stations built in to them:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-83a57b6a0db2e5e52455c225e5970bfd){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-83a57b6a0db2e5e52455c225e5970bfd" master_w="319"<br>master_h="510"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>So you can still get water without having to bring it through security.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
