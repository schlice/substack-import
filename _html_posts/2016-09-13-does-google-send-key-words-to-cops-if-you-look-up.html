<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: no.<br><br>Longer answer: If the police came to Google with a warrant and said<br>"Please give us the search history for the following IP address:<br>1.2.3.4", Google would turn over everything they had for that IP<br>address.<br><br>*It doesn't work the other way around.*<br><br>Google doesn't voluntarily hand information over to anyone, let alone<br>police, terrorism task forces, Interpol, or anyone else. Go to them with<br>a warrant, and you will get whatever information they have. But they're<br>not in the business of busily handing over IP information on every<br>keyword search that looks threatening. Google is a *business*. They're<br>not around for public benefit. Yes, they provide a service, and a good<br>one at that. That's why they make the money they do. But don't kid<br>yourself, they're not the altruistic organization many make them out to<br>be. They're a business, out to make money. As much money as they can<br>legally make. Turning information directly over to the police, without<br>them asking, doesn't make them any money. They are under no affirmative<br>requirement to inform the police about any keyword searches. They are<br>not a law enforcement agency.<br><br>If you're concerned about Internet privacy, you should look in to how to<br>conceal your identity online. Please take a few minutes and learn more<br>about what you can do to protect yourself online.

Now why would you do that? If you<br>had nothing to hide, why bother?<br><br>Because in theory, *they have no right to know what I'm doing, it's<br>supposed to be private.* They *shouldn't ever look in the first place.*<br>That said, the very fact that this question is being asked means that no<br>one trusts anyone, especially the government. So I'm not hiding my<br>information from police. I'm hiding it from people that have no right to<br>see it in the first place. I'm not doing anything illegal. That doesn't<br>give you the right to spy on me without a warrant.<br><br>I never want the questioned scenario to accidentally happen to me, so I<br>conceal my identity when I browse. You should too.<br><br>Regards,\<br>Bill Stein (if that *is* my real name...)<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
