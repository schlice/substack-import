I imagine that would be as soon as you recognize<br>that the driver is "reckless," since the very definition of reckless<br>driving means creating conditions which are dangerous to other drivers.<br><br>You will have to tell them some other things as well:<br><br>- Your location, what road, what direction, and what mile marker you are<br>  at<br>- Whether or not you will sign a formal charge against the driver. The<br>  police cannot press charges without observing the infraction<br>  themselves. The witness would have to be willing to sign the<br>  complaint, which potentially means testifying in court as to what you<br>  saw.<br>- Your real name, your real phone number, and (later) your real address.<br><br>In Colorado, we have "Safety Enforcement Zones" set up by the State<br>Patrol where citizens can call a special number from their mobile phones<br>to report reckless or dangerous drivers.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-5d9e28dbef138c0c24b100e8e8ba8806){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-5d9e28dbef138c0c24b100e8e8ba8806" master_w="135"<br>master_h="96"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>We have one on I-25, just north of my city.
