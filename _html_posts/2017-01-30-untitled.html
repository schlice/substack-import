<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Your question reminds me of Homer Simpson\'s dad when he was writing a<br>letter to the president:<br><br>"Dear Mr. President: there are too many states nowadays. Please<br>eliminate three. I am not a crackpot."<br><br>The states are what they are. And I think you are thinking of the House,<br>not the Senate. In the Senate, every state gets two Senators, from<br>California to Rhode Island.<br><br>Therefore, the Senate provides the states-based balance to Congress that<br>the House lacks. The House provides the population-based focus to<br>legislation, and the two together, which are required to pass laws,<br>strike a good balance.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-can-the-US-political-structure-be-reformed-between-Rural-and-Urban-voters/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
