<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Since the most destructive military weapon ever, the<br>nuclear warhead, is no longer in development, I would say that the most<br>destructive military weapon currently in development is the **rail<br>gun.**\<br>\<br>]<br><br>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0fe6c2&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D-uV1SbEuzFU){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="youtube.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>.\<br>\<br>The railgun is a *kinetic energy* weapon, meaning it doesn\'t use<br>explosives to destroy its target, but the kinetic energy imparted to it<br>when it is fired to literally disintegrate the target just using the<br>force of the shot. The raligun uses powerful electromagnets to<br>accelerate a projectile without the use of explosives or fueled<br>accelerants to extremely high speeds.\<br>\<br>Rail gun rounds can potentially exceed *Mach 10* which means that they<br>have far more destructive power over greater distances, without the need<br>to store explosives.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
