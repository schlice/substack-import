<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you have a higher risk of developing multiple sclerosis if you have<br>a lot of allergies?**<br><br>There is no direct epidemiological link currently established between<br>allergies and development of MS.<br><br>From the National MS Society:<br><br>> There is no evidence that an allergic reaction to a specific<br>> environmental allergen is involved in triggering MS. Therefore, there<br>> is no scientific rationale for the anti-allergy treatment regimens<br>> that are offered by some alternative medicine therapists to treat MS.<br>> Some of these treatments involve avoiding certain food groups or<br>> taking medication directed against a supposed allergen. They might<br>> actually cause harm by creating a nutritional deficiency, and should<br>> therefore be discussed with a knowledgeable health-care professional.<br>><br>> Allergic reactions to many things in our environment, including<br>> synthetic chemical allergens, are commonplace. This has led people to<br>> suppose that such allergens may also be triggering agents in MS. MS is<br>> generally considered an \"autoimmune\" disease, one in which the<br>> body\'s immune system is directed against itself. Just what part or<br>> parts of the central nervous system the immune cells attack in people<br>> with MS has not yet been precisely identified, nor has the trigger<br>> that initiates this autoimmune process been identified.<br>><br>> Since allergies are common in the general population, allergies can<br>> coexist in a person with MS. Such allergies should be given<br>> appropriate medical attention, and persons with serious allergies<br>> should consider wearing medical alert bracelets or necklaces.<br>> Maintaining good general health, including management of allergies, is<br>> a positive approach to living with multiple<br>> sclerosis.\[1\](#stDpa){#cite-stDpa .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-stDpa){.citation_index}<br>[Allergies(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=539ca7&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Living-Well-With-MS/Diet-Exercise-Healthy-Behaviors/Managing-MS-and-Another-Condition/Allergies){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
