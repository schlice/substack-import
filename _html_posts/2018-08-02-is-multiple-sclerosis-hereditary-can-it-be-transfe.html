<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is multiple sclerosis hereditary? Can it be transferred from a mother<br>to a daughter?**<br><br>MS itself is not hereditary; however, the conditions that allow a person<br>to develop MS seem to have a familial component.<br><br>The current risk in society of developing MS is about 1 in 750. The risk<br>for people with first-degree relatives (i.e. parents or siblings) who<br>have MS increases to anywhere between 1 in 100 and 1 in 40.<br><br>It's not all genetics though. And you can tell that through the<br>identical twin example. If you take two identical twins, and one has MS,<br>the risk of the other developing MS is 1 in 4 (25%). If it was all<br>genetic, then the risk to the other twin would be 100%, but it is not.<br><br>So while genetics plays a role in determining risk, there are, of<br>course, other factors at play. These risk factors include sex, family<br>history, ethnicity, geography of birth and childhood, and exposure to an<br>as-of-yet unidentified infectious trigger.<br><br>- SEX: Females are two to three times more likely to develop MS than<br>  males. Scientists believe that one\'s tendency to develop MS therefore<br>  has some hormonal connection.<br>- ETHNICITY: MS is more common among Caucasians (particularly those of<br>  northern European ancestry) than other ethnic groups, and is almost<br>  unheard of in some populations, such as Inuit, Yakutes, Hutterites,<br>  Hungarian Romani, Norwegian Lapps, Australian Aborigines, and New<br>  Zealand Maoris.<br>- GEOGRAPHY: MS occurs with greatest frequency in higher latitudes<br>  (above 40Â° latitude) away from the equator, than in lower latitudes,<br>  closer to the equator. This may have something to do with vitamin D<br>  production in the skin, and the vitamin\'s prophylactic effect on the<br>  development of MS. The exact details about vitamin D\'s involvement<br>  with the prevention of MS, however, is still unclear. Moving from one<br>  geographic area to another seems to alter a person\'s risk of<br>  developing MS. Studies show that families and their children will<br>  assume the new risk level (higher or lower) of the area to which they<br>  move. Those who move before the age of 15 generally take on the new<br>  risk themselves. Those who move after the age of 15 may not see the<br>  new risk appear until the next generation.<br>- INFECTIOUS TRIGGER: Scientists have been searching for years for an<br>  infectious agent that might trigger MS. While many different viruses<br>  have been suggested, including rabies, herpes simplex virus, measles,<br>  corona virus, canine distemper virus, HTLV-1, Epstein-Barr virus,<br>  among others, none has yet been confirmed. Chlamydia pneumoniae, a<br>  bacteria which 90% of the population has been exposed to over their<br>  lifetime, has also been suggested but never proven. Although no<br>  trigger has yet been identified, most MS experts believe that some<br>  infectious agent is involved in initiating the disease process.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
