<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Um, sounds like you've misinterpreted Matthew 7:1 also. And what the<br>vast majority of people miss is the context. **For text, without<br>context, is just pretext**.<br><br>Many individuals understand Jesus\' meaning as \"You don\'t have the<br>right to tell me I\'m wrong,\" and use this scripture to try to silence<br>their critics. When read in isolation, Jesus\' admonition to \"Judge<br>not\" does appear to exclude all critical judgments. But the paragraph<br>is much more than just those words.<br><br>When the Bible says that we should not judge, this doesn't mean we can't<br>show discernment. Just a little later, Jesus says, "Do not give dogs<br>what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may<br>trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces" (Matthew<br>7:6 NIV). Later, He continues: "Watch out for false prophets. . . . By<br>their fruit you will recognize them" (verses 15--16).<br><br>If we cannot judge, then how are we to know who are "dogs," "pigs," or<br>"false prophets?" Jesus is indeed giving us the ability to tell right<br>from wrong.<br><br>Actually, in another Bible passage, Jesus gives *the direct command to<br>judge:* "Stop judging by mere appearances, but instead judge correctly"<br>(John 7:24 NIV). So now we're starting to see what Jesus was actually<br>saying about judging wrongly:<br><br>- Superficial judgement is wrong. It is sinful to pass judgement on<br>  someone based solely on their appearance.<br>- Hypocritical judgement is wrong. Jesus warns against hypocrisy in<br>  Matthew 7:3-5 and commands us not to judge others in Matthew 7:1. He<br>  compares us to hypocrites in Matthew 6:2, 5, and 16. When we blame<br>  others for their wrongdoing while committing the same sin ourselves,<br>  we are really just condemning ourselves (Romans 2:1).<br>- Unforgiving judgement is wrong. According to Titus 3:2, we must<br>  \"always be gentle toward everyone.\" As Jesus cautioned, \"In the<br>  same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure<br>  you use, it will be measured to you\" (Matthew 7:2), it is the<br>  merciful who will receive mercy (Matthew 5:7).<br>- Untrue judgement is wrong. Bearing false witness is sinful (Proverbs<br>  19:5). "Slander no one" (Titus 3:2)<br><br>TL;DR: We are commanded against judging unfairly or<br>unrighteously, but Jesus commands "correct judgement." We are to be<br>discerning (Colossians 1:9; 1 Thessalonians 5:21). We are to preach the<br>whole Gospel, including teaching about sin (Acts 20:27; 2 Timothy 4:2).<br>We are to gently confront our brothers or sisters in Christ who have<br>lost their way or have erred (Galatians 6:1). We are to speak the truth<br>in love (Ephesians 4:15).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
