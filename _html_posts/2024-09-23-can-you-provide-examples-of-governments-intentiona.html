<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>President Obama, in a January 2008 interview with the San Francisco<br>Chronicle editorial board, said, "Under my plan...electricity rates<br>would necessarily skyrocket."<br><br>This was Obama touting his plan for "cap and trade," which would kill<br>the fossil fuel industry by pricing it out of existence. This was to<br>push his "green energy" agenda.<br><br>Thankfully, "cap and trade" died in the Senate in 2010, leaving the EPA<br>holding the bag. And their greenhouse gas regulations for future power<br>plants, which were specifically designed to cripple the coal industry,<br>caused many plants to shut down, and canceled many more plans to build<br>new plants, which sent electricity costs skyrocketing (just as Obama<br>predicted).<br><br>This is a perfect example of government intentionally causing<br>hyperinflation to push a political agenda.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
