<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can a police department fire an officer if he has to leave for a<br>deployment?**<br><br>*Technically*, they can. However, under most circumstances, they must<br>re-hire the officer upon his return into a position of equal grade as<br>the position he left, and he cannot lose any senority (i.e. he will<br>re-start in the organization as if he had never left).<br><br>The law (the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act,<br>or USERRA) protects both the interests of the Guardsman/Reservist as<br>well as the employer. It states that certain extenuating circumstances<br>will relieve the employer from re-hiring the Guardsman/Reservist (when<br>the employer's circumstances have changed so radically that reemployment<br>would be unreasonable, or if the person worked at highly irregular or<br>seasonal employment). However, employment at a police department (which<br>is also considered a local government agency and follows stricter rules<br>than civilian employment) should not fall under those categories.<br><br>Most employers hold the position open while the Guardsman/Reservist is<br>deployed. If they are gone on a full deployment (6 months or more), the<br>employer can backfill the slot, but again, according to the law, the<br>employer must re-hire the Guardsman/Reservist at the same grade he was<br>at before he left, with no loss of tenure or senority.<br><br>Employers are only required to pay a deployed reservist the difference<br>between their military pay and what they were making when not deployed.<br>My employer did not do this, and they voluntarily chose to continue to<br>pay me at my normal salaried rate.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
