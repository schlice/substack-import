<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Absolutely.\<br>\<br>Canada shares one of the longest open borders with us between any two<br>nations in the world. It\'s in our national interest to keep Canada<br>sovereign.\<br>\<br>We have several joint ventures with Canada, and one of the most notable<br>of them is<br>[NORAD(https://www.quora.com/topic/NORAD)]{.qlink_container} , the<br>North American Aerospace Defense Command, a joint US/Canadian military<br>command, tasked with defending North America. If aircraft were to start<br>invading either territory, NORAD aircraft would be intercepting those<br>aircraft, so in a way, we would be defending Canada by default.\<br>\<br>We share resources with Canada when it comes to our mutual defense;<br>through NORAD, Canada hosts the \"DEW Line\" (the Distant Early Warning<br>Line) of radar stations along the northern border, which was originally<br>watching over the Polar ice cap waiting for Russian Bear bombers to head<br>towards Ottawa and Washington D.C. The United States hosts PARCS radar<br>stations along both coasts, watching for those inbound aircraft.\<br>\<br>We are virtually \"joined at the hip\" with Canada, and it would be a<br>difficult argument to make that the defense of Canada is not in the best<br>interest of the United States.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
