I can't find any record of his<br>fundraising activities benefitting anyone in the MS community, nor any<br>dollars going to the National MS Society or any other multiple<br>sclerosis-related charities.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
