<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If someone has a child in secret, and doesn\'t tell anyone about him<br>until he is 18, so that he has no documents and no records about him<br>anywhere, how would this situation be handled by the legal authority?**<br><br>*(US answer; laws in other countries may vary)*<br><br>Once the child turns 18, he is considered an adult. There is nothing to<br>"handle" any more. There are no further child support payments which<br>need to be made, and in any case, those payments should have been<br>requested during the time that the child was a child.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
