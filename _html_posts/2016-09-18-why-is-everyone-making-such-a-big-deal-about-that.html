<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Since you asked, there actually is a law.<br><br>4 USC Chapter 8: "No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the<br>United States of America"<br><br>36 USC Chapter 10, ยง171. Conduct during playing: "During rendition<br>of the national anthem when the flag is displayed, all present except<br>those in uniform should stand at attention facing the flag with the<br>right hand over the heart. Men not in uniform should remove their<br>headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the<br>hand being over the heart. Persons in uniform should render the military<br>salute at the first note of the anthem and retain this position until<br>the last note. When the flag is not displayed, those present should face<br>toward the music and act in the same manner they would if the flag were<br>displayed there."<br><br>So did he break a law? Technically, yes. So why wasn't he arrested?<br><br>In recent times, people have exerted their First Amendment right to<br>freedom of speech, and people assert that their right to freedom of<br>expression makes these sections of United States Code unconstitutional.<br>While these particular laws were never tested, the portion of US Code<br>which talks about not burning the flag was found to be unconstitutional<br>in the case of [[Texas v.<br>Johnson](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2d1c15&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_v._Johnson){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. This invalidated any<br>laws which barred burning the flag, which were present in 48 of 50<br>states, and the section of US Code which also barred burning the flag.<br><br>Thus, it's fairly *common knowledge* that expressing oneself in any<br>manner, even if it violates a law, can be claimed to be protected under<br>the First Amendment. The "conduct during playing" laws can fairly easily<br>be equated to the prohibitions on burning the flag, and most would say<br>that his conduct was protected First Amendment expression.<br><br>In Kaepernick's case, the question is not the legality of the action.<br>The question is the intent and the motivation, and his reasoning behind<br>his decision to sit during the National Anthem.<br><br>\"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that<br>oppresses black people and people of color,\" Kaepernick told NFL Media<br>in an exclusive interview after the game in which he sat during the<br>National Anthem. \"To me, this is bigger than football and it would be<br>selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street<br>and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\" Note that<br>he is referring to police officers who, when involved in a shooting, are<br>placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the<br>investigation, and he claims they are "getting away with murder."<br><br>Kaepernick is parroting tired tropes used by hate groups such as Black<br>Lives Matter, whose favorite conceit is that the most dangerous thing to<br>a young black man in America is a racist police officer. These are<br>simply lies, plain and simple. We've been over the facts which show<br>this organization is based on nothing more than vapid lies, I won't do<br>it again here. If you want specifics, ask a specific question about<br>them.<br><br>The big problem with his "protest" is that the flag represents **far<br>more** than black people, and people of color, and racist police<br>officers. Doesn't the flag represent all of the people who fought for<br>hundreds of years against black oppression? Doesn't the flag represent<br>patriots like President Abraham Lincoln? Doesn't it represent patriots<br>like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.? Doesn't it represent every soldier,<br>sailor, and airman who donned a United States Armed Forces uniform and<br>served their country, some even making the ultimate sacrifice, so that<br>he can play a game and be paid to do it, that gave him this impressive<br>stage to parrot his lies?<br><br>The flag represents the *entire nation*. The nation is indeed flawed. We<br>have had our share of problems, from the mistreatment of the American<br>Indian, to the slave trade, Prohibition, the War on Drugs, and many<br>others. *THESE* are the real killers of the black man, NOT the<br>police!<br><br>And if Black Lives Mattered so much, why are they not doing more to<br>defend black lives *in the womb*? Truly, the most dangerous place in<br>America to be black is in the womb! Did you know that in New York City,<br>more black babies are *aborted* than are *born?* Did you know that<br>nationally, more black women have abortions than white or Hispanic<br>women? And when percentage of the population is added to the mix, blacks<br>are represented to a much higher degree in the abortion clinics than any<br>other race. Why isn't BLM promoting fatherhood instead of inciting<br>murdering police officers?<br><br>In summary, Kaepernick chose the wrong platform to promote. It's<br>stupid and wrong. And the league allows him to not only parrot these<br>cop-killing lies, but he gets to disrespect the entire heritage of our<br>nation in the name of "black lives" which he may care about, but the<br>organizations which purport to do the same, don't. And since the league<br>doesn't care, I will show the league how I feel with my wallet. I'm done<br>with the NFL. I'm back to NCAA Football. The Air Force Academy Falcons<br>would *NEVER* disrespect the flag, because they are training to be<br>military officers. They know the history of sacrifice, for everyone,<br>that the flag represents. Go Big Blue!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
