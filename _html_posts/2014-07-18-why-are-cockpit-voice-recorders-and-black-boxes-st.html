<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [The answer is easy: money.\<br/>\<br/>The airline industry is one of the penny-pinchingest industries out<br/>there, with profit margins hovering just around 1%. This low margin is<br/>primarily due to government regulations and the cost of jet fuel.<br/>Anything that increases cost is very closely scrutinized. The Economist<br/>magazine reported that airlines made a profit of \$4 per passenger in<br/>2012.\<br/>\<br/>The cost in streaming black box data over satellite is the satellite<br/>transmission cost, which based on the amount of data recorded by the<br/>black box, would run roughly \$5 to \$7 per minute to transmit the data<br/>for a flight over the Iridium satellite data network. So a typical 2<br/>hour flight would cost \$840 for data transmission. Divide that up over<br/>the 335 passengers that can be carried in an Airbus A330 and your profit<br/>margin of \$4 per passenger is now reduced by \$2.50, leaving the<br/>airline making \$1.50 per passenger, a number which is unacceptable to<br/>the airlines.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
