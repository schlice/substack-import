<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do cameras on top of traffic lights record accidents?<br><br>No, for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that there is no<br>infrastructure to do so. The camera (a low-resolution inexpensive<br>camera) replaces the old ground loop sensor to tell the traffic light<br>system that a car is waiting at the light. That's all it does: presence<br>of car, absence of car. It's not powerful enough to provide any useful<br>information, and it is focused on the lane or lanes it is monitoring,<br>it's not a wide-angle security camera.<br><br>Its feed is connected to the light controller.<br><br>Some cities have broadband feeds to the light controllers and can watch<br>live the information from the cameras, but again, the feed is low-res<br>and mostly useless for much else besides sensing the presence of a car.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
