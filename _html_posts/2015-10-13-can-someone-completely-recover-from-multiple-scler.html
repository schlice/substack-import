<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There is no cure for multiple sclerosis. So the short<br>answer is no, you cannot recover from multiple sclerosis.\<br>\<br>Some people have achieved remission to the point where it\'s nearly<br>impossible to tell that they have MS in the first place. Some people<br>have a form of MS called \"benign MS\" which exhibits one symptom and<br>then goes into remission, for as many as 10 years or more.\<br>\<br>However, no one has ever \"completely recovered\" from<br>MS.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
