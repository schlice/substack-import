<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Jesus talked of the importance of forgiveness, and yet a lot of people<br>never forgive. Why exactly?**<br><br>*Because it's hard.*<br><br>It's tough to forgive someone who has wronged you. It doesn't seem<br>"fair," does it?<br><br>But in fairness, no one ever said that being a Christ follower was going<br>to be easy. In fact, Jesus himself told his followers that life as a<br>follower would be tough:<br><br>> *I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In<br>> this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the<br>> world.*<br>><br>> - John 16:33<br><br>Jesus was telling them that life would be tough. And if you read through<br>the accounts of some of the giants of the faith, you'll see exactly<br>that. Life was tough for them. But they persevered.<br><br>We must also persevere, even when God's plan for our lives doesn't<br>appear to make sense. And unfortunately, that happens a lot.<br><br>> *Unfortunately, many young believers---and some older ones, too---do<br>> not know that there will be times in every person's life when<br>> circumstances don't add up--- when God doesn't appear to make sense.<br>> This aspect of the Christian faith is not well advertised. We tend to<br>> teach new Christians the portions of our theology that are attractive<br>> to a secular mind. For example, Campus Crusade for Christ (an<br>> evangelistic ministry I respect highly) has distributed millions of<br>> booklets called "The Four Spiritual Laws." The first of those<br>> scriptural principles states, "God loves you and offers a wonderful<br>> plan for your life." That statement is certainly true. However, it<br>> implies that a believer will always comprehend the "wonderful plan"<br>> and that he or she will approve of it. That may not be true.*<br>><br>> - Dr. James C. Dobson, *Why, God, Why?*<br><br>We may *never* understand God's ultimate plan for our life and how He<br>intends to use us to fulfill His purposes until that day we stand in<br>front of Him and get to ask all those questions.<br><br>What He tells us, though, is that it is God's place to mete out<br>judgment, and it is our place to forgive, even when it is hard for us to<br>do so. It's not our job to judge people. Let God do His job.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
