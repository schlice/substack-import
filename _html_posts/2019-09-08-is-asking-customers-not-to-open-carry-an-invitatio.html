<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is asking customers not to open carry an invitation to mass<br>shooters?**<br><br>Let's answer your question by asking another question.<br><br>*Why aren't there any mass shootings at police stations or gun ranges?*<br><br>The answer: armed resistance.<br><br>Mass shooters may have lost their grasp on reality, but that does not<br>make them stupid. They know they want to kill as many people as they<br>possibly can before they go down in a blaze of glory. This is undisputed<br>fact. Every mass shooter who remained alive after their shooting has<br>admitted that this was their goal. This is why police all over the<br>country have re-tooled their active shooter protocols to get in as<br>quickly as possible without waiting for backup forces to try to engage<br>the shooter immediately. History has shown that mass shooters will end<br>their shooting sprees when confronted with armed resistance.<br><br>**Mass shootings, therefore, happen in places where shooters are likely<br>to find the least armed resistance.**<br><br>To that end, does it make more sense to *increase* or *decrease* the<br>amount of armed resistance a mass shooter might encounter in any<br>particular location?<br><br>Clearly then, this call to end open carry in stores is not something<br>done out of an abundance of safety. It's done out of *fear,* as a<br>knee-jerk reaction, and it's also done to *virtue-signal* that you're<br>one of the "woke" corporations who finds gun violence distasteful, and<br>to even allow law-abiding citizens to exercise their rights is somehow<br>similarly distasteful. Never mind that it equates law-abiding citizens<br>to criminals. Never mind that Home Depot still rented trucks to people<br>after a madman killed eight and injured 11 more with a rented Home Depot<br>truck in New York City. But guns? Sure, let's virtue-signal with those.<br><br>Let's note that this has nothing whatsoever to do with *concealed<br>carry*. So their virtue signaling affects me not in the least.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
