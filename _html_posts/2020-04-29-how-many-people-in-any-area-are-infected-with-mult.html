<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How many people in any area are infected with multiple sclerosis?<br><br>First off, people are not "infected" with MS. It's not a bacterial or<br>viral infection you can "catch." It's an *autoimmune* condition, where<br>the body's immune system malfunctions and attacks itself. So people<br>would be "affected by" MS, or "living with" MS or "diagnosed with" MS.<br>It's inaccurate to say "infected" with MS.<br><br>Anyway, disease rates vary by location. Certain areas and certain<br>populations have virtually no MS at all, like the Hutterites or the<br>Inuit or the Yakutes, or Hungarian Romani, Norwegian Lapps, Australian<br>Aborigines, and New Zealand Maoris.<br><br>Disease rates vary also by ethnicity. It is most common among white<br>women of northern European ancestry (women are two to three times more<br>likely to develop MS than men).<br><br>Even within the United States, some states have a higher incidence of MS<br>than others, so it's really hard to pinpoint in any area just how many<br>people have MS.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
