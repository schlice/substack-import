<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, the airline does not provide wheelchair service. The<br>airport does. It\'s an important distinction. The service that runs<br>wheelchairs around the airport is provided by the airport; the airline<br>only indirectly funds the service through landing fees.<br><br>Secondly, ADA makes all disability services easy to abuse. All I have to<br>do is *claim* I have a disability. I don\'t have to *prove* I<br>have a disability. This isn\'t limited to airport wheelchairs (think<br>\"assistance animals\" akin to glamour girls with purse pups).<br><br>There are several practical reasons why airports provide wheelchair<br>service.<br><br>1\. The infamous and troublesome Americans with Disabilities Act. ADA<br>requirements say that disabled persons need to have the same access to<br>facilities that non-disabled persons do. Therefore, to get disabled<br>persons through the airport expediently, wheelchair service is provided.<br><br>2\. Wheelchairs owned and operated by the airport can go into and out of<br>the security checkpoint without a tremendous amount of security<br>difficulty.<br><br>3\. Disabled persons must transfer from a traditional wheelchair (in the<br>airport) to an aircraft wheelchair (in the plane) because it fits down<br>the aircraft aisle.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
