<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In general, police cannot enter private property without probable cause<br>and a search warrant. This is because of the Fourth Amendment, which<br>prohibits unreasonable search.<br><br>There are, as with everything, exceptions to that rule. Among other<br>reasons, police can enter private property if they see something illegal<br>in plain view. This is called the "plain sight" exception. With<br>marijuana being such a distinctive smell, the "plain smell" exception<br>extends the "plain sight" exception.<br><br>Also, if the police see or hear a person in distress, or if they see or<br>hear a crime being committed, or if they are made aware that evidence is<br>going to be destroyed or a known fugitive is going to escape, the<br>exception called "exigent circumstances" allows police to enter that<br>private property.<br><br>There are other limited exceptions to the warrant requirements (i.e.<br>search incident to an arrest, etc), but plain sight and exigent<br>circumstances are the biggest ones.<br><br>Beyond any exceptions though, in order for police to enter private<br>property, they must have a warrant to search. This is the requirement<br>under the Fourth Amendment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
