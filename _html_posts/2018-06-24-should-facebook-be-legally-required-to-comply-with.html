<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should Facebook be legally required to comply with the first amendment<br>and stop banning people for breaking its community guidelines?**<br><br>Short answer: no, because they are not bound by the 1st Amendment.<br><br>The 1st Amendment says generally that government cannot make a law<br>banning speech. It says nothing about how a private business writes its<br>Terms and Conditions as well as its User Agreement as to how people use<br>the system.<br><br>Facebook is a private business, not a government agency. It is under no<br>obligation to allow you to say anything you like on its platform, and it<br>can indeed ban people for speech it doesn't like. If that weren't the<br>case, Quora wouldn't be allowed to have a [[BNBR<br>policy](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Quoras-Be-Nice-Be-Respectful-policy)]{.qlink_container},<br>and wouldn't be able to enforce it.<br><br>You may have a First Amendment right to speak, but that doesn't mean you<br>can walk into Walmart and start using racial epithets and slurs simply<br>because you *can*. You'd better believe that Walmart will ask you to<br>leave, and will call the police if you don't, and they would not be<br>violating your First Amendment rights for doing so.<br><br>Now, if you go out to the street corner and say the same thing, you'd<br>definitely have a First Amendment right to do so. You might get your ass<br>beat as well, but that would be the natural consequence of such<br>language. Not to say that violence is justified, but it might be the<br>natural follow-on to that kind of speech.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
