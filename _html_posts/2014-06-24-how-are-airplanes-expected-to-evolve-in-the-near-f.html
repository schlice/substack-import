<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [We are already seeing some of that evolution with the<br/>\"Internet of Things\" (IoT) and the \"Big Data\" movement. Airplanes<br/>will continuously be sending \"telemetry\" data back to their<br/>maintenance offices, which are receiving and processing that data. This<br/>data shows all of the aircraft\'s flight characteristics as well as the<br/>performance of all of the aircraft\'s key systems, because the IoT has<br/>sensors in nearly every component, and they all send real-time data.<br/>What does all that mean? It means that instead of replacing parts<br/>after they break, a maintenance facility can monitor an aircraft and<br/>see the telemetry data that shows what a part is doing just before<br/>it is going to break. This way, they can have the part ready at the<br/>aircraft\'s next stop, and they can have the part replaced. The end<br/>result will be *the elimination of unplanned downtime of aircraft.*\<br/>\<br/>Another innovation you will start to see is more automation. With more<br/>collision avoidance systems becoming smarter and more interconnected<br/>with other aircraft systems like guidance systems, you will see aircraft<br/>not only guided by GPS, but aircraft interconnected with each other so<br/>that they will make *automated course corrections*. ATC will not<br/>need to manually correct aircraft courses as aircraft will all be in<br/>digital communications with each other and can make course corrections<br/>as needed. ATC can input system-wide course corrections around specific<br/>locations, and the system will allow for aircraft to update their<br/>courses around these locations. \"Filing your flight plan\" will become<br/>as simple as inputting your destination into the system when you take<br/>your seat. In a few seconds, your flight plan is downloaded to your<br/>system and is on file with ATC.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
