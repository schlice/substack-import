<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Yes, there is thought to be oligodendrocyte involvement in<br>multiple sclerosis.\<br>\<br>While the mechanism is not completely known, it is thought that immune<br>and toxic mechanisms, such as cytokines, reactive oxygen or nitrogen<br>species, and excitatory amino acids, may damage oligodendrocytes during<br>MS activation and later courses of the disease (it is thought that<br>remyelination through oligodendrocyte activity occurs in the early part<br>of the disease). It is theorized that primary oligodendrocyte death is<br>one of the mechanisms that causes demyelination and subsequent axon<br>death in later courses of the disease.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
