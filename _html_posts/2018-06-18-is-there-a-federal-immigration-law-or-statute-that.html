<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there a federal immigration law or statute that permits the<br>separation of family; and, if not, can immigrant children sue the<br>federal government or head of agency in federal or UN courts?**<br><br>There is, in fact, federal immigration law that permits the children of<br>criminals to be removed while the criminals are processed through the<br>ICE criminal system for deportation back to their home country. Those<br>criminals are sent to prison, and since you can't have kids in prison,<br>your children are separated from you. The federal immigration law<br>pertains to people who illegally cross the border and attempt to enter<br>the country.<br><br>The people who have been separated from their children have attempted to<br>unlawfully enter this country. That means they broke the law. People who<br>break the law are colloquially known as "criminals."<br><br>Some argue that children are being separated from people who wish to<br>claim asylum. This may be true. However, there is also a legal process<br>to claim asylum, and it is not by unlawfully crossing the border.<br>The only people who have been separated from their children are people<br>who have unlawfully crossed the border. Asylum seekers who lawfully<br>present themselves to Customs officials and request political asylum do<br>not have their children separated from them.<br><br>Indeed, criminal aliens have, in some cases, been told that if they are<br>captured, they should claim asylum, because that's the "magic bullet"<br>that will keep you in the country. This is untrue. The magic bullet only<br>works if you present yourself at a border crossing and request asylum.<br>The magic bullet doesn't work if you sneak across the border and are<br>subsequently caught. You will be deported (and before you are, your<br>children may be separated from you) and you will be told to present<br>yourself at a border crossing and request political asylum.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
