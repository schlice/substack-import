Also, bonus points for interesting traditions*<br><br>Well, I'm due for a few bonus points, so here goes.<br><br>The United States Military Academy at West Point was originally an Army<br>fort. General Washington considered West Point to be the most important<br>strategic position in America. He personally selected Thaddeus<br>Kosciuszko, one of the heroes of Saratoga, to design the fortifications<br>for West Point in 1778, and Washington transferred his headquarters to<br>West Point in 1779. Continental soldiers built forts, batteries and<br>redoubts and extended a 150-ton iron chain across the Hudson to control<br>river traffic. Fortress West Point was never captured by the British,<br>despite Benedict Arnold\'s treason. West Point is the oldest<br>continuously occupied military post in America. It was converted to a<br>military academy in 1802 by President Thomas Jefferson. It was West<br>Point that defined military education for officers, setting it as the<br>"first step" in a litany of education for officers to partake of during<br>their careers.\[1\](#BhmoK){#cite-BhmoK .citation_link}<br><br>In stark contrast, the Air Force Academy is different in almost every<br>way from West Point. It is, far and away, the youngest academy (as is<br>the military service for which it trains and recruits new officers). The<br>Academy was envisioned almost immediately after the Air Force became a<br>separate service in 1947. A board was assembled in 1948 to start the<br>process of reviewing Army and Navy academies to understand what was<br>needed in an Air Force Academy. On April 1st, 1954, Congress authorized<br>the construction of an Air Force Academy (and by the way, the irony is<br>not lost on us that our Academy was authorized on April Fool's Day). The<br>Air Force was already well prepared for that day. The curriculum was<br>already in development at Maxwell AFB several years before. The site in<br>Colorado was selected because of its isolated location, yet still close<br>enough to large towns, good weather for training, and not the least of<br>which that the state of Colorado offered to contribute US\$1 Million<br>towards the purchase of the land. In the same year that construction for<br>the new Academy began (1955), the first class of 306 men was sworn in at<br>a temporary Academy location at Lowry AFB in Denver. On 29 Aug 1958, the<br>wing of 1145 cadets took up residence at their now-permanent location on<br>Academy property. The first class graduated in 1959.<br><br>As for interesting traditions, I can tell you that West Point has *far<br>more* interesting traditions than we do, simply because we didn't have<br>time to develop them. But I will fill you in on the one item which could<br>be considered as close as you can come to a "secret handshake" for Air<br>Force Academy grads. We have a form at the Academy called USAFA Form<br>0--96 (that's pronounced "Oh-Dash-Nine-Six"), the "Cadet Food<br>Acceptability Report."<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-fd5bd181081483e9dcb2854b863ad31d){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-fd5bd181081483e9dcb2854b863ad31d" master_w="448"<br>master_h="268"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Except that it's not used as an actual "food acceptability report." It's<br>used to teach military form writing skill, how to correct mistakes on a<br>military form, to always carry a pen, and how to provide the "correct"<br>answer, which occasionally is not always the "right" answer. I know that<br>seems strange, but [[read this blog<br>post](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=16449d&url=http://www.thestrategybridge.com/the-bridge/2015/11/15/correct-answers-and-profession){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="thestrategybridge.com"}]{.qlink_container} and you'll get a<br>better idea of what I mean. Anyway, the "correct" answers for the top of<br>the form are "Fast, neat, average, friendly, good, good." Regardless of<br>the actual quality of the meal (which is always exceptional, by the<br>way), the "correct" answers are always the same.<br><br>The tale is told that during the Vietnam Conflict, a downed Academy<br>graduate did not have (or could not remember) the correct answers for<br>his security authentication in order to be picked up by rescue craft.<br>When the chopper pilot (also a grad) heard that the downed pilot was a<br>grad, he radioed, "Authenticate fast neat average." When the downed<br>pilot replied, "Friendly good good," he was picked up and returned home.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-BhmoK){.citation_index} [[West Point History -<br>Home](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d62566&url=http://www.westpoint.edu/wphistory/SitePages/Home.aspx){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="westpoint.edu"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
