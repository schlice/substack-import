<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I had a party at a condo I'm renting, now the condo was destroyed by<br>partygoers and I'm here left with a lot of damages, should I tell the<br>landlord or try and fix everything myself?**<br><br>Let's just start with the fact that you're on the hook for all the<br>damages. There's no two ways about it. Also, if you're a renter, it<br>doesn't matter if you're renting a house, a condo, or an apartment.<br>Someone else owns it, and you rent it. You're subject to the rental<br>agreement, and you have to return the unit to the owner in the same<br>condition in which you received it, full stop.<br><br>If your renter's agreement specifies that you notify the landlord before<br>you perform any maintenance on the interior of the unit, then you have<br>to tell him. If it does not, then the extent of the damage determines<br>who you contact and when.<br><br>If the damages extend beyond walls and carpet and into things like<br>plumbing or electrical, in all cases you should contact the landlord and<br>find out who he wants to fix those things. He may not have a preference,<br>or he might. If it's structural, talk to the landlord. It will be up to<br>you to pay for it. When the work is done, let him inspect the work so he<br>can see that you took responsibility for the issue and corrected it.<br><br>If the damage is just limited to walls and carpets, and if your rental<br>agreement does not specify that you notify the landlord for any interior<br>work at all, then you can do the work yourself, or hire a handyman to<br>help you. In any case, as previously mentioned, the unit must be<br>returned to the landlord/owner at the end of the lease period in the<br>same condition in which you received it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
