<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Honestly curious, not meant to offend. No expert on this topic, but<br>> if 30 people are shot dead a day, why do people think it is a bad<br>> thing to have basic gun background checks to prevent crazies holding<br>> my life in their hands?*<br><br>I'm going to take you at your word and believe that you are truly<br>uninformed about guns.<br><br>If you truly believe everything you said (and I quoted), you have been<br>so disillusioned by the media and by the looney liberals in Congress<br>that I feel sorry for you. *Now I start to wonder, how many more people<br>actually believe that there are no background checks? How many more<br>people believe that certain political groups don't ever want background<br>checks? How much has the education system in this country totally failed<br>people?*<br><br>Now, for your edification (and some stuff that's probably going to<br>totally blow your mind), I present for you the unedited facts:<br><br>- Firearm sales in the United States all get background checks. The<br>  only exceptions to this are *private party sales or transfers* (i.e. I<br>  sell a gun to my neighbor, or I gift a gun to my grandson). In most<br>  states, no background check is required for in-state, private party<br>  sales or transfers. But if you're a gun dealer (at a gun store, at a<br>  gun show, etc), every time a gun is purchased, a background check is<br>  performed.<br>- The reason that background checks (or any lack of the same) has *no<br>  relation to the Orlando shooting* is that the shooter **passed every<br>  background check he was subjected to.** The shooter's guns were<br>  legally purchased, and every time he was checked, he passed. He worked<br>  in an occupation where he regularly used guns, so he was, at worst, a<br>  decent enough shot to pass all of his practical shooting tests.<br>- Much ado was made of the multiple FBI investigations into his<br>  background. The FBI investigated and they found no evidence of any<br>  ties to terrorism. Despite the opinions of the low-information crowd,<br>  the results do not prove the theory. You can't go back and look at the<br>  FBI investigations and conclude that they screwed up simply because he<br>  turned out to be a mass killer. He either wasn't fully radicalized at<br>  that point, or maybe he was just really, really good (at being bad)<br>  and the FBI needs to get better. I doubt very highly it's the latter.<br>- Despite what the media has told you, **the gun does not give someone<br>  the ability to hold a life in their hands. It makes it *easier***<br>  to kill you. It doesn't make it *possible*. Remember Timothy<br>  McVeigh killed over 180 people and injured over 600 more with an ANFO<br>  (ammonium nitrate / fuel oil) bomb he built and loaded into a Ryder<br>  truck. Nineteen people killed over 3000 Americans and injured over<br>  6000 more with box cutters and commercial airplanes. Again, the gun<br>  doesn't make it possible to kill. It makes it easier to discriminately<br>  kill (that means, select a single target and kill it) instead of<br>  killing indiscriminately, like bombs do. Guns or not, people are still<br>  going to kill. Again, despite the lies spewed from the cesspool of<br>  mass media, in every country where guns were banned, people still<br>  killed other people, at about the same rate. They didn't use guns as<br>  much, but they still killed. People still died. If somehow America had<br>  banned guns, you would have heard about the Orlando nightclub<br>  *bomber*, not the Orlando nightclub *shooter*. And we would<br>  have far more people dead. Be thankful that he only used a gun. If it<br>  was a bomb, we'd be walking around the site of the former Pulse<br>  nightclub (now a smoking hole in the ground), picking up body parts to<br>  try to identify later.<br>- If someone is truly a "crazy," as you say, then a court can rule that<br>  person a "mental defective" and they cannot legally purchase guns. The<br>  question is, at what point does a court rule someone a "mental<br>  defective"? Was the Orlando nightclub shooter bat-shit crazy? Indeed<br>  he was. But was it bad enough to be ruled "mentally defective?" No,<br>  probably not. This is where the disconnect lies. We have to figure out<br>  how to help these people who are clearly insane, but are still sane<br>  enough to exist in everyday life. Currently, they live outside the<br>  reach of traditional methods of helping them, because of a Democrat<br>  initiative called *deinstitutionalization.* This change in mental<br>  health laws which took place in the 70â€²s makes it much more<br>  difficult to get someone committed to a mental institution, and the<br>  bar that the court must meet before a person can be labeled a "mental<br>  defective" or be committed to a mental hospital is very high. So<br>  because we have determined that most people with mental health issues<br>  can be helped without involuntary hospitalization, many people who<br>  should be helped simply refuse help (mostly fueled by their own mental<br>  disease) and continue to roam the streets, buy guns, and shoot up gay<br>  nightclubs.<br><br>Please let me know if you still don't understand.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
