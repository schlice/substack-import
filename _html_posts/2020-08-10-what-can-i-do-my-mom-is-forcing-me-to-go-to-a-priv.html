<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What can I do? My mom is forcing me to go to a private school in NY I<br>have been goin to public school my whole life and if I dont go shes<br>threatening to take money out of my bank account to pay for the<br>school.**<br><br>Realistically what can you do? Nothing.<br><br>So what's the best you can hope for? Sit down with your parents and talk<br>about what it is that worries you about going to private school. Is it<br>the fact that you're going to miss your friends? Maybe you can work out<br>an arrangement where you meet up with your old friends at sporting<br>events (if we ever have those again) or even planned after-school<br>activities.<br><br>Whatever the case may be, sitting down and having a discussion with your<br>parents about what it is that concerns you is going to be really<br>important. Even if they say "we don't care, you're going and that's<br>final," at least you've made your voice heard and they are at least<br>aware of your concerns. At best, maybe there are some changes they can<br>make to other things around you house that concern you to make your<br>transition a little easier.<br><br>And while it's little comfort right now, know that you will make new<br>friends who are all in exactly the same boat as you, and between you and<br>me, you're going to be better off than your peers in public school.<br>You'll get a better education and you'll be better prepared to get a job<br>when you leave school. You'll see: you'll be getting the jobs and they<br>will still be waiting to get a job. I know you're not even thinking that<br>far ahead, so take it from those of us who have been in your shoes<br>before.<br><br>I was literally in your shoes: I went to public school all the way until<br>high school and then my parents sent me to an all-boys Catholic school.<br>It was hard for me because my school was 30 minutes away from my house,<br>and with traffic that could be an hour commute just to get to school. If<br>I took the bus on the way home, with all the other stops, I'd be getting<br>home at like 7:30 at night after practice after riding the 6:00 PM<br>activity bus (when I wasn't driving yet). I'd get home, eat some dinner,<br>do some homework, and head straight to bed. It was not an easy run, but<br>I slogged through it and it set me up for success. I can promise you<br>that you will get out of it what you put in to it. The Latin phrase is<br>*quid pro quo*: you get out what you put in.<br><br>And it may start off challenging, but it will get easier.<br><br>You should also recognize that you're not the only one inconvenienced<br>here. Private school isn't free. Well neither is public school, but<br>public school is at least paid for out of your parents' taxes, where<br>private school is paid for separately. So your parents are making a<br>financial sacrifice to send you to private school.<br><br>Remember: you attract more flies with a teaspoon of honey than with a<br>gallon of vinegar. Sit down calmly with them and lay out your concerns<br>and see if they can help you with any of them. It will make the<br>transition so much easier.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
