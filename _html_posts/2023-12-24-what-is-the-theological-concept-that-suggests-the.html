<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The logic behind an inerrant Bible is not independent of the deity of<br>Christ, as it is Christ who proclaims the inerrancy of the Bible.<br><br>Basically, the logic goes like this:<br><br>1.  Jesus claimed to be God, which is why He was crucified in the first<br>    place (blasphemy).<br>2.  Jesus' claim to be God was miraculously confirmed by:<br>    1.  His fulfillment of many prophecies about Himself;<br>    2.  His sinless life and miraculous deeds;<br>    3.  His prediction and accomplishment of His resurrection.<br>3.  Therefore, Jesus is God.<br>4.  Whatever Jesus (who is God) teaches is true.<br>5.  Jesus taught that the Bible is the inerrant Word of God.<br>6.  Therefore, it is true that the Bible is the inerrant Word of God.<br><br>Do we have any proof that point 5 is true (Jesus taught that the Bible<br>is inerrant)? When the Sadducees tried to trap Jesus with a question, He<br>said to them, "You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures<br>or the power of God" (Matt. 22:29). The implication, of course, is that<br>the Bible is inerrant. It wouldn't make any sense for Jesus to say, "You<br>are in error because you don't know the Scriptures, which are also<br>erroneous!" Therefore, Jesus taught that the Bible is inerrant. And if<br>Jesus is God, and He said that the Bible is inerrant, then we know that<br>it is.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
