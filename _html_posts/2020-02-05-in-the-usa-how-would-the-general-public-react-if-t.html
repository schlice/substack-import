What you're really looking for is for<br>two people, who have committed the same crime, to be sentenced the<br>same. That's not the crime, that's the sentencing. What you're really<br>calling for is *sentencing reform*. And the only way to accomplish<br>what it is you're looking for (the exact same punishment for *everyone*<br>for any one crime) is to call for mandatory sentencing. And I'm certain<br>that you mean that *any two people* committing the same crime, not<br>just a man and a woman as the two people. What about two women? Or two<br>men? If you prescribe mandatory sentences for crimes committed by a man<br>vs a woman, you must also prescribe mandatory sentences for *everyone*,<br>or you violate the 5th, 6th, 8th, and 14th Amendments.<br><br>**Mandatory sentencing takes away the ability of the judiciary to be<br>fully effective.**<br><br>The reason we have a justice system is that in the United States,<br>everyone is entitled to a full trial and a vigorous defense. Everyone<br>can have extenuating circumstances which may influence their sentencing.<br>Note that sentencing is a distinct and wholly separate phase of trial<br>which happens after conviction. Sentencing is the phase in which<br>extenuating circumstances can be examined. We know you did it, now *why*<br>did you do it. The state of mind of the defendant at the time is taken<br>into consideration, and sentencing leniency may be provided. The judge<br>has a range of sentences which may be handed down, and the sentence,<br>ideally, fits the exact circumstances of that crime committed by that<br>person.<br><br>When mandatory sentences are prescribed for certain crimes, the entire<br>sentencing phase of the trial is eliminated. There is no opportunity for<br>leniency. There is no opportunity for extenuating circumstances to be<br>introduced. You did it, we proved it, you were found guilty, you get the<br>mandatory punishment, just like everyone else.<br><br>Mandatory sentences work in certain circumstances, such as repeat<br>offenders (the "three-strike rule," as an example). But replacing<br>judge's discretion and sentencing guidelines with mandatory sentencing<br>all the time is a travesty of justice.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
