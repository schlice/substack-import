<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not sure about USNA, but the USAF service requirements actually start<br>while you are a cadet at USAFA.<br><br>What we are discussing is called Active Duty Service Commitment<br>(ADSC). This indicates the amount of time you must repay to the Air<br>Force in order to repay the cost of your time at school. This also means<br>that you can attend your first two years at the Academy, collect all<br>your credits, and leave the Academy and finish your degree at any<br>university which will accept your transfer credits, and you will pay<br>nothing back to the military. You could also likely finish your degree<br>in only one more year, based on the courseload at the Academy.<br><br>After your first day of classes as a junior at USAFA, you begin to<br>accrue ADSC. I honestly can't remember the actual ADSC for cadets, but<br>if I remember correctly, it's one year of active duty if you leave as a<br>junior, three years AD as a senior, and then upon graduation, it's five<br>years active duty. Remember, if you haven't graduated yet, your ADSC<br>must be served as an enlisted Air Force member.<br><br>Some education benefits also incur ADSC. I completed my Master's degree<br>after graduating, and I incurred two years ADSC from that. The Air Force<br>paid the cost of my Master's program (I paid for books and labs), which<br>is what earned me some extra ADSC. Thankfully, that ADSC ran<br>*concurrently* with any other ADSC I already had. This means that I was<br>still repaying my USAFA ADSC when my education ADSC expired, so it was<br>like I had no commitment at all for my degree. An incentive to finish<br>the degree as soon as you can following graduation. I took a total of 6<br>months off of school after I graduated, and then I was right into my<br>Master's program.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
