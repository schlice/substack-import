<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [This is what I remember off the top of my head.\<br>\<br>It is generally assumed that all Turtles own an Ass (translation: a<br>donkey). To that end, if you are ever asked \"Are you a Turtle?\",<br>regardless of the location or situation, you are required to immediately<br>and proudly answer, \"You bet your sweet Ass I am!\" Failure to answer<br>thusly costs you one beverage of the asker\'s choosing.\<br>\<br>I know it is a sub group of the Freemasons, which were very popular in<br>the military. Back in my grandfather\'s day, most Naval stations had a<br>Freemason lodge on base.\<br>\<br>Am I a Turtle?\<br>You bet your sweet Ass I am!]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
