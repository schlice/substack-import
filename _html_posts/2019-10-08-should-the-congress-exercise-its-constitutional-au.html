<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should the Congress exercise its constitutional authority and have the<br>sergeant-at-arms place Trump Administration officials who defy subpoenas<br>under arrest?**<br><br>[[John<br>Ellingson](https://www.quora.com/profile/John-Ellingson-3)]{.qlink_container}<br>is spot on here. There is no "impeachment inquiry." There are no<br>subpoenas.<br><br>Any competent court would review these supposed "subpoenas" and laugh at<br>them. They were not issued as part of an "impeachment inquiry" as<br>authorized by the full House. They are nothing more than letters from<br>partisan politicians requesting voluntary cooperation. They do not<br>express the authority of the full House, which is required under the<br>Constitution.<br><br>On the flip side, some may say that the House has already elected the<br>Speaker, and she is thus endowed with the power to speak on behalf of<br>the entire body. As [[I have previously<br>shared](https://www.quora.com/q/war-elephant/Ignore-the-hype-this-is-not-an-impeachment-inquiry?ch=10&share=d7d5601b&srid=uClI)]{.qlink_container},<br>if Speaker Pelosi wants to ipse dixit her way to articles of<br>impeachment, no one can stop her unless she is legally challenged.<br><br>It is, however, the realm of the courts to protect those ensnared in the<br>web of a kangaroo tribunal. The only time the courts will become<br>involved is when the Congress attempts to exercise its presumed<br>authority against someone and denies them of one of their rights.<br><br>So I say: let Congress exercise what it believes to be its authority.<br>When that person immediately sues and forces them to prove the<br>legitimacy of their actions in court, and when they are proven wrong and<br>brought up on charges of false arrest and kidnapping, it will turn into<br>one helluva shitshow.<br><br>\<grabs popcorn\><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
