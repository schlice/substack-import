<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So Griswold decided to remove Trump from the ballot on the grounds that<br>he violated the 14th Amendment, despite the fact that we don't have a<br>verified definition of *insurrection,* and it hasn't been proven that<br>Trump engaged in it, whatever it is. Look, January 6th was a nightmare.<br>It was horrible. It was a riot. But painting it as an **actual attempt<br>to overthrow the government** is a stretch, even for Democrats. But you<br>know, never let the facts get in the way of your rhetoric.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-c7a48dc962109ae6e1a18c27c00b6fbd){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-c7a48dc962109ae6e1a18c27c00b6fbd" master_w="584"<br>master_h="424"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>But then, the Colorado GOP struck back. In a move that surprised<br>absolutely no one, they immediately appealed to the US Supreme Court.<br>While they're waiting, they started making plans to just take their ball<br>and go home. In other words, they said that if they lose their Supreme<br>Court appeal, they would cancel their primary, and instead hold a<br>statewide caucus, essentially bypassing the state voting mechanism<br>altogether.<br><br>Facing the prospect of losing at the Supreme Court (which would<br>eliminate the possibility of any other state keeping Trump off of the<br>ballot), and recognizing that they can't stop the Colorado GOP from<br>voting for Trump, with or without them, Colorado decided to punt and<br>once again allow Trump on the primary ballot.<br><br>It's probably also a move to try to moot the Supreme Court challenge. No<br>victim, no crime, no standing, right? If Trump is actually on the<br>ballot, then potentially the Colorado GOP loses its standing to appeal.<br>However, this was also tried by New York in *NYSRPA v. Breun*, and it<br>failed, as SCOTUS took the case anyway because they wanted to address<br>the broader issue. I suspect that the Supreme Court will still take the<br>case despite Colorado attempting to moot the issue, because this is<br>happening in other states (Michigan thwarted an attempt to remove Trump<br>from the ballot, while Maine removed Trump from the Primary *and*<br>General ballots), and the Court would likely want to avoid a<br>Constitutional crisis.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
