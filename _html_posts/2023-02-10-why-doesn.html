<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Would make things easier, right? I mean, it would certainly put all<br>those atheists in their places, right? I mean, the whole basis of their<br>religion is "no god," so if God exists, then being atheist would be an<br>illogical belief.<br><br>But why do you have to see God to believe in Him? Aren't there plenty of<br>things that we can't see, yet we believe in? Do you believe that love<br>and hate exist? Okay, what's the chemical composition of love? What's<br>the specific gravity of hate? Those are silly questions, because love<br>and hate are not physical. Sure, they use chemicals in our body to be<br>expressed, but chemicals do not love or hate on their own. So things<br>must exist which are not physical, because we have things we believe<br>exist that are not completely physical in nature.<br><br>Additionally, if God reveals Himself to everyone, you would have no<br>choice but to believe He exists. I mean, if you can physically see him<br>and you still don't believe He exists, then you clearly have some sort<br>of mental deficiency. Everyone with sufficient mental capacity would<br>*have* to believe He exists.<br><br>But He doesn't want that. He wants people to believe *despite* the fact<br>that He can't be seen.<br><br>Just look at the story of Thomas in the Bible. The first time Jesus<br>appeared to the disciples in the locked upper room after the<br>Resurrection, Thomas was not with them. When the disciples told Thomas<br>what had happened, he refused to believe. He said the only way he'd<br>believe that Jesus had risen from the dead is if he touched the nail<br>holes and put his hand in Jesus' side where it was pierced by the spear.<br><br>The next time they met in the upper room, Thomas was there, and Jesus<br>appeared amongst them. He went to Thomas and told him to touch the nail<br>holes and feel the spear hole in His side, which Thomas did, and<br>believed.<br><br>> Then Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed;<br>> blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed." --- John<br>> 20:29 NIV<br><br>Jesus' words are the point here. Blessed are those who have not seen and<br>yet have believed.<br><br>God wants people to freely believe in Him. He doesn't want to *convince*<br>them to believe outside of their free will. There's more than enough<br>evidence to convince anyone willing to believe that He exists. But He<br>left just enough ambiguity so as to not compel the unwilling. To make<br>sure that our choice was truly free, He placed us in an environment<br>filled with evidence of His existence, but without His direct presence,<br>which would be so powerful, awesome and overwhelming as to override our<br>free will and force us to believe whether we wanted to or not. That's<br>not the kind of people God wants.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
