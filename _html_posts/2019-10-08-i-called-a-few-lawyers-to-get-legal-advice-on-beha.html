<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I called a few lawyers to get legal advice on behalf of a friend. Are<br>the conversations protected by attorney client privilege?**<br><br>The question asks about what lawyers often call "free consultations."<br>You haven't paid or retained the attorney, is the free consultation<br>still protected?<br><br>As with any legal question, the answer depends on where you are and what<br>exactly was discussed. However, in general, as long as the prospective<br>client is seeking legal advice or representation and reasonably believes<br>the communication will be confidential, the consultation is privileged.<br>This remains true even if the would-be client never hires the attorney.<br><br>The situation is different if the attorney declines to represent a<br>potential client who nevertheless continues to communicate with the<br>attorney. There is no privilege in such a case, because there is no<br>potential attorney-client relationship, and therefore no reasonable<br>belief that the communications would have to be kept confidential.<br><br>(EDIT) The question was asked regarding the presence of a third party.<br>In general, if an attorney and client are communicating and a third<br>party is present, the client waives privilege. However, if the third<br>party is present to aid the cause, the conversation remains privileged.<br>In this case, the third party was acting in an advisory role, passing on<br>the protected information to the attorney, expecting it to remain<br>protected. So long as the client and the third party all continue to<br>intend the communications to remain privileged, the privilege will still<br>attach.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
