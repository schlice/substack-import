<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What kind of person reads Ezekiel and thinks \"That\'s the God I believe<br>in\"?<br><br>- The kind of person who doesn't read the Bible and evaluate its<br>  contents based on the norms of modern society.<br>- The kind of person who understands that God didn't send the people<br>  into exile to punish them. He sent them into exile to make good on His<br>  promises. They lived in sin and rebellion for centuries, and after<br>  centuries of warnings and invasions and prophets cautioning the people<br>  to change their ways, God had to step up His intervention to get their<br>  attention. The story of Ezekiel is a story of God's *intervention* for<br>  our *redemption*. *And if you look closely, it's the same story that<br>  God will tell again through the life, death, and resurrection of<br>  Christ.*<br>- The kind of person who is able to *correctly* *apply* the message of<br>  Ezekiel to us today. I'm certain that not everyone in that small<br>  community would have known why they were being uprooted. Some would,<br>  because they were the ones living in open rebellion against God, but<br>  some would not. Don't we find ourselves in that same situation today?<br>  I know we do, because I answer questions all the time on this platform<br>  from people who are basically asking "Why, God, why?" They ask why bad<br>  things happen to good people. They want to know where God is in all of<br>  their struggle. The people in exile had to wait five years for God to<br>  send Ezekiel, and when He did, Ezekiel delivered a prophetic message<br>  that they most likely didn't want to hear: God is sovereign over all,<br>  and the judgment the people were experiencing was as a result of their<br>  own sin.\<br>  \<br>  Now, this doesn't mean that everything that happens to us is as a<br>  result of *our own* sin, but everything bad that happens to us,<br>  even today, is as a direct or indirect result of sin in our world. It<br>  is up to us to lean on God during the hard times, even when things<br>  don't make sense to us. What pleases God is when we trust Him even<br>  when nothing else makes sense. Faith begins where logic ends.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
