<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In the United States, we no longer has \"dead or alive\"<br>bounties. Bail enforcement is a legitimate business, and you either have<br>to be licensed in the state or certified by the state in order to be a<br>bail enforcement agent. While bail enforcement agents have more<br>authority over their \"skips\" than police do, there are still rules and<br>regulations that must be followed. When an accused signs a bail bond<br>contract, he waives his Constitutional rights and agrees to be<br>apprehended by a bail enforcement agent should he fail to appear. He<br>doesn\'t have to be read Miranda warnings, he can be apprehended inside<br>his house, which the bail enforcement agent can enter without a warrant,<br>they can tap his phone without a warrant, etc.\<br>\<br>There\'s a great writeup on bail enforcement over at HowStuffWorks:\<br>\<br>[[How Bounty Hunting<br>Works](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=95fbb6&url=http://people.howstuffworks.com/bounty-hunting.htm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="howstuffworks.com"}]{.qlink_container}]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
