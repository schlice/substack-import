<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Well, if you ignore the sightings (of which there were over 100), you're<br>ignoring a critical piece of evidence. Remember, these people who saw<br>Jesus after He was raised were *persecuted*, *beaten* and *killed*<br>because of their belief. Yet they maintained their stories all the way<br>through their deaths, when all they had to do to spare themselves the<br>torture and execution would be to recant the story. That's pretty<br>powerful testimony you're ignoring.<br><br>But let's set the sightings aside for a moment. Let's focus on the tomb,<br>and the question: *could Jesus' body have been stolen?*<br><br>The answer is that anything is possible, ***but it is extremely<br>unlikely.***<br><br>The reasons:<br><br>1.  The stone itself<br>2.  The seal<br>3.  The guards<br><br>First, let's look at the tomb and the stone that was covering its<br>entrance. If you've ever seen a *millstone*, then you know the type of<br>stone that was covering the entrance to the tomb. It was a large, round<br>stone which sat in a channel in an incline cut in the limestone of the<br>hillside where the tomb was hewn. It took several men to roll the stone<br>back up the incline, which was specifically designed to thwart both<br>grave robbers and wild animals.<br><br>Once the stone was in place, the Romans *sealed* the tomb. The seal was<br>probably made of soft, moldable clay, imprinted the seal of the Roman<br>Procurator. The seal on the stone held a rope which was attached to the<br>cliff wall. Anyone disturbing the seal was subject to immediate<br>execution, and everyone knew it.<br><br>Because Jesus died on the weekend of the Passover, there were to be<br>thousands of people in Jerusalem, and both the Romans and the Pharisees<br>knew that there would be many followers of Jesus who might want to steal<br>the body. So they sent several squads of troops (each squad has four<br>Roman soldiers) to guard the entrance to the tomb. Additionally, the<br>Pharisees sent Temple Guards themselves. There were at least 16 highly<br>trained guards at the entrance to the tomb. These guards were accustomed<br>to late night guard duty, and had much experience keeping each other<br>accountable and awake, knowing that falling asleep on duty was grounds<br>for, yep you guessed it, execution.<br><br>So it's highly unlikely that a group of people who were already targets<br>of Rome and were in hiding would sneak out and try to catch *all the<br>guards, asleep,* and *move the stone* *silently* so as *not to wake<br>them.*<br><br>Is it *possible*? Sure, it's possible. Anything is possible.<br><br>But is it *likely*? No, it is not.<br><br>What is most likely is the account in the Bible. An angel effortlessly<br>rolled the stone away. The guards were in complete shock at what they<br>saw. They were frozen with fear (the Bible says "they were like dead<br>men"). They only had a few options, and none of them were good. They<br>could claim that robbers took the body, at which point they would be<br>executed. They could claim that they allowed someone to take the body,<br>wherein they would also be executed. So instead, they ran immediately to<br>the Pharisees and told them everything. The Pharisees paid them a large<br>sum of money to never tell that story again to anyone, and to claim that<br>robbers stole the body while they were asleep. The Bible stories don't<br>tell us whether or not the guards were punished for what happened, but<br>we know that several of the Pharisees were converted to belief in Christ<br>upon hearing the testimony of the guards.<br><br>So here's what it would have looked like if the disciples stole Jesus'<br>body.<br><br>[https://youtu.be/23UNLLbOS3w(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=67b20d&url=https://youtu.be/23UNLLbOS3w){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Yeah, the whole notion is pretty ridiculous, wouldn't you think?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
