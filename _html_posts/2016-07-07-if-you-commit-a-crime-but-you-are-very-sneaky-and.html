<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Interesting discussion. It's a variant of "If a tree falls in the woods<br>and there's no one there to hear it, did it make a sound?" In other<br>words, does sound only have a quality, as such, if it is interpreted by<br>someone hearing it?<br><br>To get back to the original question, "If you commit a crime but you<br>were not caught, did you still commit a crime?"<br><br>The legal answer is, most emphatically, yes. There is no objective<br>standard in the law which requires conviction of a crime in order to<br>commit a crime.<br><br>But, you might counter, you're only a felon if you get caught.<br><br>That is precisely accurate. You are only considered a "felon" if you are<br>caught, charged, tried, and convicted of a felony.<br><br>You can commit a crime and you may never be arrested, charged, tried,<br>and/or convicted, and the crime still took place. There was still a<br>victim (even in a "victimless crime," society in general is worse off<br>after the crime). The law does not require that you be caught in order<br>for a crime to have been committed.<br><br>This is the only standard we can use to determine this. Now, it may seem<br>to you that if you are never caught, then no crime was committed. Not<br>so. You are never brought to justice if you are never caught, but the<br>crime stands. All you would need is evidence and a willing prosecutor<br>and you can be brought to justice. Being held to account for your crime<br>is not a necessary part of the crime; it is not one of the elements<br>required in order to create a crime. A simple violation of the law as<br>written is all that is needed to commit a crime.<br><br>Here's an example. In around 2000, "someone" stole my personal<br>information and opened two credit cards in my name. They rang up over<br>\$12,000 in debt on those cards and then stopped paying on them. I was<br>left with the bill and the negative credit report. When the police<br>investigation started catching up with the person, he/she transferred<br>the balances off of those cards onto other cards. The credit card<br>companies removed the negative credit entries as the cards were<br>determined to be fraudulent. The detectives had enough evidence to<br>charge this person with two felony counts: possession of two or more<br>financial transaction devices (a Class 4 felony in Colorado), and<br>unlawful use of a financial transaction device (any amount over \$10,000<br>is a Class 4 felony in Colorado). However, the district attorney decided<br>not to prosecute the case. At the time, identity theft wasn't the<br>fastest growing crime in the world. The prosecutor was fairly certain he<br>could not get a jury to convict this person, given their standing in the<br>community, their history of stellar community service, and the fact that<br>there was no longer a victim (the money had all been repaid). So did the<br>crime take place? Yes. Was the criminal caught? No. The crime does not<br>need to be prosecuted in order to have been committed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
