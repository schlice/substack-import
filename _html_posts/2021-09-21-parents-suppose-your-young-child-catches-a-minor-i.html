<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>(US answer)<br><br>Depending on the level of injury or illness, we have multiple options<br>for same-day visits.<br><br>1.  Try your child's pediatrician. Many doctor's offices reserve some<br>    spots for same-day visits, although most will likely offer you a<br>    next-day appointment.<br>2.  If that's not soon enough, we have *urgent care* facilities in<br>    nearly every moderately-sized city in the country. Urgent care fills<br>    the gap between something which can't wait for your doctor's next<br>    available appointment, but something which is minor enough to not<br>    require a trip to the emergency room.<br>3.  If you cannot get in to see the doctor and you don't have access to<br>    a nearby urgent care (or it is after hours for urgent care), you can<br>    always be seen at the emergency room. They will stabilize the child<br>    and provide them with enough appropriate medication to last until<br>    you can get in to see your regular pediatrician.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
