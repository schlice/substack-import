<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **As a law enforcement officer, how would you square the fact it is<br>> legal for you to lie to citizens, but it is illegal for them to lie to<br>> you?**<br><br>**Your assertion is very easy to square. Because your assertion is<br>mostly wrong.**<br><br>While it may be illegal in most jurisdictions to lie *about your<br>identity*, and while it may be a Federal offense to lie to a Federal<br>official, *it is most definitely not illegal to lie to the police.* As<br>with everything, there are exceptions (such as if you've signed an<br>immunity agreement and are ready to give your statement, or if you lie<br>to specifically mislead the police in order to aid a criminal), but in<br>the vast majority of cases, it is not illegal to lie to the police.<br><br>That said, whether or not lying to the police *is in your best interest*<br>is another matter entirely.<br><br>In most cases, lying to the police simply gets you into more trouble<br>than you were in initially. But who knows. It may be beneficial to you<br>in the short term. Maybe you don't want to reveal who you were with in<br>that motel room in the middle of the afternoon, or her marital status.<br>You may lie out of embarrassment or shame, or to protect someone, or to<br>safeguard a marriage or spare someone's feelings.<br><br>The point is that in most cases, it is not illegal to lie to the police.<br>In fact, criminals do it all the time, and they're never charged with<br>"lying to the police" since that's not a thing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
