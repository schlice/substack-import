<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> ***If you have MS, how did you know that it was time to see a<br>> doctor?***<br><br>I didn't. My wife did.<br><br>I woke up with eye issues one morning. Blurry vision and pain in my eye,<br>and when I went into the dark closet, sparklers around the outside of my<br>vision. I've had 20/15 vision since I was a kid, and my wife has had bad<br>eyes since she was a kid. She's very knowledgeable (and sensitive) about<br>eye issues. When I told her what was happening in my eye, she<br>immediately made me cancel my business trip and made me an appointment<br>with her ophthalmologist.<br><br>I explained my symptoms to him, and he knew right away that I had ON<br>(optic neuritis). More nefarious, of course, is the cause. In almost<br>half of patients my age (I was in my 30s at the time), it had no cause.<br>It would simply resolve itself. In the other half, it's MS. He told me<br>to go back to my GP and get an MRI scheduled.<br><br>Within a few weeks, I was "in the tube" for my first MRI. The doctor<br>called me back the same day (that's never good, by the way). He told me<br>that I needed to find a good neurologist, because my MRI had all the<br>signs of someone who had MS.<br><br>So to answer your question, the only reason I went to the doctor when I<br>did is because my wife cares more about me than I do.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
