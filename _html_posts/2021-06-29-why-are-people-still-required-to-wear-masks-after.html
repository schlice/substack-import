<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(Note that this question is asking for an opinion. It's likely that<br>your opinion is different. This is mine. You are free to write your own<br>opinion. Thank you.)*<br><br>You should never be *required* to wear a mask. Masking should be your<br>*choice*. Period. Whatever your reasons, whether you want to protect<br>yourself or others, you should be able to choose whether or not you wear<br>a mask.<br><br>The government should never require you to wear a mask.<br><br>That said, can a *business* still force customers to wear masks? Yes, of<br>course they can. Businesses can set whatever requirements they like for<br>their businesses. If you can't wear a mask because of a disability, they<br>must provide some form of accommodation, like contactless ordering or<br>pickup, or they could be in violation of the ADA. But they can still<br>force you to wear a mask in their establishment.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If you're vaccinated, should you still be required to wear a mask?<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don't like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I'm wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is<br>a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply going<br>to comment to tell me "ackshually, you're wrong," then youre the reason<br>why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for everyone.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
