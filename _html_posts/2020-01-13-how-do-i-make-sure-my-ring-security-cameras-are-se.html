<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How do I make sure my Ring security cameras are secure from hackers?<br><br>[[You probably have heard news<br>reports](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0bce20&url=https://blog.ring.com/2019/12/12/rings-services-have-not-been-compromised-heres-what-you-need-to-know/?medium%3Dtsa%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAx_DwBRAfEiwA3vwZYhfMSNlU8_zdBvcU5IrP92hG2-K8Q738WbQ6IIWicbCo81NTj6pwEBoCDjYQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ring.com"}]{.qlink_container} that Ring cameras were<br>compromised.<br><br>This isn't exactly what happened.<br><br>Ring users re-used the same username and password for separate,<br>external, non-Ring services, and malicious actors gained access to those<br>credentials and used them to access Ring accounts. **Ring itself is<br>secure, it was never directly compromised.**<br><br>But in case you haven't heard this a million times before, let me say it<br>one more time:<br><br>*DO NOT REUSE YOUR PASSWORDS ACROSS WEBSITES!*<br><br>Oftentimes, your username is your email address, so malicious actors can<br>learn your username simply by scraping email addresses.<br><br>However, you should be implementing some smart, common-sense security<br>practices to keep all your accounts safe, not just Ring:<br><br>- Never re-use passwords between websites. Use a password manager<br>  like<br>  [LastPass(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2813ec&url=http://lastpass.com){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="lastpass.com"}]{.qlink_container},<br>  [1Password(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bb2366&url=https://1password.com){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="1password.com"}]{.qlink_container}, or<br>  [KeePass(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8b7a71&url=https://keepass.info/){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="keepass.info"}]{.qlink_container}. Generate strong<br>  passwords for every one of your accounts on every website. Never<br>  re-use passwords between websites. LastPass even offers a "security<br>  challenge" where it checks over all of the stored passwords in your<br>  browser and looks for reused passwords, helping you reset them to<br>  strong passwords which it securely stores.<br>- Use two-factor authentication (when offered). Many web-enabled<br>  services now offer two-factor authentication: something you know, and<br>  something you have. Your two factors are usually your password<br>  (something you know) and a token delivered by mobile phone in a text<br>  message or by email, or by a token generator app (something you have).<br>  Ring offers the ability to secure your account with two-factor<br>  authentication. If a website offers you the ability to do so, I<br>  strongly recommend you do this.<br>- (Ring-specific) **Use "shared users" to give others permission to see<br>  your Ring account**. Ring offers you the ability to create authorized<br>  users who can access your account and view your cameras. They are<br>  called "shared users." If you need to give others the ability to see<br>  and control your Ring cameras, create shared users; **do not share<br>  your account credentials**.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
