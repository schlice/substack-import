<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Unfortunately, there is very little that can be done now<br>on the Constitutional front.\<br>\<br>Congress can\'t pass laws which violate the current interpretation of<br>the Second Amendment, which the court has interpreted to confer an<br>individual right to gun ownership.\<br>\<br>Congress can propose a new Constitutional amendment which will<br>re-interpret the meaning of the Second Amendment. Whether or not there<br>is enough popular support for such a measure remains to be seen. The NRA<br>was pretty effective in convincing the vast majority of Americans that<br>the Second Amendment does just what the court said it did: conferred an<br>individual right to own firearms.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-the-American-government-just-ban-guns/answer/Jim-Ryan-16<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
