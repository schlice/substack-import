<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think you have misused the term "intentionally."<br><br>There is a great difference between *omniscience* and *predestination*.<br>People have a really hard time wrapping their heads around this.<br><br>**God can simultaneously know what will happen without influencing the<br>free will of the people involved.**<br><br>God desires you to have free will. In fact, He desires it so greatly<br>that He will voluntarily allow you to choose evil and condemn yourself<br>to eternal death. He wants your choice to love Him to be **totally<br>free.**<br><br>But in order for it to be totally free, you must have a compelling<br>alternative.<br><br>Let me give you an example. If I set two bowls down in front of you, and<br>one contains ice cream and the other contains dead decaying rats, which<br>one will you choose to eat? Now, I don't even have the gift of<br>omniscience and I can tell you with 99.9% certainty which one you will<br>choose.<br><br>Now, if I set two bowls down in front of you and one contains vanilla<br>ice cream and the other contains chocolate ice cream, *now* which one<br>will you choose?<br><br>The fact that the choices are so closely desirable is what makes the<br>decision truly free. In the first example, you have the "appearance" of<br>choice, but no one would actually choose the dead rats to eat. So there<br>really isn't a choice. In the second example, you are choosing between<br>two equally palatable choices, so you really do have a free choice.<br><br>In the Garden, God had to do the same thing. He gave Adam and Eve the<br>chance to obey Him and love Him, but He also gave them a compelling<br>alternative. It had to be flashy and attractive, otherwise it would be<br>easy to resist. So the choice was clear: love God, obey God and ignore<br>the fruit, or listen to the serpent and go for the potential gains of<br>eating the fruit (and sin against God in doing so).<br><br>God knew what choice they would make. But the point is to establish a<br>life wherein you get to make that choice freely, without coercion.<br>That's what God desired to do, and that's why He built the system in<br>this way.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
