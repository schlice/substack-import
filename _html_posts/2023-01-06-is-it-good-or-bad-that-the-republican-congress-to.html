"The government is funded, and no<br>> one is losing sleep, I don't think," he told Family Research Council<br>> President Tony Perkins on "Washington Watch" Tuesday. "I would much<br>> rather take time and get a good speaker of the House that we can trust<br>> than to hurry up and get someone \who\ does a terrible job."<br>><br>> Perkins agreed, pointing out the historic nature of the delay. "I<br>> think it's unprecedented," he said. "... And a lot of people are<br>> wringing their hands. You know, the president today was asked about it<br>> and said, 'Oh, this is embarrassing as the world watches.' I don't<br>> think so. I think this is the way our system is supposed to work." He<br>> reiterated again, "I'm not against Kevin McCarthy. I worked with<br>> Kevin. He's been on this program before. ...It's not about him. It's<br>> about the process. And it's about making this process work for the<br>> American people."<br>><br>> Perkins pointed to \Rep. Chip\ Roy's \(R-Texas)\ concerns and<br>> emphasized that "members need to come here and be able to represent<br>> their people by offering legislation and amendments on the floor.<br>> That's not happened." And what better time to make this course<br>> correction than now, Perkins asked? It may be "painful," he admitted,<br>> but "the leverage is with the<br>> conservatives."\[1\](#eKInw){#cite-eKInw .citation_link}<br><br>I have to agree with Rosendale and Perkins on this one. The government<br>is funded. No one's losing sleep over this. Sure, some government<br>functions are paused at the moment, but it's nothing amounting to a<br>crisis.<br><br>The media turns whatever it can get away with into a crisis because that<br>brings them eyeballs that pay their salaries. Don't bother with their<br>hype.<br><br>This is, indeed, the time to get this right. These are legitimate<br>concerns, and they must be addressed.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-eKInw){.citation_index} [[GOP Rebels Push for More Changes<br>in Deadlocked Speaker's<br>Race](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5ed7d0&url=https://washingtonstand.com/news/gop-rebels-push-for-more-changes-in-deadlocked-speakers-race-){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="washingtonstand.com"}<br>]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
