<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>That feeling you have, the nagging voice that tells you that abortion is<br>wrong, is your *conscience*.<br><br>We all have it. We all know it. Murder is wrong, regardless of who you<br>are or where you live, or when you lived. Murder has always been wrong,<br>and everyone *just knows it. Even murderers* know that murder is wrong.<br>They simply¹ justify their actions.<br><br>Intuitively, you know that illegal (unjustified) killing is wrong.<br>Intuitively, you know that the baby did nothing to earn the death<br>penalty. It's not the baby's fault that it's in the position that it is<br>in. Intuitively, you know that it's not a "clump of cells." It's a<br>human. Albeit a very early human, but a human nonetheless. And that's<br>the only definition we can accurately place on it. We can't place the<br>label of "person" on it, because that's a sociological term, not a<br>scientific term. The only scientific term we can place on the baby is<br>"human" because it belongs in the species *Homo Sapiens*. Once the egg<br>is fertilized, it starts dividing. And growing. And using energy. And<br>producing proteins. Human proteins. Not dog proteins, or frog proteins.<br>Human proteins. It is a human. And because it is human, it has the same<br>human right to life as every other human, everywhere else in the world,<br>regardless of how old it is. Intuitively, you know this.<br><br>You may know in your mind that in order to have peace with those who<br>place differential value on life based on its temporal locality (i.e.<br>its place in time and space), our laws must allow (to a certain extent)<br>some flexibility for abortion early in pregnancy. And in nearly all<br>states which restrict abortion, there is some flexibility for abortion<br>very early on in pregnancy.<br><br>But that feeling you keep having, your conscience, tells you that you<br>also know that abortion is wrong.<br><br>Even those who are pro-choice know that murder is wrong. But they only<br>have the luxury of knowing this because their parents *chose* to allow<br>them to be born. They have "birthed human privilege," and they don't<br>even recognize their own privilege.<br><br>For those of us who recognize the urgings of our consciences for what<br>they are, we must continue to find common ground with those who deny the<br>urgings of their consciences, while working to ensure that *ALL*<br>humans are granted equal rights to life, regardless of how old they may<br>be, or where they are physically located.<br><br>\<br><br>¹ I'm not trying to say that it's easy to justify murder. It's not. But<br>some people have the ability to justify what their conscience tells them<br>is wrong. This is *free will.* This ability to make choices, **even the<br>ability to deny the truth**, is what makes us moral creatures, and<br>ultimately allows us to choose our own destiny.<br><br>\<br><br>PLEASE NOTE: This is a controversial answer. I know that people<br>approach this topic very emotionally. I'm willing to engage in polite<br>discussion regarding this issue, but *I will not tolerate rude or<br>disrespectful commentary.* If you even become the slightest bit<br>harrassing, I will summarily delete your comments and block you. I will<br>do this immediately and without compunction. You have been warned. Be<br>nice.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
