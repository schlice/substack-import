<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, this was a test firing, there was no nuclear warhead on<br>board.<br><br>Secondly, the people in NORAD who monitor missile launches **knew well<br>in advance** that this launch was happening. Our intelligence assets in<br>the Mountain are top-notch. We were already in contact with Britain's<br>PWHQ and we knew that a test launch was happening. We knew when it was<br>going to happen, and we were fully prepared for the alarms to go off. So<br>when they did, and we saw a missile launch off the coast of Florida, we<br>went "meh."<br><br>I will tell you that the "pucker factor" climbs exponentially when the<br>missile does something which you do not expect. So if the systems were<br>able to correlate the trajectory data fast enough, the systems in NORAD<br>would have displayed that Florida was threatened by this test launch.<br>The Missile Warning Center would have been on the phone with PWHQ and<br>saying, "why is your missile going off-course" and "do you see what I<br>see?"<br><br>So:<br><br>- No nuke was involved.<br>- We knew about the launch.<br>- We were fully aware of the entire situation.<br>- The missile was properly detonated by RSOs when it went off-course.<br><br>TL;DR: Move along, nothing to see here.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
