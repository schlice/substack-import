<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What's next for the GOP now that Senator McConnell has publicly broken<br>away from President Trump by acknowledging Joe Biden as<br>president-elect?**<br><br>Call him what you like, but McConnell is a realist. Now that the<br>Electoral College has voted (even though those votes won't be certified<br>until the new Congress is sworn in in January), there's very, very<br>little chance that Biden won't be sworn in as scheduled. The only<br>remaining roadblocks are the stuff of conspiracy theorists.<br><br>In other words, most rational people understand at this point that Biden<br>is president-elect.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
