<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [IF you actually follow that advice to the letter, then the<br>dispatcher will contact the pursuing officer and advise him that the<br>driver is in phone contact with them which is why they didn\'t stop<br>right away. So assuming this is the advice they follow, AND once the 911<br>operator identifies that the person following them is in fact an<br>officer, AND once you get that information, you stop right away, you are<br>okay. If you still get charged with evading, you can use the recording<br>of the 911 call as evidence that you were making a good-faith effort to<br>determine whether or not you were being followed by an actual police<br>officer, and given the location and the time of day, it was reasonable<br>for you to do so.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-happens-if-a-police-officer-attempts-to-pull-you-over-and-you-respond-by-continuing-to-drive-less-than-the-speed-limit-indefinitely/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
