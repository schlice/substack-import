<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I cannot say specifically for the Delta flight that<br>skidded off of the end of the runway at LGA on 5 Mar 2015, but I can<br>tell you what is normally done at airports to maintain runways.\<br>\<br>The \"snow crew\" are airport employees who augment the normal runway<br>maintenance crew at airports that can receive significant snowfall. They<br>will drive the large plows to clear the runways, and they usually drive<br>in a wedge formation simultaneously to clear the runway in the fastest<br>and most efficient manner possible.\<br>\<br>They will also use large truck-mounted snow throwers to remove the snow<br>from the runway and into the infield. Additionally, they will use large<br>truck-mounted rotary brushes to help keep the snow off the runways.\<br>\<br>Funny side story, my best friend at the Academy told me a story about<br>his former enlisted days at Plattsburgh AFB in upstate New York. It<br>would snow so much that the snow mound in the infield would last until<br>July. They used to call it \"Mount July\". One day, they decided to play<br>a prank on an unsuspecting Airman; a newbie. They wrapped a can of<br>hydraulic fluid (which is red) in a BDU blouse (a military shirt) and<br>buried it in the snow. When the poor guy drove the 10K-mounted<br>snowthrower into the package, he got a BDU blouse and a whole lot of red<br>snow out the chute. Poor guy turned as white as the (other) snow.\<br>\<br>Because of the risk of foreign object damage (FOD), they do not use<br>sand. They can pre-treat the runway with anti-icing chemicals before the<br>snow falls, but if the snow falls fast enough or if the temperatures<br>decline fast enough, the chemical will not be as effective.\<br>\<br>(EDIT) [[Christopher<br>Fox](https://www.quora.com/profile/Christopher-Fox-14)]{.qlink_container}<br>makes a good point, the aircraft is essentially still flying when it<br>touches down and for some time after, until there is no longer enough<br>airflow over the wings to generate lift. During that time, the aircraft<br>normally uses thrust reversers to slow the speed of the aircraft. By the<br>end of its landing roll, it will use wheel brakes, but the majority of<br>the decel is done by thrust reversers. Again, we don\'t know what<br>happened to the Delta flight in New York yet; a full investigation will<br>reveal why the aircraft departed the end of the<br>runway.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
