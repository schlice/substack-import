<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Two different laws.<br><br>HIPAA governs what people who have your personal medical information do<br>with it. They are required to protect it. They must notify you how they<br>are going to use it and who they are allowed to give it to without<br>additional permission from you. HIPAA governs how they are to protect<br>your information while they have it. It says nothing about what they are<br>allowed to *ask you* for.<br><br>ADA does not require that a service animal have any specific<br>documentation. It does not require animals to wear vests. A business<br>owner may only ask if it is a service animal specifically trained to<br>assist with a disability, and what is the animal trained to do. This is<br>all the law allows them to ask. The law says specifically that<br>documentation of training is not required. And no, the training of your<br>service animal is not private medical information.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How is asking about someone\'s vaccine status not a violation of HIPPA,<br>but asking for documents for service animals is a violation of the ADA?<br>Aren\'t they both private medical information?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
