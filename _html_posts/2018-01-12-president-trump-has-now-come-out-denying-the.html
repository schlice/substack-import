<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**President Trump has now come out denying the \"s..holes\" remark,<br>despite numerous highly respected Democratic and Republican Senators,<br>present at the meeting, confirming the remark. Do Trump\'s supporters<br>believe Trump?**<br><br>I'm literally laughing at all this controversy over "shitholes." The<br>world is awash in "shitholes" today.<br><br>Are these literally the same people who just a few months ago were<br>wearing vaginas on their heads and actually attacking *individuals*, not<br>the *countries they came from,* calling conservative men "teabaggers?"<br>And yet, they're all wilting over "shitholes?" Not buying it.<br><br>So if the remark actually was said, he was not talking about the people<br>themselves, but he was talking about the countries from which they came.<br>Because if he actually said it, he asked why we keep getting "people<br>from shithole countries," which isn't a slam on the people themselves,<br>but the countries from which they were coming.<br><br>So let's be honest with ourselves: are the countries he mentioned (like<br>Haiti and El Salvador) *actually shitholes?* If they weren't, would<br>people from those countries be clamoring to come to the United States?<br>Where would you rather live: Haiti or the US? I rest my case.<br><br>So the problem, then, isn't the truth, it's the language. The<br>truth is, in his boorish, crass way, he said that these countries leave<br>a lot to be desired. But he doesn't talk like a president, and Democrats<br>find that utterly distasteful. Doesn't make him *wrong*, they just don't<br>like *him.*<br><br>To be honest, if he did say it, I also find it distasteful. But the<br>truth hurts sometimes, doesn't it. It's not like I didn't expect that<br>kind of language from the "pussy-grabber-in-chief." At least he's a<br>known entity. He acts exactly as I would expect.<br><br>I've often said I wished he would temper his speech, and I wish he would<br>quit being so obsessive with Twitter (a.k.a. the cesspool of the<br>Internet). But that's Trump. We'll support him so long as he produces<br>results, and so far, he's producing results.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
