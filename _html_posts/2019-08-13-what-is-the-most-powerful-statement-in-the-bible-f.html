<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What Is the most powerful statement in the Bible for you?<br><br>For me personally, it is Philippians 4:13.<br><br>> *I can do all this through him who gives me strength.*<br><br>I had received this quote on a small business card sized note, one which<br>I got during military in-processing (along with that small pocket New<br>Testament that you get with your initial issue gear). I highlighted that<br>quote and had it up on my corkboard throughout my time at USAFA, and I<br>kept it with me ever since.<br><br>The same thought from the letter to the Philippians, expanded and more<br>applicable to my situation, is found in 2 Cor 12:7--10. I didn't know<br>just how important both of these passages would be until I really needed<br>them.<br><br>> *\...or because of these surpassingly great revelations. Therefore, in<br>> order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my<br>> flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me. Three times I pleaded with<br>> the Lord to take it away from me. But he said to me, "My grace is<br>> sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness."<br>> Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so<br>> that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ's sake, I<br>> delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in<br>> difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.*<br><br>That "thorn in my flesh" which I was given was multiple sclerosis.<br><br>I fell upon this section of Paul's second letter to the Corinthians<br>during a particularly low point in my life, while I was still going<br>through the grief of learning of my disease.<br><br>And then it all clicked.<br><br>The strength He promises, to "do all things" as Paul says in his letter<br>to the Philippians, seems to be a bit nebulous. And it always was, until<br>I was diagnosed.<br><br>Paul says that he "delights in weaknesses." I certainly did not delight<br>in my weakness. I despised it. It totally changed the course of my life!<br>Instead of my life proceeding in the direction I wanted it to, it was<br>now proceeding in a completely different direction. I had to leave the<br>military. I had to stop doing some of the very things which I had<br>desired to do for my entire life. This disease totally changed my life.<br><br>But that was the point, wasn't it?<br><br>My life should not have been proceeding in the way I wanted it to. It<br>should have been proceeding in the way *He* wanted it to. And the idea<br>that I had *any* control over my life was an absurdity of my own making.<br><br>It took a diagnosis of MS to realize that.<br><br>Then I re-read Paul's words again. "That is why, for Christ's sake, I<br>delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in<br>difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong."<br><br>Paul endured far more than I ever will (or so I hope). At least, he<br>endured far more than I have, even counting MS. I have expert medical<br>care which Paul, even on his best days, did not. Not to mention he<br>suffered punishments, imprisonment, and more, in the name of Jesus. Nah,<br>what Paul and I experienced are in completely separate universes.<br>Nothing I have experienced in my life even comes close to the hardships<br>he faced.<br><br>And yet, he still "delighted" in it.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Because when his life had trouble, it was then that God's power was<br>"perfected." This word "perfected" doesn't mean "flawless." It means "at<br>its most poignant" or "at its most desirable state." In other words, its<br>*raison d'Ãªtre.* The whole reason it exists.<br><br>And what is that reason? It isn't the reason that modern culture would<br>have you believe. It isn't the removal of hardships. It is to use our<br>hardships, our weaknesses, the "thorns in our side," to display the<br>glory of God ***by allowing us to endure them. Even to "delight" in<br>them.***<br><br>Satan (and his thorns) do not work in a vacuum. *God allows Satan to<br>work, because everything Satan does is carefully planned to glorify<br>God.* Let that sink in for a second. Everything that Satan does in this<br>world is designed by God in His loving plan to lead us to His glory. God<br>allowed Satan's thorns to afflict Paul, in the same way God allowed<br>Satan to afflict Job. But it was all done with an overarching design, to<br>turn that affliction and use it for His good purposes.<br><br>So I know that my disease was permitted to happen so that God could use<br>it for His good purposes. Don't misunderstand; I have no idea what those<br>purposes are. But God keeps His promises, and He has promised that this<br>affliction "will perfect His power," or will be turned into good, for<br>His glory. I may never know what that purpose is, while I'm still alive.<br>But I will trust in Him, and I will trust that He has a plan for me. And<br>while I haven't quite gotten to the point that Paul had, of "delighting"<br>in my afflictions, I can at least rest assured that God is using this<br>for His purposes.<br><br>He has a plan for me. *God* has a plan for *me*. Now it's up to me to<br>allow Him to do the good work through me that He has planned. I just<br>have to let Him take the wheel.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
