They can believe<br>whatever it is that they want to believe. They can practice whatever<br>religion they choose, or no religion at all. The State will never<br>sponsor a state religion, so no one will be forced to believe anything.<br><br>Those atheists and agnostics you mentioned in your question have the<br>right to believe that religions cause wars, ignorance, and immorality.<br>They have the right to live without practicing religion in their lives.<br><br>The moment they try to impose their belief onto you, they have crossed a<br>line.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
