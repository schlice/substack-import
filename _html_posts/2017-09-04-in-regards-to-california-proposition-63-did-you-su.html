<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The law's provisions making large capacity magazines illegal (according<br>to the link you posted) was set to go into effect July 1, 2017.<br><br>On June 29, 2017, Judge Roger Benitez ordered Attorney General Becerra<br>to not enforce or implement the large magazine sections of Proposition<br>63. Judge Benitez\'s order is a preliminary injunction, meaning the<br>order is temporary pending conclusion of the legal case. Judge Benitez<br>said Proposition 63\'s section on large-capacity magazines is likely<br>unconstitutional because it \"burdens the core of the Second Amendment<br>by criminalizing the mere possession of these magazines that are<br>commonly held by law-abiding citizens for defense of self, home, and<br>state.\"<br><br>He also stated, \"The State of California's desire to criminalize simple<br>possession of a firearm magazine able to hold more than 10 rounds is<br>precisely the type of policy choice that the Constitution takes off the<br>table.\"<br><br>So because that section of the law never came into effect, no one who<br>owns a magazine larger than 10 rounds is an "outlaw" under Prop 63.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
