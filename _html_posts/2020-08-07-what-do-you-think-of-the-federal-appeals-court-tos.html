<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What do you think of the federal appeals court tossing out Boston<br>marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's death penalty conviction? Is his<br>current sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole<br>just?**<br><br>So let's dissect what happened at the appeals court. And let's not<br>forget that not all charges were vacated, only the death penalty<br>eligible charges. Some other charges were allowed to stand.<br><br>In this case, it's easiest to start with the words from the judges<br>themselves.<br><br>> A core promise of our criminal-justice system is that even the very<br>> worst among us deserves to be fairly tried and lawfully punished --- a<br>> point forcefully made by the then-U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts<br>> during a presser at the trial\'s end.<br>><br>> To help make that promise a reality, decisions long on our books say<br>> that a judge handling a case involving prejudicial pretrial publicity<br>> must elicit \'the kind and degree\' of each prospective juror\'s<br>> \'exposure to the case or the parties,\' if asked by counsel, see<br>> *Patriarca v. United States*, 402 F.2d 314, 318 (1st Cir. 1968) ---<br>> only then can the judge reliably assess whether a potential juror can<br>> ignore that publicity, as the law requires. But despite a diligent<br>> effort, the judge here did not meet the standard set by *Patriarca*<br>> and its successors.<br><br>So if you truly believe in the rule of law and in the promise of the<br>14th Amendment which essentially promises that all are equal under the<br>law (including the very worst among us), then the high bar set by<br>*Patriarca* to vet the jury and eliminate bias must be enforced. And if<br>the judge doesn't meet the standard, then it is entirely possible that<br>bias could have played a part in these jury decisions.<br><br>**In short, assuming the conclusion about the judge failing to meet the<br>standards set by *Patriarca* were correct, the appeals court was<br>right to vacate the death penalty eligible findings.**<br><br>The DOJ has a number of avenues it can pursue. It can ask the appeals<br>court to review "en banc" instead of just having a 3-judge panel review.<br>It can ask the Supreme Court to review. Or it can allow the appeals<br>court rulinggo back and re-do the penalty phase of the trial for these<br>charges only, and *ensure* that the judge follows the rules to the<br>letter regarding vetting prospective jurors' exposure to the case and<br>*ensure* that the jurors can ignore that publicity, assuming the<br>government still wants to pursue capital punishment for those charges.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
