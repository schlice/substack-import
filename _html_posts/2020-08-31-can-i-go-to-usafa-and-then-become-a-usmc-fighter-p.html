<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can I go to USAFA and then become a USMC fighter pilot?<br><br>Short answer: yes.<br><br>Longer answer: There are a certain number of "cross-commissions" that<br>take place between the service academies at graduation. Maybe you<br>weren't able to get an acceptance at the academy of your choice. Maybe<br>some other circumstance made you change your mind after you started at<br>your academy. Regardless, cross-commissioning is a thing.<br><br>It is a one-for-one swap; only an equal number of people may accept a<br>commission in the opposite service. For example, if there are twenty<br>USAFA grads who want to accept a Navy commission (and work in the Marine<br>Corps), but there are only ten USNA grads who want to accept a USAF<br>commission, then only the top 10 USAFA grads would be able to<br>cross-commission.<br><br>Becoming a USMC pilot after that is up to the Marines.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
