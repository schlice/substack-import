<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [So here\'s how this particular plea deal worked.\<br>\<br>The prosecutor believed he had enough evidence to charge with Murder 1.<br>Murder 2 is a *lesser-included offense* of Murder 1 (i.e. if you\'ve<br>committed a crime that meets the standard of Murder 1, you have also<br>committed a crime that meets the standard of Murder 2).\<br>\<br>So rather than go to trial and face the possibility of a Murder 1<br>conviction which would carry a minimum 58-year sentence, the prosecutor<br>offered a *plea bargain*.\<br>\<br>A plea bargain is a construct of the court system that allows the<br>defendant to accept a lesser sentence *in exchange for a guilty plea*.<br>This means that the defendant will plead guilty to Murder 2, and the<br>sentence has already been decided (30 years). It\'s a win for the<br>prosecutor because there is no trial, no jury, no waste of the court\'s<br>time and resources, and it\'s a small win for the defendant who will<br>only spend 30 years in jail (likely with the possibility for parole)<br>instead of a minimum 58 year sentence if he was tried and convicted of<br>Murder 1.\<br>\<br>As with any plea bargain, a judge must still accept the deal before it<br>is entered as a verdict. The trial is then reduced to a single hearing<br>before the judge, who reviews the terms of the plea agreement and<br>accepts/rejects them. There have been cases where judges have rejected<br>plea deals, but those are rare. Usually, judges quickly accept plea<br>deals.\<br>\<br>Differences in Degrees\<br>\<br>Murder charges vary by state. Some states even name them differently<br>(i.e. some call it \"Capital Murder\" instead of \"1st Degree Murder\",<br>some call it \"Voluntary Manslaughter\" instead of \"3rd Degree<br>Murder\") but in general the degrees are the same regardless of what<br>states call it.\<br>\<br>1st Degree Murder involves three elements which must be present in<br>order to meet the standard of the crime:\<br>]<br><br>- An unlawful taking of a life<br>- with malice<br>- and forethought.\<br><br>2nd Degree Murder involves only the first two (unlawful taking of a<br>life with malice). Forethought (planning) is not required.\<br>\<br>3rd Degree Murder (sometimes called Voluntary Manslaughter)<br>involves only the first element (the unlawful taking of a life). It<br>involves no forethought, and often results from circumstances that would<br>\"cause a reasonable person to become emotionally or mentally<br>disturbed.\" They are sometimes referred to as \"crimes of passion.\" If<br>you caught someone in bed with your wife and you killed him, this would<br>be considered voluntary manslaughter.\<br>\<br>To provide an example, if you kill someone in a bar fight, it would<br>generally be Murder 2, but if you had just found out that the person was<br>having sex with your wife, it might be reduced to Murder 3, or voluntary<br>manslaughter.\<br>\<br>Involuntary Manslaughter involves the taking of a life, but usually<br>through an intentional, or negligent, act which causes death. Drunk<br>driving would be considered involuntary manslaughter. Note that all<br>three murder charges include an \"intent\" to kill, whereas involuntary<br>manslaughter is different as there was no intent to kill. Charges such<br>as \"vehicular homicide\" and \"causing death by criminal negligence\"<br>are crimes that in the US would be equivalent to involuntary<br>manslaughter.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
