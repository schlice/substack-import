<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You need a lot more diagnosis.\<br>\<br>There are many diseases which can cause minds to get blurry like you<br>described. Your neurologist will continue asking you questions and<br>trying to understand what\'s going on. You may be ordered to take an<br>MRI, or get a lumbar puncture (aka a spinal tap). If you haven\'t<br>already, you\'ll probably get lots of blood taken and analyzed. There<br>could be any number of systemic issues going on.\<br>\<br>And if you\'re not happy with what your neurologist tells you, get a<br>second opinion. Find another neurologist near you. Keep going until you<br>find the answer.]<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
