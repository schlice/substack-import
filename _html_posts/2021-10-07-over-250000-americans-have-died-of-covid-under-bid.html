<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*NOTE: This is a US framed question, so it is a US-framed answer.*<br><br>I missed where they promised that no one would die from COVID, and that<br>any deaths can only be attributed to mismanagement at the federal level.<br><br>We know that severe COVID causes severe respiratory distress. We also<br>know that people with pre-existing respiratory illness, which is the<br>fourth (chronic lower respiratory illness) and eighth (P&I - pneumonia<br>and influenza) largest killers of people worldwide, are hit very hard by<br>severe COVID. It's no surprise that a virus which causes severe<br>respiratory distress would hit hard against people who already have<br>respiratory issues of some kind. We also had few effective treatments<br>against the virus and its actions.<br><br>We now have a vaccine which has been distributed widely in this country,<br>we have a moderate understanding about how the virus transmits, and we<br>have some very effective treatment options thanks to the Herculean<br>efforts of doctors and nurses on the ground in emergency departments<br>across the country.<br><br>No politician is responsible for anyone's death. Unless a politician<br>is literally standing between you and the vaccine, or standing<br>between you and a treatment, they cannot be responsible for those<br>deaths. Yes, political mismanagement is a travesty, but it is the state<br>which controls vaccine distribution, not the federal government. If you<br>don't have access to a vaccine, you must first look to your state to<br>find out why not.<br><br>When you hear things like "politicians are responsible for COVID<br>deaths," this is politicians politicizing a virus. To a certain extent,<br>Trump did this as he was fixing blame for the virus on China, but Biden<br>really excelled at this particular facet of politics. He has *very<br>effectively* politicized the virus, politicized the vaccine, and made a<br>brand new moral segregation between people in the United States (people<br>who are "good" and do everything the government says, and people who are<br>"bad" and question what the government says is good), effectively<br>creating a two-tiered society.<br><br>Don't put much weight on any of that "X politician is responsible for<br>COVID deaths" talk. They're baiting you into falling for their<br>politicization of the virus for their own political gain.<br><br>Be smarter. Be better.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Over 250,000 Americans have died of COVID under Biden\'s Presidency,<br>despite inheriting 3 vaccines and over 1 Million people a day being<br>vaccinated. Has he failed at handling COVID too? Is he responsible for<br>those 250K deaths like Dems say Trump was?<br><br>\<br><br>*Be cautious using the comments section.*<br><br>*This is a highly-emotional and politically-charged topic (see my answer<br>to understand why).*<br><br>*I have allowed comments to remain open on this answer. Some people like<br>to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a civil manner. But do<br>not misunderstand, I have no tolerance for harassing or inane behavior.<br>If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you are simply<br>commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised<br>if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything vaguely harassing in<br>there, and your deletion will be followed by a block/mute, and a BNBR<br>report. I will do this immediately and with no compunction. You have<br>been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
