<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can *go* to AA, but you're going to have a difficult time *being<br>helped* by AA if you don't believe in a higher power.<br><br>Now, it doesn't have to be God. It doesn't have to be anything religious<br>(AA isn't a religious program, but it is a spiritual one). It can be the<br>collective consciousness of everyone in the room. It can be the laws of<br>nature. It can be the laws of science. It can be love, or humanity, or<br>the natural flow of the universe. But the program is indeed a spiritual<br>one, and is based very strongly on the fact that you are powerless to<br>control your own addiction, and you came to believe that only your<br>higher power could restore you to sanity, and you let them do it.

That's the crux of the program: realizing<br>that there is something out there greater than yourself.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
