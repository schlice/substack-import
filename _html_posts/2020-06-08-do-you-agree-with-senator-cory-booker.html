<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you agree with senator Cory Booker\'s push to eliminate qualified<br>immunity for police officers?**<br><br>I must agree with [[Colin<br>Riegels](https://www.quora.com/profile/Colin-Riegels)]{.qlink_container}<br>and say that we should be looking to overhaul qualified immunity before<br>we eliminate it wholesale.<br><br>Even if we do eliminate it, this does not eliminate Constitutional<br>protections for police officers. They are still protected by the same<br>Constitution that suspects are, and if they are in fear for their life,<br>they can still use the same deadly force that any other citizen of the<br>United States can.<br><br>The heavy modification (or removal) of qualified immunity will allow<br>more civil rights cases to move forward when previously they could have<br>been essentially cut off at pre-trial (if they even made it that far).<br>In its current form, it allows for the disregard of officers' bad faith,<br>it demands exacting requirements to clearly establish the law, and gives<br>license to courts to grant qualified immunity without ruling on the<br>underlying constitutional claims. These traits of modern-day qualified<br>immunity send the message that law enforcement can disregard the law and<br>not be held accountable.<br><br>This is exactly what protesters have been calling for for so many years.<br><br>While I would first look at extreme overhaul vs outright elimination, I<br>agree with Senator Booker that the doctrine of qualified immunity, in<br>its current form, is completely ineffective, doesn't achieve what it was<br>originally intended to do, and doesn't save taxpayers any money in<br>litigation costs either. It also doesn't protect police officers from<br>being sued or facing personal financial liability, either. In short, it<br>has failed at its original aim, and it may send the message to law<br>enforcement that they can violate the law and not be held accountable.<br>It should be reworked.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
