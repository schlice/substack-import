<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, there's really no catch.<br><br>The rub is that they won't take a case they can't win, because they<br>won't work for free. **If they take your case, they can either win, or<br>they can win a reduced settlement,** but they'll get something.<br><br>Even if they have to settle for less than you originally thought you<br>could get, they're still taking a third of that. The agreement you sign<br>says that if you win a settlement, the attorney keeps 1/3 of that<br>settlement, and you keep 2/3. If you don't win any settlement, you don't<br>owe the attorney anything.<br><br>Here's a real-life example. One of my family members was involved in an<br>auto accident. Ahead of our vehicle (about 10 cars ahead), an elderly<br>woman ran a red light and turned left into oncoming traffic. This was<br>immediately followed by much slamming of brakes and many rear-end<br>accidents. My family member was able to stop with only minor contact to<br>the vehicle ahead. The driver behind her was not so attentive. He<br>slammed into the back of our car. Police investigation revealed that<br>based on the skid marks, he was traveling at at least 55 mph when he<br>impacted our car. Her back was seriously injured.<br><br>We hired a personal injury attorney in our city. He did a great job, but<br>because my family member's car impacted the car ahead of it before she<br>was struck from the rear, the attorney for the driver behind<br>successfully argued that the damages my family member should receive<br>should be reduced because you cannot reasonably tell how much injury was<br>caused by the first collision and the second.<br><br>I call bullshit on that one, but I'm not the judge, am I...<br><br>Nevertheless, we were expecting to be awarded around \$40,000 in<br>damages. We were only awarded around \$18,000 in damages, which meant we<br>only got \$12,000 back. So instead of my attorney earning around<br>\$13,000, he only earned around \$6,000. Covered his expenses and some<br>profit, but hardly what he was hoping for.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
