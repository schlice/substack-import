<br/><br/>Answer Comment<br/><br/><br/>Content: [You contradicted yourself. You can call it semantics, but<br/>you said \"Guns kill people\" and then you said \"They are built,<br/>designed, \\...\ distributed, and employed **to give one the means to<br/>take the life of another**\" (emphasis mine). This is a very important<br/>distinction, because on one hand you said that \"the gun killed<br/>someone\" and on the other hand you said \"someone used a gun to kill<br/>someone else\" which means \"someone killed someone else (with a gun)\".<br/>That\'s more than just semantics; that\'s the difference between someone<br/>killing someone and a gun killing someone.\<br/>\<br/>You are correct that a gun is purpose-built to kill, just as a car is<br/>purpose-built to drive. While cars and knives can cause death, they are<br/>not purpose-built to kill. This is the reason that guns are so often<br/>targeted: because they are purpose-built to kill. However, homicide<br/>is a crime in which one person takes the life of another person<br/>using a tool. Guns, of their own volition, do not take the life of<br/>another person. A gun cannot commit homicide. A gun can be used by<br/>someone to commit the crime of homicide, but a gun, by itself, cannot<br/>kill. Despite what you might hear in the media, guns do not mysteriously<br/>\"go off\" without someone pulling the trigger. There are numerous<br/>internal safeties within a gun to prevent such an occurrence. The<br/>trigger has to actually be pulled in order for the gun to fire (with the<br/>notable exception of some automatic weapons with free-floating firing<br/>pins, but that\'s outside the scope of the question).\<br/>\<br/>Therefore, a gun cannot kill, just like \"pencils do not misspell words<br/>and forks do not make people fat\" (thanks [[Chris<br/>Bast](https://www.quora.com/profile/Chris-Bast)]{.qlink_container}).<br/>It\'s people that do all these things, not the implements they use to do<br/>them.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Answer:<br/>https://www.quora.com/Do-guns-kill-people-Is-the-guns-dont-kill-people-argument-reasonable/answer/Brian-Dunlap<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
