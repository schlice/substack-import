<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are the differences between building insurance in a condo HOA fee<br>and home owners insurance?**<br><br>Remember that a condo has a separate purchase and ownership structure<br>than a townhome or a single-family detached home. In a condo, you own<br>*only* the property within the four walls of your unit. You own the<br>walls, and everything inside. You don't own anything outside of the<br>walls of your unit. In a townhome, you own the land the building sits<br>on, plus any decks, yards, and all interiors. Townhome isn't a legal<br>description, it's an architectural style. To that end, townhomes are<br>governed by the same rules as single-family detached homes.<br><br>Condos will belong to a condominium association which maintains the<br>building, all the common areas, and any amenities. Townhomes and<br>single-family homes will all belong to homeowner's associations.<br>While the difference is slight (and many condo associations will call<br>themselves HOAs), there is a difference.<br><br>Condo associations which are part of a Planned Unit Development (PUD)<br>provide for *joint ownership* of the common areas, and your condo<br>association fees pay for that. *This includes any liability insurance<br>for those common areas.* For condos not part of a PUD, the condo<br>association owns the common areas, but you still pay for general<br>liability insurance on those areas. HOAs do not provide for joint<br>ownership of common areas; the HOA is the legal entity which owns common<br>space. However, the HOA still carries general liability insurance on<br>their common areas. The difference between the two, in most cases, is<br>the ownership.<br><br>In a condo, you will pay for common area insurance (or what you've<br>called building insurance), and you will pay for, generally, a level of<br>homeowner's insurance that is much more similar to *renter's insurance*<br>for the interior space and your things (it's a renter's insurance<br>because it does not cover the structure of the building, similar to an<br>apartment). In a townhome or single-family home, you pay the HOA dues<br>which include funding for common area general liability insurance, and<br>you of course pay for your own *homeowner's insurance*<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
