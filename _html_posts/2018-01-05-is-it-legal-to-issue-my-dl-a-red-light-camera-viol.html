<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it legal to issue my DL a red light camera violation if the car was<br>never stopped by an officer?**<br><br>It depends on the state and the rules for how a ticket is "served" to<br>the registered owner of the vehicle.<br><br>We use red light cameras in some cities in Colorado. It's not actually a<br>recorded violation until you are served. Here, you can be served in a<br>number of ways:<br><br>- Being handed a ticket by a peace officer<br>- Being handed a ticket by a process server, or the process server<br>  delivering the ticket to someone over 18 at the residence of the<br>  registered owner<br>- Being delivered the ticket via registered mail, return receipt<br>  requested<br><br>We have reports of the city sending process servers to residences at 6<br>AM to try to catch people at home, so Colorado residents should be aware<br>of this.<br><br>Once the ticket is issued, it has 90 days to be served by one of the<br>above methods, or it is invalid. If it is not served within 90 days, the<br>violation expires.<br><br>Also note that a red light camera violation is civil, not criminal. It<br>will never add points to your license. If you are properly served and<br>you don't pay, they will send the ticket to a collection agency which<br>could negatively impact your credit.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
