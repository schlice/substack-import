<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Philosopher and scholar Mortimer Adler said, "\"An affirmative<br>existential proposition can be proved, but a negative existential<br>proposition\--one that denies the existence of something\--cannot be<br>proved.\"<br><br>In other words, you can prove the existence of something, but you can't<br>prove that something does not exist.<br><br>Therefore, there is no mathematical or logical proof you can provide<br>which would show that God does not exist. At best, what exists is<br>logical arguments against the logical proofs which argue that God does<br>exist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
