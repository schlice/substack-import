<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are many, both ethical and medical.<br><br>Medically, there are a series of problems with embryonic stem cells<br>(ESCs):<br><br>1.  It's difficult to grow a pure sample of a single cell-type without<br>    growing other cell types. For example, if you're trying to grow<br>    heart cells, you may find some liver cells in your sample, which<br>    renders your sample impure and potentially unusable.<br>2.  ESCs are *immunogenic*, which means that they are genetically<br>    different from the patient, which virtually guarantees that the<br>    patient will reject the cells.<br>3.  ESCs are *tumorigenic.* Because of their ability for rapid<br>    proliferation, ESCs tend to grow uncontrollably and produce tumors.<br>4.  ESCs are derived from the inner cell mass of an early embryo,<br>    between 5 and 7 days old, or aborted fetal tissue from fetuses less<br>    than a few weeks old. Because a majority of embryos are reserved for<br>    in-vitro fertilization (IVF), there is a very limited amount of<br>    source material. Current law prevents selling aborted fetal tissue,<br>    so the only material available is from embryos harvested for IVF.<br><br>Finally, the largest medical issue relates to what we've found using<br>these cells. ESCs have yet to show proven success in treating a single<br>human being. Research with ESCs has primarily triggered tumor formation<br>and immune system reactions in animal studies.<br><br>Ethically, ESCs are fraught with challenges, but the largest one is the<br>fact that in order to harvest ESCs, the embryo must be destroyed.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What are the potential problems with using embryonic stem cells in<br>humans?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
