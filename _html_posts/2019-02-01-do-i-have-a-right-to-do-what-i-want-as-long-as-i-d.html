<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do I have a right to do what I want as long as I don't break the<br>law?**<br><br>In general, yes.<br><br>Remember the rule of thumb: your right to swing your arm stops at my<br>nose. The purpose of the law is to make sure that your exercise of your<br>rights doesn't interfere with my exercise of my rights.<br><br>Remember too that there are lots of laws, and they may not cover exactly<br>what you're doing but they may still be applicable.<br><br>While it may not be illegal to scream on a street corner because there's<br>no law against screaming on a street corner, you could be causing a<br>public nuisance, or inciting a riot, or engaging in a demonstration<br>without a city permit (depending on what street corner you are on). It<br>also doesn't mean that your activity, while legal, won't prompt some law<br>enforcement inquiry as to your mental state (again, doesn't have to be<br>illegal for the police to check on whether or not you've lost your<br>marbles).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
