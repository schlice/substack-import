<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I thought California had strict gun control and red flag laws. How did<br>the San Diego shooting happen? Why didn\'t the laws prevent this from<br>happening?**<br><br>Because laws don't prevent crime. Laws are not designed to prevent<br>crime.<br><br>Laws provide a legal framework to punish those who violate them.<br><br>Remember, someone has to violate the law before the law can punish them.<br>You can't punish someone before they commit a crime.<br><br>We don't know where the shooter got his gun. But if he purchased it<br>legally, then all the laws in the world wouldn't have stopped him from<br>doing what he did. He followed the law right up to the point where he<br>didn't, and you can't predict that with any level of certainty.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
