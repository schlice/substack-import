In other words, is driving while smoking weed considered as<br>legally wrong as driving while drinking? It seems to be happening more<br>and more. I live in Ohio, USA.**<br><br>Smoking cannabis in Ohio is illegal. It's only legal for medical use,<br>and it's only legal to be used as an edible, oil, vapor, patch, or<br>tincture.<br><br>Ohio also decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana. Any<br>amount under 100 grams is a minor misdemeanor, subject to a \$150 fine.<br><br>Police don't routinely stop cars for that. So it's unlikely that you'll<br>get a police response from simply smelling weed.<br><br>*However*, if you see a car that does not appear to be controlled in<br>a normal way (swerving, weaving into oncoming traffic, erratic<br>accelerator/braking actions, etc), you should call the police and report<br>that you think a driver is under the influence. Of what, you cannot be<br>sure, even though you may have smelled marijuana from the car, but you<br>can be sure that the vehicle is operating in an erratic manner. Do call<br>911 for that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
