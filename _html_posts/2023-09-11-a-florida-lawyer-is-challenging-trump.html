<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are some really big Constitutional questions to answer, namely<br>whether or not Amendment 14 Section 3 applies to Presidents, what counts<br>as "engaging in an insurrection," who has standing to challenge Trump's<br>eligibility, and who has the authority to enforce his disqualification<br>if he is disqualified.<br><br>Section 3 has been a dead letter since 1871. We want to move cautiously<br>with now applying Section 3, because we want to be sure that Section 3<br>doesn't become yet another means by which partisan adversaries can go<br>after and sideline their political opponents. We have enough of that<br>crap with our own Federal agencies, we don't need more of it now.<br><br>Does it even apply to presidents?<br><br>Is the office of the presidency even covered by Section 3? It isn't<br>mentioned in the text, and scholars disagree over whether the Framers,<br>or the average person in 1868, would view it as being covered. Some<br>scholars suggest the broader "office \... under the United States"<br>language shouldn't be read to include the presidency. Others say there's<br>no way Congress or the public in 1868 would have understood that, for<br>example, Jefferson Davis could not be a Representative or a Senator but<br>could be President.<br><br>What counts as an "insurrection?"<br><br>There is similar confusion around the meaning of the phrases "engaged in<br>insurrection or rebellion" and "given aid or comfort." While the DOJ has<br>charged more than 1100 Jan. 6 defendants (including, last month, Mr.<br>Trump), *none of them have been charged with insurrection* (more than a<br>dozen defendants have been convicted or pleaded guilty to seditious<br>conspiracy and sentenced to prison). Since insurrection involves more<br>than one person, it would be a tough row to hoe if all of the people you<br>claim are co-conspirators in your insurrection are never charged with<br>that crime.<br><br>While Section 3 still technically has legal force, some scholars say its<br>use in the 1860s and '70s has limited precedential value for today's<br>controversies. Most of those cases involved men who had been Confederate<br>officials just a few years earlier. Michael McConnell, a professor at<br>Stanford Law School, posits: "It was the Civil War, so no one needed to<br>debate the finer points of what an insurrection was." Given that, I<br>highly doubt that the Framers envisioned First Amendment-protected<br>political speech urging listeners to peacefully protest to request<br>redress of grievances as insurrection.<br><br>Who gets to decide?<br><br>Unlike impeachment (which has a detailed process outlined in the<br>Constitution), 14th Amendment disqualifications are procedurally vague.<br>How does the process work, and who performs that function? Is it the<br>Courts, Congress, or perhaps State and local officials that get to<br>decide who's qualified and who isn't?<br><br>If we read up on the Civil War era notes of those who wrote the<br>amendment, it seems that the thinking was largely focused on Congress as<br>the deciding authority. If a high-level government candidate required<br>Congressional approval, the reasoning follows that disqualification<br>under the 14th Amendment was also likely thought to involve a vote in<br>Congress. That's an entirely different process than a state limiting a<br>candidate's access to the ballot box. The Framers at least trusted the<br>will of the people to properly adjudicate whether or not a true<br>insurrectionist would ever be voted in as president. The more important<br>question, says Professor McConnell, "is whether the people should be<br>deprived of being able to vote for the candidate of their choice when it<br>appears."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
