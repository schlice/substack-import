Maybe that's why he's "to blame."<br><br>Perhaps he "should have known" that the [[FBI is more messed up than we<br>all originally<br>thought](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=aa9dfb&url=https://www.conservativereview.com/articles/levin-incensed-twice-people-saw-something-said-something-fbi-blew/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="conservativereview.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>I don't know, exactly.<br><br>But if we're going to assign blame, make sure you blame the right<br>person. Nikolas Cruz. He is the only person to blame for the<br>shooting.<br><br>There are others who may have missed the signs that this happened, but<br>make sure you put the blame squarely where it belongs.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
