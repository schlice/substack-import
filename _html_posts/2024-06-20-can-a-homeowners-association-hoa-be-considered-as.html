<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, for several reasons:<br><br>1.  It's not a tax. It's a payment for a contracted service.<br>2.  It's not without representation. Every HOA has a Board, and that<br>    Board is usually comprised of homeowners in the neighborhood.<br>    Regardless of who makes up the Board, you chose the configuration of<br>    the Board when you agreed to the Covenants when you bought your<br>    house.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
