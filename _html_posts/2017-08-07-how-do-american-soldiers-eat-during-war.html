<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Military members are given MREs: [[Meals, Ready to<br>Eat](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f54b22&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal,_Ready-to-Eat){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>The MRE is both the sustenance, and the bane, of field troops<br>everywhere. Packaged rations have existed for almost as long as the US<br>Army has existed. They have existed in various forms, and for most of<br>the nation's existence, have consisted of canned goods. Canned meats,<br>vegetables, breads, and coffee were replaced by preserved meats (either<br>dried or salted) during World War I. WWII saw the introduction of<br>different types of rations, namely the Mountain Ration and the Jungle<br>Ration, but around the end of WWII into the Korean War, we moved back to<br>canned rations commonly known as "C Rations."<br><br>The MRE began development in the early 60s. It has been in continual<br>development throughout its use. General contents may include:<br><br>> - Main course (entree)<br>> - Side dish<br>> - Dessert or snack (often commercial candy, fortified pastry, or<br>>   [[Soldier Fuel<br>>   Bar](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=916616&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOOAH!_Bar){.external_link<br>>   rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>>   onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>>   qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}.)<br>> - Crackers or bread<br>> - Spread of cheese, peanut butter, or jelly<br>> - Powdered beverage mix: fruit flavored drink, cocoa, instant coffee<br>>   or tea, sport drink, or dairy shake.<br>> - Utensils (usually just a plastic spoon)<br>> - Flameless ration heater (FRH)<br>> - Beverage mixing bag<br>> - Accessory pack containing Xylitol chewing gum, water-resistant<br>>   matchbook, napkin / toilet paper, moist towelette, seasonings<br>>   including salt, pepper, sugar, coffee creamer, and/or Tabasco sauce,<br>>   and freeze dried coffee powder\[1\](#Oglhc){#cite-Oglhc<br>>   .citation_link}<br><br>One of the most recent developments was the inclusion of the *flameless<br>ration heater,* a small pouch containing a reagent plate. Water is added<br>to the pouch, which produces an exothermic reaction when in contact with<br>the plate. The entree pouch is placed inside the FRH pouch, and the<br>boiling water heats the entree without needing to start a fire.<br><br>I can tell you that while eating the rations without heating them is<br>possible, they become much more...palatable...once they are heated.<br><br>Everyone has their favorite MREs, and everyone has their least favorite.<br>Trading of entrees often happens.<br><br>When soldiers are deployed and are near field kitchens, regulations<br>require their rations be supplemented with fresh meals or<br>[A-rations(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d5a153&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-ration){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. A-rations are commonly<br>referred to as "box nasties." Wikipedia says that A-rations have been<br>called "bag nasties," but I've never heard that, since they come in a<br>rectangular white box. A-rations contain fresh, frozen or refrigerated<br>items, so they cannot be used everywhere. I can remember a box nasty<br>that consisted of cold fried chicken. It wasn't good when it was hot, so<br>you can imagine what it tasted like when it was cold. But it also had a<br>pear and a sports drink and a granola bar (?), so it wasn't too terribly<br>bad. One time, I took a 9-hour flight in the cargo hold of a C-141. We<br>were issued a box nasty and earplugs. Heh, have a great flight...<br><br>B-rations use preserved or pre-packaged foods in areas where there isn't<br>adequate refrigeration or freezer facilities available.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-Oglhc){.citation_index} [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f54b22&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meal,_Ready-to-Eat){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
