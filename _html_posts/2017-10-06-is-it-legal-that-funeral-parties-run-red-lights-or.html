<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with almost every legal question on Quora, the answer is "it<br>depends." States all treat funeral processions differently. There is no<br>one standard across the country.<br><br>Twenty years ago, funeral processions would simply drive with their<br>headlights on. This was before DRLs (Daytime Running Lamps) became<br>standard, so it was easy to tell the entirety of the procession: they<br>were the only ones with headlights on during the day. Construction<br>workers on the roads would stop their work and doff their hard hats<br>while the procession passed; you rarely see that these days either, but<br>I digress...<br><br>These days, states vary in their requirements for funeral processions.<br>Some states have no provisions whatsoever for funeral processions, and<br>some state that funeral processions have no additional traffic rights<br>over any other vehicle. Some states may require the entire procession to<br>have flags mounted on their cars, or hang tags on their rear-view<br>mirrors, or drive with their hazard flashers running. Some states<br>prevent other vehicles from driving in to a funeral procession if it is<br>apparent that one is in progress. Some states require an "escort<br>vehicle" to accompany the procession. Arizona even allows the escort<br>vehicle to sport red and blue flashing lights and exceed the speed limit<br>by up to 15 miles per hour to catch back up to the front of the<br>procession to guide it through the next intersection. Literally, state<br>laws are all over the map on this, and each state regards funeral<br>processions differently.<br><br>Your funeral home will advise you of the rules for the procession. If<br>you're part of a procession, try to drive as close to the car in front<br>of you as is safe to do, and follow all of the state laws regarding<br>processions.<br><br>It kinda feels like I didn't answer the question. Why is this<br>allowed? Because the individual state has determined how they want to<br>treat a funeral procession. As you can see from the rest of my answer,<br>not all states agree on how to do that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
