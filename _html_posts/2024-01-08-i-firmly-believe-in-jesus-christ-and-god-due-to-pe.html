<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So if you believe that Jesus is God, then what Jesus says must be true,<br>right? Because anything that Jesus (who is God) says must be true.<br><br>Jesus said that the Bible is the inspired word of God.<br><br>Clearly, Jesus would have to be speaking about the Old Testament, as the<br>New Testament books hadn't been written yet. But Jesus taught that the<br>Old Testament was the Word of God. He said it:<br><br>1.  Is Divinely Authoritative---When tempted by Satan, Jesus<br>    corrected him by quoting from the Old Testament. He said, "'It is<br>    written, "Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that<br>    comes from the mouth of God.' \...\ Jesus answered him, 'It is<br>    also written: "Do not put the Lord your God to the test.' \...\<br>    Then Jesus said to him, 'Away from me, Satan! For it is written:<br>    "Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only'" (Matt. 4:4,7,10).<br>    Why would Jesus so confidently quote from the Old Testament if the<br>    Old Testament was not authoritative? He must have considered the Old<br>    Testament to be a source of truth in order to dismiss his most<br>    powerful enemy with it.\<br>    \<br>    In fact, on 92 occasions Jesus and his apostles supported their<br>    position by saying "it is written" (or words to that effect) and<br>    then quoting the Old Testament. Why? Because Jesus and his apostles<br>    considered the Old Testament Scriptures to be the written Word of<br>    God, and thus the ultimate authority for life.<br>2.  Is Imperishable---In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus claimed that<br>    not even the smallest little mark in the Scriptures (the equivalent<br>    of a dot on an "i" or a cross on a "t") will ever perish: "Do not<br>    think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets," he declared.<br>    "I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. For assuredly, I say to<br>    you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by<br>    no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled" (Matt. 5:17,<br>    NKJV). Jesus could not express the imperishability of the Scriptures<br>    more forcefully.<br>3.  Is Infallible---In John 10, Jesus was about to be stoned for<br>    blasphemy. To get himself out of this jam, Jesus cited the Old<br>    Testament and declared, "the Scripture cannot be broken" (John<br>    10:35, NKJV). In other words, when His life was on the line, Jesus<br>    referred to an infallible authority that cannot be broken---the<br>    Scripture. Furthermore, He later affirmed the truth of the<br>    Scriptures when He prayed for the disciples, "Sanctify them by the<br>    truth; your word is truth" (John 17:17).<br>4.  Is Inerrant---When the Sadducees tried to trap Jesus with a<br>    question, Jesus said to them, "You are in error because you do not<br>    know the Scriptures or the power of God" (Matt. 22:29). The<br>    implication, of course, is that the Scriptures are inerrant. It<br>    wouldn't make any sense for Jesus to say, "You are in error because<br>    you don't know the Scriptures, which also err!"<br>5.  Is Historically Reliable---In addition to declaring that the Old<br>    Testament is divinely authoritative, imperishable, infallible, and<br>    inerrant, Jesus affirmed two of the most historically disputed<br>    stories in the Old Testament: Noah (Matt. 24:37-38) and Jonah (Matt.<br>    12:40). Jesus spoke of those stories as being historically true. And<br>    why wouldn't they be true? The miracles associated with Noah and<br>    Jonah are child's play for the all-powerful God who created the<br>    universe. With our limited intelligence, we build great ships and<br>    keep people alive for months underwater. Why couldn't God do the<br>    same?\<br>    \<br>    Jesus also affirmed other aspects of the Old Testament that the<br>    critics deny. Jesus taught that Daniel was a prophet (Matt. 24:15)<br>    while many critics say Daniel was merely a historian (the critics<br>    claim a later date for Daniel, because surely he couldn't have made<br>    all those predictions; their anti-supernatural bias is revealed<br>    again). Furthermore, Jesus specifically quoted different sections of<br>    the book of Isaiah (e.g., Matt. 7:6-7; 13:14-15; Luke 4:17-19),<br>    never once suggesting that there were two or three Isaiahs as many<br>    critics claim.<br>6.  Is Scientifically Accurate---Jesus made other claims that<br>    contradict those of today's critics. When asked if divorce was<br>    acceptable, Jesus cited a scientific fact out of Genesis. He said,<br>    "Haven't you read that at the beginning the Creator 'made them male<br>    and female,' and said, 'For this reason a man will leave his father<br>    and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one<br>    flesh'? So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has<br>    joined together, let man not separate" (Matt. 19:4-6). In other<br>    words, the nature of marriage is bound up in the scientific fact<br>    that Adam and Eve were created for a purpose.\<br>    \<br>    Moreover, Jesus did not accept the false idea that the Bible could<br>    tell you how to "go to heaven" but not "how the heavens go." He told<br>    Nicodemus, "If I told you earthly things and you do not believe, how<br>    will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?" (John 3:12, NASB).<br>    In other words, Jesus taught that if the Bible does not speak<br>    truthfully about the physical world that you can see, then it cannot<br>    be trusted when it speaks about the spiritual world that you cannot<br>    see. Indeed, Christianity is built on historical events---such as<br>    Creation and the Resurrection---that can be tested through<br>    scientific and historical investigation. While adherents of other<br>    religions may accept a complete separation from science, Christians<br>    do not. Truth about the universe cannot be contradictory. Since all<br>    truth is God's truth, religious beliefs must agree with scientific<br>    facts. If they do not, then either there is an error in our<br>    scientific understanding, or our religious beliefs are wrong. Yet<br>    many of the claims of Christianity are affirmed by scientific<br>    investigation. Christ knew it would be this way.<br>7.  Has Ultimate Supremacy---Since Jesus taught that the Old<br>    Testament is divinely authoritative, imperishable, infallible,<br>    inerrant, historically reliable, and scientifically accurate, you<br>    would expect him to assert that it has ultimate supremacy over any<br>    teaching of man. This is exactly what Jesus said. He corrected the<br>    Pharisees and the teachers of the law by claiming that they should<br>    be obeying the Old Testament Scriptures instead of their own<br>    man-made traditions. He said, "Why do you break the command of God<br>    for the sake of your tradition? \...\ You nullify the word of God<br>    for the sake of your tradition" (Matt. 15:3,6). He then blasted them<br>    for failing to live up to the Scriptures by quoting from the Old<br>    Testament: "You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied<br>    about you: 'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts<br>    are far from me. They worship me in vain; their teachings are but<br>    rules taught by men'" (Matt. 15:7-9). Why would Jesus correct the<br>    religious leaders of Israel with the Old Testament unless the Old<br>    Testament had ultimate supremacy over their own ideas?<br><br>In light of Jesus' teaching, there's no question He considered the<br>entire Old Testament to be the inerrant, written Word of God. He said he<br>came to fulfill the entire Jewish Old Testament (Matt. 5:17), which He<br>referred to as "the Law and the Prophets" (Matt. 5:17; Luke 24:26-27).<br>And He told the Jews, "You diligently study the Scriptures because you<br>think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures<br>that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life" (John<br>5:39-40).<br><br>Therefore, if Jesus taught that the Bible is the inerrant word of God,<br>who are we to not believe Him?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
