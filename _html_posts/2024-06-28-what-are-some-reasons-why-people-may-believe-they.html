<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is only one reason to believe that you're not going to hell: **you<br>have been saved.**<br><br>Repentance and belief in Christ is what saves you. It's really that<br>simple.<br><br>It's not about being *exempt* from God's wrath. It's that God visits His<br>wrath on everyone. We're all sinners, and we must all pay for our<br>sin. That's not wrath, that's justice.<br><br>Except in our case, God made a way for us to have our sin paid for.<br>That's mercy.<br><br>In our case, Jesus paid the penalty for our sins. That's grace.<br><br>Why do we know we are not going to Hell? Jesus promised us that<br>repentance and faith pay the penalty for our sins which we deserve.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
