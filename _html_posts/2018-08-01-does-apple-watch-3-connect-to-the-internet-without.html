<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does Apple Watch 3 connect to the Internet without a phone? Apple<br>says: \"Leave your phone at home and still get alerts from your favorite<br>apps.\"**<br><br>Yes, Apple Watch 3 has cellular connectivity as well as Wi-Fi and<br>Bluetooth.<br><br>You must have a cellular "add-on" plan with your wireless carrier, and<br>it must be the same carrier as your iPhone.<br><br>The watch has its own IMEI, and therefore registers on the network as<br>its own device. It must be registered separately on the plan. Generally,<br>there is an "add-on" option that costs anywhere from \$5 to \$15 per<br>month to add a cellular-capable tablet or smart watch to your current<br>plan, but the structure and cost for this service varies by carrier.<br>T-Mobile has a tablet and smart watch add-on to any of their plans that<br>is usually \$10 per month. The device has its own data limits.<br><br>Check with your carrier to find out how much adding an Apple Watch to<br>your plan will cost you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
