This process is known as *demyelination.* What's left in place of<br>the myelin are "scleroses" or scars. That's where the name comes from:<br>multiple sclerosis, "many scars." Nerve signals do not travel as well<br>through these areas of demyelination, which produces the various<br>symptoms of MS: fatigue, nerve pain, balance/coordination, gait,<br>bowel/bladder dysfunction, memory and cognition issues, and a whole<br>range of other symptoms. No two people experience MS in exactly the same<br>way, but there are some symptoms which are more common than others.<br><br>[https://youtu.be/QpUMT-SA75Q(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=21e4d1&url=https://youtu.be/QpUMT-SA75Q){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>In most cases, people with MS show no outward sign of disability. I've<br>lost count of the number of times that someone has incredulously looked<br>at me and said, "You have MS? But you look so *good!"* I often want to<br>retort, "Well, how exactly is someone with MS *supposed* to look?" The<br>one time I did, they responded, "Well, I thought everyone with MS is in<br>a wheelchair, or walks with a cane, or something."<br><br>It's true, it is a common misconception that everyone with MS has some<br>form of visible disability. In fact, most people with MS will not show<br>any outward signs of the disease for many years. It's the great Ironic<br>Disease: how good you look on the outside has absolutely no relation to<br>how bad you feel on the inside.<br><br>**tl;dr: Multiple Sclerosis, for the most part, is an invisible<br>disease.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
