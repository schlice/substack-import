<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Did Jesus cause the COVID-19 as God himself to punish the humans he<br>created so he can feel some satisfaction as a result of their sins?**<br><br>Nope, not even on the right continent, let alone the right ballpark.<br><br>Let's start with the "satisfaction" part. God does not seek to punish us<br>for our sins. In fact, God loves us so much that he sent his son to be<br>killed by us so that he could redeem us. That's how much he loves us. He<br>loves us so much that he sent his son to die so that our sins could be<br>forgiven. We didn't ask him to do that. We didn't beg him to do that. He<br>just did it. That's what we call *grace*: getting something we<br>objectively do not deserve. Does that sound like a god who would inflict<br>a virus on us as punishment for our sins? Not even close. Our sins have<br>already been forgiven. So why then would he continue to punish us for<br>something for which he's already forgiven us? It just doesn't make<br>sense.<br><br>Second, did God create COVID-19? You could say yes, by allowing the<br>conditions under which it could be created. If so, to what end? Why<br>would God allow this terrible thing to happen to people? He could stop<br>it instantly. *Why does God allow bad things to happen to good people?*<br><br>Let's just look at that "satisfaction" paragraph. God allowed Jesus to<br>be killed so that we could be redeemed. I would think that being killed<br>would qualify as a bad thing, no? God allowed that bad thing to happen.<br>And it was to his own son! Why would he do such a thing? He did this to<br>redeem us. He did this to give us a path to heaven. He did this so we<br>could freely choose him, and choose salvation. Remember, we were create<br>as sinful creatures, but with free will. You must be sinless to enter<br>heaven, and none of us are sinless. We are all sinners, and we all fall<br>short of God's standard. None of us *deserve* heaven. We are sinful in<br>our thoughts, in our hearts, and in our actions. But God made a way for<br>us to return to him. God sent Jesus to live a sinless life, so that he<br>could open the path to heaven for us.<br><br>We live in a fallen world. We live in a world full of sin. And we are<br>indeed sinful creatures. The Bible is clear that this life will not be<br>easy, and things like COVID-19 will happen. They have happened before,<br>and they will happen again. He never promised us an easy, carefree life.<br>But by his death and resurrection, Jesus found a way to beat the world!<br>"In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome<br>the world. (John 16:33)"<br><br>Just know that all of this, these things that happen in this world, be<br>it COVID-19, the Black Plague, the Swine Flu, natural disasters, wars,<br>famines, and all of the objectively bad things that happen, all happen<br>for a reason. They all work as part of God's plan to glorify him and to<br>advance his kingdom. He also said that his plan will be hard to<br>understand, again because of our humanity. Think of trying to explain<br>the beauty of a sunrise to a baby still in the womb. It's impossible to<br>do. We will probably never understand why he allows things to happen.<br>And I'll tell you right now, when I finally meet him face to face, I'm<br>gonna have a few questions.<br><br>But he keeps his promises. And he has promised that if we believe in<br>him, we are saved. And that is a promise you can be sure of.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
