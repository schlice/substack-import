<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why are some fully auto guns and firearms available for sale in the<br>U.S.?**<br><br>I ask you: *why not?* Why should they *not* be available for sale?<br><br>Now, mind you, fully automatic firearms are heavily regulated, but they<br>are not illegal. You must go through an extensive background check which<br>includes fingerprinting and photos, and you must pay a \$200 tax to<br>transfer the firearm. Additionally, some states have extra regulations<br>on fully automatic firearms, on top of the Federal requirements.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
