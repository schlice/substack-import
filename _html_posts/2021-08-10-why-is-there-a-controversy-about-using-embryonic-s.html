<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are several reasons why there is controversy, but the primary<br>reason why embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are controversial is that **in<br>order to harvest any type of embryonic stem cell, it is necessarily<br>destructive to a fetus.**<br><br>There are two places from which you can harvest embryonic cells:<br><br>- Embryos. Embryonic stem cells are obtained from the inner cell<br>  mass of the early embryo, usually from 5 to 7 days old. Deriving these<br>  cells requires the destruction of the young embryo.<br>- Fetuses. Embryonic germ cells, another type of embryonic cell, are<br>  obtained from aborted fetuses several weeks old; though similar to<br>  embryonic stem cells, they have not been used much by researchers.<br><br>In contrast, adult stem cells (ASCs) can be harvested from the<br>following places: the blood of umbilical cords and the solid cord<br>tissue, the amniotic fluid that surrounds the baby in the womb, and the<br>placenta. It can also be derived from body tissues, or even cadavers.<br><br>Regardless of the advantages and disadvantages of each type of cell<br>(which is not what was asked), the major ethics controversy surrounding<br>these types of cells is the fact that in order to acquire embryonic stem<br>cells, you must destroy a fetus.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why is there a controversy about using embryonic stem cells?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
