<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, where did you get the idea that God was supposed to save<br>anyone from anything?<br><br>It certainly didn't come from the Bible. Even the giants of the faith<br>were not "saved." Stephen was stoned to death. Peter was crucified<br>(upside-down). Paul was beheaded. In prison. In fact, ten of the twelve<br>disciples were executed themselves (not counting Judas, who killed<br>himself, and John who died in exile).<br><br>Look at what the Bible says in Paul's letter to the Hebrews:<br><br>> Others were tortured and refused to be released, so that they might<br>> gain a better resurrection. Some faced jeers and flogging, while still<br>> others were chained and put in prison. They were stoned; they were<br>> sawed in two; they were put to death by the sword. They went about in<br>> sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated---the<br>> world is not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains<br>> and in caves and holes in the ground. These were all commended for<br>> their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised. (v.<br>> 35-39).<br><br>So there's no indication that faith saves you from suffering. In fact,<br>it seems that the Bible is pretty clear that believers will suffer at<br>some point throughout their lives.<br><br>The point is not that God will spare you from suffering. The *Life<br>Application Bible* says this about that verse:<br><br>> Having a steadfast faith in God does not guarantee a happy, carefree<br>> life. On the contrary, our faith almost guarantees us some form of<br>> abuse from the world. While we are on earth, we may never see the<br>> purpose of our suffering. But we know that God will keep his promises<br>> to us.<br><br>That is the answer. While we are still alive, we may never know why<br>we are going through the suffering we are (or we may never know why God<br>allows others to suffer). But we do know that God keeps His promises,<br>and we know that He has good plans for us:<br><br>> "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to<br>> prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."<br>> --- Jeremiah 29:11 NIV<br><br>We may never have answers for why we suffer during this life. In fact,<br>we may never know the answers to those questions until the day we can<br>ask Him face to face. But we know that He loves us and He has a good<br>plan for us, even if we don't know what that plan is.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
