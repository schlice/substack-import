<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why do Trump fans care so much about whether Hillary broke the law but<br>not seem to want to find out if Russia helped Trump steal the<br>election?**<br><br>*We know that Hillary broke the law, and no one seems to care.* We know<br>that Hillary met all the elements of crimes under the Espionage Act by<br>sending classified email using an unclassified email system. We know<br>that the contents of those emails was leaked. There does not need to be<br>intent in order to violate the Espionage Act. Comey inserted intent<br>where the law does not require intent.<br><br>In contrast, *we have yet to see any proof that anything at all illegal<br>took place between Trump and the Russians, and yet we seem to be<br>scrambling to look under every rock to try to find something*. We know<br>that Trump's transition team spoke with many foreign countries, but that<br>was after the election was won. There is, as of yet, not a single shred<br>of proof that anyone from Trump's team asked the Russians to do anything<br>at all to swing the election in Trump's favor. There's no proof that the<br>Russians did anything that actually *could* have swung the election in<br>Trump's favor. There was no vote tampering. There was no voter<br>suppression; this much has been confirmed by the states. Everyone was<br>able to vote, and everyone voted their consciences. So the only thing<br>the Russians could have "hacked" is the mind of the American voter, and<br>that's not illegal (yet). In theory, if Trump used campaign money to<br>finance Russian efforts to swing the election in his favor, this may<br>have violated campaign finance rules.<br><br>Kinda like the way the DNC used campaign money to finance the anti-Trump<br>dossier fabricated by Fusion GPS, but again, we're talking about Trump<br>here, not Hillary's crimes...sorry, I keep getting off track.<br><br>At this point, it's clear that the election was not "stolen." The<br>fact that we have not yet gotten past this point is beginning to show a<br>desperation on the part of Democrats to steadfastly refuse to believe<br>the fact that they had a terrible candidate that a soppy dish sponge<br>could have beaten by a wider margin than Trump took. The election was<br>not stolen. Period. Did Trump do something illegal? Highly doubtful, as<br>*he didn't need to*.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
