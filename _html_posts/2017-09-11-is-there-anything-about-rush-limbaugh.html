<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Wow. Before you comment about something you think you heard from someone<br>else, check the original source.<br><br>You probably won't hear this from anyone in the news media, because they<br>are part of the problem.<br><br>Anyway, nothing of the sort happened. At. All. But the Drive-By Media<br>decided to spin this as "Rush wants people to die" because he doesn't<br>think like them. He's the biggest name in media who doesn't follow the<br>media's party line.<br><br>So here's Rush<br>[talking(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4b4b68&url=https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2017/09/11/one-of-the-greatest-smears-of-my-career1/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="rushlimbaugh.com"}]{.qlink_container} about this<br>"controversy" (emphasis mine):<br><br>> I'm observing something that is phenomenal to me. The original<br>> forecast tracks of Hurricane Irma... Let me... We've got Dittocam<br>> here, right? Let me find this for you. I want to find the original<br>> tracks.<br>><br>> I want you to look at these original tracks here. (shows image) You<br>> see that? Now, if you look at the state of Florida, on your right of<br>> the state of Florida is where everybody thought this hurricane was<br>> gonna go for a week. A week! Before they changed their minds. See, all<br>> of those models taking this hurricane, Hurricane Irma, out to the<br>> Atlantic Ocean, maybe up to North Carolina and South Carolina? Those<br>> are the original tracks, and it was during those forecasts that, in<br>> south Florida, \a\ run on bottled water began to the point that<br>> there was no bottled water in south Florida while the forecast track<br>> looks as you see to the right or east of Florida there.<br>><br>> :::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>> ::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>> !(images/qimg-22b41ebcd48e84dbd495e519cdf8af71){.landscape<br>> .qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>> master_src="images/qimg-22b41ebcd48e84dbd495e519cdf8af71"<br>> master_w="650" master_h="310"}<br>> :::<br>> ::::<br>><br>> Well, now, I'm a social commentator as well as a political commentator<br>> and I found that fascinating. "How can there be a run on water with a<br>> hurricane forecast that's not even expected to hit us?" Now, granted,<br>> these are long range, but there's a lot of them. The vast majority<br>> of... Look at it again. The vast majority of those models --- and<br>> included in there is the NHC, the real track. You can dig it out<br>> there. I can't get close here, but you can dig it out, the real track<br>> that went up the west coast of Florida.<br>><br>> By the way, it didn't hit Tampa. All night last night it was gonna<br>> wreck Tampa, was gonna ruin Tampa. I was watching it. It wasn't gonna<br>> go to Tampa. It did go to Marco Island and Naples.<br>><br>> Anyway, during all of this, there's a run on bottled water to the<br>> point that in West Palm Beach a semitrailer delivery of bottled water<br>> to a grocery store had to be protected by local police for fear that<br>> people would show up and try to rob or steal. I'm saying, "Why is this<br>> happening when this hurricane isn't even gonna hit here, at least<br>> according to these forecasts?"<br>><br>> So I explained how the world works. I explained how local media seeks<br>> to hype these storms 'cause it's good for ratings, and it's also good<br>> for grocery stores and advertisers that sell things you need during a<br>> hurricane.<br>><br>> Meanwhile, the forecast tracks don't have it anywhere near. They got<br>> closer and closer and closer during the 10 days, or maybe it was a<br>> week, and then I suggested, "Folks, there's no reason to panic. You<br>> have water in your house right now. It's called a faucet. All you have<br>> to do is go get some empty bottles and fill 'em up, and there's your<br>> water. And in many cases it's the same stuff that you're gonna buy in<br>> the bottles, and it's gonna be a lot cheaper. So you can get some<br>> Ziploc bags, fill 'em 75% full, put them in the freezer as a standby."<br>> It's smart advice, reasonable advice, economical advice. **Never did I<br>> say the hurricane wasn't gonna hit, because nobody knows. Never did I<br>> say the hurricane was not a bad one. Never did I say you should ignore<br>> the forecast. Never!**<br>><br>> Nothing that is out there that I supposed said on social media is true<br>> --- and I defy any of you SJWs to call here and run by anything you've<br>> heard that I said, and let me explain the truth to you. 800-282-2882.<br>> This is a series of lies and misstatements, and this is because I do<br>> not heel. I do not join everybody in the conventional wisdom, the<br>> consensus and the groupthink. I did not join in the panic. I did not<br>> join in helpless wailing and, "Oh, woe is me!" I did not join in any<br>> of the things --- and I specifically didn't join the idea that global<br>> warming or climate change was causing this.<br>><br>> I also pointed out that whenever a storm like this happens, you can't<br>> avoid it; in the media people are gonna say it's happening because of<br>> climate change. It's stronger than ever because of climate change.<br>> This is the seventh largest hurricane to hit Florida. The hurricane in<br>> 1935, Labor Day, was much stronger than Hurricane Irma. That's before<br>> anybody knew about CO2 and the greenhouse effect and climate change.<br>><br>> Shouldn't the hurricanes today be far worse than ever if what they're<br>> saying is true? You're not supposed to think this way, folks, and<br>> you're not supposed to ask that question. You're not supposed to give<br>> people an alternative way of looking at something outside the<br>> groupthink. If you do, they're gonna come after you and try to destroy<br>> your credibility and smear you, because they have an agenda that they<br>> seek to advance using every public event they can.<br>><br>> BREAK TRANSCRIPT<br>><br>> RUSH: Now, ladies and gentlemen, this smear (chuckles) of me... This<br>> smear is unlike most of the previous attempts that the left has made,<br>> because there isn't even a misunderstood joke to base this on. There's<br>> no insult to anybody to base this on. This has been based on a<br>> complete fabrication and intentional misrepresentation of what I said.<br>> I never said the hurricane was fake news. I never said it wasn't gonna<br>> be big. I never said to ignore the forecast.<br>><br>> I [[never said anything that you have heard Al<br>> Roker](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=40b3f8&url=https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2017/09/06/i-never-ever-said-the-hurricane-was-fake-news-drive-bys/){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="rushlimbaugh.com"}]{.qlink_container} or anybody else in<br>> the Drive-By Media saying. But because I don't subscribe to the<br>> groupthink, because I don't subscribe to the consensus, they think I<br>> don't care --- and when you don't care, why, that's the greatest sin<br>> of all, and that's what they think is going on, which gives them the<br>> justification. But I wanted to deal with this, folks, because this is<br>> the \worst\ example of a smear that I have experienced yet.<br>><br>> BREAK TRANSCRIPT<br>><br>> RUSH: You know what is stunning, folks? The degree to which lies and<br>> disinformation have become commonplace in the Drive-By Media. It's<br>> stunning to me how many people actually believe that hurricanes are a<br>> recent phenomenon brought about by man-made climate change. If you're<br>> a Millennial or an iGen --- if you're under 34 --- it is shocking what<br>> you don't know. It's shocking the lies that you have been taught and<br>> the lies that you see as factual news each and every day. It's<br>> stunning, folks. Literally stunning.<br><br>Fake news run amok. I am continually surprised at the level of fake news<br>that is making headlines and truly influencing ordinary Americans.<br><br>So to answer your specific question: **No, nothing Rush Limbaugh said<br>even comes close to the very narrow exceptions carved out of the First<br>Amendment.** He did not incite anyone to violence. There was no libel or<br>slander: there was no knowing misrepresentation of the truth (the truth,<br>at the time, were the predicted hurricane tracks all over the map, and<br>while they didn't want to hear it, he was right about that).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
