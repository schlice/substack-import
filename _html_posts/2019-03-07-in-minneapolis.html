<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In Minneapolis \"photo cop\" traffic cameras have been ruled<br>unconstitutional (MN constitution) because you can\'t prove/show who<br>exactly was driving. Why aren\'t they unconstitutional in the rest of<br>the U.S. as well?**<br><br>Presumably, this is because other state constitutions don't positively<br>require the driver to be identified before a citation can be issued.<br><br>In other states, it may be that you can get the ticket thrown out if you<br>can positively prove that you were *not* the driver. For example, in<br>Colorado, if the photo shows a woman driving and the vehicle is owned by<br>a man, the ticket can be tossed.<br><br>Also, in other states, citations from red light cameras do not impact<br>your driving record in any way. No points are assessed on your license;<br>they don't show up on your insurance, etc. But if you don't pay them,<br>they go to collections and can negatively impact your credit.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
