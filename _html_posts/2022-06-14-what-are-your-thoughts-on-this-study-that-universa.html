If we would have had universal health care, the study<br>suggests, these comorbidities would have been managed because people<br>would have been able to afford to go to the doctor. And if those<br>comorbidities were managed better, then those people (when they<br>contracted COVID) wouldn't have died.<br><br>It's an interesting line of logic. But it just goes to prove that the<br>way to save lives during COVID was to protect those with comorbidities.<br>**Which is precisely what the "marginalized" health experts (and<br>Conservatives) were saying.**<br><br>In other words, what this study should be saying is that **you should<br>have listened to the other health experts** and you should have<br>**targeted your protection towards people who had pre-existing health<br>conditions**, and left the healthy to leave their homes and run their<br>businesses. Instead, the heavy-handed approach we did take has left the<br>economy in shambles, and combined with politics and<br>politically-motivated policies, have left us with supply chain<br>nightmares which will take years to undo, and are pushing us toward the<br>edge of an economic recession...<br><br>...which will ultimately cost more lives.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What are your thoughts on this study that [[Universal Health Care Could<br>Have Saved More Than 330,000 U.S. Lives during<br>COVID](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ffdc4c&url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/universal-health-care-could-have-saved-more-than-330-000-u-s-lives-during-covid/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="scientificamerican.com"}]{.qlink_container}?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
