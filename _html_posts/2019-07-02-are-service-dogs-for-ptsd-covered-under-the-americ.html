<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>in order to qualify as a service dog, a dog has to be trained to treat a<br>specific condition caused by a recognized disability. PTSD is a<br>recognized disability. A dog specifically trained to treat a condition<br>caused by PTSD qualifies as a service dog under ADA.<br><br>Business owners can ask you whether or not your dog is trained to treat<br>a specific condition caused by a recognized disability, and what the dog<br>is trained to do. That\'s all they\'re allowed to ask you. Your dog does<br>not need any papers, it doesn\'t need to wear a special harness, or<br>anything. You'll see lots of dogs wearing vests; a vest does not make a<br>dog a service animal. I also see emotional support animals wearing<br>vests; this also does not make them acceptable under ADA. The dog must<br>be trained to treat a specific condition caused by a recognized<br>disability.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
