<br><br><h2>Space Submission</h2><br><div><br><br>Space name: Everything Republican<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm not supposed to reveal this information. In fact, I could be<br>executed simply for confirming that Trump's Orders™ actually exist.<br><br>But the truth is that Trump orders all Republicans to believe everything<br>that he, the Great Leader, says. We must deny that any tax evasion took<br>place, even if evidence is provided. And if it is, we are to claim that<br>it is FAKE NEWS. We must proclaim that Trump was the Best President<br>Ever,™ even better than Lincoln or Washington.<br><br>Trump actually ordered Elon Musk to embed Republican monitoring software<br>into Twitter, so the Great Leader can see what we say about him on every<br>platform we use on our phones. I've heard some others saying (in hushed<br>voices so that the Great Leader doesn't catch on) that he can hear what<br>we say through our phones, *even if we're not in a phone call.*<br><br>I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to get you information. I'm<br>sure they're coming for me as I write this. Somehow, the Great Leader<br>seems to know everything I type before I type it...<br><br>So let me just say this really quickly right now: if it is learned over<br>the next few days that I "committed suicide," I DIDN'T COMMIT SUICIDE! I<br>WAS MURDERED BY THE TRUMP HIT SQUAD! TELL THE WORLD OF MY CAUTIONARY<br>TALE!!!<br><br>/s<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
