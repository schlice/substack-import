<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Has anyone found anything besides steroids to be helpful for symptoms<br>that return between doses (imbalance, motor skill deficits, vision,<br>etc)? My daughter may need to postpone her infusion a 2nd time (illness)<br>but has some of these issues.**<br><br>MS is called the "Great Imitator" because every symptom associated with<br>the disease is also associated with some other disease or condition; no<br>condition can be caused only by MS. In other words, balance issues can<br>be caused by MS, but they can also be caused by inner ear issues (middle<br>ear inflammation and benign tumors of the acoustic nerve that connects<br>the ear and the brain). Vision issues can be caused by MS, or they can<br>be caused by other neuropathies as well.<br><br>Treatments for the symptoms of MS are similarly related to other disease<br>paths that share the same symptoms. For example, balance issues are<br>treated in the same way for someone with an inner ear problem as they<br>are for someone with MS. Occupational therapy can help with balance<br>issues, and some medications which are used to treat motion sickness can<br>also be prescribed for balance issues or vertigo.<br><br>It's important to talk with your neurologist about all of your symptoms<br>so that you can come up with effective treatments to ease them. There<br>are treatments available for all of these symptoms, so the quicker you<br>can get in to discuss them with your doctor, the sooner you can start to<br>experience some relief.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
