<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is a digital photo copy of a driver\'s license acceptable as ID for<br>someone at a concert or festival who is not drinking or driving?**<br><br>A very small handful of states are testing out electronic driver's<br>licenses. The process is lengthy and requires that not only the state<br>provide a valid electronic license, but that the people within the state<br>required to accept them have the requisite technology to do so. It's a<br>very slow process and it's only in its pilot stages in a few states.<br><br>Which means that as far as identification goes, electronic licenses (and<br>I'm talking about approved electronic licenses, not a picture of a<br>license) still have a long way to go before they would be accepted as a<br>valid form of ID.<br><br>In general, a picture of a license is not a valid form of ID. To be<br>fair, it's really up to the venue to decide if they'd accept a picture<br>of a license as a valid form of ID, but because PhotoShop, there's<br>virtually no way that any venue in its right mind would accept a picture<br>of a license as a valid form of ID.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
