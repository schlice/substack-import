<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This was crossposted in the Republican space, which really doesn't make<br>any sense, but as a conservative, let me see if I can take a swing at<br>this. An actual, honest assessment of someone who should remain a<br>Democrat in 2025.<br><br>The main reason to continue to be a Democrat in 2025 is if you believe<br>that the answer to the nation's problems is *more government*.<br><br>If you believe that the only thing that will bring America back into<br>economic stability and peace is by adding more government oversight, not<br>less, you should continue to be a Democrat.<br><br>If you believe that expanding the bureaucratic state is beneficial for<br>the largest amount of people in the country, you should continue to be a<br>Democrat.<br><br>If you believe the Constitution is a "living document" and should be<br>interpreted based on the "common view of the day," you should continue<br>to be a Democrat.<br><br>If you think that the government should have broad authority into most<br>areas of your life, because "why not, I have nothing to hide" and it<br>would stop the crazies (whoever they may be), then the Democratic Party<br>is for you.<br><br>If you think that the government should control prices on goods because<br>of "evil corporations" who are only out to line their own pockets, then<br>the Democratic party is for you.<br><br>If you believe that the government should silence people who try to<br>spread "disinformation" on social media, and that we should expand the<br>use of "fact checkers" to make sure that people only spread "real"<br>information, then you should continue to be a Democrat.<br><br>If you believe that the National Guard has obviated the need for anyone<br>outside of the government (military, police, or National Guard) to keep<br>or bear arms, then the Democratic Party is for you.<br><br>If you believe that religion belongs confined to the inside of the four<br>walls of whatever church building you choose to attend (if you want to<br>continue to waste your time on such ancient and backwards thinking), and<br>if you believe that if you run a business, you can never allow your<br>religion to influence how you do business in the public square, then the<br>Democratic Party is for you.<br><br>I think this is a fair assessment based on how conservatives view those<br>who should remain Democrats.<br><br>(EDIT) As I'm seeing comments, I'm thinking of other things that<br>separate the parties. Here's another:<br><br>If you believe that America is *fundamentally evil*, that its founding<br>documents and our nation's laws and systems of government were founded<br>specifically to create a white supremacist nation, and that there is no<br>way for there to ever be equity in this country unless the government<br>creates and enforces that equity, then you should continue to be a<br>Democrat.<br><br>Similarly, if you don't believe in American exceptionalism, or if<br>hearing that term causes you to blanch, then you probably should<br>continue to be a Democrat. If you don't think America is exceptional, if<br>you don't think America was ever great to begin with, we shouldn't<br>strive to make America great, and America can never be great unless we<br>rip it out by the roots and start again, then the Democratic Party is<br>for you. In other words, if you don't think that America truly was<br>founded in 1776, but was instead founded in 1619, then you should<br>probably continue to be a Democrat.<br><br>\<br><br>(EDIT 2) By the way, if you are Republican and some of these ideas<br>resonate with you, *that's okay!* Let's talk about it! Let's discuss<br>what about these ideas you like. Let's discuss the Constitution. Let's<br>discuss things *respectfully.* We don't need to agree on everything.<br>That's good and healthy. Having healthy debate and dialogue is vital to<br>the free exchange of ideas. We're never going to agree on everything.<br>Patton said, "If everyone is thinking alike, then someone isn't<br>thinking." Groupthink gets you nowhere, because there is no room for<br>critical thinking when there is no free exchange of ideas.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
