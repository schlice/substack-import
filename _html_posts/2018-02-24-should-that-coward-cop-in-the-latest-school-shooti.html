<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>And what part of his job did he fail to do? What law did he violate?<br><br>It appears the problem here is that you are gleefully unaware of what<br>his actual job is.<br><br>I challenge you to find a police officer job description which reads,<br>\"Gets killed when necessary.". Police officers are under no obligation<br>to get themselves killed while attempting to enforce the law.<br><br>Additionally, we don\'t know the particular rules in this department for<br>active shooter situations. This officer was alone and outgunned. Going<br>into that school alone would have been suicide. And his department may<br>have expressly forbid a solo officer from entering an active shooter<br>situation without backup. He contained the situation, which met his<br>legal obligation for "doing his job."<br><br>Also, police officers are under no obligation to keep you safe. They<br>have a general duty to keep the public-at-large safe, but they have no<br>specific duty to keep any one individual or any group of people safe. If<br>you willingly enter a gun-free zone, it is the venue\'s responsibility<br>to keep you safe, not the police.<br><br>Finally, let me add this. Every police officer out there feels terrible<br>for this particular Deputy. We all know that cognitive dissonance when<br>you know that you can\'t make a difference, but you desperately want to.<br>This Deputy resigned days after this incident, which leads me to believe<br>that the cognitive dissonance was so debilitating, that he could no<br>longer do his job. The pressure and criticism from the uninformed, like<br>you, must have also been tremendous, and he will have to deal with that<br>for the rest of his life. We feel awful for the victims and their<br>families, but you must recognize that the deputy is a victim as well.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
