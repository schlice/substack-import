<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it illegal for an HOA to peek through your garage windows?<br><br>You need to review your Governing Documents, as despite what others have<br>said, the rules apply equally to renters and homeowners. Who is<br>responsible for paying for repairs may vary between renters and<br>homeowners, but renters are bound by the same rules of conduct as<br>homeowners. Additionally, HOAs can address both tenants and homeowners<br>separately; there is no requirement for HOAs to only address homeowners<br>and not tenants. If your HOA does not have a website where your<br>governing docs are posted, you will probably need to contact the<br>Managing Agent of your HOA in order to get copies.<br><br>The HOA may have a rule which allows them to inspect parking spaces<br>(i.e. garages) to ensure you can park a car in them.

Additionally, while<br>cities write ordinances granting broad authority to HOAs, this is<br>generally balanced by courts and judges who limit HOAs to the most<br>narrow interpretation of city ordinances imaginable. Also, judges know<br>the difference between rules (which are written and approved by the HOA<br>Board of Directors) and covenants (which are voted on by a plurality of<br>homeowners), and they hold covenants to a much higher regard than rules.<br><br>If there is no rule stipulating what can and cannot be done inside of a<br>garage, I would suggest talking to a real estate attorney in your area<br>who specializes in HOA law.
