<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can you unlock a Sprint SIM card so that you can hook up the phone<br>to another company?**<br><br>While most of the answers here are correct, they are missing the fact<br>that you must pay for the entire phone before it can be unlocked.<br><br>If you were in a contract, that contract must be fully paid before<br>Sprint will unlock the phone for you. If you had a Equipment Installment<br>Plan (EIP) to pay for your phone, it must be fully paid off.<br><br>To unlock the phone, contact Sprint Customer Service and they will<br>assist you. By law, if you own the phone, the carrier must unlock it for<br>you. The phone must be free of any contracts and completely paid off.<br><br>Based on the model of phone, it may not work on every other company's<br>network. It may only work on a few. Some Sprint phones (as [[Lars<br>Poulsen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Lars-Poulsen-2)]{.qlink_container}<br>mentioned) are CDMA, which means they will (possibly) only work on<br>Verizon's network. But there are even multiple bands of CDMA, and your<br>Sprint phone may not have the appropriate bands to work well on Verizon<br>in your area.<br><br>If you happen to have a Sprint phone with a SIM card, it may be GSM.<br>This means that it may work on AT&T or T-Mobile's networks. The same<br>restrictions about bands may hold true, so your mileage may vary when<br>taking a phone from one carrier to another.<br><br>Once you get the phone unlocked, you can bring it in to the new store<br>and they can help you determine if you can use it on the new network.<br><br>If you can't, don't panic. There are a few things you can do.<br><br>- Most carriers have a trade-in program which will give you a credit for<br>  a working phone you trade in when you get one of theirs. Granted, you<br>  probably won't get the full value of the phone when you do this, but<br>  it's the easiest way to use an old phone on a new network.<br>- You can independently sell the phone on eBay, or locally using apps<br>  like OfferUp or Letgo. You'll get a better price with the phone being<br>  unlocked, as you will be able to sell to a wider audience.<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
