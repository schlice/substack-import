In the index, 0 equals complete equality; all people<br>have exactly the same income. 1 equals complete inequality; all of the<br>wealth is held by one person and everyone else has none.<br><br>There is a positive correlation between a higher score in the Gini Index<br>(higher income inequality) and higher rates of violence in general. Note<br>that correlation does not equal causation, and no one is claiming that<br>rates of violence are directly tied to higher income inequality. It's<br>simply a correlation. We've noticed that in areas with higher rates of<br>crime, they also tend to rate higher on the Gini Index.<br><br>There is no direct correlation between a higher Gini Index rate and a<br>higher incidence of mass shootings.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
