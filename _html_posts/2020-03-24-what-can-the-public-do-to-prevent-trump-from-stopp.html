You can,<br>however, urge your state governor to ignore Trump's recommendations and<br>keep your state on lockdown. Remember, there is no "national lockdown."<br>They are all implemented at the state level.<br><br>But if you're personally worried that it's too soon: stay home. You're<br>guaranteed to not get sick if you don't come in contact with others. If<br>you feel unsafe going outside when the government says you can,<br>shelter-in-place until such time that you do feel safe again.<br><br>If you do have to go out, practice good social distancing, wash your<br>hands, don't touch your face, etc.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
