<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Also, what partially happened with Brexit was the "likely voters" issue.<br>Pollsters tend to contact people who are "likely voters," people who<br>have voted consistently in past elections, and who are registered. In<br>the Brexit vote, you had a large number of people show up who haven't<br>voted for anything in a long time.<br><br>Does Trump inspire people who have been out of the political system for<br>decades to get out and vote? Does he motivate people who haven't voted<br>to do so? We simply don't have any data to show that, but if we base it<br>on nothing more than the enthusiasm generated by Trump supporters, there<br>may be something to that argument.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Are-there-people-out-there-who-actually-think-that-Trump-might-win/answer/Chris-Everett<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
