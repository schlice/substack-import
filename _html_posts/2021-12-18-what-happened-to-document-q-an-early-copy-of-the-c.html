<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The "Q Source" (or the Q Document or the Document of Q) is part of the<br>"two-source hypothesis" which has been debated but never proven<br>regarding the Gospels of Matthew and Luke.<br><br>> The case for Q\'s existence follows from the argument that neither<br>> Matthew nor Luke is directly dependent on the other in the double<br>> tradition (defined by New Testament scholars as material that Matthew<br>> and Luke share that does not appear in Mark). However, the verbal<br>> agreement between Matthew and Luke is so close in some parts of the<br>> double tradition that the most reasonable explanation for this<br>> agreement is common dependence on a written source or<br>> sources.\[1\](#AyQuY){#cite-AyQuY .citation_link}<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-49aca61c9f67d73b88874dd0b4055bd9){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-49aca61c9f67d73b88874dd0b4055bd9" master_w="788"<br>master_h="921"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(By Alecmconroy - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, from* [[*Wikimedia<br>Commons*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=67181d&url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid%3D3158802){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikimedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br>You can see in the graphic how the Gospels of Matthew and Luke both use<br>elements of the Q Source, along with two other sources, called the [[M<br>Source](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=692cc0&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M_source){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} and the [[L<br>Source](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=02f050&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L_source){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, represented by green and<br>teal respectively.<br><br>But for as many arguments as exist for the existence of a Q Source,<br>there exist just as many *against* the idea of a Q Source:<br><br>> While the two-source hypothesis remains the most popular explanation<br>> for the synoptic gospels\' origins, the existence of the \"minor<br>> agreements\" has raised serious concerns. These minor agreements are<br>> those points where Matthew and Luke agree against or beyond Mark<br>> precisely within their Marcan verses (for example, the mocking<br>> question at the beating of Jesus, \"Who is it that struck you?\",<br>> found in both Matthew and Luke but not in Mark, although this \"minor<br>> agreement\" falls outside the usually accepted range of Q.) The<br>> \"minor agreements\" call into question the proposition that Matthew<br>> and Luke knew Mark but not each other, e.g. Luke might have indeed<br>> been following Matthew, or at least a Matthew-like source. Peabody and<br>> McNicol argue that until a reasonable explanation is found the<br>> two-source hypothesis is not viable.\[2\](#iLGjQ){#cite-iLGjQ<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>So at best, the Q Source is a *hypothesis* to explain how the two<br>Gospels are so closely related at some points.
