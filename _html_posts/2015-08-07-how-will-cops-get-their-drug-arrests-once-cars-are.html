<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Thanks for the A2A, and great question.\<br>\<br>Two things:\<br>1. \"most dope busts follow random vehicular felony stops\" is not<br>necessarily an accurate depiction of most dope busts, as it were.<br>Vehicular drug enforcement is accomplished through several measures, one<br>of which is random stops. In many circumstances, police know who they<br>are looking for, and they stop the appropriate vehicle with the<br>appropriate occupants in the appropriate area.\<br>\<br>2. Self-driving cars must still have a licensed driver in them, and<br>driver override of an automated system is always possible. So police can<br>approach and light up an auto-drive car, and the driver will be required<br>to take over and stop the car.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
