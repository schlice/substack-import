<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>God doesn't require worship. He doesn't need our worship. We don't need<br>to worship Him. We worship Him because He is worthy of worship. We<br>worship Him because of what He has done for us.<br><br>Regarding church attendance, the Bible talks about worshipping together:<br><br>> *not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing,<br>> but encouraging one another---and all the more as you see the Day<br>> approaching. --- Hebrews 10:25 NIV*<br><br>In the early church, people were avoiding meeting together, and the<br>author of Hebrews says that's not a good idea. We need the encouragement<br>of other believers, especially as we approach the end times.<br><br>Our friends at<br>[GotQuestions.org(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e4ff7d&url=http://GotQuestions.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container} talked about all the<br>reasons why we need to regularly attend church. Their list is so<br>exhaustive and comprehensive that I figured I'd just reproduce it here:<br><br>> Church is the place where believers can love one another (1 John<br>> 4:12), encourage one another (Hebrews 3:13), "spur" one another to<br>> love and good works (Hebrews 10:24), serve one another (Galatians<br>> 5:13), instruct one another (Romans 15:14), honor one another (Romans<br>> 12:10), and be kind and compassionate to one another (Ephesians 4:32).<br>><br>> When a person trusts Jesus Christ for salvation, he or she is made a<br>> member of the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:27). For a church body<br>> to function properly, all of its "body parts" need to be present and<br>> working (1 Corinthians 12:14--20). It's not enough to just attend a<br>> church; we should be involved in some type of ministry to others,<br>> using the spiritual gifts God has given us (Ephesians 4:11--13). A<br>> believer will never reach full spiritual maturity without having that<br>> outlet for his gifts, and we all need the assistance and encouragement<br>> of other believers (1 Corinthians<br>> 12:21--26).\[1\](#WWxDR){#cite-WWxDR .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-WWxDR){.citation_index} [[Why is church attendance / going<br>to church<br>important?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4a32d7&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/church-attendance.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
