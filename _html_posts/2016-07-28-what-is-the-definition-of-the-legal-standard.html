<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Negligence is a failure to exercise reasonable care.<br><br>Gross negligence is a conscious and voluntary disregard for the need<br>to exercise reasonable care, and which usually results in grave harm to<br>people or property.<br><br>Both terms arise from a failure to exercise reasonable care, but simple<br>negligence can be due to unconscious (or accidental) failure to exercise<br>reasonable care, where gross negligence generally implies conscious (or<br>intentional) disregard for the need to exercise reasonable care. Gross<br>negligence is conscious indifference to, or the complete disregard for,<br>reasonably foreseeable consequences which would arise from the failure<br>to exercise reasonable care.<br><br>Note also that gross negligence is less severe than willful or wanton<br>misconduct, which is conscious or intentional disregard for laws or<br>rules with full knowledge that such disregard usually results in grave<br>harm to people or property. Findings of willful or wanton misconduct<br>have the ability to result in punitive damages, where gross misconduct<br>usually does not.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
