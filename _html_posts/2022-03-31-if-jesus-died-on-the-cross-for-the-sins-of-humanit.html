<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>They already do.<br><br>It doesn't cost you anything to gain your salvation. Jesus is literally<br>standing there, holding a gift in front of you.<br><br>*All you have to do is take it*.<br><br>Even when someone offers you a gift, *you still have to take it*. There<br>is some action required on your part to accept the gift Jesus gave you.<br>But, to your point, it's *free*. It literally costs you nothing.<br><br>To accept the gift, you have to do two things: repent and<br>believe.<br><br>Repentance is a "turning away" from our sins. It's recognizing what<br>you've done, turning away from those actions, and asking Jesus to<br>forgive you.<br><br>Then, you need to believe that Jesus is your savior, who died on the<br>cross to take the punishment for your sins, that you deserve. He did<br>this *willingly*, no one made him do it.<br><br>*But shouldn't everyone just "get" the free pass? Why do they have to do<br>something?*<br><br>God gave us something else when he created us: free will. We have the<br>freedom to either accept his gift, or reject it. He will never force<br>you, for love can only be given freely, it cannot be coerced.<br><br>He left enough evidence in this world of his existence for anyone<br>willing to believe in him, but he also left enough ambiguity so as to<br>not compel the unwilling. Understand that this wasn't a mistake; he did<br>this intentionally. You must accept him freely. *You must be willing to<br>reach out and take the gift.* It will not be forced on you; you will not<br>get the gift without willingly accepting it.<br><br>\<br><br>To be fair though, there might be a cost to accepting your salvation.<br>Because once you're saved, your life will change. The old ways of<br>thinking will fade away. Desires for sinful things will fade. Your<br>desires will change; your thoughts will change; your actions will<br>change. Depending on how you lived before, the things you spent your<br>time on, the friends you spent your time with, and the thoughts you<br>spent your day thinking, may change. In short, it is possible that *your<br>entire life* may change. This is the impetus for the phrase: *salvation<br>is free, but it could cost you your life.*<br><br>But considering the eternal consequences, it is literally *the best gift<br>that anyone has ever given to anyone else in the history of the world,*<br>and it's yours.<br><br>For free.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If Jesus died on the cross for the sins of humanity, wouldn\'t everyone<br>have a free pass into heaven?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
