<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is an absolutely fantastic question! If you are truly seeking to<br>understand this answer, you can address many of the questions that<br>modern-day atheists love to trot out against Christianity. These are<br>things like "God is evil," "God can't even hold to His own standards,"<br>and the one that I love, "God is a murderer."<br><br>So let's answer a few of these questions together, like "Does the Bible<br>endorse slavery?" and "Is God a murderer for killing people?" and see if<br>we can understand these questions, how apologists answer these<br>questions, and maybe draw some inductive conclusions about how we<br>reconcile modern ethical standards against historical texts.<br><br>Before we get into the specifics, it's important to understand that<br>you've basically answered part of the first question within your<br>question: **you cannot judge historical societies through a modern<br>lens.** Our standards are far different than the standards which existed<br>2000 years ago. In just one example, slavery was a fact of life 2000<br>years ago. Taking conquered people as slaves was common. Selling<br>yourself into indentured servitude was common also. Today, those things<br>are quite abhorrent to the modern-day person, but back then, those<br>things were culturally acceptable, and even considered quite normal.<br>Expecting the Bible to do something it was never intended to do is a<br>fault of the reader, not the Bible.<br><br>We can expound on these ideas by looking more closely at some of the<br>most common objections that modern readers have to what they<br>uncritically read in the Bible.<br><br>\<br><br>The Bible endorses slavery.<br><br>This is a common misunderstanding of the fact that the Bible does not<br>outright *condemn* slavery. That's really hard for the modern man to<br>accept.<br><br>Besides what we've already discussed regarding the lens though which we<br>view history, we should go further. Modern people (especially people in<br>the United States, where slavery was officially abolished in the 1800s)<br>tend to think of slavery as a thing which happened in the *past*, but<br>this is far from the truth. Slavery still exists today, and worldwide,<br>slavery (specifically chattel slavery, involuntary servitude) has<br>*grown* since the US abolished slavery. Today, it is estimated that over<br>27 million people in the world are subject to slavery (i.e. forced<br>labor, sex trade, inheritable property, etc).<br><br>Also, while not immediately condemning slavery, what it *does* do is put<br>guardrails around slavery. It provides rules for Hebrews to follow<br>when it comes to the treatment of slaves. These rules for slaves and<br>slaveowners were *revolutionary* for the time. You must treat your<br>slaves as if they are your family??? Scandalous! Exodus 21 even gives<br>more "scandalous" rules for how Hebrews are to treat their slaves, such<br>as the right to keep a wife (verse 3), the right not to be sold to<br>foreigners (verse 8), the right to be adopted into a family by marriage<br>(verse 9), and the right to food and clothing (verse 10). The law also<br>limited masters in their use of corporal punishment (verses 20, 26--27).<br><br>Additionally, we need to recognize that the Bible was not written to<br>effect *political* change. The Bible was written to effect *individual<br>change*, and then those changed people go on to make social and<br>political change. Indeed, in nations where Christianity spread and took<br>firm hold, slavery was brought to an end through the efforts of those<br>newly-saved Christians. The seeds of change needed to end slavery are<br>already in the Bible: the truth that all men are created by God and made<br>in His image (Genesis 1:27), the condemnation of those who kidnap and<br>sell a person (Exodus 21:16; cf. 1 Timothy 1:8--10), and that a slave<br>can truly be "a brother in the Lord" (Philemon 1:16).<br><br>So when people deny the Bible because it doesn't immediately demand the<br>cessation of every ingrained, centuries-old sinful custom of the day, we<br>can rest assured that the Bible prefers to change people, and they go on<br>to change others. *Changed people change people.*<br><br>\<br><br>God is a murderer<br><br>This is another little tidbit of cognitive dissonance which is very<br>easily defeated logically, but one which confounds the human heart.<br>People will see passages in the Bible about the armies of the Israelites<br>slaughtering entire cities full of women and children and conclude that<br>God kills "innocent people," or even when God sent the Flood to destroy<br>all of the people in the world except Noah and his family. Surely some<br>of those deaths could be considered murder, no?<br><br>The logical argument made by apologists is an easy one to make:<br>*ground your morality*. By what moral standard do you judge God and<br>find Him lacking? What moral standard is God subjected to, which you can<br>show that He knowingly violated? They can never do it. This is the one<br>question which atheists cannot answer. There is no moral standard higher<br>than God, as there is no standard above God. *God is the standard*.<br>Therefore, if God does it, it is *de facto* moral.<br><br>*But what about all the dead people?* *Doesn't that make God a<br>murderer?*<br><br>First, we must recognize that there is a difference between *killing*<br>and *murder*. Legally speaking, *homicide* is defined as "the taking of<br>a human life." It doesn't talk about the justification of that taking.<br>Some homicides have valid reasons, and we would characterize those as<br>"justifiable homicide." But in the realm of "unjustifiable homicide," we<br>find crimes like *manslaughter* and *murder*.<br><br>So we can see, right off the bat, we see that *murder* is minimally<br>defined as "homicide which is not justified" (along with some other<br>legal qualifications). So does God commit murder? Since murder means<br>that the homicide is done without justification, can we point to a time<br>when God took a life without justification? In analyzing the Bible, we<br>find that we cannot. God had already judged every single person who He<br>killed, or who He had others kill on His behalf.<br><br>*Even the people in Deuternonmy, when God ordered the armies of Israel<br>to destroy whole cities, and all those women and children? Weren't they<br>innocent?*<br><br>Actually, no, they were not. Nowhere in Scripture can we find where God<br>killed "innocent" people. In fact, compared to God's holiness, there is<br>no such thing as an "innocent" person. All have sinned (Romans 3:23),<br>and the penalty for sin is death (Romans 6:23a). God has "just cause" to<br>wipe us all out; the fact that He doesn't is proof of His mercy.<br><br>*But what about the whole world in the Flood? God literally judged every<br>single person? You're saying no one was innocent?*<br><br>Well, yes. The Bible makes that clear:<br><br>> *The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and<br>> that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil<br>> continually. \-- Genesis 6:5 ESV*<br><br>The bottom line about death: every person dies in God's own time<br>(Hebrews 9:27; Genesis 3:19). Jesus holds the keys of death (Revelation<br>1:18). Does the fact that everyone experiences physical death make God a<br>*killer*? In the sense that He could prevent all death, yes. He allows<br>us to die. And in the sense that He does cause some people who have<br>sinned to be killed, yes. But does that make Him a *murderer*. Not at<br>all; God is no *murderer.* Death is part of the human experience because<br>we brought it into the world ourselves (Romans 5:12). One day, as John<br>Donne put it, "Death shall be no more; death, thou shalt die." God, in<br>His grace, has conquered death for those who are in Christ, and one day<br>that truth will be fully realized: "The last enemy to be subdued and<br>abolished is death" (1 Corinthians 15:26).<br><br>\<br><br>Hopefully this was helpful in understanding the truth behind some things<br>which confuse humans because we possess limited human minds, and God's<br>mind is infinite.<br><br>> *For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,<br>> declares the LORD. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so<br>> are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.<br>> \-- Isaiah 55:8--9 ESV*<br><br>We should always keep in mind that when we study the Bible, we must<br>interpret it as the people of its time would have interpreted it.<br>Understanding the real meaning of the Bible includes using the right<br>"lenses" to look through while we read it. Using modern-day "lenses" to<br>view the Bible always results in a distorted view of its truth.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
