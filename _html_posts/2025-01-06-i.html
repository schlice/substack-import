<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The *illegal* part.<br><br>Legal immigration is great. We love it! More people should immigrate to<br>the United States.<br><br>Illegal immigration is terrible. If your first act after entering<br>the new country you intend to live in is to break its laws, you're not<br>really doing anyone any favors.<br><br>Now, that's not to say that our legal immigration system is perfect; it<br>is not. We have a lot of work to do to improve our immigration system.<br>How we vet new immigrants, and the amounts we allow to naturalize, is<br>insanely poor. We have a lot of work to do to untie the red tape<br>surrounding our immigration and naturalization system. It is very, very<br>broken, but not beyond fixing.<br><br>HOWEVER, just because our immigration system is broken ***is not an<br>excuse to break the law to become a citizen.*** Plenty of people still<br>immigrate to this country legally every year. They legally become US<br>citizens. I've seen it. If you've never been to a swearing-in ceremony,<br>then it's probably because you didn't know someone who was naturalizing.<br>But I've seen it and it is beautiful. We as a country absolutely want<br>that.<br><br>What we DON'T want is people "jumping the line" and thinking that<br>they will be accepted. Nope, deported back to your country. Get in line<br>with everyone else.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
