<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [What legal benefits (or legal restrictions) are placed on<br>a website based on its Top-Level Domain (TLD)?\<br>\<br>To the best of my knowledge, the TLD was, at best, a way to classify<br>websites based on the type of content served there:\<br>\<br>.com: Commercial (for-profit) websites\<br>.org: Not-for profit organizations\<br>.gov: Government websites (restricted to government only)\<br>.edu: Educational websites\<br>.net: Network service providers\<br>.mil: Military organizations (restricted to military only)\<br>\<br>When registration restrictions were lifted in the early 90s, any<br>organization could apply for registration in any of the TLDs. There are<br>no legal implications of being registered in any TLD. There are some<br>restrictions as to who can register for certain TLDs, but for the most<br>part, anyone can register in any of the TLDs.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
