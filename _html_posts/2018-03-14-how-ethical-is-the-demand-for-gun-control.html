<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We should separate the two questions that most people here are<br>conflating:<br><br>- How ethical is gun control<br>- How ethical is it to demand gun control, or how ethical is it to ask<br>  the question about demanding gun control<br><br>The second bullet is directed at the person asking the question. It is<br>entirely ethical to ask the question. It would be unethical to attempt<br>to prevent someone from asking the question. The ethics of asking the<br>question is not at issue. Even if your motive for asking the question is<br>morally suspect in the first place, the actual asking of the question is<br>not unethical.<br><br>The first bullet is directed at the concept: is gun control, as a<br>concept, ethical? Assuming you base your ethical standards on the<br>foundation of the nation, then by that metric, gun control itself is<br>unethical. The nation was based on the natural law as written about by<br>Blackstone and others. Natural law is derived from natural rights, which<br>are assumed to be rights which exist because you are human. No one gives<br>you those rights, therefore no one can take those rights away. One of<br>the natural rights humans have is a right to self-defense. Therefore,<br>anything that you do which inhibits a natural right is *prima facie*<br>unethical.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
