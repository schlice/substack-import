<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [As the other posters alluded to, Ampyra is a medicine, the<br/>first of its kind, designed specifically to treat a symptom of MS; that<br/>is, foot drop. Ampyra is an option for people who experience moderate to<br/>severe foot drop, and it does not work for everyone as Christine<br/>attested to. However, it is a relatively new treatment for MS foot<br/>drop.\<br/>\<br/>Several MS medications have fairly recently been approved, such as<br/>fingolimod (marketed as Gilenya), which is an oral MS medication, the<br/>first to be approved. More oral medications for MS are in the approval<br/>pipeline today.\<br/>\<br/>Also recently, Tysabri (natalizumab) was approved for use, but under<br/>strict prescribing guidelines due to its propensity to cause PML<br/>(progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), a rare but often fatal<br/>viral disease. Tysabri is used to treat MS and Chron\'s disease, and it<br/>is believed to work by preventing inflammatory immune cells to pass<br/>through the cell layers of the intestines and the blood-brain barrier.<br/>Tysabri has proven effective in slowing relapse rates, improving<br/>cognitive function, and preventing vision loss. In clinical trials,<br/>Tysabri was shown to reduce relapses by 68% vs. placebo, which is the<br/>highest relapse reduction rate of any of the approved MS therapies.\<br/>\<br/>The use of LDN (low-dose naltrexone) in MS patients continues, but has<br/>not yet been supported by clinical trials of any large scale. There is<br/>much anecdotal evidence to support its use, but there is not enough<br/>evidence in terms of rigorous study to show that LDN is effective, or<br/>even safe. Any use of the drug would be \"off-label\" and doing so would<br/>be considered an \"unproven treatment\" which should not be used in<br/>place of proven, approved therapies.]<br/><br/>*Disclaimer:*<br/><br/>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br/>substitute for professional medical advice.
