<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My neighbors keep calling the cops and the police have shown up and<br>dismiss the complaint every time. What actions can I take?**<br><br>There are several, but they all begin, like [[Victor<br>Marquez](https://www.quora.com/profile/Victor-Marquez-20)]{.qlink_container}<br>said, with documentation.<br><br>Keep a record of every one of those calls. Record all the details, as<br>well as the disposition of those calls.<br><br>Once you have that record, you can go in a number of directions. You can<br>contact the police department and have them investigate whether or not<br>charges of misuse of the 911 system are in order. Here in Florida,<br>misuse of 911 is a first-degree misdemeanor punishable by up to a \$1000<br>fine and up to one year in jail for the first four offenses. A fifth or<br>subsequent offense are charged as third-degree felonies with penalties<br>up to \$5000 and up to five years in jail. The police can also charge<br>the person with creating a nuisance. In Florida, that is a third degree<br>misdemeanor punishable by a \$500 fine. The person could also be subject<br>to a state's stalking law, which is defined as willful and repeated<br>following or harassing. Here, stalking is also a first degree<br>misdemeanor. Stalking also has an aggravating modifier if there is a<br>credible threat of harm, and aggravated stalking is a third degree<br>felony.<br><br>Beyond the criminal side, your documentation can be the start of an<br>order of protection or a restraining order. Violating a restraining<br>order may be a crime in and of itself, or the violation of a restraining<br>order may be a modifier to the harassment statute.<br><br>There may be valid reasons for someone to contact 911. But in the<br>absence of such reasons, the calls can turn from mistakes to harassment.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.
