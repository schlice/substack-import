I can produce many links to mainstream media stories showing<br>exactly what I am talking about. Can you produce the overwhelming<br>majority of links to stories that *don't* say this? Can you produce<br>*any* mainstream media stories at all? Maybe one or two, but to be<br>confirmation bias, I would have to be consciously ignoring the many many<br>news stories that go counter to my belief.<br><br>It's just not true.<br><br>So it's just not confirmation bias.<br><br>Thanks, we're done here.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-do-Second-Amendment-people-think-about-Trumps-comments-about-them/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
