<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(NOTE: Full disclosure: I am a Senator on USAFA's Class Advisory Senate<br>\CAS\. Some of my remarks are derived from CAS-prepared commentary<br>surrounding the release of this article. We did not receive full<br>attribution for everything submitted to us. If you wrote something I<br>posted and you want attribution, let me know)*<br><br>You're not the only one who had questions after reading that article.<br>Graduates, too, had many questions about the changes in the training<br>curriculum.<br><br>I think Mr. Wood means well, but I think that buzzing in for a few<br>hours, poking around a little bit, and somehow collecting enough valid<br>information to formulate a global opinion about what's "wrong" with<br>USAFA is not only short-sighted, but begins a dangerous precedent.<br><br>Ultimately, grads, administration, and staff all want the same thing: to<br>produce officers of character who are productive on day one of their<br>careers. This is [[General Michelle<br>Johnson's](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=92f789&url=http://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/107919/lieutenant-general-michelle-d-johnson/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="af.mil"}]{.qlink_container} ('81) goal as well, so right<br>away, we're all on the same page. That's a good start, right?<br><br>So let's get down to some specifics.<br><br>- Before we point out the speck in our brother's eye, did we stop to<br>  remove the plank from our own? Did we ever stop to ask ourselves not<br>  what is wrong with current USAFA training, but what might have been<br>  wrong with our USAFA training? The USAFA training experience of<br>  the 1980s and 1990s was more about mental toughness than effective<br>  leadership, and it infected graduates with a host of well-known<br>  pathologies, including arrogance, hyper-competitiveness, fear of and<br>  intolerance for error, and most pervasive of all, a deep and abiding<br>  cynicism. Graduates' favorite incongruity is repeating Schofield's<br>  quote about "harsh or tyrannical treatment" or Rommel's quote about<br>  "avoiding excessive sharpness or harshness of voice" while being<br>  yelled at. Rarely did one stop to wonder if there might be other,<br>  better ways to push cadets to their limits than keeping them<br>  half-starved, sleep-deprived, and fearful for an entire year. Good<br>  institutions conduct such reviews periodically. It would be surprising<br>  to find an institution that did not.<br>- Innovation is what the Air Force is about. Tradition cannot get in the<br>  way of the mission. As one alumni noted, the perception of discipline<br>  among the freshmen, or at least the crisp outward trappings of<br>  discipline, has declined. Perhaps this is a worthwhile trade-off for<br>  nurturing internal discipline and practicing methods of leadership<br>  other than instilling fear. Ultimately, rather than trying to find<br>  fault in the training curriculum, since our goal is to produce<br>  officers of character who are productive on day one, shouldn't we be<br>  measuring *officer* quality rather than *cadet* quality? Military<br>  institutions are revered based on the quality of their graduates,<br>  not the quality of their students. We all know Lance Sijan '65<br>  (GBNF) was not a model cadet while he was in attendance, but his<br>  bravery is the stuff of legend, as well as the first and only<br>  Congressional Medal of Honor for an Academy grad. If you were to judge<br>  USAFA by Cadet Sijan's example, what would you find? Now judge USAFA<br>  by Captain Sijan's example. Would you reach the same conclusion?<br>  Eisenhower is not significant because he attended West Point; West<br>  Point is significant because Eisenhower, the great military leader,<br>  had it as his alma mater. Hopefully you can see the difference.<br><br>Does this shift in focus make an Academy graduate any less disciplined?<br>Externally, perhaps. Perhaps the outward trappings of discipline are a<br>little less sharp. But internal discipline? As good as ever. Does this<br>shift make USAFA a less disciplined or rigorous institution? **Not at<br>all.** I can happily report that cadets are challenged to levels that<br>would have made us cringe, and they are learning things that are more<br>technical than we could have ever dreamed of. And I have worked in the<br>technology fields for the better part of a quarter of a century, and<br>their technical acumen is so good, it's scary.<br><br>The world is changing, and so is the face of warfare. Being able to<br>adapt to the new paradigms should be a *hallmark* of a great<br>institution, not a *black mark* against it. It is institutions like the<br>one we quipped consisted of "over two hundred years of tradition<br>unhampered by progress" which should make us fearful for the officers it<br>produces. I'm not saying specifically that this is the case, because I<br>don't know how the other service academies have adapted to the new face<br>of warfare. I only know how USAFA has adapted. And if we use officer<br>quality as our measure (as we should), then we are doing just fine.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
