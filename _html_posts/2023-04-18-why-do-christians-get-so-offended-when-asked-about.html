<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Why do Christians get so offended when asked about their faith?<br><br>I have never seen a Christian get offended when asked about their faith.<br>Ever.<br><br>> Is it necessary to blindly believe something without any proof or to<br>> rely so heavily on anecdotal or testimonial opinion rather than<br>> substantial, demonstrable evidence?<br><br>I will admit that some Christians have what you might call "blind<br>faith." They can't articulate the basis of their faith, they don't<br>understand the scientific foundations behind their belief, they just<br>believe because "the Bible tells them so." But *why*? Is the Bible<br>trustworthy? Are the things written in the Bible true? How can you tell?<br>Does absolute truth even exist?<br><br>There are actually very real, substantial, scientifically-based answers<br>to those questions. But it takes effort to learn those answers.<br><br>There is also a component of what proof you will accept. If God is<br>immaterial, you're not going to prove God's existence using the physical<br>sciences. But logic and reason are the very foundations of science, and<br>we can use logic and reason to prove God's existence.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
