<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It certainly depends on what you mean by \"keeping my<br>phone and laptop in sync.\"\<br>\<br>If you\'re looking at syncing data files between your phone and your<br>laptop, check out<br>[Syncplicity(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2ce5d2&url=http://www.syncplicity.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="syncplicity.com"}]{.qlink_container}. It is 100%<br>cross-platform, so it will work anywhere.\<br>\<br>If you are looking to sync calendar, contacts, and emails between phone<br>and laptop, use the Google infrastructure to do it (i.e. Google<br>Calendar, Google Contacts, Gmail, etc). If you use Google Drive, you can<br>also then keep files synced too. If you have an Android-based phone,<br>these sync features with the Google infrastructure are baked into the<br>operating system. iPhone can certainly sync with Google as well, but<br>Android has a leg up there since you don\'t have to install anything new<br>to do it.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
