<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If I witness a murder am I obligated to call 911 to report it?<br><br>In the vast majority of states in the United States, no, failure to<br>report is not a crime. A small group of states have written some failure<br>to report laws for some crimes. For example, it is a Class A misdemeanor<br>in Texas to fail to report any crime which results in bodily injury or<br>death. Ohio has made it illegal to fail to report a felony.<br><br>Mandatory reporting is usually only applicable for crimes against<br>children, and usually only for people in professional fields related to<br>or who work with children, such as police officers, doctors, nurses,<br>school administrators, social workers, etc.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
