<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Are police officers legally allowed to lie when you ask them if<br>they\'re a cop? Does this rule change in undercover situations?**<br><br>This question comes up frequently, but I can't seem to find the old<br>questions. So let me just quickly answer:<br><br>1.  Police are allowed to lie to you. You are allowed to lie to the<br>    police (unless you're talking to a Federal agent, where lying to<br>    them is a crime, or if you're lying to aid a criminal). Police are<br>    under no legal obligation to tell you the truth.<br>2.  Since police are legally allowed to lie, they are under no<br>    obligation to tell you they're undercover if they're undercover.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
