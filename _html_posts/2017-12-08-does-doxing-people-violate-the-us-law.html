<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Does doxing people violate the US law?<br><br>The answer is that it may.<br><br>"Doxxing," or public outing, of people may violate privacy laws if the<br>person has not previously revealed his or her identity. Was the person<br>intending to remain anonymous? For example, if you're doxxing a white<br>supremacist, did they attend a white supremacy rally in public, showing<br>their face? If they did, revealing them as a white supremacist doesn't<br>necessarily violate privacy laws, since they already revealed themselves<br>in public anyway. But for someone who has not, doxxing may be illegal.<br><br>And if you do it wrong (you identify someone incorrectly) and they lose<br>their job or their house or anything else of value because of it, then<br>*you* become liable for that, under libel laws.<br><br>Finally, doxxing someone unethically, simply because the person holds<br>views you disagree with, will likely just push them "underground," into<br>Anonymous posts and IP hiding using Tor and similar identity<br>concealment, from which there is *no* accountability at all. Is that<br>really where you want to send these people?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
