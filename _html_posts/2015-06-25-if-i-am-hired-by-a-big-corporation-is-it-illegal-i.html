<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It\'s not illegal, but many companies make you sign a<br>\"non-compete\" clause when you join them, which requires that if you<br>want to hire on with certain companies (which are direct competitors of<br>big corporation), you will have to wait a certain amount of time,<br>generally six months to one year, before you can join the new firm.<br>Check with the HR department at big corporation to see if you signed one<br>of these when joining, and what companies it applies to.\<br>\<br>If you have access to certain IP (intellectual property) at big<br>corporation, you may have had to sign additional contracts when gaining<br>access to that property which may limit your ability to move to new<br>companies. As [[Dan<br>Robinson](https://www.quora.com/profile/Dan-Robinson-9)]{.qlink_container}<br>said, slavery was abolished in the US, but companies are allowed to<br>protect their intellectual property.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
