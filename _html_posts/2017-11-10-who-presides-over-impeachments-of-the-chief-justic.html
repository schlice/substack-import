<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Impeachment is not a judicial function, but a legislative one. Even<br>though the Chief Justice presides over the trial in the Senate,<br>impeachment and its subsequent trial is not a judicial process.<br>Therefore, it is unclear specifically who would preside over the trial.<br><br>Congress appoints the Supreme Court, and Congress would preside over<br>them. The House would draft Articles of Impeachment, and the Senate<br>would hold a trial, which presumably would be presided over by a judge.<br>Normally that judge would be the Chief Justice, but if it is the Chief<br>Justice who was being impeached, I don't know who would preside over<br>that trial.<br><br>Since it is not a judicial process but instead controlled entirely by<br>the Senate, the Senate can vote on how to proceed, and can vote on how<br>the trial is conducted. In President Clinton's impeachment trial, the<br>Senate decided on a trial end date, whether or not to allow House<br>prosecutors to depose witnesses, and whether or not to hear live witness<br>testimony. Senators can make these decisions either through unanimous<br>consent or by voting on a proposal put forth by Senate leadership. So<br>this means then that the Senate can determine their own method of<br>proceeding, and it is likely that the Senate would vote on who would<br>preside over the trial of the Chief Justice.<br><br>Section 1 of Article 3 of the Constitution says:<br><br>> The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one<br>> supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from<br>> time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and<br>> inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behavior, and<br>> shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services a Compensation<br>> which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.<br><br>Only two times in US history has a Supreme Court justice been impeached.<br>One justice was impeached but not convicted, and one justice resigned<br>under the threat of impeachment. Justice Samuel Chase was impeached but<br>not convicted in 1804, and in 1969, Justice Abe Fortas resigned under<br>threat of impeachment.<br><br>*(EDIT) The question was not accurately worded, so I clarified my<br>answer.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
