<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Well, *Roe v. Wade* was already overturned. The consequence of that is<br>that control of abortions has been returned to the states. The states<br>decide how much access to abortion they want to allow. Some states allow<br>abortion through all nine months of a pregnancy. Some states limit<br>abortion at 15 weeks gestation, while at least one state prohibits<br>abortion completely, with no exceptions other than to save the life of<br>the mother.<br><br>"Limiting access to abortions nationwide" is not an easy task. As we<br>just mentioned, abortion is a state's rights issue. Because of this,<br>limiting access to abortions nationwide would be a really difficult<br>task. In reality, the only way to accomplish such a thing would be an<br>amendment to the Constitution declaring that the fetus in the womb has<br>the same right to life as a born citizen, and has the right to not have<br>its life taken from it without due process of law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
