Is<br>it legal?**<br><br>In most cases, if it is prohibited somewhere in your governing<br>documents, then yes, it is legal. Most modern housing associations (both<br>single-family and condos) prohibit clotheslines and drying clothes<br>outdoors.<br><br>If it is not covered by your governing documents, you may be able to<br>claim that it is not something you can be prohibited from doing (until<br>they add a new rule).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
