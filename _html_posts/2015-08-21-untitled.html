<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [And this DOJ report you speak of says that all police<br>departments in the United States are structured around revenue<br>generation?\<br>\<br>Okay, maybe not all of them, but like most of them, right? Or half<br>maybe? I mean, it\'s gotta be a lot if you\'re this fired up about it.\<br>\<br>So seriously, how many departments are we talking about? And are these<br>big-city departments? Rural counties? Suburban departments? Any other<br>facts to give us other than \"all police departments are geared towards<br>revenue generation instead of public safety?\"\<br>\<br>Did you ever stop and think that, perhaps, the DOJ might just have<br>something to gain by slanting these reports in their favor, away from<br>local police? Stop and think about what the DOJ might be able to gain.\<br>\<br>If you can\'t, you might just be a Democrat.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-is-unacceptable-about-police-shooting-on-an-armed-criminal-of-any-race/answer/Chris-Tion-1<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
