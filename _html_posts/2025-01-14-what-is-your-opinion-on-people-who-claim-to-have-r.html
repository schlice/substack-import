<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm quite pleased with them. You can even do it a little bit at a time<br>over the course of a year, if it seems daunting.<br><br>[https://www.bible.com/search/pla\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f99a38&url=https://www.bible.com/search/plans?query%3Dread%2520entire%2520bible%2520one%2520year){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bible.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>You may have to do a little bit of catching up, but you can even start<br>today and still read through the entire Bible in one year.<br><br>\<br><br>What I would be *more* concerned with, rather than the capability of<br>reading through the entire Bible, is *prayerfully understanding it.* The<br>words on the page don't speak to you. The Holy Spirit speaks to you,<br>through your reading of the Bible.<br><br>You can read all the words and understand them. But to *really* get<br>something out of the Bible, you need to read with an open mind and an<br>open heart. *That* is the part that many people who simply claim to have<br>read the whole Bible have not done.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
