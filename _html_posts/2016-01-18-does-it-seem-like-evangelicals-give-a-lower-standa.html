<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, your article conflates the people they interviewed, who<br>were of many varied faiths, not just Evangelicals, to official<br>endorsement by the American Council of Evangelicals of Mr. Trump.<br><br>This is simply not so.<br><br>If you actually read the article and not just the headline, Questioner,<br>you\'ll find that people of all faiths believe that while Mr. Trump may<br>not necessarily be a man of God, he is almost universally referred to as<br>someone who \"means well,\" and can \"get things done.\"<br><br>Indeed, while politicians spend entire careers explaining how a vote in<br>Congress actually \"got something done,\" Trump, for all of his New York<br>brashness, has actually built things. He\'s built skyscrapers. He\'s<br>built a thriving organization. And yes, he was born with a silver spoon<br>in his mouth, and I daresay the characterization, \"he was born on third<br>base and he thinks he hit a triple\" is accurate. That doesn\'t change<br>the fact that he has actually achieved the things he\'s set out to<br>achieve. He said he\'d build a world-class company, and he has done<br>that. He said he was going to have one of the highest-rated reality<br>shows on television, and he has done that. For all of his personal<br>braggadocio, Trump *has actually shown that he can accomplish things.*<br><br>And Republican voters look at that, and they then look at the America he<br>is walking into: people are angry with eight years of failed Obama<br>policy and unfulfilled promises. They are scared at a steadily weakening<br>economy, and they are (rightly) afraid that a Syrian refugee will<br>actually be a terrorist in disguise. They look at Trump and say, here is<br>a man who may not speak eloquently, but he speaks honestly. He speaks<br>from the heart. He has a genuine love for America (why else would he<br>sink all this money from his own coffers into the race?), and most<br>importantly, out of all of the candidates out there, he has the highest<br>chance of actually accomplishing what he says he\'s going to do, because<br>he has a *track record of success.* So when he says he\'s going to build<br>a wall, why shouldn\'t we believe him? He\'s built skyscrapers. I bet he<br>can build a wall. When he says he\'s going to fix America\'s trade<br>deficit, restore the nation\'s economy, and return jobs to America, why<br>shouldn\'t we believe him? He\'s run an immensely successful business.<br>No one can doubt that. And based on the track record of some of our past<br>presidents (ahem Bill Clinton), the fact that a president is a moral,<br>upstanding Christian doesn\'t seem to be too high on most voters\' lists<br>of requirements for a president.<br><br>Clearly, voters are looking for honesty, and they believe that Trump has<br>it in spades. He may not be the orator and skilled debater that Lincoln<br>was, but his heart is in the right place, he has the best interest of<br>the country at heart, and he has the ability to pull it off.<br><br>That\'s why he is so popular right now.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
