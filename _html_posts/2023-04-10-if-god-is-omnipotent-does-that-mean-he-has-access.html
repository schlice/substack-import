<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>100% yes.<br><br>This also implies that if this is true, then it implies that **God<br>permits Satan and his minions to do their work on the earth**.<br><br>It's actually not implied. It's written in the Bible. Look at the<br>interaction at the beginning of the book of Job:<br><br>> One day the angels came to present themselves before the Lord, and<br>> Satan also came with them. The Lord said to Satan, "Where have you<br>> come from?"<br>><br>> Satan answered the Lord, "From roaming throughout the earth, going<br>> back and forth on it."<br>><br>> Then the Lord said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job?<br>> There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man<br>> who fears God and shuns evil."<br>><br>> "Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied. "Have you not put a<br>> hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have<br>> blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread<br>> throughout the land. But now stretch out your hand and strike<br>> everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face."<br>><br>> The Lord said to Satan, "Very well, then, everything he has is in your<br>> power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger."<br>><br>> Then Satan went out from the presence of the presence of the Lord. ---<br>> Job 1:6--12 NIV<br><br>Wow. This passage totally blows my mind every time I read it. First of<br>all, *there's a council of angels?* Yep. But even better, *Satan hangs<br>out at that council?* Yep. *And Satan continually challenges God?* Yep.<br><br>Then, look at what's happening in this discussion. God pokes Satan in<br>this discussion. He starts by asking Satan where he came from. To be<br>sure, God is omnipotent; He already knows where Satan has been. But like<br>a good detective, He doesn't ask questions to which He doesn't already<br>have an answer. Clearly then, He asks the question for another reason.<br>Anyway, He asks Satan if he has ever considered the blamelessness and<br>uprightness of Job. Why ask him about that? God already knows what<br>Satan's been up to, and yet He asks Satan about Job. *Yet another area<br>where God is sending a message.*<br><br>Continuing on, Satan says "Yeah I've seen your Job guy, but of course<br>he's blameless and upright; you're protecting him! Wouldn't anyone<br>behave the same if you were protecting them? Tell ya what. I can make<br>him denounce you. Remove your protection from him, and I'll get him to<br>crack."<br><br>God says, "Sure, have at it, but you can't kill him." This passage tells<br>you lots. Besides the different translations which say things like "on<br>the man himself do not lay a finger" and then others that say "don't<br>harm him physically," the broader message is that *God limits what Satan<br>can do.*<br><br>The overall theme here is that God is in control, even of what Satan and<br>his minions do.<br><br>But *why*? Why would God allow Satan to torture people?<br><br>The only reason that makes any sense is that **God is allowing this to<br>happen because it's part of His plan. Satan's actions on this earth are<br>aligned with God's great plan for us.**<br><br>But what is that plan? We don't know the answer; we don't know what His<br>plan is. But we know He has one, and that all things will happen<br>according to that plan.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
