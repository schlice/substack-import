Remember, **people can be contagious with no visible outward<br>symptoms of disease**.<br><br>However, while this does impact our accounting, it has no effect on the<br>spread of the virus. Only isolation and social distancing can prevent<br>the spread of the virus.<br><br>Testing does not prevent or cure disease.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
