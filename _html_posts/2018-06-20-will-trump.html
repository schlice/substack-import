<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will Trump\'s new executive order undo the political backlash/damage<br>of the family separation policy or is it too late?**<br><br>Nothing can undo political backlash. Democrats are going to ride this<br>train until the end. Or at least past 2020.<br><br>What's more important is that he fixes the problem. I suspect that one<br>way or another, he's going to do something that will keep families<br>together at the border.<br><br>If he simply signs an EO that says that children can stay with their<br>parents, it will immediately be challenged in court. I bet the 9th<br>Circus already has the injunction written, just waiting for the EO to be<br>signed. His signature won't even be dry before the injunction is filed.<br>He could also go this route just to say "I tried" and blame everyone<br>else. I would be sad if he did this. He has a real opportunity to make a<br>fix here, without Congresscritters' help.<br><br>What he *could* do is treat illegal entrants who are also asylum seekers<br>simply as illegal entrants rather than asylum seekers. We should deport<br>*everyone* who is an illegal entrant, rather than holding asylum seekers<br>for a hearing with an immigration judge. If he could speed up the<br>deportation process and get illegal border crossers out of the country<br>within 20 days, we could forestall the separation of children<br>completely.<br><br>So it's a wait-and-see game right now.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
