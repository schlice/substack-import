  possibly research the political atmosphere of the state they left and the state
  that they are moving to before they move?"'

<br><br><h2>Space Submission</h2><br><div><br><br>Space name: The Conservative Corner™️<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I don\'t know what "people\" do, I only know what "I\" do. And my<br>primary factor in deciding which state to which I was going to uproot<br>and transplant my family *began* with comparing the political climate of<br>the state I was leaving, and the state to which I was going.<br><br>I had lived in Colorado voluntarily for about 20 years. Other than the<br>enclaves of Socialism centered around the college towns (i.e. the<br>People's Republic of Boulder or Ft. Collins), Colorado was a pretty red<br>state. Governor Bill Owens made sure of it. Then it started to turn<br>purple, but Colorado Springs was still reliably Conservative, with<br>multiple military installations within its purview including facilities<br>like NORAD and the Air Force Academy. But that didn't stop Colorado's<br>slide towards Progressivism, and with the election of John Hickenlooper<br>and the subsequent election of Jared Polis (the first openly gay<br>governor in the US\*) as governors, the state had fully turned blue. We<br>saw the policies changing, and we wanted no part of it. The policies<br>they were changing were going to harm the state for decades to come. We<br>saw it with Hickenlooper's creation of the first ever fully-fleshed out<br>marijuana marketplace and universal background checks (which studies<br>have shown have about a 5% compliance rate, even the state sheriffs<br>won't enforce it), and with Polis openly supporting suppression of<br>freedom of religious expression with the Masterpiece Cake shop fiasco<br>(he may have lost that one, but the writing was on the wall: you will<br>publicly accept our agenda and deny your own religion or we will cancel<br>you) and his furthering of Hickenlooper's open drug policies by<br>decriminalizing virtually all drugs in Denver. Watching the state change<br>like that was disheartening at best and downright dangerous to our<br>freedoms at worst. We knew we had to get out. We just weren't sure<br>exactly where to go. We sold our house and moved into an apartment until<br>we could decide where to land.<br><br>When we were deciding where to live, we narrowed it down to region (and<br>we settled on the Southeast), and we considered several states there.<br>But ultimately, it was the political climate in Florida which drew us<br>here. Governor DeSantis has the courage to do the right thing in the<br>face of intense media and Democratic pressure, so by the end of 2019, we<br>had sold our house in Colorado and relocated our entire family to<br>central Florida.<br><br>Sorry not sorry, Colorado. We vote with our feet.<br><br>\*Let me be clear. The fact that Polis is gay is just fine. But that<br>fact signals the type of Progressive policies he is going to endorse,<br>and we were not wrong about that. He doubled down on those policies, and<br>in our view, the state has suffered for it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
