<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is one of those times that Google is your friend. A quick perusal<br>of Google brings up this gem of an article from the History Channel:<br><br>> The idea that a just and fair government must divide power between<br>> various branches did not originate at the Constitutional Convention,<br>> but has deep philosophical and historical roots.<br>><br>> In his analysis of the government of Ancient Rome, the Greek statesman<br>> and historian Polybius identified it as a "mixed" regime with three<br>> branches: monarchy (the consul, or chief magistrate), aristocracy (the<br>> Senate) and democracy (the people). These concepts greatly influenced<br>> later ideas about separation of powers being crucial to a<br>> well-functioning government.<br>><br>> Centuries later, the Enlightenment philosopher Baron de Montesquieu<br>> wrote of despotism as the primary threat in any government. In his<br>> famous work "The Spirit of the Laws," Montesquieu argued that the best<br>> way to prevent this was through a separation of powers, in which<br>> different bodies of government exercised legislative, executive and<br>> judicial power, with all these bodies subject to the rule of law.<br>><br>> Building on the ideas of Polybius, Montesquieu, William Blackstone,<br>> John Locke and other philosophers and political scientists over the<br>> centuries, the framers of the U.S. Constitution divided the powers and<br>> responsibilities of the new federal government among three branches:<br>> the legislative branch, the executive branch and the judicial branch.<br>><br>> In addition to this separation of powers, the framers built a system<br>> of checks and balances designed to guard against tyranny by ensuring<br>> that no branch would grab too much power.<br>><br>> "If men were angels, no government would be necessary," James Madison<br>> wrote in the Federalist Papers, of the necessity for checks and<br>> balances. "In framing a government which is to be administered by men<br>> over men, the great difficulty is this: You must first enable the<br>> government to control the governed; and in the next place, oblige it<br>> to control itself."\[1\](#jHnJg){#cite-jHnJg .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-jHnJg){.citation_index} [[Checks and<br>Balances](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7547d9&url=https://www.history.com/topics/us-government/checks-and-balances){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="history.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
