<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>OK, I'll answer the law school question.<br><br>Under US law, there is no such thing as "degree of participation." There<br>is a difference in what they did, so there is a difference in how they<br>will be charged. The actual "doer" would be charged with rape, and the<br>other two would be charged with "aiding and abetting." Aiding is<br>assisting or helping someone commit a crime, and abetting is encouraging<br>or inducing someone to commit a crime. Because they did both, they will<br>commonly be lumped together as "aiding and abetting."<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**In a case of rape, there were 3 men who were accused. One was on top<br>of the woman, one held the hands, and the other held the legs. What is<br>the degree of participation of all accused?**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
