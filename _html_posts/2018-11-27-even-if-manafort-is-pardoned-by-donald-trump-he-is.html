<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Even if Manafort is pardoned by The Donald he is still open to state<br>crimes.**<br><br>This is accurate. Even if Manafort receives a Presidential pardon after<br>his sentencing, he is only pardoned from Federal crimes. New York<br>indicated that even if he was pardoned, they would pursue state tax<br>evasion charges. Manafort is a Virginia resident, but he owns a condo in<br>New York, so he may still be vulnerable to charges there. He could also<br>be vulnerable to Virginia's state tax evasion laws, although there isn't<br>a clear indication that they would be pursuing such charges.<br><br>How is this likely to play out?<br><br>The short answer is we don't know. We do know that Mueller essentially<br>ripped up Manafort's plea agreement yesterday (Monday, 26 Nov 2018).<br>This essentially says that Manafort simply cannot tell the truth, and<br>that Mueller has solid evidence to show that Manafort lied following<br>entering into his plea agreement. Mueller told a Federal judge that he<br>\"will file a detailed sentencing submission to the Probation Department<br>and the Court in advance of sentencing that sets forth the nature of the<br>defendant\'s crimes and lies, including those after signing the plea<br>agreement.\" Basically, Mueller knows the lies Manafort told after he<br>signed his plea deal, and he's going to let the court know exactly what<br>happened.<br><br>What we don't know is who Manafort was lying to protect.<br><br>Based on what we know about Paul Manafort, my guess is that he was lying<br>to protect himself. He's already lied to try to protect himself once;<br>there's no reason to think that he's doing otherwise now. Manafort has<br>already been found guilty in Federal court. He has pleaded guilty to<br>additional crimes. He broke his own cooperation agreement by lying. I<br>think Manafort is just physically incapable of telling the truth, and<br>he's going to spend the rest of his life in prison.<br><br>I don't think this has anything to do with the promise or even the hint<br>of a Presidential pardon. I think Trump has made his opinion on Manafort<br>very clear. He believes that Mueller has been pressuring people to lie<br>in order to "get him." Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump's lawyers, has hinted<br>at the possibility that Trump could still pardon Manafort based on how<br>this all plays out. But if he was trying to get himself a pardon, why<br>did he cooperate in the first place? Why didn't he just refuse to<br>cooperate? Wouldn't that be a better sign to Trump if that was what he<br>was going for?<br><br>So is Manafort a congenital liar, or is he a martyr? Is he banking on a<br>Presidential pardon? Until Mueller plays his hand, we really don't know.<br><br>(EDIT) [[Steve<br>Rapaport](https://www.quora.com/profile/Steve-Rapaport)]{.qlink_container}<br>pointed out a fascinating conspiracy theory in the comments which points<br>to another possibility for Manafort's behavior. It's actually a fairly<br>well known conspiracy theory, but because I don't put much stock in<br>conspiracy theories, it was mostly unknown to me.<br><br>[[FACT CHECK: Could a Case Currently Before the Supreme Court Result in<br>a Stronger Presidential<br>Pardon?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5d41ce&url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-gamble-court-case/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="snopes.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>So the theory goes like this:<br><br>- Trump fought hard to get Kavanaugh in to this SCOTUS session.<br>- During this SCOTUS session, a case is being heard, *Gamble v. United<br>  States*, which challenges the constitutionality of being tried for the<br>  same crime at both the Federal and state level. Currently, a Federal<br>  crime and a state crime which both cover the same offense are<br>  considered two separate offenses under the "separate sovereigns"<br>  doctrine. Currently, it is an exception to the double jeopardy rule.<br>  Adam J.
