<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Honestly, I don't think he's going to be acquitted.<br><br>He was charged with manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. In<br>New York, manslaughter says that the defendant must cause the death of<br>another person (1) recklessly; (2) with intent to cause serious physical<br>injury or (3) with intent to cause death under the circumstances<br>evincing an extreme emotional disturbance. Criminally negligent homicide<br>is charged when a death is caused with criminal negligence. The<br>difference is *intent*. Criminal negligence does not require any intent,<br>while manslaughter requires some level of intent to cause injury or<br>intent to cause death.<br><br>Self-defense is definitely a defense here, and his stepping in to defend<br>another person qualifies. So the jury is going to have to decide if<br>defense of another (which falls under self-defense) is enough to<br>overcome the negligence claim.<br><br>In my opinion, he's either going to be acquitted, or he's going to be<br>convicted for criminally negligent homicide. I don't think they have<br>enough for manslaughter.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
