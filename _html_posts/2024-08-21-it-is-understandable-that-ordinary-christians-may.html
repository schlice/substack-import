<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, it's actually the opposite. Properly Bible-trained scholars are<br>*more certain* that the Bible contains no contradictions. It is those<br>who are *poorly* Bible-trained who believe that genuine contradictions<br>exist in the Bible.<br><br>I suppose it really boils down to what you believe is a *contradiction*.<br>Yes, there are *differences* in the Bible. There is no way for there to<br>*not* be, as the Bible was written by forty different authors in three<br>languages, on three continents, over the span of 1500 years. **But a<br>difference is not a contradiction.** It is only a contradiction if there<br>is *no conceivable way* that two "differing" verses can be reconciled.<br><br>Even if an answer is not available right now, that does not mean an<br>answer does not exist. Many have found a supposed error in the Bible in<br>relation to history or geography only to find out that the Bible is<br>correct once further archaeological evidence is discovered.<br><br>Some things that people bring up as "contradictions" are indeed hard to<br>reconcile. But it is the Christian belief that every one of those<br>supposed contradictions can be reconciled in a viable and intellectually<br>plausible way.<br><br>There are entire books written showing "all of the errors in the Bible."<br>And there are *other* books which refute every one of those supposed<br>errors. But the truth is that most people who attack the Bible using<br>those "errors" as their ammunition aren't really interested in finding<br>an answer. They simply parrot the people showing the "errors" because<br>they want to attack Christianity, not because they seek genuine answers.<br><br>Jesus' warning about not casting pearls before swine is apropos here.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
