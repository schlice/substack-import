<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [An airplane is a business. Whether or not a plane makes it<br>to its destination on time is a function of business, not of law.<br>Therefore, that business can choose to operate itself in any manner it<br>chooses.\<br>\<br>Nevertheless, an airline ticket is a contract for carriage. The airline<br>is required to get you to your destination within a certain window of<br>time, or compensate you for your inconvenience.\<br>\<br>If a KAL exec decided to divert an aircraft, that\'s a business<br>decision. That company will have to deal with the ramifications of 300+<br>pissed off passengers and lots of compensation. But if they choose to do<br>it, that\'s their business.\<br>\<br>I also imagine that it would be highly unlikely that a KAL exec would be<br>able to divert any other than a KAL aircraft.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
