<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If the President of the United States demonstrates he does not<br>understand the powers and duties of the Office, would that satisfy the<br>requirements of the 25th Amendment Section 4?**<br><br>No.<br><br>Notice the text of the 25th Amendment, Section 4 (emphasis mine):<br><br>> *Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal<br>> officers of the executive departments or of such other body as<br>> Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of<br>> the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their<br>> written declaration that* ***the President is unable to discharge the<br>> powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall<br>> immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting<br>> President.*<br><br>This says nothing about a *lack of understanding of his job*. This says<br>the President is *physically unable to discharge his duties.*<br><br>But, you might say, it could mean that he is unable to discharge his<br>duties because he doesn't know what they are, or doesn't understand<br>them.<br><br>However, we can glean from the next paragraph of Section 4 why this is<br>untrue:<br><br>> *Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore<br>> of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his<br>> written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the<br>> powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a<br>> majority of either the principal officers of the executive department<br>> or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within<br>> four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker<br>> of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the<br>> President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.<br>> Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within<br>> forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress,<br>> within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written<br>> declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days<br>> after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote<br>> of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers<br>> and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to<br>> discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall<br>> resume the powers and duties of his office.*<br><br>What the rest of Section 4 says is that if the President is ***actually,<br>physically able to discharge his duties***, all he has to do is tell the<br>President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House that he<br>is actually ready to resume his duties. In practice, this means, "Hi,<br>I'm out of the hospital and I'm ready to get back to work."<br><br>If the Vice President AND a majority of the cabinet still says that the<br>President is physically unable to discharge his duties, then Congress<br>gets to decide if the President is physically unable to discharge his<br>duties. You need a 2/3 majority in both houses to say that the President<br>is physically unable to discharge his duties, and then the VP will<br>continue as Acting President.<br><br>**TL;DR: The 25th Amendment is used when the President is physically<br>unable to discharge his duties. The 25th Amendment is not used when the<br>President discharges his duties poorly, or without requisite knowledge,<br>or even dangerously. It is only used when the President is**<br>*physically* unable to discharge the duties of the office.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
