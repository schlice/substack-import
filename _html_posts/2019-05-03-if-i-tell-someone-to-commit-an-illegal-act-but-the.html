It then requires one of the people involved to<br>take "a substantial step" towards the execution of that crime.<br><br>One person telling another person to commit a crime does not amount to<br>conspiracy, especially since no one took any substantial steps towards<br>actually committing the crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
