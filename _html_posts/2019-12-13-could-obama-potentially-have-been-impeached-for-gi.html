<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Could Obama potentially have been impeached for giving Iran \$50<br>billion without congressional approval?**<br><br>If we were asking about this when Obama did it, the answer would clearly<br>be no, because it doesn't fit with any of the four actual reasons for<br>which you can impeach a president.<br><br>However, the bar has been lowered now. Presidents can now be impeached<br>for what the framers referred to as *maladministration*. They were very<br>worried that impeachment would devolve into partisan posturing, and that<br>impeachment would turn only on which party has control of the House.<br><br>This is the situation we find ourselves in today.<br><br>Remember when Senate Presidential appointment confirmations were changed<br>from a 2/3 majority to a simple majority? We called it the "nuclear<br>option." Democrats used it successfully, but then Republicans got the<br>opportunity to use it when they took power, and Democrats were<br>incredulous. But when they made the change, we warned them of that<br>eventuality.<br><br>Democrats are being similarly short-sighted. When Republicans take<br>control of the House, you can expect that "abuse of power" will also<br>encompass maladministration when a Democrat is in the White House.<br><br>Additionally, impeachments were never designed to be partisan. If you<br>have party-line votes, you do not have consensus that you even have an<br>impeachable offense, and it should not be moving forward. Impeachment is<br>not a grand jury. Impeachment has to be a complete, bipartisan<br>investigation and consensus that there is an actual impeachable offense<br>which occurred. This is the other change that House Democrats have made<br>to the impeachment process.<br><br>So, the new rules:<br><br>- Abuse of power now includes simple maladministration.<br>- Impeachment no longer needs to be a bipartisan, complete<br>  investigation. The equivalent of a grand jury indictment is all that<br>  is needed to impeach a President.<br><br>So this is not a stupid question. Democrats who dismiss this question as<br>partisanship are being as shortsighted as the House currently is. This<br>is a very pertinent question, and it bodes poorly for the future of the<br>nation.<br><br>**TL;DR: Under today's new rules for impeachment, Obama could have been<br>impeached for giving the \$50 billion to Iran without Congressional<br>approval. It would rightly have been called "abuse of power" and Obama<br>would have been impeached on a party-line vote.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
