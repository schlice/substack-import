<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think there is a confusion here between *how* we should be kind<br>and *why* we should be kind.<br><br>As far as *how* we should be kind, the Bible actually instructs you<br>to determine how based on personal gain.<br><br>> *"So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them,<br>> for this is the Law and the Prophets. \-- Matthew 7:12 ESV*<br><br>Jesus says here that you should do what you'd want others to do to you.<br>This is the Golden Rule (and you may not have known before right now<br>that it came out of the Bible).<br><br>But *why* we should be kind is another matter. We should be kind,<br>not just because we are commanded to be kind, because ***God is kind to<br>us.***<br><br>Clearly, God (through Jesus) commands us to be kind:<br><br>> *Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is<br>> good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to<br>> those who hear. \-- Ephesians 4:29 ESV*<br><br>But we should also be kind because He was kind to us first:<br><br>> *Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God<br>> in Christ forgave you. \-- Ephesians 4:32 ESV*<br><br>Notice that it's not that the person we're kind to is kind to us. We are<br>kind to others because God is kind to us, not others. That's exceedingly<br>important. We have not once in this discussion looked at whether or not<br>others are actually kind to us. We did examine *how we would want others<br>to treat us,* but that's different from *how others* *actually*<br>*treat us.*<br><br>\<br><br>Probably most importantly to this discussion, **true kindness doesn't<br>come from us. True kindness comes from the Spirit.**<br><br>> *But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,<br>> goodness, faithfulness, \-- Galatians 5:22 ESV*<br><br>Kindness in our hearts comes from the Spirit. It is an orientation of<br>our hearts towards others despite whether they deserve it, despite<br>whether they love us in return.<br><br>> *But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in<br>> return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the<br>> Most High, for he is kind to the ungrateful and the evil. \-- Luke<br>> 6:35 ESV*<br><br>And it may not always feel good to be kind. Sometimes, it feels just as<br>good as getting smacked in the head.<br><br>> *Let a righteous man strike me---it is a kindness;\<br>> let him rebuke me---it is oil for my head;\<br>> let my head not refuse it.\<br>> Yet my prayer is continually against their evil deeds. \-- Psalm 141:5<br>> ESV*<br><br>But if you can manage to do it, kindness bears much fruit in your life.<br><br>> *Whoever pursues righteousness and kindness\<br>> will find life, righteousness, and honor. \-- Proverbs 21:21 ESV*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
