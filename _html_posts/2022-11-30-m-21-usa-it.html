<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You should not join.<br><br>The simple fact of the matter is that in the military, *you are<br>willingly giving up your life in service to your country.*<br><br>So tell me how your logic makes sense: you're wiling to sacrifice your<br>life for your country, but you're not willing to sacrifice your health<br>for your country?<br><br>Bottom line is that when you sign up to be in the military, you are<br>*ceding control* of yourself to the government. Governments are<br>political. The military is the projection of the government's political<br>will. That makes the military a *political tool*.<br><br>The government in power at the time can use the military in any legal<br>way to project its political will. This particular government is using<br>the military to make gender equality statements as well as to prove to<br>the people that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective.<br><br>They did the same to me (not with the COVID vaccine, mind you, but with<br>other unknown chemical substances), and as a result, I developed<br>multiple sclerosis.<br><br>I willingly made my choice. **And despite the risk, I'd make the same<br>choice again.**<br><br>*That's* what service means. If you're not ready to make that level of<br>commitment, you should not join.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
