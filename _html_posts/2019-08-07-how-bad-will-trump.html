<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How bad will Trump\'s dementia have to get before the 25th amendment<br>is invoked?**<br><br>Understanding the letter of the law, Trump would have to be unable to<br>discharge the duties of the office of President, as observed by the Vice<br>President and the Cabinet.<br><br>Note that I did not say "unable to discharge *well*" or even "unable to<br>discharge *effectively.*" I said "unable to discharge."<br><br>The whole purpose of the 25th Amendment is for it to be used when the<br>President is incapacitated to such a degree that he can't function as<br>President.<br><br>For example, if he breaks his leg and is confined to bedrest, he can<br>still function as President. The 25th Amendment can't be invoked.<br><br>However, the President can *voluntary cede the office to the Vice<br>President* until he is back on his feet, if he believes that he is<br>unable to do the job.<br><br>Therefore, for the 25th Amendment to be invoked, the President must be<br>*so far gone* that he can't even respond to verbal questions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
