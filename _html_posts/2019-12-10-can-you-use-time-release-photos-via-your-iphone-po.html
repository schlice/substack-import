<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you use time release photos via your iPhone pointed outside your<br>house in place of a security camera like Ring or Vivint?**<br><br>Yes you can! Better than that, you can use your old phone virtually<br>exactly like a Ring or Vivint camera!<br><br>Clearly, you'll want to do this with an old, unused iPhone, since it<br>wouldn't make sense to do this with a phone with a current data plan.<br>But you absolutely can do this. In fact, there are a lot of great uses<br>for old mobile phones; baby monitors and a Google Home speaker are some<br>of the things that come to mind. But in this case, we're creating a<br>security camera.<br><br>1.  Download a piece of software called<br>    [Alfred(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1e9843&url=https://alfred.camera/){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="alfred.camera"}]{.qlink_container}. It's one of the best<br>    cross-platform mobile phone security camera softwares available.<br>    Alfred is free to use and gives you a remote view of your live feed,<br>    motion detection with alerts, free cloud storage, a two-way audio<br>    feed and use of both the front and rear cameras. Incidentally, this<br>    is all you can do with an iPhone. If you use Android, you can also<br>    set things like automatic restart of Alfred if the phone reboots,<br>    continuous focus, and setting of the resolution. Alfred also offers<br>    a Premium paid option which gives you features like<br>    higher-resolution viewing and recording, zoom capabilities, ad<br>    removal and 30-days of cloud storage. But try out the free version<br>    for a while, and if it meets your needs, don't buy the upgrade. If<br>    you want the additional features, you can upgrade if you choose, but<br>    it's not necessary to get the basic functionality.<br>2.  Plug in your phone (purchasing a long charging cable is a great idea<br>    here), connect it to the wireless network, and mount it where you<br>    want. You can use a simple tripod mount, or those car suction cup<br>    mounts work great to put your phone up against the window to look<br>    outside.<br>3.  Log in to Alfred on the security camera (we'll call it the "old<br>    phone"). Log in to your Google account and select "Camera." That's<br>    pretty much it.<br>4.  On your active phone (we'll call it the "new phone"), you should<br>    also download the Alfred app, log in with the same Google account,<br>    and select "Viewer."<br><br>That's about it. Alfred isn't the only solution out there, there are a<br>few others. I've used Manything in the past and it's also very good,<br>with a good basic free offering, and paid upgrades if you want more<br>options.<br><br>[[Make your old phone a home security camera for<br>free](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7d9df7&url=https://www.cnet.com/how-to/for-a-free-security-camera-look-no-further-than-your-old-phone/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cnet.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
