<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Because police are not a government-provided security<br>force. They are, instead, law enforcement. This means that the police<br>are there to enforce the law (which implies that the law has already<br>been broken). That the police protect you *from* crime is ancillary and<br>only if they have the means to do so.\<br>\<br>The 14th amendment guarantee that the government cannot take life,<br>liberty, or property without due process of law does not place a<br>requirement on the government to protect those same<br>rights.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Does-a-police-officer-have-an-obligation-to-rush-to-your-rescue/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
