<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why has the NRA lobbied Congress so hard to keep the CDC from<br>investigating gun violence as a health matter?**<br><br>Short answer: *they didn't.*<br><br>Longer answer: In 1993, a CDC-funded research study by Arthur Kellerman<br>found, among other things, that guns in the home were associated with an<br>increased risk of homicide in the home. The NRA saw this report as<br>unrelated to CDC's mission to prevent disease, and instead saw it as a<br>veiled attempt at gun control through "research."<br><br>Through their lobbying efforts, Congress passed the [[Dickey<br>Amendment](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7fd880&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickey_Amendment){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} as a rider on the 1996<br>Omnibus spending bill. The amendment simply says, "\N\one of the funds<br>made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for<br>Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may be used to advocate or promote<br>gun control.\"<br><br>That's it. Do as much research as you like, but you can't take a<br>political position.<br><br>Researchers, of course, saw this is a "restriction" on their work, and<br>didn't do *any* research at all, making it appear that the NRA's<br>lobbying efforts had in fact prohibited the CDC from doing any gun<br>research at all.<br><br>Democrats tried all throughout the Obama years to remove the Dickey<br>Amendment from spending bills, but it stubbornly hung on. Obama directed<br>the CDC to get back to work and do gun research. They funded a study in<br>2013, and did their own study in 2015.<br><br>In 2018, when the Continuing Resolution was passed allowing for<br>government operations to continue, a report accompanying the CR<br>clarified that the CDC can, in fact, conduct research into gun violence,<br>so long as they do not advocate or promote gun control.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
