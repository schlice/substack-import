<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The only other country I can think of, off the top of my head, is<br>Switzerland.<br><br>Switzerland has a statutory right to keep and bear arms in their Weapons<br>Act of 1997. Switzerland also has \"universal conscription\" and<br>mandates that all able-bodied males age 20-34 are members of the<br>militia. They will perform a period of active duty service, following<br>which they remain members of the militia. They also are then required to<br>keep their selective-fire rifles and semi-automatic handguns at home. Up<br>until 2007, militia members also received 50 rounds of government-issued<br>ammunition in a sealed box for use during milita call-ups. The rest of<br>their ammunition is self-purchased.<br><br>Switzerland has the highest rate of gun suicide in Europe. However, it<br>has one of the lowest rates of overall homicide in the world,<br>considerably lower than the rest of Europe.<br><br>For the seemingly ubiquitous gun presence in Switzerland (they likely<br>have the highest rate of gun ownership in the world), their laws are<br>very tight. They require licenses to own and carry weapons, and they<br>also have liability laws which render the owner responsible when a third<br>party misuses their weapon.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
