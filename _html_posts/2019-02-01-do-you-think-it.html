<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you think it\'s important for every American who cares about the<br>Constitution and the 2nd Amendment to learn about Shay\'s Rebellion and<br>the consequences of this event? Do you think most Americans understand<br>it?**<br><br>Most Americans don't understand it because history is so poorly taught<br>in American schools. But I digress.<br><br>*Shay's Rebellion is not an argument against the 2nd Amendment.*<br><br>That is the classic trope of *going to the extreme to avoid the middle.*<br>It's like explaining that abortion kills hundreds of thousands of babies<br>every year in the United States and you reply, "tell that to a woman who<br>has been raped." That a woman was raped does not change the fact that<br>hundreds of thousands of babies are killed out of convenience. You<br>cannot use the rape argument to justify the killing of hundreds of<br>thousands of innocent babies out of convenience.<br><br>In the same way, you cannot use an example of an insurrection which was<br>quelled by the government as an argument that the millions of gun owners<br>who successfully defend themselves against crime every year should not<br>have that right. In fact, the 2nd Amendment lives right alongside the<br>Insurrection Act, which permits the government to quell insurrections.<br>That's a little strange, considering that the 2nd Amendment exists, in<br>part, as a bulwark against tyranny. However, an insurrection against a<br>non-tyrannical government must still have a legal method by which that<br>insurrection may be quelled.<br><br>And in no case does an instance of insurrection relate to the right of a<br>person to own and carry a firearm for his own self-defense and the<br>defense of his family, nor does it negate the necessity to guard against<br>tyranny. Sure, while a revolution might look like insurrection,<br>attempting to overthrow a *legitimate* government is far different than<br>attempting revolution against a *tyrannical* one.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
