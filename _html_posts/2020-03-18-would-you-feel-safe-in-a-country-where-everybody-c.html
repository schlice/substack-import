<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would you feel safe in a country where everybody would have openly<br>carrying a firearm in public?**<br><br>So you said "everybody" would be open carrying. Therefore, this includes<br>you. So you already feel comfortable around firearms, because you open<br>carry as well. You did say "everybody," not "almost everyone," or<br>"anyone who wants to," you said "everybody."<br><br>Therefore, the sight of other people open carrying should also be no big<br>deal to you.<br><br>In fact, you'd probably be more likely to call out someone who is<br>carrying *improperly*, like in a holster not designed for the firearm in<br>it, or someone with an open thumb break, or someone using no holster at<br>all (i.e. waistbanding).<br><br>You'll have far fewer interpersonal confrontations in public (i.e.<br>people will be nicer). No one will be overly argumentative. People will<br>not be coerced into action. They can only be persuaded through<br>discussion. Force will be off the table because force will be equal<br>between any two people. Therefore, society becomes more polite. Crimes<br>against the person plummet precipitously.<br><br>Mass shootings virtually disappear, as they are stopped instantaneously.<br><br>So would I feel safe?<br><br>Absolutely.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
