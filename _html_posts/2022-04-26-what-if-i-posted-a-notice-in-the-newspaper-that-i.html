<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Absolutely. You can say that you have contempt for every judge, police<br>officer, janitor, and mouse family that has ever stepped foot in that<br>accursed building, and you\'re perfectly allowed to do so.<br><br>Where you would run afoul is if a judge gave you a court order, and you<br>posted a notice in the paper that you were specifically going to not<br>follow that court order.<br><br>*That* is the definition of "contempt of court.". Not having a general<br>contempt of any court, or even having a specific contempt of a<br>particular court.<br><br>Contempt of court is a charge when you deliberately ignore or violate a<br>judge\'s court order.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What if I posted a notice in the newspaper that I have nothing but<br>contempt for any court, am I within my first amendment rights?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
