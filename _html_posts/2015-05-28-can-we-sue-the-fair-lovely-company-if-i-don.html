<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Look closely at what the product claims to do:\<br>]<br><br>- BB cream instantly covers spots, blemishes, dark circles and dullness<br>  to give you a fabulous make-up finish.<br>- It is enriched with Multi-Vitamins that work from within\* to give you<br>  treatment like fairness#.<br>- Its SPF 15, PA++ protects your fairness in the sun, and its matte<br>  texture leaves your face feeling non-oily, fresh and bright through<br>  the day.<br><br>Then check the fine print:\<br>\<br>\<br><br>> Make-up finish/look via coverage. Results not equal to face make-up<br>> categories like the eye, lip, blush etc.\<br>> \<br>> \*within epidermin.\<br>> \<br>> #Refers to treatment in the cosmetic domain.\<br>> \<br>> Results not equal to clinical/invasive skin treatment. Use daily for<br>> best results.\<br><br>\<br>There is nothing there that says you will get fair. There is nothing<br>there that says you will retain fairness. It says you will get<br>\"treatment-like fairness\" and they are talking about cosmetic<br>treatment. So translated, that means it\'s makeup, and not much else.\<br>\<br>Their products never claim to make your skin lighter.\<br>\<br>So it\'s not likely they can be sued for false advertising, since their<br>products say exactly what they will do and what they won\'t (results not<br>equal to clinical/invasive skin treatment).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
