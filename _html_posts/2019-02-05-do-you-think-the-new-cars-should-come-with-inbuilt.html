<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you think the new cars should come with inbuilt dashcams as a<br>standard? Especially since it's become inexpensive now?**<br><br>I like the idea, and I think it would be smart for auto makers to<br>install new cameras to do this.<br><br>*But they already have 360 degree cameras on these cars! Just set those<br>to always record!*<br><br>Those cameras are not designed for continuous recording:<br><br>- They are relatively low-res. You want something a lot higher<br>  resolution to make out things like license plates. Most of those<br>  cameras are installed for specific applications like lane departure<br>  warnings, parking space viewers, or backup cameras.<br>- They are not designed for continuous use. The optical sensors are not<br>  designed to such tolerances that they can be continuously operated for<br>  the entire time the vehicle is running. They work fine for brief<br>  periods of operation, but not all the time.<br><br>However, I do think that manufacturers should think about installing<br>front and rear cameras in vehicles which are designed for continuous<br>recording. An SD card slot in the dashboard somewhere would be all that<br>is required to enable the always-on recording.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
