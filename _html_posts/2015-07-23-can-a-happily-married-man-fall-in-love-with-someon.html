<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I just finished reading a book series by David Simpson called,<br>collectively, the \"Post-Human Series.\" If you like sci-fi, dystopian<br>future stories, limits of human intelligence, etc., you\'ll really like<br>that series.<br><br>One of the overarching themes in that series was the following:<br><br>*\"Feelings are never wrong. Acting on those feelings may be, but<br>feelings themselves are never wrong.\"*<br><br>So with that in mind, let\'s answer your questions:<br><br>*Can a happily married man fall in love with someone else?*\<br>I would have to say, within the bounds of this question, no.<br><br>Why? Because if he\'s a truly happily married man, he won\'t get<br>involved with another woman to such an extent that he has an opportunity<br>to fall in love. Love is more than skin-deep, so \"love at first sight\"<br>is a misnomer. You can\'t love someone you don\'t know. You can find a<br>strong physical attraction when you visualize someone (and men are<br>highly visual creatures), and thus the phrase is more accurately said as<br>\"lust at first sight,\" but in my opinion you have to truly know<br>someone to love them. If you truly love someone for everything they are,<br>you would have to really know them to love them.<br><br>In this context then, if a \"happily\" married man falls in love with<br>another woman, he needs to do some serious soul-searching about what it<br>is in his marriage that makes him \"happy\" and why he finds it so easy<br>to fall in love with someone else. My guess is that he will find that<br>he\'s not quite as \"happy\" in his marriage as he thinks.<br><br>Once that analysis is completed, he\'ll have a better understanding<br>about what to do. Is he truly unhappy in his marriage? If he is, he<br>needs to give his wife a chance. He needs to talk to her and explain<br>what he is feeling and what he has discovered is missing from his<br>marriage. Remember, the key to a happy marriage is communication. When<br>communication breaks down, everything else falls like dominos.<br><br>But the discovery that a \"happily\" married man can fall in love with<br>someone else is a signal that the man is not actually \"happy\" in his<br>marriage at all.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
