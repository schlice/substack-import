<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [First, the \"exigent circumstances\" exception is not used<br>to \"violate\" civil liberties or to \"violate\" due process. They are<br>used during emergency situations to safeguard life and property.\<br>\<br>Exigent circumstances means that there exists an emergency situation<br>that requires \"swift action\" to prevent \"imminent danger to life\" or<br>\"serious damage to property.\" There is no \"litmus test\" to determine<br>if such circumstances exist; it is up to the responding official to use<br>the relevant facts at his immediate disposal to determine if exigent<br>circumstances exist. This was upheld by *People v Ramey (People v.<br>Ramey*, 545 P.2d 1333,1341 (Cal. 1976)).\<br>\<br>The court in *US v McConney*, which was ruling on a police entry into a<br>home, held that exigent circumstances are \"those circumstances that<br>would cause a reasonable person to believe that entry (or other relevant<br>prompt action) was necessary to prevent physical harm to the officers or<br>other persons, the destruction of relevant evidence, the escape of a<br>suspect, or some other consequence improperly frustrating legitimate law<br>enforcement efforts.\" (*United States v. McConney*, 728 F. 2d 1195,<br>1199 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 824 (1984))\<br>\<br>The court in *US v Reed,* which was ruling on an imminent destruction of<br>evidence exception, held that exigency may be determined by:\<br>]<br><br>- degree of urgency involved<br>- amount of time needed to get a search warrant (telephonic warrants<br>  must also be considered in determining amount of time to get a<br>  warrant)\<br>- whether evidence is about to be removed or destroyed, as well as ready<br>  destructibility of the evidence\<br>- danger at the site<br>- knowledge by the suspect that police are on the trail (*United<br>  States v. Reed*, 935 F. 2d 641 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 960<br>  (1991))<br><br>Since electronic data can be destroyed in seconds, warrantless seizures<br>using exigency criteria will be considered more frequently.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
