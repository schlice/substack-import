<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer to this question is *absolutely!*<br><br>Let me preface this by saying that I am a church musician. I have been a<br>church musician for my entire life, ever since I was old enough to sing<br>in the choir, old enough to reach the pedals on the organ, and old<br>enough to strum a guitar. Then I became a Christian and I have been<br>worshipping and leading worship in a number of Christian churches around<br>the country.<br><br>One of the problems we face as church musicians is making sure that our<br>motivation is pure. We need to ensure that we are there for God, and not<br>there for us. We're not there to *perform*, unless we understand that<br>*we perform for an audience of ONE*. We are there to lead, to assist the<br>congregation in their worship, not to perform FOR THEM. We perform<br>for God. Our music serves to enhance worship.<br><br>But who is to say what type of music? If you grew up on chancel organ<br>music, and you find that it sets the condition of your heart to worship<br>(as I did, and it still does), then fine! If 60's and 70's folk worship<br>songs are your cup of tea, great! (I still have those songs stuck in my<br>head on a never-ending loop) And if contemporary Christian music is what<br>energizes you and focuses your heart on worship, awesome!<br><br>But how about this?<br><br>[http://www.heavymetalchurch.com/(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=375b65&url=http://www.heavymetalchurch.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Are these folks worshipping God? Is their worship any more or less<br>worthy than mine? OF COURSE NOT! THEIR WORSHIP IS JUST AS WORTHY AS<br>MINE, and it's almost *blasphemous* to say otherwise!<br><br>It is GOD who determines whether or not your worship is pleasing and<br>acceptable! And it is the condition of the heart which God judges.<br><br>Be careful to not fall into the trap of judging them because you are not<br>a fan of the way they look, or the sound their musicians make. Because<br>this could be said as much for Gregorian Chant as it can for chancel<br>organ music, 60's folk group worship, or contemporary Christian music.<br><br>TL;DR: The style of the music does not make the worship any more or<br>less pleasing to God. *The condition of the heart of the worshipper<br>does.*<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can the Psalms 100 phrase \"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord\" be<br>stretched to apply to contemporary Christian songs in the heavy metal,<br>rock hip hop or rap mode?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
