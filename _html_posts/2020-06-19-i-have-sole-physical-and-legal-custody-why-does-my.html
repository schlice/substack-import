<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I have sole physical and legal custody. Why does my ex-husband, who<br>has not followed his court order at all, think he's going to become a<br>legal guardian?**<br><br>Because regardless of his past mistakes, he's still the father. And<br>courts recognize that children have the best possibility of later<br>success in life when raised by their biological parents in a communal<br>home. So maybe in your situation you can't have it all, but the more of<br>those things you can give a child, the better chance they have at being<br>successful. The state has a vested interest in the well-being of those<br>children.<br><br>So the court will try.<br><br>Granted, the court will *heavily* condition that try on the father's<br>willingness to follow each and every court order *to the letter*. One<br>false move and the custody agreement goes out the window.<br><br>But for better or worse, he is still the father. And for better or<br>worse, you had kids with him. He will never *not* be the father.<br><br>So if he throws himself on the mercy of the court and says he's a<br>changed man and he wants to try to be the best father to those kids that<br>he can be, I'd bet you dollars to donuts that they give him just enough<br>rope to hang himself. In other words, they give him the chance, and if<br>he screws up that chance, *then* they tell him to go pound sand.<br><br>So don't be surprised that a few mistakes in his past doesn't completely<br>shut him out of his kids' lives.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
