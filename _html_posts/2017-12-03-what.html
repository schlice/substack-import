<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What\'s President Trump doing about the illegals who abuse the system,<br>go home to their native countries and come back to the U.S. and start<br>the cycle anew?**<br><br>For starters, he's tough on immigration. Even without the wall in place,<br>illegals know that illegally entering a country run by a president tough<br>on immigration is no fun place to be. This is evidenced by the fact that<br>illegal immigration is way down since Trump took office, and he hasn't<br>even finished the wall yet!<br><br>Secondly, he's building a wall. I know people love to trot out the tired<br>tropes about a multi-billion dollar wall thwarted by a \$10 ladder, but<br>it's tough to get a semi truck full of drugs over a wall with a ladder.<br>It slows down illegal immigration immensely rather than leaving large<br>swaths of land available for people to cross at their leisure. You don't<br>have large groups of illegal immigrants moving freely across your border<br>when you have a wall. Evidence and history show that walls slow down<br>illegal immigration.<br><br>He's also directing ICE agents to enforce the law. He's increasing<br>border patrol funding, putting more agents on the front lines, and<br>directing the agency to do the job it's been Constitutionally directed<br>to do. He's working on getting chain migration repealed, and he is also<br>working on getting birth citizenship amended to state that it only<br>applies to parents who are citizens. You shouldn't be able to illegally<br>cross the border, drop a kid while on our side of the border, have that<br>kid become a citizen, and then have the rest of their home village<br>become citizens through chain migration. For reference, chain migration<br>is the process that is enabled when citizens and legal permanent<br>residents are allowed to sponsor non-nuclear family members into the<br>country. Reports have shown that [[more than 70 percent of immigrants<br>came from chain<br>migration](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cf70b7&url=http://dailycaller.com/2017/12/01/more-than-70-percent-of-immigrants-came-from-chain-migration/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="dailycaller.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
