<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Was Apple's FaceTime security flaw a huge invasion of privacy?<br><br>It could have been, if someone exploited it.<br><br>By the time the bug became widely known, Apple had already implemented a<br>server-side fix to obviate the problem, so it certainly wasn't<br>widespread.<br><br>Apple had a bug in their software, and as soon as they learned about it,<br>they crafted a fix and applied that fix. As a software vendor, you can't<br>ask for much more than that.<br><br>If you personally feel that Apple's actions constituted an invasion of<br>privacy, you're welcome to sell your Apple devices and buy a Samsung<br>Galaxy S10. We'll welcome you into the Android fold.<br><br>And if you still want to FaceTime with your friends on iPhones, you and<br>they can download Google Duo, which is a cross-platform video calling<br>app.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
