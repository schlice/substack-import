<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You do realize that there is a whole sub-class of doctors who<br>specialize in administering anesthetics, correct? They're called<br>anesthesiologists, and it is a precise art. Too little, and you just get<br>a little woozy and it doesn't really do what you want it to do; too much<br>and you're dead anyway.<br><br>Unless you're planning on training all police officers as professional<br>anesthesiologists, it's unlikely that tranquilizers will ever be used in<br>place of firearms.<br><br>"Icers" are a great sci-fi tool, but that's about it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
