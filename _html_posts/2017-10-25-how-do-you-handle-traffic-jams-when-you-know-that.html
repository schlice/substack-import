Try to find an activity that you can do while you\'re<br>sitting in traffic that you enjoy. Maybe you can read a book, or listen<br>to a book on tape. Maybe you\'d like to write a book. Maybe you like<br>Angry Birds. I\'m sure that there\'s something that you can find to fill<br>the time.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
