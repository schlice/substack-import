<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There are several things you can do.\<br>\<br>1. Sit somewhere where there is an open seat next to you so you can<br>place your carry-on under that seat instead. Or sit in the last row and<br>put your carry on under your own seat. This leaves the area at your feet<br>open for you to stretch out.\<br>\<br>2. If you\'re tall like me, you can bring your knees up and place them<br>on the seatback in front of you, like kids do on school buses.\<br>\<br>3. If no one is in the seat next to you, stretch your legs into the<br>underseat area of the seat in front of you.\<br>\<br>4. Or if all else fails, get up once or twice during the flight to<br>stretch your legs.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
