<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In order to answer this question, we must define our terms.<br><br>*What is the "Jewish Homeland?"*<br><br>Israel is the Jewish homeland. The State of Israel was established<br>on May 14, 1948. Jews support Israel as a Jewish homeland. All Jews<br>around the world currently have the right to move to Israel and gain<br>citizenship, enshrined in Israel\'s Law of Return, which was enacted in<br>1950 (two years after Israel became a state).<br><br>*What is "Zionism?"*<br><br>Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the<br>Jewish people in their ancestral homeland, the land of Israel. The vast<br>majority of Jews around the world feel a connection or kinship with<br>Israel, whether or not they explicitly identify as Zionists, and<br>regardless of their opinions on the policies of the Israeli government.<br><br>While there has been a continuous Jewish presence in the land of Israel<br>over the millennia, the yearning to return to Zion, the biblical term<br>for both the land of Israel and Jerusalem, has been a cornerstone of<br>Jewish communal life since the Romans violently colonized the land,<br>sending Jews into exile two thousand years ago. An earlier exile by the<br>Babylonians produced perhaps the most well-known lamentation "By the<br>rivers of Babylon, there we wept as we remembered Zion." That connection<br>between Jews and the land, and the hope for repatriation, is deeply<br>embedded in Jewish prayer, ritual, literature and culture.<br><br>What is known as modern Zionism emerged in the mid-19th century in<br>tandem with the rise of the nation-state and widespread national<br>liberation movements across Europe. In the case of the Jews, it was also<br>in response to a long history of intense anti-Jewish hatred,<br>persecution, and discrimination in countries and societies across the<br>world where Jews lived, including in Europe, the Middle East, and North<br>Africa. Its advocates believed that a modern Jewish state would provide<br>Jews with a safe haven from the bigotry and endangerment they suffered<br>perennially as a minority culture among non-Jewish majority cultures,<br>and ensure that Jews have the same right to nationhood and<br>self-determination as any other people, along with the same protections<br>that are typically afforded to other nations. Zionism was also a<br>cultural and national renaissance movement which sought to enable the<br>Jewish people to revive their language, Hebrew, and reestablish<br>self-determination over their traditions, culture, religion and<br>education.<br><br>In the late 1800s, the "father" of modern Zionism, Austrian journalist<br>Theodor Herzl, consolidated various strands of Zionist thought into an<br>organized political movement, advocating for international recognition<br>of an independent and sovereign Jewish state in the land of Israel.<br><br>Today, with a Jewish sovereign state a reality, Zionists believe in and<br>support the right of the democratic State of Israel to exist as a Jewish<br>homeland. Israel is the only Jewish state in the world. Being a Zionist<br>is distinct from supporting the policies of the government of Israel.<br><br>Zionism is a big tent movement that includes those across the spectrum<br>from progressives, moderates and conservatives and those who are<br>apolitical. There are Zionists who are critical of Israeli policies,<br>just as there are Zionists who rarely voice disagreement with the<br>Israeli government. There are diverse views among Zionists about the<br>Israeli-Palestinian conflict, about how to promote peace, whether to<br>support a two-state solution, and about approaches to Israeli<br>settlements. Being critical of Israeli policies is no more anti-Zionist<br>than being critical of American policies is anti-American.<br><br>*(excerpted from*<br>[*ADL*(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9db597&url=https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/zionism){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="adl.org"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br>\<br><br>So is it a Jewish homeland or a Zionist colony? Probably both.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
