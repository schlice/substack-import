<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What we call "squatter's rights" are actually a legal principle called<br>"adverse possession." "Squatter's rights" is the colloquialism for the<br>laws surrounding adverse possession.<br><br>Adverse possession is a legal method by which someone other than the<br>title owner gains possession of a piece of land. It is a legal situation<br>that occurs when one party is granted title to another person\'s<br>property by taking possession of it. This can happen intentionally or<br>unintentionally with or without the property owner\'s knowledge.<br><br>Intentional adverse possession is when a squatter or a trespasser<br>gains access to a piece of property and takes possession. Unintentional<br>adverse possession may occur, for example, when a neighbor builds a<br>fence on your property. The adverse possessor (also referred to as the<br>disseisor) can lay claim to that property. And if the claimant is<br>successful in proving adverse possession, they are not required to pay<br>the owner for the land.<br><br>State law varies on the requirements to prove adverse possession. States<br>can require any amount of time that the disseisor must be in possession<br>of the land, most require at least seven years before they can prove<br>adverse possession. But in general, there are five requirements to prove<br>adverse possession:<br><br>> - Continuous use: Under this condition, the adverse possessor must<br>>   show they\'ve been in continuous and uninterrupted possession of the<br>>   property in question for the period of time specified in state law.<br>> - Hostile and adverse occupation of the property: Although this<br>>   doesn\'t mean that the disseisor uses force to take the land, they<br>>   must show there is no existing agreement or license from the<br>>   landowner such as a written easement, lease, or rent agreement.<br>> - Open and notorious possession: The person seeking adverse<br>>   possession must occupy a property in a manner that is open,<br>>   notorious, and obvious. The true owner is not required, however, to<br>>   be aware of the occupation.<br>> - Actual possession: The possessor must actively possess the<br>>   property for the state\'s predetermined statutory period, which may<br>>   vary from three to 30 years. Possession may involve maintaining the<br>>   land and---depending on state law---paying taxes.<br>> - Exclusive use: The property is used solely by the disseisor,<br>>   excluding any others from using it as<br>>   well.\[1\](#mqOND){#cite-mqOND .citation_link}<br><br>Property owners should take steps to prevent adverse possession. They<br>should identify property boundaries and clearly mark them. If they find<br>an adverse possessor, they should attempt to, perhaps, rent the property<br>to the disseisor. With a proper rental agreement in place, the<br>trespasser cannot claim adverse possession. You could also grant written<br>permission to someone to use your land, and make sure you get their<br>written acknowledgment. Again, with a proper agreement in place, the<br>trespasser cannot claim adverse possession.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-mqOND){.citation_index} [[Adverse Possession: Legal<br>Definition and<br>Requirements](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6bab9f&url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adverse-possession.asp){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="investopedia.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
