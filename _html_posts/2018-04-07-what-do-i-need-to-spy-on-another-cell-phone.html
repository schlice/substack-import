<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What do I need to spy on another cell phone?<br><br>- You need physical access to the phone.<br>- You need to be able to unlock the phone.<br>- And you need a bunch of time to install spying software on the phone.<br><br>I think that's probably about as far as I can go with that answer,<br>before it becomes an instruction manual on how to spy on a cell phone.<br>From here on out, you need to learn how to become a good Google user to<br>learn what to do.<br><br>I would caution you though: spying on another cell phone is not only a<br>violation of privacy, it is most likely illegal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
