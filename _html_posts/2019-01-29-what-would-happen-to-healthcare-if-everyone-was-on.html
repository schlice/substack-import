<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What would happen to healthcare if everyone was on the<br>\'Medicare-for-all\' plan and we eliminated private insurance for<br>good?**<br><br>It's an interesting "what-if" analysis, if you want to go down that<br>rabbit hole, but if so, we'd have to label this question *Hypothetical<br>Scenarios* because this will never happen. [[Jennifer<br>Castro](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jennifer-Castro-313)]{.qlink_container}<br>hit the nail on the head. Private insurance will never go away. It's too<br>far entrenched in our lives to ever be completely eliminated.<br>Additionally, it's not really insurance. It's an expensive prepayment<br>plan where all of your needs are paid for, from the smallest band-aid to<br>the most expensive open-heart surgery. That's not insurance, it's<br>prepayment. We need to get away from that before we can ever hope to<br>reform the system.<br><br>The best we can hope for is a "dual-tier" system, at least initially.<br>Many writers on Quora have come to the same conclusion (many doctors and<br>attorneys themselves), and it's definitely worth looking into because if<br>we ever have any hope of providing basic healthcare for everyone in this<br>country, that's going to be the way we do it.<br><br>Basically, we would provide some modified form of Medicare Part B for<br>everyone who is a citizen. We have to draw a line somewhere, and that<br>line is "people who pay into the system can use the system." And unless<br>we get rid of the national income tax and move to a national consumption<br>tax that even foreigners and illegals pay, we will never be able to have<br>universal basic healthcare which includes foreigners and illegals. But<br>that's a discussion for another question. All basic care will be covered<br>under this plan. All routine doctor visits for everything from the flu<br>to a broken leg will be covered. 100% of children's healthcare will be<br>covered until age 18, so we can eliminate CHIP and SCHIP as well. EMTALA<br>will still exist for everyone, so any emergency situations will still be<br>triaged and stabilized by any emergency room, regardless of ability to<br>pay.<br><br>Above the basic health tier, private health insurance (usually provided<br>by your employer but you can purchase individually) will cover<br>everything else: hospital stays, major surgeries, non-routine<br>procedures, specialists, as well as catastrophic costs (e.g. the<br>resulting medical care from a car accident).<br><br>There will be a line between the two systems. That line can move over<br>time (i.e. some care can be moved down to the universal tier, or some<br>care can be moved up to the private tier.<br><br>Doctors can be compelled to provide Medicare care, because we can<br>provide low-cost government-subsidized medical school student loans for<br>them (or depending on the government's ability to pay, perhaps<br>completely fund their medical school), in exchange for X number of years<br>providing Medicare service exclusively, or even change that X depending<br>on how much time the doctor chooses to give back to the<br>Medicare-exclusive system in exchange for better loan rates or more<br>money loaned for medical school. After that time, they can expand their<br>practice if they choose and start accepting private insurance as well,<br>and if they no longer need that sweet, sweet government money, they can<br>then gradually phase out Medicare service and become a specialist.<br><br>This *can* be done. We *can* create this system, and everyone *can* have<br>universal basic healthcare provided by the government. But there will be<br>detractors. Those who want to see universal single-payor healthcare will<br>complain that this creates a "haves vs. have-nots" system, when it does<br>nothing of the sort. First, you can buy your own health insurance, and<br>these prices will be about as much as you spend on a cell phone or a new<br>TV, so if you can afford those luxuries, you can afford health insurance<br>if you choose. Secondly, *everyone* participates in the Medicare plan;<br>private insurance will not cover anything that Medicare covers. If<br>the doctor has both a Medicare and a private practice, that doctor will<br>bill the appropriate entity for repayment depending on the service, not<br>the person.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
