<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Simple police matter. No crime of any consequence has been<br>committed. The police would simply break up the incident and send the<br>ne\'er-do-wells on their way. These folks were well on their way to<br>committing the crime of harassment, but their behavior had not yet risen<br>to that level.\<br>\<br>However, the tort crime of assault has been committed, as verbal assault<br>is a civil offense. You would have to file suit against the<br>individual(s) in civil court. That\'s all on your own, there are no<br>arrests or police involved.\<br>\<br>Would you have gotten in trouble for calling the police? If you called<br>911 and told them your life was in danger and they had guns and were<br>shooting up the store, you could have gotten in a little bit of trouble<br>for misrepresenting the situation (the crime is called *false<br>reporting*). But if you called the local non-emergency number,<br>reported the situation, told them exactly what was going on (just as you<br>reported here), then they could have decided when they would send<br>someone, and you can\'t get in trouble for reporting exactly what you<br>see and what\'s going on.\<br>\<br>I will tell you this: as long as you are truthful with the<br>dispatchers and tell them exactly what you see and hear<br>(who/what/when/where/why/how), you will never get in trouble for calling<br>the police. Don\'t be afraid to call; I\'d hate for someone to decide to<br>not call the police because they are afraid they will get in trouble for<br>doing so. Also, ***learn your local municipality\'s non-emergency<br>number***. If you\'re ever worried about whether or not you should call<br>the police, call the non-emergency number.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
