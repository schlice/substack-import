<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The Bill of Rights, over the course of the years since its<br>inception, but most notably in Supreme Court decisions in the 60s and<br>70s, is binding on the states.\<br>\<br>This does not mean that \"individual\" rights are bound on \"states,\"<br>but they are binding in such a way that states cannot make laws that<br>abridge peoples\' rights as listed in the Bill of Rights, so state laws<br>are \"bound\" by the Bill of Rights. Justice Black wrote in *Duncan v<br>Louisiana*: \"No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge<br>the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\" This<br>essentially means that the Bill of Rights applies to states and their<br>laws just as much as it applies to the Federal government.\<br>\<br>This is a view that was never expressly stated by the founders, as they<br>were more worried about restricting the growth of the federal government<br>than overreach by the states. However, numerous decisions by the Supreme<br>Court over the years has made it clear that the Bill of Rights binds<br>state governments.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
