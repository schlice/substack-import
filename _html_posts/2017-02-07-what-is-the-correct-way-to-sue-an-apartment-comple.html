<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is no correct or incorrect way. There are only approved methods in<br>your jurisdiction for filing a lawsuit.<br><br>And in order to do so *and ensure your best chance for success*, you<br>should get an attorney.<br><br>If I could say that there was a "correct" way to file a lawsuit, that<br>would be it. Get an attorney.<br><br>If you wish to sue the apartment complex in small claims court, the<br>respondent would simply be the complex, care of the management agency<br>(if there is one), and the business address of the business office on<br>record for the complex. Check with your local municipal court on how to<br>file in your small-claims court.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
