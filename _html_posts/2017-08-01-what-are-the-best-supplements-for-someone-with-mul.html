<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, and I can't stress this enough, this is a great question to ask<br>your neurologist. Please don't start or change any of your medications<br>without consulting with your doctor. This includes supplements.<br><br>While I agree with [[Angel<br>Singer](https://www.quora.com/profile/Angel-Singer)]{.qlink_container}<br>that Vitamin D is important to people with MS, I would suggest that if<br>you are able, you should try to get Vitamin D the natural way. Fifteen<br>minutes a day of exposure to the sun is all you need to get your Vitamin<br>D for the day. Vitamin D supplements are tricky things; you have to work<br>with your doctor to get the dosing right, and too much Vitamin D can<br>cause other health problems, such as kidney stones in people who are<br>susceptible to them. Ask me how I know.<br><br>Supplements I would suggest, which are safe and effective to start any<br>time:<br><br>- Cod Liver Oil. Fish oil has great benefits to both the brain and the<br>  immune system. But again, try to get your omega 3 oils the natural<br>  way: make sure you're eating fish which are naturally full of good<br>  fats, like salmon, halibut, herring, tuna, and of course, cod.<br>- Don't believe the hype! Fat does not make you fat! You need<br>  cholesterol in your diet because it feeds your brain. Your brain cells<br>  are swathed in fatty substances made from primarily cholesterol. Make<br>  sure you eat whole foods and meats which contain actual fat, like<br>  chicken with the skin (not necessarily fried though), buffalo,<br>  venison, and uncured bacon.<br>- Make sure your veggies are whole and you eat enough of them; most<br>  people do not. Good veggies are plentiful, and include broccoli, kale,<br>  Brussels sprouts, Romaine lettuce, asparagus, collard greens,<br>  radishes, cucumbers, spinach, artichokes, onions, carrots, bok choy,<br>  etc.<br>- Fruits should be whole and plentiful. Good ones to eat are apples,<br>  oranges, kiwis, grapefruits, strawberries, blueberries, avocados<br>  (which also have good fat), honeydew, papayas, raspberries, oranges,<br>  mangos, nectarines, cranberries, apricots, etc.<br><br>AVOID these things:<br><br>- Any oil listed as hydrogenated. This produces TRANS FATS, which are<br>  the actual fats which are bad for you. Any vegetable oil which is<br>  heated at all will form trans fats and will also denature and become<br>  carcinogenic. Olive oil heated to more than medium heat will denature<br>  and is actually bad for you. And the big one, partially hydrogenated<br>  anything is bad. If you need fats to cook with, use whole, real<br>  butter, or coconut oil.<br>- Artificial sweeteners. The killer here is high fructose corn syrup.<br>  Anything with HFCS should be avoided like the plague. Stay away from<br>  all artificial sweeteners. One exception: stevia. So long as you use<br>  whole stevia extract (and avoid the stevia mixed with artificial<br>  sweeteners like Mannitol or Sorbitol or Glycerol or Dextrose), you're<br>  in good shape. Stevia may have some neuroprotective effetcs. Also okay<br>  but in moderation: whole cane sugar, or cane juice.<br>- Artificial colors, which have been linked to neurological disorders.<br>  Stay away from any foods which contain FD&C colors at all, but the<br>  biggies are Yellow 5 and Red 40.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
