<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's true that the Old English style of the KJV is a bit...foreign to us<br>today. But that's not the real problem I have with the KJV. And I'll get<br>to that objection in a moment. To me, that's a secondary issue.<br><br>The main problem I have with the KJV is that *the choice of words<br>changes the meaning of some Bible verses.*<br><br>For example, only the KJV translates the 6th Commandment as "Thou<br>shalt not kill." Every other modern translation (including the New King<br>James Version) correctly translates *rasach* as "murder," not "kill."<br><br>From gotquestions.org:<br><br>> The Old Testament uses over half a dozen different Hebrew words for<br>> the taking of a human life. In Exodus 20:13, the Hebrew word used is<br>> *rasah*, which means "murder." It is the same word that the KJV<br>> correctly renders elsewhere as "murder" or "murderer," including all<br>> eleven times that *rasah* appears in Numbers 35:17--31. Oddly, when<br>> they came to the sixth commandment, the KJV translators chose to<br>> translate the word as "kill" instead of "murder." "Thou shalt not<br>> kill" is an incorrect and inconsistent translation.<br><br>That error alone has caused a massive amount of confusion among<br>Christians. It has caused confusion about whether to serve in the<br>military during war time, to use deadly force as a police officer, or<br>even to protect their own families from attackers who wish to *actually<br>murder them*. And all from one overly broad choice of word which was<br>actually inconsistently translated, even within the KJV itself.<br><br>Additionally, the KJV correctly used the Masoretic Texts as the source<br>for the Old Testament, but then included the Apocrypha from the<br>Septuagint. The Masoretic Texts specifically left the Apocrypha out<br>because they were never written in Hebrew, meaning they were additions<br>to the Jewish Holy Scriptures. Their omission from the Masoretic Texts<br>was a *feature,* not a *defect.*<br><br>In some cases, KJV includes whole verses which are not found anywhere<br>else. An example of this is what is referred to as the \"Comma<br>Johanneum\" in 1 John 5:7, which in the KJV reads, "For there are three<br>that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost:<br>and these three are one." The earliest and best manuscripts read, "There<br>are three that testify." Those three are then identified in the next<br>verse as the Spirit, the water and the blood. The verse has nothing to<br>do with the Trinity, but the King James Version added a complete and<br>unique thought to Scripture. Not only are we not supposed to take away<br>from the Bible; we shouldn't add to it either.<br><br>And then there's the most glaring issue of the Old English. The English<br>language has changed quite a lot over the last 400 years, so there<br>shouldn't be a real reason why we *need* to read the Bible in Old<br>English. This changing over the years means that some words, as they<br>were translated in Old English, actually convey a different meaning<br>today. For example, in Matthew 19:14, the KJV reads, "Suffer the little<br>children to come to me." No one wants little children to suffer. It<br>should be translated "Allow the little children to come to me." But the<br>archaic language of the Old English leads to confusion, such as where<br>the KJV uses the word "conversation" when it actually means "conduct" or<br>"lifestyle." There have been good faith efforts to correct these issues,<br>and the New King James Version (NKJV) tries to do this. It's actually an<br>excellent translation.<br><br>But there is one group of people who believe that there is only one<br>translation of the Bible which anyone should be reading, and that's the<br>KJV. These people are part of the "KJV-Only" movement. They say things<br>like, "All modern translations have taken verses out of the Bible. The<br>KJV is the only one that preserves all the Scripture. The KJV is the<br>only true Bible. Don't use any other." Besides the NKJV, other attempts<br>(such as the KJ21 and MEV) have been made to make minimal updates to the<br>KJV, only \"modernizing\" the archaic language, while using the exact<br>same Greek and Hebrew manuscripts. These attempts are also rejected by<br>KJV-Only activists. This proves that KJV-Only activists are loyal to the<br>King James Version itself, not necessarily to the original manuscripts.<br><br>If we're going to be loyal to any writing, it should be to the original<br>manuscripts of the Old and New Testaments, written in Hebrew, Aramaic,<br>and Greek. Only the original languages are the Word of God as He<br>inspired it. A translation is only an attempt to take what is said in<br>one language and communicate it in another. As we all know, language<br>translation is imprecise, because of structural differences in language<br>(I detail this [[in another<br>answer](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-an-original-version-of-the-Holy-Bible-that-has-not-been-altered-by-any-church-If-so-which-version-is-it-and-where-can-it-be-obtained/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}<br>about Bible translation philosophies). Loyalty to any text outside of<br>the original manuscripts is textually fraught.<br><br>Here's the bottom line, in my opinion. Modern translations are based on<br>the earliest and best manuscripts of the Bible and use understandable<br>contemporary language. Most importantly, they do not add to the Bible.<br>The King James Version uses archaic English (which causes confusion),<br>uses overly broad words in some cases (which also causes confusion) and<br>occasionally adds entirely new thoughts to the text of the Bible. But<br>still, if you like the KJV, feel free to keep reading it, but just keep<br>those particular caveats in mind. Just don't hang on the idea that it is<br>the only translation anyone should be reading.<br><br>To be honest, I'm just glad that people are reading the Bible. I am far<br>less concerned with *what* version they read.ยน<br><br>\<br><br>ยน ...with the notable exception of the *New World Translation*. This<br>version was translated by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, and is<br>the first intentional, systematic effort at producing a complete version<br>of the Bible that is edited and revised for the specific purpose of<br>agreeing with a religious group's specific doctrine. The Jehovah's<br>Witnesses and the Watchtower Society realized that their beliefs<br>contradicted the Bible. So, rather than conforming their beliefs to the<br>Bible, they altered the Bible to agree with their beliefs.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
