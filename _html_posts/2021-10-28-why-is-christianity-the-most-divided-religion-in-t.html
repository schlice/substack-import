<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ultimately, even though the various Christian sects may disagree on the<br>finer points of the faith, the gospel remains the same throughout<br>any religion or sect which claims itself to be Christian. In fact,<br>Christians are *allowed to have differences of opinion* on non-essential<br>doctrine:<br><br>> Now accept the one who is weak in faith, *but* not for *the purpose<br>> of* passing judgment on his opinions. One person has faith that he may<br>> eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables *only*. The one who<br>> eats is not to regard with contempt the one who does not eat, and the<br>> one who does not eat is not to judge the one who eats, for God has<br>> accepted him. Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own<br>> master he stands or falls; and he will stand, for the Lord is able to<br>> make him stand.<br>><br>> One person regards one day above another, another regards every day<br>> *alike*. Each person must be fully convinced in his own mind. He who<br>> observes the day, observes it for the Lord, and he who eats, does so<br>> for the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who eats not, for the<br>> Lord he does not eat, and gives thanks to God. For not one of us lives<br>> for himself, and not one dies for himself --- Romans 14:1--7 NASB<br><br>In other words, it is necessary for a church which claims to be<br>Christian to believe that Jesus Christ is God, one of three persons in<br>the Trinity, and that he died as a penal substitution for us and our<br>sins.<br><br>Really, the only thing we need to do in order to define whether or not a<br>religion or sect is Christian is to determine who they say Jesus is.<br><br>Yes, among Christian sects (which really exploded in the United States<br>in the 19th century following the [[Second Great<br>Awakening](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7a3720&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Great_Awakening){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}) there are still<br>disagreements on certain details such as *sola scriptura* (only the<br>Bible as the source of God's inerrant word) and *sola fides* (only faith<br>saves you instead of faith plus works). But that alone doesn't make them<br>less Christian.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why is Christianity the most divided religion in the world with diverse<br>doctrines and believes that sometimes contrast, the only thing all<br>denominations have in common is believing in Jesus?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
