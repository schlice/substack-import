<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No one has the right to violate the amendments of the Constitution.<br><br>*That said*, persons who are on parole ***are still serving a prison<br>sentence***. They're just not doing it inside of a prison.<br><br>That means that as prisoners (on parole), they still have some of their<br>Constitutional rights curtailed.<br><br>Parole officers can continue to do the same things that happened within<br>the prison walls. So that right to privacy? Very much curtailed while<br>you are on parole. Along with several other rights, the biggie is the<br>Fourth Amendment. You pretty much surrender your Fourth Amendment search<br>and seizure protections while you are on parole. You can be subject to<br>random urinalysis. Your home and your car can be tossed at any time.<br>Your person can be searched, and they don't need reasonable doubt or<br>probable cause to do it. And not just by your probation officer, but by<br>any authorized law enforcement officer, at any time.<br><br>Just one more of the privileges of being on parole.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
