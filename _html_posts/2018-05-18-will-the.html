<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will the "leaders" in Washington do anything differently now that<br>we've had another mass shooting at a school?**<br><br>We hope so.<br><br>We hope that they'll stop wasting time with more ineffective gun laws<br>that won't make any difference in keeping our children safe.<br><br>We must realize that **laws do not prevent bad people from doing bad<br>things**. Laws might *deter* some good people from making bad choices.<br>Laws might make it *slightly more difficult* for a bad person to do a<br>bad thing, but that bad person will always find a way to do a bad thing<br>if they want to. **Laws are designed to provide a framework under which<br>we can punish people *who choose to break them***. That means<br>*before laws work, someone must actually break them.*<br><br>In this case, we want to *prevent bad people from doing bad things, and<br>to do that, we need to think of laws differently.*<br><br>We hope that leaders will actually implement some real "common-sense"<br>laws to protect our nation's children while they are in schools.<br><br>Some examples:<br><br>- Getting rid of ridiculous gun-free zones which are nothing more than<br>  "free-fire zones" or "target-rich environments" if you're so inclined.<br>- Allowing teachers with CCW permits to carry while in school.<br>- Actually securing school buildings, and implementing proper security<br>  procedures. Yes, having armed security guards in school helped in<br>  today's shooting, but we can do better. As Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said<br>  today, if we can secure a courthouse or other government buildings,<br>  there is no reason we can't secure a school, and keep guns from<br>  getting inside in the first place.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
