<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So your question is asking me whether or not it *depresses* me that most<br>people will not go to heaven?<br><br>No.<br><br>The truth of God's word is written on the hearts. Paul wrote the<br>following:<br><br>> Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things<br>> required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they<br>> do not have the law. They show that the requirements of the law are<br>> written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and<br>> their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even<br>> defending them. --- Romans 2:14--15 NIV<br><br>The requirements of the law are written on their hearts. Even the<br>Gentiles (who did not have the law) did things required by the law<br>naturally. That's because the requirements of the law are written on<br>their hearts.<br><br>In other words, everyone knows naturally what is right. Some people<br>still choose to do what they desire rather than to do what is right.<br>People are stubborn and refuse to do what is right all the time. There<br>is nothing surprising about this.<br><br>You can rest assured that the people who are going to hell are doing so<br>by choice, not by accident. They know what is right but they ignore it.<br>They follow their desires rather than following God's law. And they will<br>knowingly reap the rewards for their misdeeds.<br><br>Why should people's free choices sadden me?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
