<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, we need to define a "black knight narcissist," because it is a<br>term coined by one of our very own Quorans, [[Elinor<br>Greenberg](https://www.quora.com/profile/Elinor-Greenberg)]{.qlink_container}:<br><br>> ***White Knights, Black Knights, and Victims: Three Different<br>> Strategies for Getting Narcissistic Supplies***<br>><br>> *All Narcissists are preoccupied with self-esteem enhancement, but not<br>> all of them use strategies that hurt other people. One can think of<br>> three of the most common Narcissistic strategies as falling into these<br>> basic categories: White Knights, Black Knights, and Victims.*<br>><br>> *The White Knights**: These are the "do-gooders" of the Narcissist<br>> world. They raise their self-esteem by going around doing favors and<br>> good deeds for as many people as possible. When they have the funds,<br>> they give to charities, build hospitals, and support cultural causes.<br>> Their goal is to make the world a better place and, by doing so,<br>> internally settle once and for all their self-doubt about whether they<br>> are really a decent human being. By the way, although I am mostly<br>> using the pronoun "he," all of the Knights and Victims can be men or<br>> women or anything in between.*<br>><br>> *Like all Narcissists, White Knights are very concerned with what<br>> others think about them and often these are some of the best-liked<br>> people in their neighborhood. They are the neighbors who offer to help<br>> you paint your house, or get you milk and orange juice when they are<br>> on the way to the grocery store. The more they please you, the better<br>> they feel about themselves. Think Knights of the Arthurian Round Table<br>> who have sworn an oath to protect those weaker than them and make the<br>> world a better place. Often White Knights hold jobs in helping<br>> professions and that further enhances their shaky self-esteem.*<br>><br>> *Of course, when the wives of White Knight Narcissists come to<br>> therapy, their main complaint is that they hardly ever get to see<br>> their husband because the husbands are so busy helping everyone else<br>> and not doing the chores that need doing around their house. They are<br>> likely to spend much of their free time trying to prove their goodness<br>> to strangers and will often ignore their family's needs in order to do<br>> this.*<br>><br>> *Black Knights:* *Unlike the White Knights, these people get their<br>> self-esteem from destroying yours. They like nothing better than to<br>> prove to you that they are better than you. They are sadistic bullies,<br>> who if they could, would grind you into the dust under their feet.<br>> Dominating other people is their main pleasure in life. They are a<br>> very different kettle of fish from the White Knights. When people<br>> advise you to avoid all Narcissists, they are usually thinking of<br>> Black Knight types, not their do-gooder White Knight cousins.*<br>><br>> *Victims:* *These are the Narcissists whose main claim to fame is<br>> how they are always treated worse than anyone else. They will tell you<br>> repetitive, boring, long stories about each insult that they have<br>> endured. They endlessly complain about the waitress who brought them<br>> their food cold, the parking attendant who lost their keys, and the<br>> nasty bus driver who closed the door in their face. Like all<br>> Narcissists, they are motivated to show everyone how important and<br>> special they are; but in their case their specialness revolves around<br>> how badly they get treated and how much worse it is for them than for<br>> everyone else.*\[1\](#ccloz){#cite-ccloz .citation_link}<br><br>Multiple Sclerosis is an autoimmune disease which causes the immune<br>system to attack and destroy the myelin sheath which surrounds nerve<br>fibers in the central nervous system, in a process called<br>*demyelination*. MS causes varied symptoms throughout the body, but the<br>most common are fatigue, brain fog, numbness and tingling, vision<br>issues, bowel/bladder issues, sexual dysfunction, and muscle weakness.<br>The disease affects everyone differently; no two patients have the exact<br>same symptoms, although some symptoms are more common than others.<br><br>A black knight narcissist is a person who gets his self-esteem by<br>destroying yours. When they develop MS, they develop a disease which<br>causes physical symptoms, some of which may make one feel weak or<br>helpless. This is definitely not good for the black knight narcissist,<br>as it removes some of the tools they use to destroy the self-esteem of<br>others. How can I destroy your self-esteem regarding your physique when<br>my own is deteriorating? It's hypocritical. This kind of divergent<br>thinking alone can cause more psychological issues, so the narcissist<br>will have to either ignore it, hide it, or adapt to it.<br><br>Dr. Greenberg would know the answer to this next part better than I, but<br>it might be possible for a black knight narcissist to "re-tool" himself<br>into a victim narcissist, and use the disease as his nemesis. I am<br>unaware of how effectively the black knight narcissist would be able to<br>make this transformation, but I hypothesize that it is possible.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ccloz){.citation_index} [[How can someone best deal with<br>narcissists?](https://www.quora.com/How-can-someone-best-deal-with-narcissists)]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
