<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the reason for the censorship regarding nude swimming in<br>public schools and public swimming pools in the United States in the<br>1940\'s to the mid 1960\'s? Why is it such a hush hush thing among the<br>people who lived back then?**<br><br>People in the United States are generally prudish about nudity. This is<br>why it is "hush hush." People don't like to talk about it because it<br>violates modern social norms.<br><br>However, nude swimming in swimming pools was preferred because at the<br>time, swimming in clothes was unsanitary.<br><br>Before modern antiseptic treatments such as chlorine were routinely<br>used, swimming in clothing caused the buildup of bacteria, and<br>contamination of the swimming water. Pools had to be frequently drained<br>and refilled. The American Public Health Administration's guidelines,<br>all the way through 1962, recommended boys swim in the<br>nude.\[1\](#owENO){#cite-owENO .citation_link}<br><br>Girls, on the other hand, were not permitted to swim in schools, both<br>for modesty and sanitization reasons primarily related to menstruation.<br><br>Chlorination, while effective at killing bacteria, was not in widespread<br>use because at the time, they had difficulty controlling the pH of the<br>water. The problem was eventually fixed by the mid 1950's:<br><br>> By the middle of the twentieth century compounds consisting of<br>> chlorine with cyanuric acid became available for swimming pool use.<br>> Like earlier forms of chlorine sterilizers, these materials function<br>> as a source of hypochlorous acid, which is the active sanitizing<br>> agent.<br>><br>> When used correctly, the combination of dichloroisocyanurates and<br>> cyanuric acid stabilizers provides long lasting chlorine, good<br>> solubility, ease of application, and will not affect the pH of the<br>> water.\[2\](#nRDiO){#cite-nRDiO .citation_link}<br><br>Early swimming garments were made of wool, which allowed for bacteria<br>growth and wreaked havoc on early sand filtration systems, which were<br>primarily used to filter bacteria. Bathing garments did not become<br>mainstream until the early 50s and the development and popularization of<br>fabrics like Lycra and Spandex.\[3\](#XfBTz){#cite-XfBTz<br>.citation_link}<br><br>Once good sanitization was available for swimming pool water, the<br>necessity for nude swimming was obviated, and as gender integration in<br>public school swimming pools became more widespread and filtration<br>systems did not suffer ill effects due to modern fabrics in swimming<br>garments, swimming using bathing suits became the standard.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-owENO){.citation_index} [[Nude swimming -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cb37a8&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_swimming%23Indoor_pools){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-nRDiO){.citation_index}<br>[1(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=654792&url=https://msuweb.montclair.edu/~olsenk/pool.htm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="montclair.edu"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[3\](#cite-XfBTz){.citation_index} [[Spandex -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=114b91&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandex){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
