<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I was on Copaxone for 7 years. It worked great, until it didn't. It just<br>quit working, and I got new lesions and new symptoms. It was severe<br>enough that it was time to change.<br><br>I used Tysabri for 18 months. This medicine worked better than any other<br>medicine I've ever been on. It worked so well, that some of my lesions<br>actually started to *shrink* while I was on it. Downside: it is<br>metabolized by the liver, like my depression medication was (I was on<br>Wellbutrin XL and Cymbalta at the time). Tysabri is taken monthly, by<br>infusion. So over the course of the month, as the level of Tysabri<br>changed its quantity in my bloodstream, my liver needed time to catch up<br>to the change, which caused over- or under-metabolization of my<br>Wellbutrin and Cymbalta, which negatively affected my mood and<br>depression. My mood was a roller coaster every month. Apparently, I was<br>a bear to live with.<br><br>I got off of Tysabri and moved to Gilenya (the first drug I used that I<br>didn't have to stick myself to use) and so far, it's been okay. I'm no<br>fan of the side effects, but it seems to be keeping the MS under<br>control, and you can't argue with success.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
