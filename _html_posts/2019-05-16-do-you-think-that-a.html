<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you think that a \"sex strike,\" as a way to combat anti-abortion<br>laws is a good idea?**<br><br>*YES!!!!!!!! THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC IDEA!!!!!*<br><br>However, not for the reasons its organizers had in mind.<br><br>1.  The anti-abortion law ultimately aims to reduce the number of<br>    abortions. A sex strike voluntarily decreases the number of<br>    abortions by voluntarily preventing unwanted pregnancies in the<br>    first place. So they are actually *helping* the pro-life cause.<br>    Thank you.<br>2.  They are protesting control over women's bodies by exerting control<br>    over other women's bodies. If you must be hypocritical in order to<br>    make your point, you likely have a very weak position to begin with.<br>3.  Conservative men and conservative women (who already have a modicum<br>    of self-control) won't be affected at all by this.<br>4.  Since children generally ideologically follow their parents, this<br>    will trigger an increase in conservative children, which will also<br>    decrease the need for anti-abortion laws.<br><br>Lol. Just lol.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
