<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We had some frequent flyers I met in medium security in Cañon City, CO,<br>who knew the exact crime they would commit at the right time so that<br>they would stay in medium security for the rest of their natural days. A<br>\"retirement plan\" of sorts. I do wonder how it worked out for them. I<br>could see a dozen or so ways that could go sideways in a hurry. Then<br>they end up in Supermax in Florence instead of Med Sec in Cañon.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-confess-to-crimes-they-didnt-commit/answer/Tim-Dees<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
