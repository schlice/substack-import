<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How would I go about changing mobile network and buying a new mobile<br>plan if I am under 18?**<br><br>There are few people under 18 who are paying their own way these days.<br>Few have a job that allows them to sign up with a carrier on their own<br>without their parents' assistance.<br><br>But if you do, good for you! You are an enterprising individual, and<br>you'll do well in whatever you decide to do.<br><br>If you can show the carrier that you make a steady income, you should be<br>able to sign up for a wireless plan on your own.<br><br>That said, however, in order to *enter into a contract* with a wireless<br>carrier, you have to be 18. If you are under 18 (between 13 and 17 for<br>most US carriers), you will need permission from your parent or guardian<br>to enter into a contract.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
