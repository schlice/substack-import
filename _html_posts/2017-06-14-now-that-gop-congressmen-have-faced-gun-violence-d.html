<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If, by gun control, you mean "using two hands," then I'd agree.<br><br>If, by gun control, you mean increasing laws so that lawful citizens<br>lose access to guns, then most assuredly no.<br><br>No one in their right minds believes that "yet another law" would stop a<br>crazed gunman. Because if the crazed gunman didn't have a gun, he'd use<br>a knife. Or a car. Or a bomb. Because he's *crazy*.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
