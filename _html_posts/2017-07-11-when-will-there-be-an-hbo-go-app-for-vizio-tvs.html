<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It does not appear that HBO Go is supported on Vizio Smart TVs. Note<br>that HBO Go (the service included with a traditional HBO subscription<br>through your cable or satellite provider) and HBO NOW (the standalone<br>service you can purchase at any time) are both supported on the same<br>list of devices.<br><br>Clearly, there is either an incompatibility between Vizio's system of<br>apps and the HBO apps, or there is a contractual issue between HBO and<br>Vizio that is preventing the app from being fielded on Vizio TVs. This<br>normally has something to do with supportability and how much access<br>Vizio demands to HBO's code, and vice versa. For example, HBO may demand<br>more control over their own software (i.e. for support or upgrade) than<br>Vizio is prepared or even able to offer. If they can't reach an<br>agreement on those points, the app doesn't get fielded. Note that I do<br>not know the actual reason why the HBO family of apps is not on Vizio<br>Smart TVs; I am merely explaining why these apps sometimes don't make it<br>on. I don't know if Vizio and HBO are working to get their apps natively<br>supported within Vizio's app framework. This is all just general<br>information.<br><br>It looks like you will have to use a compatible streaming device to use<br>HBO Go or HBO NOW, such as an Apple TV, Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV or<br>Fire TV Stick, or a compatible gaming console (PlayStation or Xbox).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
