<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Question Details:<br><br>> *If a mob encircles a car and attacks it, can the driver drive off?<br>> (this assumes that his path is blocked by the mob, so he will<br>> inevitably run over a few people)*<br><br>You would have to make the case that you were in fear for your life.<br>If it can be reasonably asserted that you felt in fear of your life, or<br>felt fear of serious bodily harm, you can use whatever force necessary,<br>up to and including deadly force, to overcome that threat.<br><br>Using your car to get away from the attackers (especially if you know<br>you're going to hit them) is reasonably going to be considered deadly<br>force. You must be prepared to defend yourself against the charge that<br>you used deadly force. You must be able to articulate that you were<br>afraid you were going to die, or you were going to be seriously hurt.<br>Additionally, you will be charged with leaving the scene of an accident<br>in which someone was either hurt or killed, which is also a felony.<br><br>If your car was encircled by a mob and you had to drive over them to get<br>away, you should **immediately drive to the nearest police station and<br>turn yourself in, and retain a criminal defense attorney from your<br>mobile phone on the way.** Immediately driving to the police station<br>would go a long way to convincing authorities that you had no intention<br>of not being responsible for your own actions.<br><br>Don't forget, you did use deadly force. You will likely be arrested<br>until the District Attorney investigates. At the very least, you will be<br>processed and released on your own recognizance. Be prepared for that,<br>too. But stand by your assertion that you were in fear for your life. If<br>your fear was reasonable, the self-defense argument should help you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
