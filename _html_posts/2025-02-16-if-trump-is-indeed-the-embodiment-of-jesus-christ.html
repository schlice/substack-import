title: '"If Trump is indeed the embodiment of Jesus Christ, as is believed by millions
  of the MAGA faithful, then why did he let it rain all over the Daytona 500, which
  stopped the race after a mere 11 laps, even though Trump was in attendance?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Well you know, as with all things God (oh sorry, I mean Trump) does,<br>there is an ultimate purpose that you or I cannot see or comprehend. So<br>there is a reason God (oh sorry, I did it again, I mean Trump) made it<br>rain on the Daytona 500.<br><br>Now, I have it on good authority (but I'm not telling you where) that if<br>he didn't stop the race, there was going to be a massive crash and a<br>driver was going to be killed, so he was actually saving that driver's<br>life. But don't tell anyone I told you.<br><br>\<br><br>***NOTE: For the low-information readers, this entire answer was<br>sarcasm. Millions of MAGA faithful. I just love this stuff!***<br><br>***SECOND NOTE: If you don't know what sarcasm is, and you actually<br>believe that Trump is God, or if you actually believe that millions of<br>people believe Trump is God, throw away your cell phone and your<br>computer right now, you don't belong on the Internet. You can have a<br>flip phone from the 90s, but that's it.***<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
