<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What makes you feel like you're being brainwahsed? Are you being<br>indoctrinated against your will? Because if you don't want to be there,<br>*don't go*.<br><br>The cool thing about this life and the free will that comes along with<br>it is that if you don't want to believe in the truth of Christianity,<br>*you are free to reject it*. This ability to make choices---even to<br>reject the truth---makes us rational creatures and allows us to choose<br>our own eternal destiny.<br><br>And to make sure your choice is truly free, you exist in a world filled<br>with evidence of God's existence, but without His direct presence, which<br>would be so overwhelming as to negate your free will.<br><br>God has left enough evidence in this life to convince anyone *willing to<br>believe*, but He has also left just enough ambiguity so as to not coerce<br>*the unwilling*. That's how much He cares about respecting your free<br>will.<br><br>It's not about evidence. It's about volition.<br><br>TL;DR: If you don't want to believe, *don't.* No one will force you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
