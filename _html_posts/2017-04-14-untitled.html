<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You are correct, you are not permitted to intervene. The best you can do<br>is to record the situation and provide it to the person so that he and<br>his lawyers can use it as evidence if they decide to press charges.<br><br>But let's be fair: you really believe that police are going to handcuff<br>a person and continue beating him? That's just stupid, and it's illegal.<br>Cops know this, and they also know that there are no fewer than 10 cell<br>phone cameras recording their every move every time they step out of<br>that car, so they know that they better be on the straight and narrow<br>when people are around.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-it-illegal-to-catch-up-on-an-overly-agressive-police-intervention/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
