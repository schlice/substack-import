<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do private clubs, private organizations have the right to determine<br>who may join?**<br><br>Yes, with caveats.<br><br>Private clubs and organizations can make rules about who may join.<br>However, they may not be exclusive in violation of the law. The Civil<br>Rights Act of 1964 makes it illegal to discriminate on the basis of<br>race, color, religion, biological sex, or national origin. Additionally,<br>some states and cities have gone further and added sexual orientation to<br>their own civil rights laws.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
