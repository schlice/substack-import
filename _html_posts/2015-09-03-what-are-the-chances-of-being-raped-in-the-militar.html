<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The risk is lower than out in public, in general.<br>Especially if you are on a military installation.\<br>\<br>The chances are not non-existent, as I have seen cases come through the<br>military legal system involving rapes. The percentage is much lower than<br>the percentage in society, accounting for the different populations as<br>well. But you do need to understand that the military is made up of<br>people, and in general, while military members are people who hold<br>themselves to a higher standard, some do not. That percentage is much<br>lower than the corresponding percentage in the general public.\<br>\<br>I think you\'re far more likely to get in trouble for having consentual<br>sex with someone with whom you are disallowed by policy (i.e.<br>fraternization) than you are to be raped.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
