<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [[[Cliff<br>G.](https://www.quora.com/profile/Cliff-G-13)]{.qlink_container} is of<br>course correct. If you had asked \"If someone tries to punch you and you<br>dodge it and then you take out a gun and shoot him, will you be charged<br>for murder?\" this would be an example of using a higher level of force<br>than necessary to meet the threat and would probably not be covered<br>under self-defense. You probably wouldn\'t be charged with murder, but<br>you might be charged with voluntary manslaughter. But this too varies by<br>jurisdiction. There are exceptions though, especially a very large<br>difference in size (i.e. you\'re extremely small and your attacker is<br>extremely large), where using a gun could still be considered valid<br>self-defense. The short answer is \"it depends on the laws in your<br>jurisdiction\"\<br>\<br>In your scenario, you met a punch/kick with a punch/kick. This would<br>probably be considered equal force and would probably be valid as<br>self-defense. Exceptions might be if you were militarily trained or<br>trained in martial arts. These people actually know how to kick someone<br>and kill them. That death-by-kick may not be defensible as<br>self-defense.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
