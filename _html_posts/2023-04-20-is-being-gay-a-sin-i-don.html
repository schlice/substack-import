<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The problem is that people have a hard time distinguishing between<br>*temptation* and *sinful acts*. In general, temptation to sin is not<br>sinful, but sinful acts are.<br><br>In other words, having a homosexual temptation is not sinful. Allowing<br>that temptation to go further into homosexual thoughts or homosexual sex<br>is sinful.<br><br>Just look at King David in the Bible. Or if you don't want to read the<br>story of David and Bathsheba, you can watch the old movie starring Cary<br>Grant. Same difference. Basically, David was up on his palace rooftop<br>one night when he saw Bathsheba in a nearby home taking a bath.<br><br>> It happened, late one afternoon, when David arose from his couch and<br>> was walking on the roof of the king's house, that he saw from the roof<br>> a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful. - 2 Samuel 11:2 ESV<br><br>David saw her accidentally; that was temptation. **But his sin occurred<br>when he didn't look away**. He kept looking, and he thought that she<br>"was very beautiful." His sin in thought led him to sin in action. The<br>accidental view wasn't a sin. **Allowing his mind to continue the<br>thought was.**<br><br>The Bible does indeed say that homosexual sex is sinful. The Bible is<br>replete with admonitions against homosexual behavior (all quotes from<br>NIV):<br><br>> Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that<br>> is detestable. --- Leviticus 18:22<br>><br>> If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman,<br>> both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to<br>> death; their blood will be on their own heads. --- Leviticus 20:13 ยน<br>><br>> Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of<br>> God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters<br>> nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the<br>> greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the<br>> kingdom of God. --- 1 Corinthians 6:9-10<br>><br>> We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for<br>> lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and<br>> irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for<br>> murderers, for the sexually immoral, for those practicing<br>> homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers---and for<br>> whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine --- 1 Timothy 1:9-10<br><br>And lest you think that only gay men are implicated in the Bible,<br>lesbians are also specifically called out:<br><br>> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their<br>> women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the<br>> same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were<br>> inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with<br>> other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.<br>> --- Romans 1:26--27<br><br>These passages are so clear that they defy reinterpretation. It's<br>intellectually dishonest to claim that Christians are misinterpreting<br>the Bible because of some prejudice against homosexuals.<br><br>\<br><br>But take heart, because we're *all* sinners. All of us have fallen short<br>of the glory of God. But God forgives those who repent of their sin and<br>turn to Him for salvation. If you truly repent (turn away) from your sin<br>and believe that Christ is your savior, He will give you the power to<br>overcome your sinful urges.<br><br>> No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is<br>> faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but<br>> with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you<br>> may be able to endure it. --- 1 Corinthians 10:13 ESV<br><br>All you gotta do is *ask*.<br><br>\<br><br>*ยน Remember the context: the book of Leviticus details God's commands<br>for the Jews, who had literally been slaves for generations and had no<br>idea how to live in community with each other without some form of<br>overlord controlling their lives.* ***We do not believe today that<br>homosexuals should be killed.*** *While homosexuality is a sin, we do<br>not kill people for committing sins. The rules were different back then.<br>Jesus literally fulfilled the law so the old law no longer applies.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
