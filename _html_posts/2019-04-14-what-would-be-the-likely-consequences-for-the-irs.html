<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What would be the likely consequences for the IRS if it didn't comply<br>with the House\'s request for Trump\'s tax returns?**<br><br>Congress will have to file suit against the IRS, and then the IRS will<br>get to explain why Congress' request is not in line with IRS regulation<br>section 6103(f).<br><br>The purpose of retrieving tax returns under 6103(f) is to audit the IRS,<br>and ensure that the IRS is following applicable law. It is also to be<br>used in research for legislation. Congress can check to see that the IRS<br>is implementing tax code correctly and fairly. Congress can also ensure<br>that the IRS is properly auditing the President's tax returns.<br><br>*This* Congress, on the other hand, is attempting to use 6103(f) to<br>audit an individual, not the IRS.<br><br>You can tell because Congress requested tax returns for at least one or<br>two years (I can't remember which off the top of my head) before the<br>President was actually president. This indicates that they are<br>attempting to check on the IRS' treatment of *this* taxpayer, not how<br>the IRS operates. This implies that this request is more about the<br>individual taxpayer than the IRS' treatment of that taxpayer.<br><br>Let's be clear: **no law gives Congress the power to audit any<br>individual taxpayer. That is exclusively the IRS' job**. The law is<br>in place so that Congress can oversee the IRS, unless Congress is<br>investigating a specific tax-related crime. There is no tax-related<br>crime which the President is accused of committing. The law does not<br>allow Congress to go on fishing expeditions, which this clearly is.<br><br>Because Congress' intent is clear from both what they have publicly<br>stated and from the details of their request, the IRS will likely refuse<br>the request. If they have questions about how the IRS handled the<br>President's tax returns, they can subpoena any member of the IRS to<br>testify to that handling. There is no need to request confidential tax<br>returns in order to understand how they handled those returns.<br><br>Additionally, if they want to ensure that the IRS is handling the<br>President's returns correctly, they should only be requesting the<br>returns from when he was President, not for at least a year or two<br>*before* he was President.<br><br>Finally, it's clear that there is at least a better than average chance<br>that once Congress gets hold of those returns, someone is going to leak<br>them. While I'm sure it's not quite a huge deal for the President, it is<br>indeed a huge deal for any companies which he owns which are reported on<br>his return. It could potentially reveal a great deal of information<br>about how his companies run (not things they did illegally, but just how<br>they operate) which could prove to be financially ruinous to those<br>companies.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
