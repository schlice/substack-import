<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Loss of appetite and its attendant weight loss are not customary<br>symptoms of MS. That said, everyone experiences MS differently, and no<br>two MS patients will experience symptoms in exactly the same way, even<br>when the symptoms are the same.<br><br>It's possible that some other things may be going on:<br><br>- Dysphagia. If a person has swallowing problems, which do occur with<br>  MS, they may subconsciously avoid eating, or eat less.<br>- Depression. Neurological and immune changes can cause mood swings and<br>  irritability, and depression is one of the most common symptoms of MS.<br>  Loss of appetite is a symptom of depression. Depression is so common<br>  because it can either be a primary symptom (i.e. caused directly by<br>  neurological changes), or can be a tertiary symptom (i.e. brought on<br>  by the effect of the other changes in lifestyle).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
