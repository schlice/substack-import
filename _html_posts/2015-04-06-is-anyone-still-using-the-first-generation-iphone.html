<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The problem you run into is that applications are<br>continually updated and enhanced to take advantage of newer hardware,<br>screen resolutions, and memory. Without upgrading the hardware, you\'ll<br>find it difficult to run newer applications.\<br>\<br>There will be older versions of applications available for some time<br>that you can run in some circumstances, but not all.\<br>\<br>So usability in terms of applications will be limited.\<br>\<br>Core functionality (telephone and SMS functionality) will still work<br>correctly, but any other application functionality will be severely<br>limited.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
