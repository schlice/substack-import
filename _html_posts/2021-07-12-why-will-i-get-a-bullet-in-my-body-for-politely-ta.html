<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We can really only answer this question when you can explain how you can<br>"politely" take away someone's property.<br><br>You can buy the property from them, but that may get a little<br>expensive for you.<br><br>You can steal the property from them, but the police might have<br>something to say about that. Also, it's not very polite, and it might<br>get you a bullet in your body if you break into their house to steal<br>their property.<br><br>You can ask them to simply give you their property. You can expect<br>that they probably won't though.<br><br>Unless you can tell me how you intend to "politely" dispossess someone<br>of their legally-acquired property, there's really no way we can help<br>you here.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why will I get a bullet in my body for politely taking away guns from<br>people in America to stop mass shootings?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
