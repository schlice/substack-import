<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Since I am not a militant vaxxer, nor am I anti-cruise, I feel like I<br>can actually answer your question.<br><br>The answer is: ***when they have taken enough financial losses to<br>finally admit defeat and start returning life to normal.***<br><br>The CDC allowed the Conditional Sail Order (CSO) mandating 100%<br>vaccinated passengers to expire on January 15, 2022. At that time, they<br>*recommended* the cruise lines voluntarily follow the [[COIVD-19<br>Program for Cruise<br>Ships](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ee704f&url=https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/cruise/management/technical-instructions-for-cruise-ships.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cdc.gov"}]{.qlink_container}. *On January 15th,* all major<br>cruise lines did opt in to the program. The program includes being<br>labeled as a "good boy" on the CDC's list of [[Cruise Line<br>Status](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f81c12&url=https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/cruise/cruise-ship-color-status.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cdc.gov"}]{.qlink_container} if you have 95% of your<br>passengers (excluding children) fully vaccinated, and being labeled as a<br>"bad boy" if you didn't have 95% of your passengers and crew<br>vaccinated.\* The major cruise lines, of course, opted in to the program<br>by creating health and safety rules which demanded that all passengers<br>and crew be fully vaccinated, up to date, and tested before boarding.<br><br>Some people, especially those who had COVID-19 and recovered (and now<br>that Omicron has literally swept the population, that number is growing<br>by leaps and bounds), are simply disinterested in being vaccinated<br>against a virus for which they already have immunity. So they won't<br>sail, despite their love for cruising.<br><br>And the cruise lines have been feeling the pinch of cruisers "opting<br>out" of cruising. They have lost *billions* in revenue since the start<br>of the pandemic. And they know full well that if they continue like<br>this, it won't be long before their reserve coffers run dry and they're<br>out of business. They built up massive war chests before the pandemic<br>and they've been living off of those reserves, but they can't keep doing<br>that forever.<br><br>In other words, *they cannot keep operating like this and expect to stay<br>in business.*<br><br>At some point, some major cruise line will *be forced* to make the<br>difficult decision to allow unvaccinated passengers on board. And it<br>will be a *windfall* for that cruise line. They'll be booked solid once<br>they make the announcement. There is definitely pent-up demand for<br>cruising, but people want *normal* cruising where they can *relax*. They<br>don't want this virus panic on the ship. They want to *get away* from<br>virus panic.<br><br>\* Of course, they didn't call them "good boy" and "bad boy." They<br>called them the more politically-correct terms of "Highly Vaccinated" or<br>"Not Highly Vaccinated."<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>When will unvaccinated people be allowed to cruise again?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
