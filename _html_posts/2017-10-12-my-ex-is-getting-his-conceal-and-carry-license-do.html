<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you own the home and he is not on the deed, you can inform him that<br>firearms, either openly carried or concealed, are not welcome in your<br>home. Since this is a custody thing and since courts and lawyers are<br>involved, I recommend you send a certified letter to inform him of your<br>requirement. Businesses restrict weapons all the time even when the law<br>allows properly registered persons to conceal firearms. You might check<br>your local laws to see if there is a requirement for signage to be<br>posted in a private residence which does not permit firearms; I know<br>there are some requirements for businesses in this category in some<br>states.<br><br>You cannot personally enforce this request, for several reasons:<br><br>1.  If the weapon is concealed, you'll probably never know he has it.<br>2.  If you do see the weapon, your only recourse is to ask him to leave<br>    and return without it. If he refuses, it is the equivalent of<br>    trespassing, and you would have to call the police to assist you<br>    with enforcing your trespassing directive.<br><br>In either case, I would advise you to remember that you are doing what<br>you are doing *for your daughter*. I would ask you to remember that, and<br>try not to cause a scene with her present. Instead, I would take note of<br>the situation and talk to him privately at another time, asking him why<br>he can't respect your boundaries (which may be one of the reasons you<br>got divorced in the first place, but that's a bit off topic). A gun safe<br>which can be locked in a car is very inexpensive (less that \$50), and<br>anyone who carries concealed should have one for those situations in<br>which you can't bring a firearm somewhere (like a school), so you can<br>just lock it in the safe in the car and you're good. It's really not<br>difficult to do what you asked.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
