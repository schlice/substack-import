<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, it's great to have a goal. And being a fighter pilot is a<br>great goal.<br><br>But in the military, you are an officer first, and a job second.<br><br>I'll tell you why I know this.<br><br>My particular class had over 1000 PQ (pilot qualified) cadets in it. But<br>the early 90s saw the military shrinking in size after Desert Storm, a<br>process called a *drawdown*. The problem they were facing in 1992 and<br>1993 was that there were too many pilots coming out of UPT<br>(Undergraduate Pilot Training) and not enough airframes for them to fly.<br>To address the immediate problem, the Air Force was placing pilots in<br>non-flying jobs because we had nowhere else to put them, and no planes<br>to give them.<br><br>The next thing the Air Force did was to slow down the amount of people<br>going *into* UPT, meaning they cut back on the number of pilot slots in<br>UPT. *That directly affected the number of pilot slots for my class.*<br>With over 1000 pilot qualified cadets, we got 225 pilot slots.<br>That meant that 3/4ths of us PQ cadets were not going to fly.<br><br>We learned this just before we were to incur an Active Duty Service<br>Commitment from attending USAFA (at the beginning of our junior year),<br>so we had a chance to leave with no commitment. We could take our<br>credits to a civilian university, and with the number of credit hours<br>cadets carry, we probably could have graduated with a BS in just one<br>more year.<br><br>But only a handful of cadets left.<br><br>*Why*?<br><br>Because we are Air Force officers first*,* *and jobs second.*<br><br>An important lesson to learn is that you go where the military tells you<br>that you are needed. It may not be the most glamorous job, or the most<br>glamorous location, or the most prestigious career field, but the Air<br>Force will take care of you.<br><br>I was commissioned as a Communications Officer (AFSC 33S). It was a good<br>job. I worked in NORAD. That was fun.<br><br>Anyway, the moral of the story is you're an officer first, and a job<br>second.<br><br>\<br><br>Okay, now that that's out of the way, how do you maximize your chance of<br>being a fighter pilot? Statistically, there are more pilots in the *Air<br>Force* (the name kinda gives it away) then there are in the Navy. No<br>disrespect meant at all to my naval aviator brethren, but there simply<br>are far fewer of you to go around. So if you want to *maximize* your<br>chance to become a fighter pilot, join the Air Force.<br><br>However, actual in-aircraft fighter pilot slots are diminishing. RPA<br>pilots are ramping up. RPA is short for Remotely Piloted Aircraft.<br>*Drones*.<br><br>RPA pilots are *in demand* right now.<br><br>That doesn't mean we don't still need in-aircraft pilots. We do. But<br>those slots are diminishing as well, so be aware of that.<br><br>\<br><br>How to prepare for a service academy in middle school? Here's some<br>practical things you can do:<br><br>- Get good grades. Keep your grades as good as you can get them. Focus<br>  on doing really well in your *high school* classes, don't worry so<br>  much about taking things like AP or College level classes. Those are<br>  less important than doing really well in school.<br>- Participate in a team sport. If you don't have one yet, join one. You<br>  don't have to be the Team Captain or the best player on the team, but<br>  consistently being a valuable team member will be important.<br>- Start thinking about what you can do in your community, outside of<br>  school. Maybe some volunteer work, or participating in your church.<br><br>The academies follow the "whole person" concept. They don't want someone<br>who is a "one-trick pony." They don't want the guy who is a 4.5 GPA but<br>hasn't participated in a team sport or did any community service. They<br>want the guy who is the 3.75 GPA who was the MVP of the cross country<br>team and who serves in his church and volunteers at the library. That's<br>an example, but you get the point. They are looking for what we used to<br>call the "well-rounded" applicant. But you need to be well-rounded and<br>good at everything that you do. Good grades, good athletically, and a<br>history of community involvement. Proven leadership in multiple areas is<br>better than proven leadership in just one area.<br><br>Hope that helps. If you have more questions, you can visit the Air Force<br>Academy admissions website. It's good to check it out now since it has<br>lots of helpful information on how to prepare.<br><br>[https://www.academyadmissions.com/(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60e33c&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
