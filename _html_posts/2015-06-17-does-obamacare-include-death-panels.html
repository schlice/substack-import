<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The Independent Payment Advisory Panel (or Independent<br>Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB) is an independent panel which is<br>responsible for keeping Medicare costs down. Sounds innocent enough. The<br>rub is how they plan on doing so.\<br>\<br>The former chief of Medicare [[has<br>said](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=df8c6b&url=http://dailycaller.com/2010/05/27/death-panels-were-an-overblown-claim-until-now/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="dailycaller.com"}]{.qlink_container} that it\'s cheaper to<br>let people die (or in more technical terms, to simply provide palliative<br>care) than to treat them with traditional treatments. Obamacare<br>therefore invented this board, which is truly independent. No<br>Congressional oversight, and no input from doctors either. This board<br>essentially gets to make the decisions as to what doctors you can see,<br>what treatments you can get, and whether or not you can get care at<br>all.\<br>\<br>Sounds like a death panel to me. If it walks like a duck\...\<br>\<br>[Forbes(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=378bfa&url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/sallypipes/2015/06/15/two-more-pieces-of-obamacare-may-be-on-their-way-out/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="forbes.com"}]{.qlink_container} says, \"If Medicare spending<br>exceeds limits set by law, then IPAB can impose its own set of cost<br>controls\... Once IPAB settles on its cuts, lawmakers must either offer<br>an alternative plan that cuts the same level of spending or muster a<br>super-majority to block the Board\'s cuts from taking effect.\" IPAB<br>independently decides what care to deliver, and unless Congress can<br>muster a super-majority (ha ha), it\'s unlikely that anyone can stop<br>it.\<br>\<br>Both sides of the aisle are pushing to abolish IPAB. Many groups which<br>are in favor of the ACA are pushing for IPAB\'s disbandment. In<br>committee alone, the repeal motion had [[20 Democratic<br>co-sponsors.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e1d75b&url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/245109-house-gops-focus-on-obamacare-excludes-court-case){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="thehill.com"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>\<br>As the opposition to this law pointed out before its inception, the cost<br>to take care of sick people, which is the bulk of people using the<br>coverage, is too high for the program to bear. Already, insurance<br>providers are pushing for rate hikes in the state Exchanges, in some<br>states as high as 51%. [[Only<br>Maine](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b65418&url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/health-insurers-seek-hefty-rate-boosts-1432244042){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wsj.com"}]{.qlink_container} has not sought to increase<br>rates.
