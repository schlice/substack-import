<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, any time someone says "Why does this seem wrong" it's<br>usually because it is.<br><br>So let's look at the two pieces of legislation Gov DeSantis signed into<br>law on April 12th of this year.<br><br>> SB 184 does the following:<br>><br>> - Prohibits the harassment of a police officer or first responder who<br>>   is actively doing his or her job.<br>> - This law pertains to any person who has received a verbal warning<br>>   not to approach an officer and who approaches with the intent to<br>>   interfere with their official duties, threaten with physical harm,<br>>   or harass the officer.<br>> - Under this bill, an individual who harasses a law enforcement<br>>   officer in the line of duty will be charged with a second-degree<br>>   misdemeanor.<br>><br>> HB 601 does the following:<br>><br>> - Prevents anti-police activists from carrying out extrajudicial<br>>   investigations against law enforcement.<br>> - Codifies the creation of "Civilian Oversight Boards" to ensure they<br>>   are directed by a county sheriff or chief of police and are<br>>   comprised of at least three to seven members, all of whom are<br>>   appointed by the sheriff or chief of police.<br>>   - At least one member must be a retired law enforcement officer.<br>> - Ensures that misconduct allegations will be investigated by those<br>>   properly trained and equipped to handle such investigations, such as<br>>   Internal Affairs Departments or the Criminal Justice Standards and<br>>   Training Commission (CJSTC).<br>> - Increases all county sheriffs' base salaries by \$5,000 for each<br>>   population group.\[1\](#LZwxk){#cite-LZwxk .citation_link}<br><br>So now that we have the details about what was signed, let's look at the<br>questions.<br><br>> **The new rules say law enforcement now has oversight over the<br>> civilian oversight of law enforcement.**<br><br>No, the new rule says that state law has oversight over the civilian<br>oversight of law enforcement. The Sheriff only has the authority to<br>appoint the civilians to the Board, and at least one of the people on<br>the Board must be a retired officer. In this way, we can ensure that the<br>people who man these Boards are not only impartial, but have the<br>capacity to rationally review these incidents, recommending punishment<br>when necessary, but not excessively.<br><br>While it is commendable that law enforcement appointed civilian<br>oversight boards in the past (they are under no obligation to do so<br>until now), in the past it was local governments that did it outside of<br>the oversight of the department. While that seems to be transparent, the<br>people who often volunteered to serve on these boards did so because<br>they are specifically anti-police, and some of these civilian oversight<br>boards would use their platform to harass individual officers. This is a<br>problem that the Governor corrected.<br><br>Critics argue that extrajudicial investigations are imperative, because<br>the police allegedly will cover up crimes that their own commit.<br><br>Of course, this fails to realize that law enforcement activity is<br>subject to not only their department's review, but to the district<br>attorney who investigates crimes, and the Department of Justice who<br>reviews each incident to determine if the defendant's rights were<br>violated. Allegations of officer misconduct can't be swept under the rug<br>as easily as they could back in the 70s.<br><br>Additionally, this is the age where everyone has pocket access to a<br>high-quality camera which can record an incident and share it instantly.<br><br>Finally, thanks to the Biden administration's treatment of officers and<br>his calls to defund the police (which many states did), recruitment of<br>new officers is way down across the country. Florida, as a<br>law-enforcement-friendly state, was in a unique position to protect the<br>rights of officers from some of the radical anti-police elements popping<br>up across the country.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-LZwxk){.citation_index} [[Governor DeSantis Signs<br>Legislation to Protect Florida's Law Enforcement<br>Officers](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=219448&url=https://www.flgov.com/2024/04/12/governor-desantis-signs-legislation-to-protect-floridas-law-enforcement-officers/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="flgov.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
