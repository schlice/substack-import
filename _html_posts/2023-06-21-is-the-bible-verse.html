<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Our friends at<br>[GotQuestions.org(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c2491a&url=http://gotquestions.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container} have already<br>sufficiently answered this question. I really can't add anything to<br>their analysis.<br><br>> In the Bible, the word translated "fear" can mean several things. It<br>> can refer to the terror one feels in a frightening situation<br>> (Deuteronomy 2:25). It can mean "respect" in the way a servant fears<br>> his master and serves him faithfully (Joshua 24:14). Fear can also<br>> denote the reverence or awe a person feels in the presence of<br>> greatness (Isaiah 6:5). The fear of the Lord is a combination of all<br>> of these.<br>><br>> Fear of the Lord can be defined as "the continual awareness that our<br>> loving heavenly Father is watching and evaluating everything we think,<br>> say, and do" (Matthew 12:36; Psalm 139:2; Jeremiah 12:3). As Jesus<br>> told each of the seven churches in Revelation 2---3, "I know your<br>> works." Nothing escapes His attention.<br>><br>> In order to develop the fear of the Lord, we must recognize God for<br>> who He is. We must glimpse with our spirits the power, might, beauty,<br>> and brilliance of the Lord God Almighty (Revelation 11:17; Hosea 12:5;<br>> Isaiah 6:1--5). Those who fear the Lord have a continual awareness of<br>> Him, a deep reverence for Him, and sincere commitment to obey Him.<br>><br>> Proverbs 1:7 says, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of<br>> knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction." This verse gives<br>> us some added insight with its antithetical parallelism---there is a<br>> sharp contrast between the wise life and the foolish life. A wise<br>> person fears/reverences/obeys the Lord; a fool despises God's<br>> instruction and cannot be told what to do. The wise person is wise<br>> because he has started at the starting place; the fool has no<br>> foundation on which to build wisdom.<br>><br>> Romans 1:21--22 speaks of those who "neither glorified him as God nor<br>> gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish<br>> hearts were darkened. Although they claimed to be wise, they became<br>> fools." This is a description of people who try to obtain wisdom while<br>> ignoring God---it cannot be done for the simple reason that God is the<br>> source of wisdom.<br>><br>> The link between the fear of God and wisdom means we cannot possess<br>> wisdom if we recreate God in our own image. Too many people want to<br>> "tame" God into a non-threatening nobody. But, if we redefine the Lord<br>> as a god that makes us feel comfortable, a permissive "buddy" who<br>> exists simply to bless us and give us what we want, we will not fear<br>> Him in the way He deserves to be feared. The Lord God Almighty is far<br>> greater than that, and the fear of the Lord begins when we see Him in<br>> His majesty and power (Revelation 4:11; Job 42:1--2) The Lord shows<br>> Job (and us) a glimpse of His power in Job 38---41 when He describes<br>> His absolute sovereignty over everything.<br>><br>> When the reality of God's true nature has caused us to fall down in<br>> worship, we are then in the right position to gain wisdom. Wisdom is<br>> merely seeing life from God's perspective and responding accordingly.<br>> Wisdom is a priority, and we are told to seek it above all else<br>> (Proverbs 3:13; 16:16). Proverbs is known as the wisdom book, and the<br>> entire second chapter gives a detailed explanation of the value of<br>> gaining wisdom.<br>><br>> Until our hearts are in a right relationship with God, we are unable<br>> to have the "wisdom that comes from heaven" (James 3:17). Without the<br>> fear of the Lord, we may gain knowledge of earthly things and make<br>> some practical choices for this life, but we are missing the one<br>> ingredient that defines a wise person (Psalm 14:1; Exodus 20:3; 34:14;<br>> Jeremiah 25:6; Matthew 22:37). In the parable of the rich farmer, the<br>> rich man had a "wise" and practical plan for his profits, but God said<br>> to him, "You fool!" because the farmer's plans were made with no<br>> thought of God and eternity (Luke 12:16--21).<br>><br>> Without the fear of the Lord, we make final decisions based on our<br>> faulty human understanding (Proverbs 3:5--6). When we incorporate the<br>> fear of the Lord into every moment of our lives, we make decisions<br>> based upon His approval. We live with the knowledge that the Creator<br>> of the universe is intimately involved in our every move. He sees,<br>> knows, and evaluates all our choices, and we will answer to Him (Psalm<br>> 139:1--4).<br>><br>> Our respect for God's majesty causes us to honor Him (Psalm 29:2). Our<br>> gratitude for His mercy causes us to serve Him well (Psalm 2:11;<br>> 107:15). And the understanding that our God of love is also a God of<br>> wrath inspires enough fear to help us stay away from evil (Romans<br>> 1:18; Proverbs 8:13). Sin is foolish; righteousness is wise. When we<br>> live righteously, we are on the path to wisdom, and everyone in our<br>> lives benefits (Proverbs 13:20; 19:8).\[1\](#IUdiQ){#cite-IUdiQ<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-IUdiQ){.citation_index} [[How is the fear of the Lord the<br>beginning of<br>wisdom?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a8e98e&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/fear-Lord-beginning-wisdom.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
