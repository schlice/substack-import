<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can you sue a landlord for wrongful eviction?<br><br>You can sue anyone for anything. The question becomes how likely you'll<br>be to prevail.<br><br>If the landlord followed correct legal procedures for the eviction, then<br>it's highly likely you'll lose any lawsuit you attempt. Legal evictions<br>include a court order, so judicial review has already taken place. This<br>means a judge has looked at the evidence and found that it has enough<br>merit to warrant eviction.<br><br>If your landlord did not do this, and simply evicted you by locking you<br>out of your rental space and throwing your belongings on the street<br>(commonly known as a "self-help eviction"), you may have a case for<br>wrongful eviction.<br><br>I would suggest getting in contact with a tenants rights group in your<br>area, or retaining the services of an attorney in your area who<br>specializes in landlord/tenant cases.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
