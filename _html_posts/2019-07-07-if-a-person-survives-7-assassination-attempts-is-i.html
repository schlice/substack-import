<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a person survives 7 assassination attempts is it a sign that he/she<br>needs to start carrying a handgun?**<br><br>Not even close.<br><br>- If a person survives seven assassination attempts, it's a sign that<br>  they need to improve their security posture.<br>- The decision to start carrying a handgun for personal protection is a<br>  very, er, personal one, and involves many factors, only one of which<br>  being the level of perceived threat a person faces.<br><br>Assassination attempts are part and parcel of being a controversial<br>public figure. There are always going to be whackadoodles out there, and<br>"haters gonna hate," so it's natural that nearly every controversial<br>public figure is going to face assassination attempts.<br><br>But the level of threat against an individual is only one factor which<br>should play in to whether or not anyone should start carrying a handgun.<br>For example:<br><br>- Do I have the time, money, and motivation to train to the extent<br>  needed to effectively carry and use a handgun in my own defense?<br>- Have I thought about what taking a life means? Have I thought through<br>  the potential consequences?<br>- One of the things we say in the concealed carry world is, "every<br>  bullet you fire has a lawyer attached to it." Am I prepared for the<br>  legal nightmare that is certain to follow any time I may have to<br>  use deadly force?<br>- Do I have the temperament to be able to undertake this responsibility?<br>- Can I increase my security posture (i.e. improving my situational<br>  awareness) without seeming like my own whackadoodle?<br><br>The decision to carry a firearm is certainly one that is not to be taken<br>lightly. And the perceived threat alone is just one factor which must be<br>weighed before deciding to carry.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
