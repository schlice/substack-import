<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The short answer is yes.<br><br>The longer answer is "it depends on what you mean by enforcement."<br><br>When you join (or are involuntarily joined to) an HOA, you essentially<br>enter a "contract" under which you agree to follow the rules as they are<br>written by the HOA. One of those rules may be that owners and guests<br>cannot park on the streets overnight (as an example from a former HOA of<br>mine). Doesn't matter if the streets are public or private, if your<br>rules say that you cannot park your car on the streets overnight, then<br>you can't.<br><br>The question becomes what the HOA can do about this.<br><br>Because the HOA does not own the streets, they cannot have the car<br>towed. They cannot "boot" the car until fines are paid. However, they<br>can fine the owner. The HOA can indeed issue fines for parking on a<br>public street when the Governing Documents say that you can't park<br>there.<br><br>There is a lot of confusion on this point, including by lawyers. A lot<br>of that confusion stems from the fact that it's a public street and the<br>HOA has no authority to regulate parking on a public street. However,<br>the HOA has broad authority to regulate the look of the neighborhood,<br>and where and when vehicles are parked definitely impacts the look of<br>the neighborhood. As long as the restrictions are not onerous and as<br>long as they do not impede fair use of the property, and as long as the<br>HOA is not arbitrary or capricious in its enforcement of that rule,<br>courts have generally given the HOA latitude to make the neighborhood<br>look the way they want it to look. That said, it is universally accepted<br>that an HOA cannot boot/tow cars from public streets.<br><br>In my example above from a previous neighborhood where we disallowed<br>overnight parking, we also cited safety as a factor. During the winter<br>(which could see the streets snow-packed and dangerous to drive on), you<br>could have garbage trucks and school buses attempting to navigate the<br>streets simultaneously. When kids are out, you want them as safe as<br>possible. And trying to have all of those competing large vehicles<br>traversing the streets while weaving around parked cars is simply a<br>recipe for disaster. The HOA definitely had a vested interest in<br>safeguarding children in that case.<br><br>In a neighborhood where it is not against the law to park in a<br>particular area, you can still have a CC&R rule which forbids parking,<br>and the HOA can fine you for violating that rule. If you get a<br>particularly zealous lawyer, you *may* be able to fight that one and you<br>*may* win depending on how your local courts lean in terms of who is<br>favored (the homeowner vs the HOA). But you'll still have to fight it in<br>court.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can an HOA in Georgia enforce no parking rules from the covenants on<br>public streets within the subdivision?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
