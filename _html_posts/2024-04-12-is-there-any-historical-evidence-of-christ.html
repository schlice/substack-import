<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are extra-biblical sources which mention Christ and which also<br>mention that His disciples believed He rose from the dead. The proof is<br>circumstantial, and the best evidence of it is found in the Bible. But<br>there are at least ten sources outside of the Bible which not only<br>mention Jesus, but discuss the fact that His disciples believed He rose<br>from the dead.<br><br>Those ten sources are:<br><br>- Josephus<br>- Tacitus, the Roman historian<br>- Pliny the Younger, a Roman politician<br>- Phlegon, a freed slave who wrote histories<br>- Thallus, a first-century historian<br>- Seutonius, a Roman historian<br>- Lucian, a Greek satirist<br>- Celsus, a Roman philosopher<br>- Mara Bar-Serapion, a private citizen who wrote to his son<br>- the Jewish Talmud.<br><br>*NOTE: For a complete listing of mentions of Christ from these sources,<br>see Norman L. Geisler,* ***Baker Encyclopedia of Christian<br>Apologetics*** *(Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker, 1999), 381-385; see also<br>Gary Habermas,* *The Historical Jesus* *(Joplin, Mo.: College Press,<br>1996), chapter 9.*<br><br>These ten sources collectively admit certain facts about early<br>Christianity that help us piece together a storyline that is<br>surprisingly congruent with the New Testament. Piecing together all ten<br>non-Christian references, we see that:<br><br>1.  Jesus lived during time of Tiberius Caesar.<br>2.  He lived a virtuous life.<br>3.  He was a wonder-worker.<br>4.  He had a brother named James.<br>5.  He was acclaimed to be the Messiah.<br>6.  He was crucified under Pontius Pilate.<br>7.  He was crucified on the eve of the Jewish Passover.<br>8.  Darkness and an earthquake occurred when he died.<br>9.  His disciples believed he rose from the dead.<br>10. His disciples were willing to die for their belief.<br>11. Christianity spread rapidly as far as Rome.<br>12. His disciples denied the Roman gods and worshiped Jesus as God.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
