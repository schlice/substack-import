<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There isn't any "non-anecdotal" evidence that police brutality is<br>running rampant. Because it's *all anecdotal*.<br><br>No one collects statistics about "police brutality" that I know of,<br>because there is no one definition of "police brutality" since it's<br>really an opinion. There is only crime and violation of policy. "Police<br>brutality" is very much a media-coined term like "assault weapons."<br>Search police brutality in the Google and you'll find media reports.<br>It's all media-created hype. You may see a video of an officer taking<br>down a criminal. And it looks violent. It looks painful. You may think,<br>"wow, police brutality." But it's all perfectly legal, and complies with<br>department policy. Takedowns are never pretty. They always look way<br>worse than they really are. But they stop the bad guy with the minimum<br>amount of collateral damage and the minimum amount of injury to the bad<br>guy himself (if it's not a lethal force takedown).<br><br>You might be able to find tallies of police officers convicted of<br>murder, but beyond that there is no single agency overseeing all 17,985<br>state and local police departments across the United States, so there<br>are no consistent statistics that show this. Perhaps the US Justice<br>Department may have such statistics.<br><br>Perhaps someone can get them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
