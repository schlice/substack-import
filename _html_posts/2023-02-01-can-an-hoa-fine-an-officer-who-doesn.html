There may also be a<br>process for that Board member removal spelled out in the same section of<br>the Bylaws, but one way or another, if the rule about residency exists,<br>the Board can remove a Board member who violates that rule.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
