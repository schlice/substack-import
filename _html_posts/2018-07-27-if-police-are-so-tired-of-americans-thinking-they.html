<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If police are so tired of Americans thinking they're racist,<br>uneducated, violent, formerly-bullied, lazy, power tripping losers with<br>guns, why aren't they trying to fix that image?**<br><br>1.  How would you propose police fix that image? We have 800,000 police<br>    officers in the United States. The *vast majority* of them are<br>    not any of the ridiculous things you quoted. So how would you<br>    propose that hundreds of thousands of people *who don't have any<br>    problem* try to fix a problem they don't have?<br>2.  What difference in the world does it make to police officers what<br>    *you* think of them? Does it make them do their jobs any<br>    differently? (hint: not at all)<br>3.  Why should changing their image in your eyes be their problem? If<br>    *you* have a problem with police officers, perhaps it's *you* who<br>    should be trying to change how you perceive them. It's not up to<br>    police to change how you see them.<br><br>Police aren't tired of Americans thinking anything at all about them,<br>because it says more about *Americans* than it does about *police*.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
