<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**As a libertarian, do you support laws banning non-medical circumcision<br>of male babies?**<br><br>Libertarians believe that parents have the right to raise their children<br>in the way they see fit, "according to their own standards and beliefs,<br>provided that the rights of children to be free from abuse and neglect<br>are also protected."\[1\](#dxFbh){#cite-dxFbh .citation_link}<br><br>Therefore, in order to support such a law, you have to make the case<br>that circumcision is abuse or neglect.<br><br>While it may be unnecessary cosmetic surgery, it is not harmful and<br>causes no long term damage. No bodily functions are harmed by the<br>surgery. Therefore, it cannot be classified as "abuse" or "neglect."<br><br>Since we have determined that circumcision is cosmetic surgery, in order<br>to support such a law, you have to make the case that parents do not<br>have the right to consent to cosmetic surgery on behalf of the children<br>for whom they are responsible.<br><br>A Libertarian would not make that case.<br><br>Therefore, a Libertarian would not support a law banning non-medical<br>circumcision of male babies.<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance<br>for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough<br>shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion<br>masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your<br>own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.<br>If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"<br>don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything<br>vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a<br>block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-dxFbh){.citation_index} [[2018 Platform \| Libertarian<br>Party](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1aef9e&url=https://www.lp.org/platform/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="lp.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
