<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a test is contrived and only one "religion" is allowed to pass,<br>does that violate freedom of religion and other rights afforded under<br>the US Constitution? If so, should Christians engaged in unlawful<br>testing be prosecuted under the RICO statute?**<br><br>Only if it was the government that administered the test, and if by<br>"failing" the test, you were denied equal access to some government<br>service or benefit, then yes, this test would be illegal. The government<br>cannot show *preference* for any one religion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
