<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The First Amendment has been conflated to grant you the right to express<br>whatever opinion you choose to express.<br><br>The First Amendment, however, says nothing about the consequences of<br>your expression.<br><br>*Just because you have the right to say it does not absolve you of the<br>judgement that will most assuredly follow you based on what you say.*<br><br>Or like I tell my kids all the time: *Just because you* *can*<br>*doesn't mean you* *should.*<br><br>Your employer may look at your speech and determine that your character<br>and your personality is simply not as good a fit as they originally<br>thought in their company. Especially in employment, most work is what is<br>known as "at-will employment." This means that either side in the<br>working arrangement (worker and employer) can choose to terminate the<br>working relationship at any time, for nearly any reason. So long as the<br>termination does not violate the Employment section of the Civil Rights<br>Act (employment cannot be terminated due to race, color, religion, sex,<br>or national origin) or any state or local EEO laws, you can be<br>terminated without cause at any time. In most cases, if you were full<br>time, this also means you qualify for unemployment benefits which might<br>help you while you search for a new job, but the employer does have the<br>right to terminate at any time, just as you have the right to quit at<br>any time.<br><br>New York, California and Washington, DC have specific employment laws<br>that protect you from discrimination based on political activity or<br>political affiliation. Colorado and North Dakota protect you from<br>employment discrimination based on "lawful conduct outside of work." But<br>beyond that, the federal guidelines are normally followed by the states<br>when it comes to political views.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
