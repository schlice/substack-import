<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with all legal answers, this one too is "it depends."<br><br>The crime you are talking about is called conspiracy **to commit a<br>crime. Conspiracy happens when two or more people agree** to commit<br>a crime, and then at least one person makes an overt act in<br>furtherance of that crime.<br><br>- Agreement. The core of conspiracy is a mutual understanding or<br>  plan between two or more people to commit a crime. This agreement can<br>  be express or implied. Conspirators must intend to agree to the<br>  criminal plan and intend for the underlying crime to be committed.<br>  The act of conspiring itself is the crime, and it can be<br>  prosecuted even if the underlying crime is not actually completed. It<br>  can be prosecuted even if one person backs out (but that back-out can<br>  be cited as a mitigating circumstance at sentencing).<br>- Overt act. Most jurisdictions require that *at least one* of the<br>  conspirators take a concrete step (called an *overt act*) to advance<br>  the agreed-upon criminal plan. This can be a physical act, a<br>  communication, or any action that shows progress towards the crime.<br><br>So the answer to the question is yes, the person who backed out is<br>guilty of one crime: conspiracy to commit a crime, even if they back<br>out before the first person actually goes ahead with committing the<br>crime. The person who committed the crime is guilty of two crimes:<br>the actual crime, and conspiracy to commit that crime.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*I am not a lawyer, and this answer is not a substitute for professional<br>legal advice or a solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific<br>facts.
