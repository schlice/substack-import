<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You have not yet received an excellent response to this excellent<br>question. You have some good answers, but not an excellent answer.<br><br>I probably won't give you an excellent answer either, but I'll try to<br>give you an acceptable Christian answer. And that answer is found in the<br>following phrase: the hypostatic union.<br><br>The hypostatic union is the idea that Jesus is both fully human and<br>fully divine. Along with that idea is the notion that the divine didn't<br>influence the human, and the human didn't limit the divine, a concept<br>known as the *Communicatio Idiomatum*. He isn't half-human and<br>half-divine, like some sort of demi-god or some sort of ultra-human. He<br>is 100% human, and 100% divine. Yes, I am aware that adds up to 200%.<br>Nothing is impossible for God.<br><br>Before Jesus was born, He existed. His spirit nature did indeed exist.<br>It's recorded in John 1:1<br><br>> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word<br>> was God.<br><br>This is important because it tells us that the Word (who hasn't been<br>identified yet) is God. He was present at the beginning, when the world<br>was created. You see it in verses 2 and 3:<br><br>> He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made;<br>> without him nothing was made that has been made.<br><br>But at this point, we still don't know who the Word is. We only know the<br>Word was present at the beginning of the world, and that He was<br>responsible for the creation of the world (through Him all things were<br>made). Therefore, we know He is eternal, but that's it, for right now.<br><br>But then, we get another piece of evidence, in verse 14:<br><br>> The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his<br>> glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father,<br>> full of grace and truth<br><br>The Word became flesh. So the Word (which is eternal) took on flesh<br>(which is normally not, at least if "normal" is the current human<br>condition). So Jesus the person did have a beginning, but Jesus God is<br>eternal.<br><br>I know that this is a difficult concept to wrap your brain around; it is<br>for me as well. Nevertheless, this is the Biblical answer. I hope this<br>helps.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
