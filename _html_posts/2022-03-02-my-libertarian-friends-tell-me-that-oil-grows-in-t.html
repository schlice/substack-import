<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No offense, but you need smarter friends.<br><br>Oil doesn't grow in the ground. While oil is formed in the ground, it<br>doesn't "grow" like a plant. And God may have created the world and set<br>the conditions under which oil can develop, but he doesn't make the oil<br>appear in the ground any more than he actually moves my muscles to make<br>me walk. He built the world and created the natural rules under which<br>the world operates, but he doesn't directly "cause the oil to appear<br>with magic."<br><br>> Petroleum, also called crude oil, is a fossil fuel. Like coal and<br>> natural gas, petroleum was formed from the remains of ancient marine<br>> organisms, such as plants, algae, and bacteria. Over millions of years<br>> of intense heat and pressure, these organic remains (fossils)<br>> transformed into carbon-rich substances we rely on as raw materials<br>> for fuel and a wide variety of products.\[1\](#nDnTG){#cite-nDnTG<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>My Libertarian friends tell me that oil grows in the ground, and my<br>Christian friends tell me that God makes the oil appear in the ground<br>with magic.
