<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [It\'s hard to say this, but if that\'s exactly what your<br/>neurologist told you, he\'s wrong.\<br/>\<br/>What he may have meant to say is that your immune system will not attack<br/>the myelin with the same vigor when you are older as it does now.<br/>Everyone\'s immune systems slow somewhat as they age, so the damage will<br/>occur naturally more slowly.\<br/>\<br/>However, this does not translate to \"your MS will get better.\" MS is a<br/>progressive disease, it does not revert. Gliosis of nerve cells is<br/>irreversible using today\'s (2014) medical technology. Once it happens,<br/>the damage is done and cannot be reversed. So in that respect,<br/>regardless of how slowly or how quickly your immune system carries out<br/>its attacks on you, once it causes gliosis, those nerve cells are<br/>damaged and that damage is irreversible. So \"your MS will get better\"<br/>should not be taken to mean that your symptoms will start to reverse<br/>themselves.\<br/>\<br/>For those with MS, we have to stay on some type of immunomodulator or<br/>immunosuppressant in order to manage the disease. We cannot rely on \"it<br/>will get better as you get older\" because as far as disease progression<br/>goes, it doesn\'t get \"better.\"]<br/><br/>*Disclaimer:*<br/><br/>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br/>substitute for professional medical advice.
