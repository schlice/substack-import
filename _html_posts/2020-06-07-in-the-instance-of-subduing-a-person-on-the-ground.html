<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is placing the knee on the back of the neck of the person you are<br>arresting part of police training?**<br><br>So as you've probably read by now, training varies, and department<br>policy when it comes to use of force also varies between departments so<br>that you can appropriately meet the needs of your locality.<br><br>There was a control technique (never one I was taught, nor anyone I know<br>of) which involved an officer kneeling on a suspect with BOTH KNEES, one<br>knee at the torso and the other knee at the base of the neck. The key to<br>performing that technique correctly was the distribution of the weight.<br>Nearly the full weight of the officer was on the knee in the torso. As<br>was explained during the training video I saw, there was very little<br>force required at the neck to keep the head and shoulders down. It was<br>essentially nothing more than the weight of the leg itself holding the<br>head and shoulders in place. The video I watched *emphasized* the point<br>that all the weight was on the back, hardly any of the weight was on the<br>neck. Also, the suspect in the training was ON HIS SIDE, not flat on<br>his stomach.<br><br>Most departments opted to not use that technique because it was<br>difficult to master, and it placed suspects at risk of injury if it was<br>done incorrectly. It also carried a risk of [[positional<br>asphyxia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=09015b&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_asphyxia){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>As in this case. This was a perfect example of why departments routinely<br>bypassed this technique.<br><br>This is not uncommon. Police departments change techniques all the time<br>based on new findings and new science. When my dad was a cop, *hog<br>tying* used to be a technique for suspects who were out of control,<br>kicking out police car windows while in handcuffs. They stopped using<br>hog tying because of suspects dying in the back of police cars due to<br>positional asphyxia. The technique now would be to take that same wild<br>child out of the car, spray with pepper spray, and put back in the car.<br>Repeat as needed until suspect stopped wilding.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me how much the police suck or \"ackshually,<br>you\'re wrong,\" then you're the reason why I disable comments. Well<br>done, Karen. You ruined it for everyone.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
