<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends."<br><br>In this case, if your HOA has a rule which disallows all signs<br>regardless of content, then it's unlikely you'll be able to display a<br>Biden sign without facing a fine.<br><br>What *most* HOAs do is not disallow all signage all the time, but most<br>HOAs will place *restrictions* on political signs. Normally, political<br>signs are limited in time period. For example, the HOA may say that you<br>can only place political signs within 45 days of the election, and the<br>signs must be removed no later than one week after the election. Many<br>HOAs also limit the size of political signs. Most political signs are 12<br>by 18 inches, but some can be as large as 18 by 24 inches. The HOA will<br>likely set this (18 x 24) as the largest political sign you can post in<br>your yard. Finally, HOAs can limit the *number* of yard signs you can<br>post at any time regardless of time of year, and this includes<br>advertisements for vendors who have just performed work at your<br>property.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
