The 1st Amendment ensures that. Of<br>course, you can only criticize until you begin to slander, which is<br>where criticism becomes unlawful.<br><br>With that understanding, if the net outcome of intersectionality is to<br>shield a person from criticism, then it is intersectionality that is the<br>problem, not the ability to use it to shield oneself from criticism.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
