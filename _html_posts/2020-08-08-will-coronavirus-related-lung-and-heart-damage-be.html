<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will coronavirus-related lung and heart damage be covered as a<br>qualifying disability under the ADA moving forward?**<br><br>A disability under ADA is defined as "a physical or mental impairment<br>that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a person<br>who has a history or record of such an impairment, or a person who is<br>perceived by others as having such an impairment."<br><br>If heart disease or lung disease "substantially limit one or more major<br>life activity" then it is covered.<br><br>What is a "major life activity?" Major life activities include, but are<br>not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing,<br>hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending,<br>speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking,<br>communicating, and working.<br><br>If your coronavirus-related lung or heart disease "substantially limits"<br>one or more of those activities (or similar activities), then it is<br>classified as a "disability" under ADA.<br><br>If your lung disease has permanently impaired your ability to breathe<br>and you must be on oxygen for the rest of your life, then this is a<br>disability. If it just bothers you and you can't run as far as you used<br>to, this is not a "substantial" limitation. In short, an impairment is a<br>disability if it substantially limits the ability of an individual to<br>perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general<br>population.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is legal information, not legal advice.
