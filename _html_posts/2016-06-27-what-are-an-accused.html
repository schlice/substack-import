<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The rights of the accused anywhere in the country are the same. The<br>rights are guaranteed in the Constitution, so it doesn\'t matter what<br>state you go to. You have the right to a speedy trial. You have the<br>right to not be a witness against yourself. You have the right to face<br>your accuser. You have the right to a jury of your peers. Just read the<br>Bill of Rights, it\'s all in there.<br><br>[Cliff G.(https://www.quora.com/profile/Cliff-G-13)]{.qlink_container}<br>pointed out that the Constitution is the *minimum* standard for the<br>states to follow. States can impose *greater* protections than provided<br>for in the Constitution. You can review the Missouri Constitution,<br>[[Section 01.018(a)1, Rights of the accused in criminal<br>prosecutions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=90c0ca&url=http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/Consthtml/A01018a1.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="mo.gov"}]{.qlink_container} for more information.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
