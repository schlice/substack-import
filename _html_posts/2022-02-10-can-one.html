<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let me ask you this question.<br><br>Do you know your grandparents full names? Sure, you probably do. But do<br>you know all eight of your great grandparents full names? I bet very few<br>of you do.<br><br>We are forgotten in a blink of time. We do not generate any lasting<br>memories. Unless we are someone famous or influential, our lives flick<br>in and out of existence and no one remembers.<br><br>So ask yourself this question: if your *presence* has so little impact<br>on others' lives, *why would you think that your absence would?*<br><br>Suicidal people tend to overestimate their impact on the world. They<br>think that the world would be better off without them. But this is just<br>as flawed logic as thinking that your *presence* makes the world a<br>better place.<br><br>I'm not trying to be mean or uncaring. I'm simply trying to be rational,<br>since we can all agree that the position of the suicidal person stems<br>from a point of irrational thinking.<br><br>And I also think that the suicide would only completely devastate a<br>handful of people, those who were closest to the person, like parents or<br>siblings, or best friends. Beyond that, the suicide will generate a<br>moment of sadness, maybe some self-reflection in others, but certainly<br>won't "completely devastate everyone who knew the victim." This is<br>actually another indication of exactly what I mentioned earlier.<br>Sometimes the suicidal person says, "I'll show them, I'll kill myself<br>and they will be hurt." But this is exactly the same sort of<br>overestimation of one's impact on the world (thinking that others will<br>be hurt by your passing) as is thinking that your presence makes their<br>life so much better.<br><br>See what I mean? If your presence doesn't meaningfully enrich others'<br>lives, why would you think that your absence would harm them?<br><br>The thoughts of the suicidal person stem from irrational thinking. What<br>the suicidal person needs, above all else, is *help*.<br><br>You might suggest to your friend that they reach out to one of the<br>organizations listed in the "There is Help" box on this page.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can one's suicide have more profound, unforeseeable consequences beyond<br>completely devastating everyone who knew the suicide victim? Asking this<br>as someone who has a suicidal friend and wishes to know more about the<br>subject.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
