<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Regarding indictment of POTUS, is it possible for SCOTUS to rule that<br>it\'s possible to indict a sitting President AND that the statute of<br>limitations is tolled for the length of the presidency, so long as the<br>DOJ waives its right to indict?**<br><br>No, these are not both simultaneously possible.<br><br>If SCOTUS rules that it is possible to indict a sitting president, then<br>the statute of limitations cannot be tolled, because the president can<br>be indicted.<br><br>If SCOTUS rules that it is not possible to indict a sitting<br>president, then the statute of limitations *will be* tolled, since<br>indictment is not possible.<br><br>A SCOTUS decision would not be made based on implied or promised conduct<br>by the Department of Justice, which works for the President. A SCOTUS<br>decision is made based on interpretation of the Constitution. SCOTUS<br>would only rule on whether or not you can indict a sitting president.<br>And they would only do so if the President is indicted, and his<br>attorneys appeal the decision on the grounds that you cannot<br>Constitutionally indict the President.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
