<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>"Screen tests," of the variety indicated by the article, are very<br>uncommon today. Not only is there video in the back of the car in many<br>jurisdictions, but officers in almost all jurisdictions are required to<br>seat belt rear seat occupants in. Performing a screen test would be an<br>indication that the officer failed to follow procedure and properly seat<br>belt his passenger. Arriving at the jail with injuries like that are a<br>big red flag that the officer didn\'t follow correct transport<br>procedure.<br><br>So unless he is looking to get himself in trouble, that\'s not going to<br>happen.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
