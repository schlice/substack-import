<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I don't think so, because I don't view the Church of Jesus Christ of<br>Latter-Day Saints (LDS for short) as a cult. I view them as a<br>culture.<br><br>I think we do ourselves a disservice, as non-Mormons, to view the LDS as<br>a cult. As a closet Christian apologist, I find that when we "label" a<br>group as a cult, we tend to do things like highlighting the historical<br>inaccuracies we may find in their religion, or taking a more stern<br>apologetic approach (especially in desiring to debate doctrine) which<br>could easily feel like an attack.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-9f2059280ef568de7910d402bb6dd58e){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-9f2059280ef568de7910d402bb6dd58e"<br>master_w="1240" master_h="1367"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(The Salt Lake Temple, a Mormon temple in Salt Lake City, UT.

What's the difference, you may ask? The easy way to see the<br>difference is to imagine yourself doing a mission trip to a foreign<br>country. You'd probably be first struck with the fact that they speak a<br>different language. Among many other things, they have different customs<br>and courtesies. They would have unique and interesting foods. But all<br>the while, you'd take all of this in stride, because you were dealing<br>with a different *culture.*<br><br>Mormons do have a unique culture. They have their own clothes and food<br>customs. They even have their own holiday. In many cases, they feel<br>enormous pressure in society just to prove themselves worthy. These are<br>just some of the cultural differences we must keep in mind as we<br>minister to our Mormon friends.<br><br>If you treat Mormonism as a *culture* rather than as a *cult*, you will<br>be more likely to take time to get to know them and their customs (which<br>is exceptionally easy since, to a person, they are incredibly kind and<br>loving¹), which will, in turn, drive you to be more patient and loving<br>in the process. It will also cause you to patiently understand their<br>unique needs, which will provide you the visibility you need to<br>determine how best to reach them.<br><br>So are Mormons a cult or a culture? How you answer that question may<br>very well drive how you reach out and share the Gospel with them.<br><br>\<br><br>¹ Seriously, when was the last time you met an *angry, mean Mormon?*<br>Can't say that I've found one yet.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
