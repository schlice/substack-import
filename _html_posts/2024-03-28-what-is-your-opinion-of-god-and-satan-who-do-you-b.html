<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is an interesting question. You're asking, in a forum of believers,<br>whether or not they support God or Satan. I don't think you're going to<br>get a lot of surprising answers.<br><br>I think the only thing that might be useful would be to learn how they<br>came about. Why would God create Satan? And since God knows all, why<br>would God create Satan if He knew that all this would happen?<br><br>Let's start with who Satan is. Satan started off his existence as<br>Lucifer, a created angel. The Morning Star, or "son of the morning" as<br>is depicted in Isaiah 14:12:<br><br>> How you have fallen from heaven, O morning star, son of the dawn! You<br>> have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations!<br>> ---NIV<br><br>That little bit of foreshadowing talks about what happened to Lucifer.<br>Lucifer, like all the angels, is a created being, and he had free will<br>just like all the angels did. He could make his own choices. Lucifer<br>possesses a voice the quality of which is unmatched by any other being<br>in existence. As a created being, Lucifer's job was, like for all of the<br>other angels, to worship God. Lucifer was to use that "angelic voice" to<br>sing praises to God. Lucifer though, for whatever reason, *wanted that<br>glory for himself.* He didn't want God to get all the glory. He wanted<br>glory. He didn't want to worship God. He wanted others to worship *him*.<br><br>And so he rebelled (along with about a third of the angels). Ultimately,<br>he was cast out of heaven and down to the earth, and the angels who<br>rebelled with him were also cast out, and exist as demons.<br><br>*But why would God have done this if He knew that Lucifer would rebel?<br>Why create him at all?*<br><br>Ultimately, it is because God so loves free will. God does not want<br>mindless automatons worshipping Him. He doesn't need that (as an<br>all-powerful God, He has no needs, as He is complete). But He desires<br>His creation to worship freely, to love freely (for love can only be<br>freely given, it can never be coerced). Free will, and the ability to<br>make choices, is paramount to God.<br><br>Satan existing as an agitating force, existing as our very accuser, only<br>reinforces the free will aspect of God's creation. Satan only serves now<br>to agitate against us, and to accuse us of wrongdoing (which he may or<br>may not have goaded and influenced us into committing). Of course, it is<br>Jesus on our side, pleading for our souls, so there's that.<br><br>Allowing Satan to introduce sin into the human condition was all part of<br>God's plan to redeem us and give us that choice to love Him or to reject<br>Him without violating our free will. God created a perfect free-will<br>environment in which anyone who chooses to believe will recognize all<br>the evidence of God's existence, but He has also left just enough<br>ambiguity so as to not coerce the unwilling. Again, God only wants<br>willing believers, not coerced or brainwashed believers. And He has<br>created an environment filled with evidence of His existence *but<br>without His direct presence*, a presence so powerful that it would<br>coerce our belief and overcome our free will.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
