<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In just the same way that you shouldn't take medical advice from<br>politicians, don't take legal advice from people who are not your<br>lawyer. Don't take legal advice from me, either. But I've got one or two<br>years experience under my belt; I can keep you out of jail better than<br>what you've apparently been told about a repo.<br><br>Maybe you forgot that you don't own the car yet. It doesn't belong to<br>you. It belongs to the lender or leasing agency (depending on whether<br>you took out a loan to buy or you are leasing), and you are working on<br>buying it, but you haven't made all the payments yet. You don't hold the<br>title to the car, the lender or the leasing agency does.<br><br>About the only part they got right is the part in which they can't tow<br>it with a person inside of it. However, if you jump in your car and<br>refuse to get out, the tow truck driver will call the police. The police<br>officer will order you out of the car, at which point you have one of<br>two options: you get out of the car on your own and maybe you get to<br>leave on your own, or you are dragged out of the car in which case<br>you're going to jail.<br><br>In many states, it is a *crime* to get in a car which is legally in the<br>possession of a tow operator (once the tow hook is on the car, it is<br>legally in the possession of the tow company), and you can go to jail<br>for that act alone, let alone refusing to follow the lawful orders of a<br>police officer.<br><br>Repossession is the natural consequence of a contract you signed. If you<br>fail to make the payments on your car, it gets repossessed. Your<br>complaint is not with the tow truck driver; your complaint is with the<br>lender or leasing agency. And if the repo driver has your car on his<br>list, he's bringing your car in, plain and simple. Neither the repo<br>driver nor the police officer really care that you have problem X that<br>is preventing you from paying, or that the leasing agency is screwing<br>you personally over, or anything else you choose to tell them. Your<br>complaint is with the lender or leasing agency, end of discussion.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice. This answer is for GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.<br>Seek the advice of a licensed attorney in the appropriate jurisdiction<br>before taking any action that may affect your rights. If you believe you<br>have a claim against someone, consult an attorney immediately, otherwise<br>there is a risk that the time allotted to bring your claim may expire.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to legal questions are intended<br>third-party beneficiaries with certain rights under Quora\'s* [[*Terms<br>of Service*](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I just heard someone say \"If your car is getting repossessed, jump in<br>the car because they can\'t legally tow it and police can\'t stop it."<br>What\'s your take?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
