<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As we learned from the [[History Channel<br>episode](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c30842&url=http://www.history.com/shows/modern-marvels/season-3/episode-9){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="history.com"}]{.qlink_container} on us (as part of their<br>*Modern Marvels* series), Cheyenne Mountain was never designed to take a<br>direct hit from any nuclear weapon. We know that a direct hit with a<br>kiloton-sized weapon (which was all that was available when the Mountain<br>was built) would have at least collapsed all the tunnels, effectively<br>destroying the facility, or at least rendering it completely<br>inoperative. A direct hit by today's megaton-sized weapons would turn<br>Cheyenne Mountain into Cheyenne Valley.<br><br>We know the former Soviet Union was targeting all the military<br>installations in Colorado, but NORAD was definitely high on the list.<br>What we learned *after* the collapse of the Soviet Union was that the<br>missiles that they *did* have (which were greatly exaggerated) would<br>have been mostly inaccurate. There's a fair chance that a kiloton weapon<br>would have *missed* the Mountain, a fully-survivable scenario. Megaton<br>weapons? Less likely, but if it wasn't a direct hit, it *might* have<br>been survivable. However, we never based any of our mission parameters<br>around surviving an attack. We had the capability and the resources to<br>do so, but our mission directives never specified that we had to survive<br>an attack in order to complete our mission.<br><br>For this reason, our entire mission is complete in under 10 minutes,<br>from observance of missile launch to notification delivered to the<br>National Command Authority. Missile flight time from the former Soviet<br>Union to Cheyenne Mountain is about 30 minutes. We would continue<br>providing updates on the missile to the NCA, continually narrowing the<br>impact zone as the missile got closer to its target. We used to say that<br>our job was done in 10 minutes, and you can spend the next 20 minutes<br>bending over and kissing your ass goodbye.<br><br>It's just something you live with when you work in a place like NORAD.<br>If you've done your job correctly, you get to tell the President that<br>you're about to die.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
