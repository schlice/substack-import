<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you fail to pay your dues for a long enough time, the HOA can put a<br>lien on your home to cover the unpaid dues and fees. This means that if<br>you try to sell or refinance your home, you'll have to pay off your lien<br>with the proceeds of the sale before you collect any remaining profit.<br><br>If you still go even longer without paying, even after a lien has been<br>placed on your property, the HOA can foreclose on the lien, forcing your<br>house to be sold to recoup the money they are owed. The sale of the home<br>will pay off your mortgage.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
