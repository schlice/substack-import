<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with all legal answers, the correct answer is "it depends."<br><br>Let's assume for completeness that your backyard is bounded by a privacy<br>fence. From the street level, no one can see you in your backyard.<br><br>Now, to make the point, let's assume you have a neighbor who can easily<br>see into your yard from a second-story window. At this point, laws<br>differ by state. In some cases, you can be cited for indecent exposure<br>if you are indecent in an area which a reasonable person should know is<br>viewable by someone who has not affirmatively consented to seeing such<br>things. In New Jersey for example, you can be cited under this statute<br>for simply being naked in your yard. The statute doesn't care where you<br>are. It simply says that if you are in an area which can reasonably be<br>seen by someone who didn't consent to look at what they are seeing, you<br>can be cited. In such a scenario, imagine if a child saw you. You could<br>*also* then be charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor,<br>which would get you arrested. Contrast that with the indecent exposure<br>laws in Colorado. In that state, the exposure must be sexually-related<br>in order to be charged with indecent exposure. You either have to be<br>having sex, or exposing yourself in a sexually explicit manner (i.e.<br>touching yourself explicitly). Simply "being naked" where you can be<br>seen by someone else does not constitute indecent exposure there.<br><br>Also, if someone can see you in your yard from their house, they have<br>every right to watch you as well as record you, so long as they do it<br>from the same place they can normally see you (i.e. a second-story<br>window). In other words, if you want *privacy*, you need to go inside<br>and cover your windows. If you can be seen from a neighbor's<br>second-story window, you voluntarily give up your expectation of privacy<br>by stepping outside naked.<br><br>TL;DR: Check your state and city ordinances on indecent exposure before<br>you go traipsing around naked in your yard.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
