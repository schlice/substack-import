<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it possible to use an Android phone without having a Gmail<br>account?**<br><br>Short answer is yes.<br><br>The easiest way to do this is to Reset Your Phone, and when you've<br>done that, when it asks you to sign in with your Google account, look<br>for the "Skip" option. You won't be able to download apps from the<br>Google Play Store, but you can use the Amazon Appstore if you like, and<br>if you're on a Samsung Android phone, you can use your Samsung account<br>to back up/restore your phone, as well as download apps from the Samsung<br>App Store. The selection of apps is not as great as the Google Play<br>Store, but you can get most apps that way. You can use the phone's<br>built-in email client to access POP or IMAP email from your favorite<br>email provider (obviously not Gmail). You can also use Microsoft Outlook<br>(formerly Hotmail) using their Outlook client, which should be available<br>in the Samsung App Store, among other places.<br><br>Thankfully, Android also lets you download apps from *Unknown Sources*<br>(i.e. the Internet) and any apps you can't get from the Google Play<br>Store are usually available online somewhere. Note that you open<br>yourself up to the possibility of downloading a hacked version of the<br>same app, but dem's da breaks.<br><br>If you really want to go crazy and totally remove all of the Google apps<br>from your phone, you can use an app called Package Disabler Pro,<br>which you can buy and download directly from [[their<br>website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=447716&url=http://www.packagedisabler.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="packagedisabler.com"}]{.qlink_container}. You can then<br>disable all of the Google applications without having to root your<br>phone.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
