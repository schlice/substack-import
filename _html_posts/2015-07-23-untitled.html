<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [It is only analogous if you believe that an abortion ends<br>a life. The law says that abortion does not end a life. Therefore,<br>abortions never kill people.\<br>\<br>The implication by the gun control crowd says that more guns = more<br>violence. The tenor behind \"Guns don\'t kill people, people kill<br>people\" is a shorthand expression that the gun is a tool, and on its<br>own, it doesn\'t do anything. As you rightly noted, it takes a person<br>operating the mechanism with a will to operate that machine to cause a<br>death. The gun is just the tool that they use to end the life.\<br>\<br>In order to conflate abortion into that statement would presume that an<br>abortion ends a life. In today\'s law, abortion does not end a<br>life.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-who-consider-themselves-pro-life-not-support-gun-control/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
