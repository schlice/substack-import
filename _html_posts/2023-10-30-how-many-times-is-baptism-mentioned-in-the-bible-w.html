<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> How many times is baptism mentioned in the Bible?<br><br>The word \"baptism\" is mentioned 22 times in the New Testament. The<br>verb form, \"baptize\", is mentioned 10 times, and the action form,<br>\"baptized\", is mentioned 60 times.<br><br>> What is the purpose of baptism according to the Bible?<br><br>Baptism is a symbolic gesture, both for your own personal journey and as<br>a sign to the rest of the world that you believe in the death and<br>resurrection of Jesus.<br><br>Remember: *baptism does not save you*. *Baptism is what saved people<br>do.*<br><br>The Bible commands believers to be baptized. Jesus tells us to do it as<br>part of what we call the Great Commission:<br><br>> *Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the<br>> name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching<br>> them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you<br>> always, to the very end of the age. --- Matthew 28:19--20 NIV*<br><br>So at the very least, we are baptized because Christ commanded it.<br><br>Beyond that, we believe that Christ followers are "buried with Him"<br>through baptism, and if we are united with Him in death, we will<br>"certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his."<br><br>> *Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus<br>> were baptized into his death? We were therefore buried with him<br>> through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised<br>> from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new<br>> life.*<br>><br>> *For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will<br>> certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his. For we<br>> know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled<br>> by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to<br>> sin---because anyone who has died has been set free from sin.*<br>><br>> *Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with<br>> him. For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot<br>> die again; death no longer has mastery over him. The death he died, he<br>> died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.*<br>><br>> *In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in<br>> Christ Jesus. --- Romans 6:3--11 NIV*<br><br>Baptism is usually considered the *beginning* of a personal faith<br>journey for a Christian.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
