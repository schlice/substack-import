<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I was a victim of identity theft before identity theft was the fastest<br>growing crime in the United States.<br><br>The local police department told me that their investigators were simply<br>too busy to take the case. They gave me a jacket number that I could<br>give to the credit card company to show them that "someone" was doing<br>"something," and I'd likely get the whole incident scrubbed from my<br>credit and swept under the rug.<br><br>It likely would have worked. But it wasn't *right*.<br><br>I went to the Sheriff's Office, whose investigators told me that they<br>had a fifth of the investigators that the local department had, and they<br>never turned a case down. My enduring admiration for the Sheriff's<br>Office began that day.<br><br>It never went to trial; the DA chose not to press charges even though<br>evidence was present to support two felony charges.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
