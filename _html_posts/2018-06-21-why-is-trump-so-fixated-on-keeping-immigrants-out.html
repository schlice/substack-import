<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is Trump so fixated on keeping immigrants out of our country? Why<br>does he assume that everyone who comes here is a criminal and rapist?<br>Most of us were immigrants at one point in our history, and this country<br>was built by being a melting pot.**<br><br>This is an important question, and it goes to the heart of what we mean<br>by intentional conflation.<br><br>The people who feed you this information (primarily Democrats and the<br>news media complex) are intentionally conflating two terms:<br>*immigration* and *illegal immigration*.<br><br>Clearly, you believe that Trump's attacks on *illegal immigration* mean<br>he is attacking *immigration* in general. In fact, if you were to search<br>Trump quotes about immigration, you'd only find quotes where he is<br>discussing *illegal* immigration.<br><br>So, let's be sure we understand what we're talking about. *Immigration*<br>is the process by which a person leaves one country and becomes a<br>citizen of another. The legal process of immigration is a long one. It<br>involves agencies of the losing and gaining countries talking to each<br>other to get information across official channels about you. This is<br>important for the gaining country. They need to find out if you're a<br>criminal. Perhaps you're evading capture in your home country. The list<br>of "perhaps" entries could go on for pages. But the bottom line is that<br>the gaining country gets to determine who comes in and who does not.<br>Now, before you start to think about how "unfair" that may be, remember<br>that the gaining country does this because it has to consider the impact<br>of adding to its population. It has an impact on every public service<br>that the government offers: roads, utilities, hospitals, fire, police,<br>etc. The government has official numbers of people it will allow to<br>emigrate annually.<br><br>There are two ways in which you can emigrate to a new country. You can<br>follow the process above, which is indeed a long one. Or, you can simply<br>enter the country in a legal manner (like on a tourist visa) and then<br>never leave. In fact, overstaying a visa is one of the number one<br>ways illegal immigrants end up in this country. You could also<br>unlawfully cross a border not at a border control entry point (like what<br>happens across our southern border).<br><br>Trump does a good job talking about "illegals" which means "illegal<br>immigrants." He is not talking about "legal immigrants" which means<br>people who followed the process and entered the country legally and<br>became naturalized citizens. He is only talking about *illegal*<br>immigrants. Trump's detractors (including the media) like to conflate<br>*illegal immigration* with *immigration in general,* which leads you to<br>believe that Trump hates all immigration, which is simply untrue.<br><br>So let's answer your questions:<br><br>> Why is Trump so fixated on keeping immigrants out of our country?<br><br>He is not. He is fixated on keeping *illegal* immigrants <br>out of our country. Come in through the door, not over the wall.<br><br>> **Why does he assume that everyone who comes here is a criminal and<br>> rapist?**<br><br>I know he had some rhetoric in his campaign speeches about Mexico<br>sending us criminals and rapists, but he doesn't believe that everyone<br>who comes here is a criminal. That's simply misunderstanding what he's<br>saying. Again, he's only talking about *illegal* immigrants.<br>Many of them are indeed criminals and rapists. Many more are simply<br>people fleeing poor economic conditions and oppressive regimes in their<br>home countries, and they can't afford to wait the amount of time it<br>takes to become a legal citizen. This is a big issue and it does need to<br>be addressed.<br><br>> **Most of us were immigrants at one point in our history, and this<br>> country was built by being a melting pot.**<br><br>Yes, our nation is a nation of immigrants. But we are a nation of<br>*legal* immigrants, who, granted, came into the country at a<br>time when immigration was much easier than it is today. We had unlimited<br>land and resources and we'd take anyone in the early 1900s. Times are<br>different now. We can't simply take anyone. Our economy is already<br>feeling the strain of illegal immigrants on our infrastructure, and<br>fixing it is one of the reasons Trump was elected.<br><br>As for your mention of "melting pot," we are most certainly not a<br>melting pot anymore. It's almost considered *racist* to even mention<br>"melting pot." The whole idea of being an American has been supplanted<br>by *multiculturalism*, another winning idea foisted upon us by<br>Progressives. But I won't get into that here, because that's not what<br>this question was about. If you want to know my thoughts about how "The<br>Great American Melting Pot" has been supplanted by *multiculturalism,*<br>you'll have to ask that question.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
