<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Child support is not about punishing the higher-earning parent, or the<br>non-custodial parent. Child support isn't about rewarding or enriching<br>the custodial parent, or the lower-earning parent.<br><br>In fact, child support isn't about the parents at all. And it's<br>definitely not paid to "support the girl."<br><br>Child support is about the child.<br><br>Child support payments are determined by the state using a formula which<br>takes several factors into consideration, only one of which is the<br>non-custodial parent's ability to pay. It also takes into account the<br>mother's ability to work. Does she have a degree? Does she have a<br>high-paying job? Can she afford to raise a child? This wouldn't *negate*<br>the child support requirement (Person A still has to contribute), but it<br>might *lessen* it.<br><br>Child support does not increase simply because the non-custodial parent<br>has more money. So at the point at which Person A becomes a billionaire,<br>the woman cannot haul him back to court and demand he pay more in child<br>support just because he *can*.<br><br>Most importantly, child support has nothing to do with "supporting the<br>girl." If they were not married, he has no obligation to support her. He<br>*might* if he's a nice guy and suddenly has billions to spend, but he is<br>not *obligated* to. It is truly "his billions, his choice." Perhaps if<br>they had been married and they got divorced, she could ask the court to<br>take another look at *alimony* (called *maintenance* in some states),<br>but *child support* is a fixed amount to ensure that the basic needs for<br>a child are met until that child turns 18.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Person A gets a woman pregnant at 18 and has to pay one thousand in<br>child support. He leaves the girl and the baby but still pays child<br>support. A becomes a billionaire and famous. Should he support the girl?<br>His billions his choice right?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
