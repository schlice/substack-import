You should check it out.<br><br>[War Elephant(https://warelephant.quora.com/)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>It is the largest military and conservative political space on Quora<br>with over 51.8K followers.<br><br>But that's not why our stuff is not removed.<br><br>Our stuff is not removed because we follow a simple rule regarding our<br>content. We like to call it the 3 R's:<br><br>*Relaxed. Researched. Respectful.*<br><br>Here's what [[Joshua<br>Alexander](https://www.quora.com/profile/Joshua-Alexander-356)]{.qlink_container},<br>the owner of War Elephant, says about the 3 R's:<br><br>> Relaxed<br>><br>> People get too strung up about politics. The purpose of politics isn't<br>> the constant pursuit of power. It's to serve you so that you don't<br>> have to worry about politics. We aren't a motivated advocacy group<br>> electioneering or driven to defeat our political enemies. We have no<br>> enemies. We're part lounge, part classroom, and part message-board,<br>> where people can come and go as they please; to read, learn,<br>> socialize, and then live their lives. I want people to leave us and<br>> just appreciate how wonderful it is to be alive today, right now, but<br>> to think back to that thing we shared with them. And I want them to<br>> say in that quiet moment, "I never thought of it that way. It kind of<br>> made a lot of sense." - Relaxed<br>><br>> Researched<br>><br>> Our opinions face a scrutiny like few others ever have. Here, we have<br>> to write like our worst enemy is our closest follower --- because they<br>> are, so we can't be lazy. We have to be more than opinions and empty<br>> rhetoric. Everything that comes through War Elephant needs to follow a<br>> standard of excellence that leaves the casual reader drifting in and<br>> saying, "Whoa! I wasn't expecting that." It won't be hard. They've<br>> been taught that we're unintelligent, uninformed, and something to be<br>> underestimated. Read, study, write clearly, and cite your sources.<br>> Make people walk away with the uncomfortable feeling of doubt. Doubt<br>> in their assumptions about not only our beliefs, but about ourselves,<br>> as well. - Researched.<br>><br>> Respectful<br>><br>> We want others who disagree with us to hear us. To do that, we can't<br>> bash them every third post. That only confirms suspicions and builds<br>> barriers to learning. It proves to those who already hate us they were<br>> right. We have to be better. Without compromising our values to suit<br>> others, we have to work extra hard to make sure our words can be<br>> heard. We do that by being respectful. Always. An errant comment, a<br>> lazy post, or a moment of anger at someone who isn't being a very good<br>> guest will ruin a great deal of work others do. We have to be better.<br>><br>> Perhaps most important of the three, I want this space to be known as<br>> a place where people feel respected even by people telling them<br>> they're wrong. At this time, when so many very influential people<br>> demand incivility, intolerance, and resistance from their follower, I<br>> think most people just want to find something welcoming, but might be<br>> too afraid of their own side to say so.<br>><br>> This is the hardest of the three R's, and the one I'm going to push<br>> the strictest to ensure is part of our culture. I think without it,<br>> once we grow much bigger, we may be surrounded by so many people<br>> diseased with the toxin of hurt and resentment, that they want this<br>> place to be their staging ground for assault. We are War Elephant, but<br>> we are never about fighting other Americans. -<br>> Respectful.\[1\](#cUnzu){#cite-cUnzu .citation_link}<br><br>This is why our content is not removed.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-cUnzu){.citation_index} [[War<br>Elephant](https://warelephant.quora.com/)]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
