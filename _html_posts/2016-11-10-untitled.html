<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I don't think we can compare the two. Maybe not "apples and bricks", but<br>"apples and oranges": both fruit, but vastly different. One protest at<br>one college campus does not compare to tens of thousands of rioters in<br>multiple cities across the country shouting "F\*ck Donald Trump" and<br>"He's Not My President."<br><br>This is not how democracy works. He is, in fact, everyone's<br>president.<br><br>I may not have agreed with Mr. Obama's policies, but I'm not so na√Øve to<br>believe that he's not my president. He is, indeed, my president. He was<br>democratically elected (whether or not you believe in the benefits of<br>the Electoral College), twice, no less. If I can claim that Obama was my<br>president even though I disagreed with the vast majority of his<br>political positions, then even if you didn't vote for him, those<br>protesting should also understand that Trump is their president, too.<br><br>There are lots of ways to make your feelings known to your government.<br>Working through your elected officials is probably the best way to do<br>it, but there are others. Rioting and protesting are not the best<br>ways to do it. You certainly get noticed, but not in the way you might<br>like.<br><br>Also, there is a night and day difference between disagreeing with<br>your president-elect, and calling people who *voted for him* racist,<br>sexist, misogynistic, xenophobic haters. Disagreeing with elected<br>officials is commonplace in society. Disparaging other citizens simply<br>because they have an *opinion* is wrong. It is not democracy at<br>work. It is simply evidence of exactly the hate you accuse others of<br>espousing. So, who is really the hater here?<br><br>Trump didn't win because he tapped into the "racist underbelly" of the<br>country. He won because he connected with the people who felt abandoned<br>by their government better than Clinton did. Remember, for every "I'm a<br>Hillary Deplorable" T-shirt at a Trump rally, there was a "Nasty Woman"<br>T-shirt at a Clinton rally. Both sides are culpable in that regard.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Do-Trump-voters-understand-how-scared-many-groups-of-Americans-are/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
