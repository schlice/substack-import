<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If the government wanted to go door to door and collect guns, how<br>would they know who owned any?**<br><br>If the government goes literally "door to door," they don't have to know<br>who owns any, because they're going to be checking every door.<br><br>That's going to take a *looooooong* time. And if I have 40 acres of<br>property, how are you exactly going to find the guns I buried somewhere<br>out there in those 40 acres? Are you going to employ a team of engineers<br>with ground-penetrating radar and a backhoe to search all 40 acres?<br>That's going to take weeks, and just on my property alone.<br><br>Now repeat the process a few hundred million times.<br><br>You can see the problem.<br><br>So if they're going to violate the Constitution and confiscate all those<br>firearms in contravention of the 2nd Amendment, then they may as well<br>violate a few more laws in the process, to try to make their lives<br>easier.<br><br>Like the law that says that the government cannot create or maintain<br>lists of gun owners. They could illegally seize all of the sale records<br>of any FFL who has ever sold a gun, and compile a list of people who<br>bought guns that way. That will get about 40% of gun owners. But that's<br>still not going to get all the guns, because those sale records only<br>show the *first* owner, and in most states, private party sales or gifts<br>do not need such rigorous records-keeping as the ones required of FFLs.<br>So they may go to half of those homes and find that the guns were either<br>lost, stolen, or sold to someone else.<br><br>That still leaves the remaining 60% of gun owners who acquired their<br>guns through private party sales or as gifts, whose transactions were<br>never recorded.<br><br>So the bottom line in all of this: the government wouldn't know where<br>all the guns are, there isn't a consistent record anywhere which states<br>where all the guns are, and in order to "get them all," they would, as<br>you suggest, have to go door-to-door to try to find them all. And they<br>still would be unable to do so.<br><br>**TL;DR: They wouldn't, and there is no record they could acquire or<br>create where you could even begin to know where they all are. They would<br>have to visit every house.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
