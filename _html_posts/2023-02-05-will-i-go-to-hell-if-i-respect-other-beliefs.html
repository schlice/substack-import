<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Depends on what you mean by "respect."<br><br>Do you "respect other beliefs" by allowing others with differing beliefs<br>to live and believe as they choose? Then you're good! We are to love our<br>neighbors as we love ourselves. It is right that everyone has the<br>freedom to believe as they choose and live their lives as they wish.<br><br>Do you "respect other beliefs" by claiming that their beliefs are just<br>as right and just as valid as ours? That may be problematic, because it<br>doesn't make logical sense.<br><br>For example, Christianity teaches that Jesus rose from the dead; Islam<br>teaches that Jesus never died. Which one is it? One of those must be<br>right, and the other one must be wrong. There is no middle ground there.<br>Conservative Christians believe that those who haven't accepted Christ<br>as their Savior have chosen hell as their ultimate destination. It's<br>often overlooked, but many Muslims believe the same about non-Muslims:<br>they're headed for hell as well. And Hindus generally believe that<br>everyone, regardless of beliefs, is caught in an indefinite cycle of<br>reincarnation based on works. These contradictory beliefs can't all be<br>true.<br><br>Here's a few more:<br><br>- Jews, Christians, and Muslims believe in different versions of a<br>  theistic God, while most Hindus and New Agers believe that everything<br>  that exists is part of an impersonal, pantheistic force they call God.<br>- Many Hindus believe that evil is a complete illusion, while<br>  Christians, Muslims, and Jews believe that evil is real.<br>- Christians believe that people are saved by grace while all other<br>  religions, if they believe in salvation at all, teach some kind of<br>  salvation by good works (the definition of "good" and what one is<br>  saved from varies greatly).<br><br>These are just a few of the many essential differences. So much for the<br>idea that all religions teach basically the same things!<br><br>In fact, when you look across all world religions, you find there are<br>far more differences, especially about the important issues, then there<br>are similarities. The old thought about "we're all climbing the same<br>mountain, but we're taking different paths" is a really nice metaphor,<br>and it really appeals to people in populist countries like the United<br>States, but it's simply not true. The notion that all religions teach<br>basically the same thing---that we ought to love one<br>another---demonstrates a serious misunderstanding of world religions.<br>While most religions have some kind of similar moral code because God<br>has implanted right and wrong on our consciences, they disagree on<br>virtually every major issue, including the nature of God, the nature of<br>man, sin, salvation, heaven, hell, and creation.<br><br>\<br><br>All that said, we still have to answer the question. *Will any of these<br>beliefs cause you to go to hell?*<br><br>No.<br><br>The only thing that will save you from your ultimate destination of hell<br>is accepting Christ as your savior. That's it. You can believe whatever<br>you want about other religions, but the only thing that will save you<br>from hell is accepting Jesus Christ and repenting of your sin.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
