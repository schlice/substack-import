<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'m having a hard time seeing how freedom of speech<br>contributes to GDP.\<br>\<br>However, the tenor of your question implies that the lack of the<br>Amendment\'s impact on GDP somehow devalues it. It has immense value in<br>the culture of the country, allowing people to freely speak about any<br>topic which they choose without license or censure, and to freely and<br>openly redress grievances with the government. Try that in North Korea<br>and see what happens.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
