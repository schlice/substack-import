<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would police officers lose their guns if the Second Amendment gets<br>repealed?**<br><br>Let's first start with what the Second Amendment is, and what it is not.<br><br>We all know (or should know by now) that the Second Amendment, and the<br>Bill of Rights as a whole, does not *grant* rights. The Second Amendment<br>***prevents the government from infringing on already-existing rights,<br>rights which pre-date the Constitution.***<br><br>So think about this: *if you repeal the Second Amendment, does the right<br>go away?*<br><br>Even if you did repeal the Second Amendment, and a state tried to pass a<br>law barring civilian ownership of firearms, that law could *still* be<br>challenged based on the fact that it violates the natural right of the<br>citizen to self-defense.<br><br>(I'll be honest: if national public opinion were so skewed that the<br>Second Amendment were able to be repealed, then it's also probably<br>unlikely that such a challenge to such a law would succeed either,<br>because at that point, people would think *so little* of their natural<br>right to self-defense that they would be fine with the state infringing<br>on that right.)<br><br>But back to the question.<br><br>Let's say that the Second Amendment were repealed. All this does is<br>remove the protection against the government making laws with respect to<br>the right of the people to keep and bear arms. This means that it would<br>no longer be *unconstitutional* for the government to make a law barring<br>the people from keeping and bearing arms. That's it.<br><br>They could make a law which says that civilians who are not law<br>enforcement officers cannot keep and bear arms. They could make a law<br>that says that civilians who are not active military members cannot keep<br>and bear arms. They could make a law that says that only blonde-haired<br>people cannot keep and bear arms. They could make *any* law about<br>possession of firearms that they choose, because it would no longer be<br>*unconstitutional* for them to do so.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
