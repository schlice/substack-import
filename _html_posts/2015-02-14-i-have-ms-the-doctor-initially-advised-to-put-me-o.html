<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Tysabri (natalizumab) has the highest efficacy of any of<br>the MS drugs, which means it is the most effective medicine we have. It<br>does have a risk of PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy),<br>but the greatest risk factors for developing PML are:\<br>]<br><br>- Taking Tysabri in combination with another medication. More than 75%<br>  of patients who developed PML were also taking another disease<br>  modifying drug, or still had a previous DMD in their system<br>- Being JC positive. You can\'t develop PML if you are not JC positive,<br>  as it is the JC virus being allowed to run amok which causes PML.<br><br>Even if you are JC positive, you can still take Tysabri. You do have to<br>monitor for PML symptoms and see your doctor right away if you<br>experience any symptoms at all. Doctors have had very good luck treating<br>PML using plasmapheresis, among other treatments, and catching it<br>quickly is the number one way to get out of the worst of it with little<br>damage.\<br>\<br>Anyway, there are plenty of good choices for drugs, and your next best<br>choice is an oral drug called Gilenya. It has a low incidence of side<br>effects (less than 20% of patients who start Gilenya have to stop<br>because of side effects), and its efficacy is pretty good, while not as<br>good as Tysabri.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
