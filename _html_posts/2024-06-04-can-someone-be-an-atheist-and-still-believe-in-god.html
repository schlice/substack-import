<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Can someone be an atheist and still believe in God?<br><br>No. The word "atheist" means "no god." Atheists affirmatively believe<br>that God does not exist. Some confused atheists say that it's not a<br>belief that God does not exist, it's a lack of belief that God exists.<br><br>Besides this being nothing more than semantics, *lacking* a belief is<br>called agnosticism. Having an affirmative belief that God does not<br>exist is atheism. There is a difference.<br><br>> Have there been any cases of believers becoming atheists?<br><br>Happens all the time. In fact, I bet the largest majority of atheists<br>were once believers, but they were turned off of religion because of<br>interactions with others in their church, or interactions or behaviors<br>of other believers.<br><br>While the logic of this is questionable¹, it does happen, and I posit it<br>happens quite frequently.<br><br>\<br><br>¹ Would you stop going to the gym because of the poor behavior of other<br>people working out? You might, but you'd probably complain to management<br>first. How many of these ex-believers do you think complained to<br>management before they left? I'm certain some did.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
