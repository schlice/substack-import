<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No. In general, homeowners should not be able to stop other<br>homeowners from building new homes.<br><br>The calculus changes when the homes are all within an area controlled by<br>an HOA.<br><br>In that case, it is the Governing Documents which control whether or not<br>a homeowner can build a new home. Approval for the home is up to the<br>Architectural Review Committee (a committee under the HOA), and if they<br>do not approve it because its design or colors or layout does not<br>comport with the rest of the community, then this level of control is<br>acceptable.<br><br>Beyond the example of being within an HOA, if you are a homeowner, you<br>get to do whatever is allowed by your local government's zoning rules.<br>So there's always someone who will control what you do on your property.<br>Unless you have an HOA though, that won't be your neighbors.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
