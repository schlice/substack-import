I don't see where any accusers have any legal standing<br>to begin criminal investigations, as it appears that the allegations of<br>misconduct have all happened many years ago, and the statutes of<br>limitations have already expired.<br><br>But even if there was a criminal charge and even if the District<br>Attorney wanted to arrest them, they would work out a deal under which<br>they would voluntarily surrender to police. They would not need to be<br>handcuffed in their offices.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
