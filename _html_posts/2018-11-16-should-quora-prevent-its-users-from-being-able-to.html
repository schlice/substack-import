<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should Quora prevent its users from being able to disallow comments to<br>their answers?**<br><br>No.<br><br>Despite what you all may think about the value of being able to question<br>someone about their answer, there is one overriding point which remains<br>about Quora:<br><br>Quora is not a debate site. Quora is a question-and-answer site.<br><br>If you don't like an answer, you are free to do several things:<br><br>- You may downvote the answer if it is a low-quality answer unsupported<br>  by fact. Quora's upvote system is often misunderstood; I'll get there<br>  later.<br>- If the answer is actually wrong, you can Report the answer as<br>  "Factually Incorrect."<br>- If it's merely an opinion, you are free to answer the question<br>  yourself, and cite your own opinion.<br><br>However, on Quora, someone asks a question, and someone answers it. As<br>far as *ownership* goes, when I write an answer, it's my answer. I own<br>the answer. If I choose to allow comments to my answer, I own the<br>comments on my answer as well.<br><br>In my case, if I feel a comment adds to the value of my answer, I leave<br>it. If I feel it is unnecessarily argumentative, doesn't add any value<br>to my answer, and even if I'm just not in the mood to argue, I will<br>absolutely delete that comment, first advising the commenter that if<br>he/she has a different opinion, they are more than welcome to answer the<br>question themselves, but I'm just not in the mood to debate.<br><br>If you think that all answers must be debated (and that all users should<br>be free to debate all answers), then you not only must allow all<br>comments, but you must also *force the original answerer to respond to<br>any and all criticisms on their answers*, and that's not how Quora is<br>designed.<br><br>The other thing that often gets misunderstood about Quora: **Quora's<br>upvote button is often confused with Facebook's "Like" button.**<br><br>In the era of Facebook, the Upvote button is often confused with<br>Facebook's "Like" button: you like things you agree with, and you see<br>more of them in your Feed. However, in Quora, upvotes are designed to<br>highlight *high-quality answers*, ***not answers with which you agree<br>(or "like").*** I often upvote great answers from people with whose<br>viewpoints I diametrically oppose. But their answers are well-sourced<br>and are great arguments, so I upvote them. I don't agree with them, but<br>I upvote them.<br><br>But back to comments on answers: *it's my answer*. The comments on my<br>answer are mine, and are under my control. I can even turn off comments<br>completely on my answers. I know of quite a few TWs who have turned off<br>comments completely, just because they're tired of the constant hate.<br>They have that right. You do not have the right to comment on someone's<br>answer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
