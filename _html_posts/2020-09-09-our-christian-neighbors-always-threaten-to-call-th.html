<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Our Christian neighbors always threaten to call the police on me if<br>I'm outside because \"God doesn't want to see such dirty skin\". This<br>happens almost daily. Is that harassment?**<br><br>Indeed it is.<br><br>Let them call the police a few times and see what happens to them when<br>they get charged with abuse of the 911 system.<br><br>More importantly, a few visits by the police because your neighbors<br>don't like how your skin looks are great evidence to use in a harassment<br>lawsuit, as evidence for a restraining order, etc.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
