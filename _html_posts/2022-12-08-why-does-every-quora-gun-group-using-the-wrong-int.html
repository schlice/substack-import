<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**SCOTUS isn't the last word because they're always right. SCOTUS is<br>always right because they're the last word.**<br><br>- When SCOTUS originally ruled on *Roe* 50 years ago, they were right.<br>- And when SCOTUS overturned *Roe*, they were also right.<br>- When SCOTUS originally ruled on *Plessy v. Ferguson*, they were right.<br>- And when SCOTUS functionally overturned *Plessy* with cases like<br>  *Brown v. Board* (among others), they were also right.<br><br>Are you getting it now? *Heller* is right, and so was *US v. Miller*<br>before it. Every time they make a ruling, it is right, ***because the<br>Supreme Court is the last word***. There's no one else to appeal to.<br>It's over.<br><br>That makes it right.<br><br>(EDIT) My commenters have pointed out something to me. I understand that<br>there is a distinction people are drawing between what is *legally*<br>right and what is *morally* right. Yes, it is true that something can be<br>legal while still being immoral, and vice versa.<br><br>When SCOTUS makes a decision, it's always the *legally right* decision<br>because they are the last word, even if you consider the outcome of the<br>law to be *wrong*. That's why we're seeing this confusion over whether<br>or not a decision they made is "right." It can be legally right, and you<br>can still consider the outcome to be wrong.<br><br>\<br><br>*DISCLAIMER:*<br><br>*Feel free to participate with me in spirited, reasoned discussion in<br>the comments section. But don't think you can come into* *MY*<br>*answer and pontificate to me about your pet peeves with<br>\<insert_your_pet_peeve_here\>. I'll have none of that in my comments,<br>so if you do happen to post some of that absolute tripe, don't be<br>surprised if you refresh and it's magically gone, into the bit bucket.*<br><br>*TL;DR: Stay on topic or I'll delete your comments.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
