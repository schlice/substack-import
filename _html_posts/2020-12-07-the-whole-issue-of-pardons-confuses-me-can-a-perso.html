<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**The whole issue of pardons confuses me. Can a person be pardoned of a<br>crime if not convicted? Can a person be pardoned if not charged? Can a<br>person be pardoned of a yet to be named crime and isn\'t that just<br>immunity? HELP!**<br><br>A pardon can extend to any issues found in the future **related to a<br>particular incident or a particular timeframe**, but a pardon does not<br>cover any crime at all, even if not yet committed.<br><br>In short, ***you can't be pardoned for a crime you haven't committed<br>yet, but you can be pardoned for any crime you may have committed<br>already, even if we haven't discovered it yet.***<br><br>So for example, President Ford pardoned President Nixon after Ford took<br>office. He issued a "full, free and absolute" pardon for any crimes<br>Nixon may have committed while in office, seeking to put a final end to<br>the "long national nightmare" that was Watergate. Notice that this<br>pardon would have covered any crime Nixon may have committed during his<br>time as President, even if we hadn't yet discovered it.<br><br>Also note that pardons are for *federal crimes only.* States can still<br>charge persons who were pardoned if they choose.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
