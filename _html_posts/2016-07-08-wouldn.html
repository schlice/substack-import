<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: No.<br><br>There would be more evidence for the police to use as justification for<br>their actions in court if every officer were required to wear body<br>cameras., but the presence of a body camera won't change how an officer<br>responds to any given situations.<br><br>Police shootings of unarmed citizens will continue as long as unarmed<br>citizens continue to violate the law and fail to follow lawful<br>instructions by law enforcement. Remember (we all seem to forget this):<br>*unarmed* does not equal *not dangerous*.<br><br>Cops aren't going to suddenly stop doing their jobs because there's a<br>camera there. Heck, you don't have to buy any cameras for officers;<br>there's already ten cell phone cameras recording every officer during<br>any given traffic stop.<br><br>But again, the problem is not getting body cameras for every officer.<br>The biggest monetary hurdle is the storage and management of the<br>*petabytes* of data that will routinely be recorded.<br><br>And how long do you store discretionary video? Three months? Six months?<br>Every day longer you store your videos, the more the costs go up.<br><br>And when do you require officers to have video rolling? Surely every<br>interaction an officer has with the public, right? What about when he's<br>interviewing a rape victim? What about when someone may have been<br>partially complicit? You think they will be \*more\* forthcoming or<br>\*less\* forthcoming? What if the person did do something wrong? What if<br>he was in an inappropriate relationship with a woman? What if he was<br>cheating on his wife? You think he'd want that recorded and released<br>under a FOIA request?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
