<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm not sure what your particular fixation is, but any reasonable<br>exegetical reading of the Bible says absolutely nothing of what you have<br>indicated.<br><br>Luke 1:15<br><br>> *for he will be great before the Lord. And he must not drink wine or<br>> strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from<br>> his mother's womb. \-- Luke 1:15 ESV*<br><br>This chapter of the Bible deals with the prophet Zechariah telling<br>Elizabeth that she is going to bear a child in her old age. That child,<br>John the Baptist, will have a very important earthly ministry that<br>prepares the way for the Messiah. Nothing at all about "entering and<br>filling up a private organ."<br><br>Job 3:10<br><br>> *because it did not shut the doors of my mother's womb, nor hide<br>> trouble from my eyes. \-- Job 3:10 ESV*<br><br>So let's set the scene here. The book of Job details Job, a man who is<br>described by God as "blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned<br>evil" (Job 1:1). Satan accused God of protecting Job, and basically<br>blaming God's protection as the reason that Job was so blameless. Satan<br>uses an expression my wife loves to use: he accuses God of "placing a<br>hedge of protection" around Job, which is why Job never curses God. So<br>God allows Satan to torment Job as a test, but God limits what Satan is<br>allowed to do.<br><br>So in this scene in Job 3, Satan had just previously in chapter 2<br>afflicted Job with terrible boils all over his body, but still Job does<br>not curse God. Job is quite in pain, and in response to his affliction,<br>he curses the day he was born. This passage (3:10) is part of that<br>discourse. Not only does it not talk about "buttocks" but it has nothing<br>to do with a birthing door.<br><br>Job 3:11<br><br>> *"Why did I not die at birth, come out from the womb and expire? \--<br>> Job 3:11 ESV*<br><br>Continuing Job's cursing of his life because of his afflictions, he asks<br>why he didn't die at birth. He asks why he didn't just come out of the<br>womb and die. Maybe you were thinking that "expire" meant breathing, but<br>no, the word here translates to "die" or "expire" and not "breathe."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
