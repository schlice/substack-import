<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Well as a Christian, I'm not sure where you get the idea of *vileness*,<br>*selfishness*, or *hate* from, but I will tell you that Christians **are<br>indeed intolerant towards those who don't agree with them**, and I think<br>you are conflating *intolerance* with *hate*.<br><br>***WHAT?????? A CHRISTIAN JUST ADMITTED THAT CHRISTIANS ARE INTOLERANT<br>TOWARDS THOSE THAT DON'T AGREE WITH THEM???????***<br><br>::: {.ui_qtext_gif_noclick_wrapper background-url="images/qimg-8ea40ab6c639c0257ed3d7ee0f1d47e6" gif-embedded="images/qimg-8ea40ab6c639c0257ed3d7ee0f1d47e6" is-playing="true" interactive="true"}<br>!(images/qimg-8ea40ab6c639c0257ed3d7ee0f1d47e6){.qtext_image<br>style="max-width: 100%;"}<br>:::<br><br>*Mind. Blown.*<br><br>Does the American Academy of Pediatricians admit anyone who is not a<br>pediatrician? Does the plumber's union admit postal workers? Every group<br>which has a core set of beliefs does exactly the same thing, and they<br>are intolerant of anyone who does not believe as they do.<br><br>Churches are no different. As you may have heard, a church is not a<br>building. A church is a group of people who share similar beliefs. This<br>is no secret. In fact, in order to become a member of a church, you<br>usually must assent to a set of beliefs, normally in writing. This means<br>that the church, while open to *visitors*, accepts only those who<br>believe as they do as *members*.<br><br>This means, if you follow the logic, churches are *intolerant* towards<br>those who do not believe as they do. They do not tolerate unbelievers<br>becoming members. They love everyone, but they do not tolerate<br>membership by those who do not share their beliefs. And as I mentioned,<br>the church absolutely welcomes visitors. Even if you don't believe, stop<br>by, listen to the music and the message (even an unbeliever can get<br>something positive out of the message), have some free coffee and donuts<br>and experience some really nice fellowship (friendly conversation).<br>There are worse ways you could begin a Sunday.<br><br>In short, we love everyone, but only believers can become members.<br><br>It seems, though, you somehow equate religious intolerance with hate. It<br>only works in one direction: sure, even hate groups are intolerant, but<br>not all groups which are intolerant are hate groups. Every group is<br>intolerant of those who are outside of the group, but not all groups<br>which do not tolerate those from within the group are hateful.<br><br>\<br><br>Okay, time for the hard conversation. Let's apply this to the real world<br>rather than the theoretical. As an example, let's talk specifically<br>about a gay man. Let's ask some questions:<br><br>- Can an openly gay man attend church services?<br>- Can an openly gay man join the church?<br><br>To the first question, can an openly gay man attend church services,<br>the answer is *YES!* Unequivocally yes. Please come! We'd love to<br>meet you and share our diabetes-inducing sugary sweets along with a<br>great message of hope and salvation. God loves you and so do we!<br><br>But now to the next question, can an openly gay man join the church?<br>Now, it gets a little more challenging. Church membership includes<br>believing in the same doctrine as everyone else, and the Bible clearly<br>states that homosexual activity is a sin. Knowingly living in sin is not<br>what a Christian does. If you know the Bible, then you know that<br>homosexual activity is sinful. While we are all sinners, we all strive<br>to *not* be sinners. That means we work towards recognizing our sin and<br>repenting of (turning away from) our sin. In order to become a<br>member of the church, you too need to repent of your sin, and that means<br>not knowingly continuing in sin.<br><br>And yes, that is *intolerant*.<br><br>But it is not *unloving*.<br><br>We indeed love that man and want the best for him, but the loving thing<br>to do is not to allow him to knowingly continue living in sin. It would<br>actually be unloving to allow him to knowingly continue living in sin,<br>as it could affect his eternal future.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
