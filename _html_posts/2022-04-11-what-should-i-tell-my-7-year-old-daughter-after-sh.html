<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a great time to introduce the basics of gun safety to your<br>child.<br><br>You really shouldn't need to go into the "sometimes killing is<br>acceptable" schtick because it's a bit beyond the 7 year old mind. For<br>now, you can tell your 7 year old that guns are tools, but they can be<br>very dangerous if they are not used correctly. If you ever see one:<br>stop, don't touch, leave the area, and tell an adult.<br><br>By the way, I shamelessly stole that from the NRA's Gun Safety Program,<br>with Eddie Eagle. This would be a really really good time to [[introduce<br>your child to Eddie<br>Eagle](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=714943&url=https://eddieeagle.nra.org/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nra.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What should I tell my 7 year old daughter after she asked me \"Why do<br>guns exist?\" after seeing an ultra-violent scene in a movie playing on<br>TV (over which I had no control)? Besides \"to kill\" I don\'t know what<br>to say.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
