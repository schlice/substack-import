<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Your nephew has parents (albeit absentee), which is more<br>than can be said for most children in the foster care system, who are<br>either dead or in jail.\<br>\<br>I think you sitting down with the child\'s parents and explaining to<br>them that you are basically raising this child and they better get with<br>it or they are going to miss out on some of the best times in a child\'s<br>life.\<br>\<br>You can offer to them that you adopt the child, but there isn\'t a court<br>in the world that\'s going to award you custody when both biological<br>parents are actively part of the child\'s life (i.e. they are there<br>daily, regardless of how little attention they pay to their own child).\<br>\<br>Maybe the parents are taking you for granted. Maybe they are relying on<br>you way too much. Maybe you should limit your childcare to the times<br>when they are at work, and maybe they should be taking care of the child<br>beyond that.\<br>\<br>But forcing the courts to get involved is not a good situation. You\'re<br>much better off talking it out with them then trying to force their<br>hand.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
