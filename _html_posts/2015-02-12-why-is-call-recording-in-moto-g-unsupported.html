Not all call recordings will be admissible as evidence in<br>court proceedings, if that\'s what you were planning on doing with them.<br>I can\'t speak for any other uses of those recordings.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
