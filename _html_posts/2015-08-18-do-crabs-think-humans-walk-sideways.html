<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Answer which reflects the tenor of the question:*<br><br>They do. In a recent survey (highly controversial, since Galapagos crabs<br>felt very underrepresented), nearly 80% of crabs thought humans walked<br>sideways. Around 15% of crabs thought they walked sideways, and around<br>5% of crabs didn\'t really care to answer.<br><br>*Answer required to make this answer not a \"joke\" answer:*<br><br>Crabs do not \"think.\" They have a brain the size of a peanut. They<br>cannot form rational thoughts about their environment. They do not<br>possess higher-order thinking, and therefore do not have the mental<br>capacity to form opinions about their environment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
