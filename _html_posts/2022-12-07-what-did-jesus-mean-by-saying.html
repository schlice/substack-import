<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The phrase "do not cast pearls before swine" was part of the Sermon on<br>the Mount. Jesus was teaching about many things we know about, like "do<br>not judge, lest you be judged" and "first take the plank out of your own<br>eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your<br>brother's eye."<br><br>But then in verse 6, Jesus tempers this guidance, telling us that we<br>must learn the difference between "judgement" and "discernment" so that<br>we can discern the swine and not cast our pearls before them without<br>being hypocritical judges ourselves.<br><br>Jesus gives the same guidance to the apostles elsewhere in the New<br>Testament when He says, "If anyone will not welcome you or listen to<br>your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or<br>town" (Matthew 10:14).<br><br>In other words, we are told to share the gospel, but when it becomes<br>apparent that the gospel is not welcome, move on. We should not persist<br>in trying to share the gospel when it is clear through our discernment<br>that the gospel will only be met with ridicule.<br><br>But remember, that doesn't mean that we shouldn't share the gospel at<br>all. We are responsible to share the good news; we are not responsible<br>for how others receive it. Swine don't appreciate pearls, just as some<br>people don't appreciate what Christ has done for them. Our job is not to<br>convert them. Our job is to deliver the message; it is God who does the<br>hard work of conversion. Not all will be saved, but that doesn't change<br>our resolve in ensuring everyone has an opportunity to hear that<br>message.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
