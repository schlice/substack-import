<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Israel.<br><br>I suspect Israel will offer the people in Gaza the same deal they did at<br>the end of the Six Day War: *if you accept Israel\'s right to exist, if<br>you accept Israel as the valid authority in this region, you can live in<br>peace, as full citizens of Israel.* It\'s a good deal. For the Arabs in<br>the region, they would be the only Arabs in Europe living in an actual<br>democracy.<br><br>And just as after the Six Day War, some will take that deal<br><br>But some will not. And in this case, they will be asked to leave. I use<br>asked loosely. They won\'t actually be asked to leave. They will be<br>escorted out of the county. Israel can no longer afford to allow them to<br>remain when all they desire to do is destroy Israel. They have no desire<br>for peace. They have no desire for compromise.<br><br>Just think about the chants that they have been shouting at the pro<br>Palestinian rallies. "From the river to the sea, Palestine shall be<br>free.\" Where\'s the river? It\'s the Jordan River, the eastern border<br>of Israel. Where is the sea? It\'s the Mediterranean Sea, the western<br>border of Israel. They want nothing more than the complete destruction<br>of Israel. Israelis can no longer afford such people on their shores.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
