<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There's a lot of great information here from some really wonderful<br>people, but none of it really answered the question.<br><br>There are two components to addiction. One of them is a predisposition<br>to addictive behavior, and the other is exposure to addictive<br>activities.<br><br>It is currently unknown how addictive behavior actually, physically<br>works in the brain. We know the mechanism in the brain which<br>malfunctions during addiction, but we don't know *why*. Because we don't<br>know why that area of the brain malfunctions, we have no idea if that<br>malfunction is genetic or environmental or hereditary. We know what's<br>broken, but we don't know why it's broken. I know personally several<br>parents who used drugs and then just quit, cold turkey, without any<br>(known) side effects, who went on to have kids who became full-blown<br>addicts, and they wrestle with the fact that it was *so easy* for<br>them to simply quit, but a) their kids use, and b) their kids can't<br>stop. So we know that the broken bit in the brain which leads to<br>addiction is not necessarily, 100%, hereditary.<br><br>As for exposure to addictive behaviors, it may be that the old PSA from<br>the 80's is still true: *Parents who use drugs will have children who<br>use drugs.* Do you remember that PSA (assuming you are old enough to<br>remember it)?<br><br>Well for those of you who missed it (or who were born after it quit<br>airing), here it is:<br><br>[https://youtu.be/n5XakEKSIaM(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ea1c41&url=https://youtu.be/n5XakEKSIaM){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>I seriously can't tell you whether or not this is true, but I do know<br>that if you combine both the addictive personality (the broken bit in<br>the brain that leads to addiction) and exposure to addictive behaviors<br>(may not necessarily be drugs or alcohol, could be gambling, or Internet<br>porn, or any number of addictive behaviors) there is a much higher<br>likelihood that someone will become an addict.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
