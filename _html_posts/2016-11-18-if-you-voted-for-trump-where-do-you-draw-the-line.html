<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why in God\'s name would you think that a vote  would somehow<br>change my moral character? Do you *really, truly believe* that the<br>election of a President gives human beings some sort of permission to be<br>racist, or xenophobic, or inhuman?<br><br>Seriously, grow up. My vote doesn\'t change who I am. If I was inclined<br>to do any of the morally bankrupt things you listed in your question,<br>*i was going to do them anyway* because I\'m already morally<br>bankrupt. My vote didn\'t change that.<br><br>Unless you\'re implying that all Trump voters are morally bankrupt. If<br>you truly believe that, not only are you not paying attention, but you<br>completely missed the real reason Trump was elected.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
