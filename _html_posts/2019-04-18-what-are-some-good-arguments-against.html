<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are some good arguments against "Should private clubs have the<br>right to remain all male or all female if they do choose so?" (in the<br>USA)?**<br><br>There aren't any "good" arguments against forcing all private clubs to<br>be gender-neutral. The Constitution provides for freedom of association.<br>The courts have continually found that in private clubs, they are indeed<br>allowed to pick their members. The more exclusive a club is, the more<br>right they have to restrict their membership to a specific gender. The<br>more public a club is, the less right they have to discriminate in any<br>way. For example, the Boys Clubs of America lost a Supreme Court ruling<br>and was forced to admit girls, and now they're the Boys & Girls Clubs.<br>The court found that they basically admitted everyone, except girls, and<br>that was discriminatory.<br><br>That said, states are allowed to fight gender discrimination in whatever<br>way they choose. Minnesota limits the tax exemptions it gives to<br>male-only golf courses. It is not preventing the clubs from forming,<br>it's just not giving as many tax exemptions to clubs which discriminate.<br><br>This paragraph from<br>[Wikipedia(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6fe9f5&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_association){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} is interesting, and it<br>points to one reason why not all groups should be forced to allow all<br>comers:<br><br>> In the United States, expressive associations are groups that engage<br>> in activities protected by the First Amendment -- speech, assembly,<br>> press, petitioning government for a redress of grievances, and the<br>> free exercise of religion. In [[Roberts v. United States<br>> Jaycees](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=dede5f&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberts_v._United_States_Jaycees){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, the U.S. Supreme Court<br>> held that associations may not exclude people for reasons unrelated to<br>> the group\'s expression. However, in the subsequent decisions of<br>> [[Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Group of<br>> Boston](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6b1248&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurley_v._Irish-American_Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual_Group_of_Boston){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, the Court ruled that a<br>> group may exclude people from membership if their presence would<br>> affect the group\'s ability to advocate a particular point of view.<br>> The government cannot, through the use of anti-discrimination laws,<br>> force groups to include a message that they do not wish to convey.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
