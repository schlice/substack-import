<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In most jurisdictions in the US, you must dispose of the body correctly,<br>because a decomposing body produces toxic gases which are detrimental to<br>your health.<br><br>You could be charged with improper disposal of a corpse.<br><br>But what would be worse is the police investigation that would follow,<br>since innocent people who have nothing to hide will call the police to<br>come take the body away. Those who don\'t call generally have something<br>they want to hide. The police will want to find that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
