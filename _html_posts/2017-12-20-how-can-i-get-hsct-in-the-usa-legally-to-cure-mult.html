<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>[Me(https://www.quora.com/profile/Me-9043)]{.qlink_container}'s answer<br>is correct. And I'm reasonably sure that Northwestern is the only<br>location in the US which is actively doing HSCT trials, although this<br>may have changed by now (these trials do change rather quickly).<br><br>But the trial, as Dion mentioned, is really difficult to get into. Not<br>only do you need to have *very* aggressive MS, but you also have to have<br>tried traditional disease modifying drugs and have had limited or no<br>success with them.<br><br>The procedure is dangerous because, as Dion mentioned, they will<br>have to destroy your immune system by using chemotherapy to destroy<br>your bone marrow. Then, using stem cells they previously harvested,<br>replicated, and forced into pluripotency, they will rebuild your immune<br>system and your bone marrow.<br><br>You will be as an infant, with a brand-new immune system. At this point,<br>the common cold can kill you. You will need to be in sterile isolation<br>until your immune system can be rebuilt, **and there is no guarantee<br>that you will emerge on the other side without MS.**<br><br>As you can see, you have to be in some very dire straits before HSCT<br>would even be considered an option for you. The procedure is still too<br>new and too untested to be recommended to any but the most severe cases<br>of MS that are simply not responding to any of the therapies we<br>currently have. It is currently a treatment of last resort, and you<br>still may not even qualify.<br><br>But if you think you meet these criteria, discuss it with your<br>neurologist. If you truly fit the profile of someone who might qualify,<br>I'm certain they would go out of their way to help you get into the<br>trial in whatever way they could help.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
