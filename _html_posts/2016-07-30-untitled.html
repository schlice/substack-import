<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Unfortunately, your assumption is incorrect. It is only the court that<br>is concerned with your innocence or guilt. The police do not adjudicate<br>innocence or guilt, the police only deal with preponderance of evidence.<br>Only a court of law in the jurisdiction in which the incident occurred<br>can determine whether or not you are guilty of that offense. The police<br>do not have any say in that determination. If the police are called as<br>witnesses, it is only to clarify facts in evidence.<br><br>If the police had any concern with innocence or guilt, that would make<br>the police judge, jury, and executioner.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-do-the-police-think-of-the-public-saving-a-14-year-old-from-an-unjustified-arrest/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
