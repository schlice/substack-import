<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Highly unlikely.<br><br>Being saved doesn't change your human nature. The sins we commit, in<br>thought and in word, in our actions, and in our *inactions*, are tied<br>directly to the fact that we are human and fallible.<br><br>Sure, you will be *better* after you are saved. You'll think<br>differently. You'll act differently. You'll be in the word more. You'll<br>praise God more. You'll be able to more easily talk to God about your<br>sin and seek repentance.<br><br>But will you be completely free of sin? Highly unlikely.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>After receiving Jesus Christ, can one live a complete sin-free life?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
