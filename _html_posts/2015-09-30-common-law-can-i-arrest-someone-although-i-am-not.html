<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Citizen\'s Arrest is an authority granted to a private<br>person to detain an individual who they witnessed performing a crime.<br>The citizen must have probable cause to effect the arrest.\<br>\<br>Almost all states have some form of citizen\'s arrest statute, and<br>almost all states differ in how they implement the statute. Some allow<br>you to perform arrests for any crime. Some only allow you to perform an<br>arrest for a felony. Some require verbal announcement before force is<br>used.\<br>\<br>It would have to be a really sketchy situation for me to jump in and<br>make a citizen\'s arrest.\<br>\<br>My advice: be a good witness. Try to capture as many details about<br>the situation as possible. Who was the person? What was he wearing? What<br>did he do? When did he do it? Where did he go? Did he get into a car?<br>Did he get on the bus? Did he run off somewhere?\<br>\<br>Most everyone has a cell phone with a camera these days. Maybe snap some<br>pictures or record some video. That\'s way more useful than trying to<br>effect a citizen\'s arrest.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
