<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Under current law, it cannot be considered a felony.<br><br>The only way to make it a felony is to change the law. Contact your<br>lawmakers and demand that they make failure to pay child support a<br>crime.<br><br>As it stands, child support is a civil matter, not a criminal matter. It<br>can be accomplished with things like garnishment, where the supporting<br>parent has his wages garnished before he even gets them. A court order<br>can do that.<br><br>But currently, failure to pay child support is not a crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
