<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How do we get our HOA to enforce rules and regulations?<br><br>Contact them. Advise them of rules which are being violated. Ask them<br>for a specific response as to what they are doing about those rules.<br><br>Attend a board meeting. Board meetings are open to members (although<br>they may enter Executive Session to discuss specifics about homeowners<br>and maintain confidentiality). Ask them what the purpose of the HOA<br>actually is if they're not going to enforce their own rules.<br><br>Selective enforcement is actually worse than non-enforcement. When an<br>HOA selectively enforces rules, it can be very bad for them. In essence,<br>if they can't state a reason for selective enforcement, then *none*<br>of their enforcement of anything is valid.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
