<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Question details:*<br>><br>> *He\'s 32 and im under 18. My dad didn\'t care about our relationship,<br>> but now that I\'m pregnant, he wants me to be with him for financial<br>> security, the baby to know their father etc. If they both sign some<br>> papers, technically I could marry him now, if the judge approves.<br>> Would he be arrested?*<br><br>Consult with a marriage and family attorney in your area. If your dad is<br>so concerned about this, then perhaps he can pay for that attorney to<br>make the arrangements, or to advise you on how to proceed.<br><br>I would not do anything, including announcing to the world through the<br>court system who the father is, until you get the advice of an attorney<br>in your area.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
