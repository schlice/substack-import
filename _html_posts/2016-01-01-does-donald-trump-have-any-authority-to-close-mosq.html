<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [First, he would have to designate radical Islam a<br>terrorist organization. There have been Islamic terrorist organizations<br>on the Terror Watch List for years, adding radical Islam could be done<br>if it could be clearly defined.\<br>\<br>Once radical Islam (which is separate from traditional Islam) is<br>designated a terrorist organization, you can close the radical Islamic<br>mosques (i don\'t know how you can know that a mosque teaches radical<br>Islam, but still there it is), freeze the funds, and jail the terrorists<br>in Gitmo. This would be a valid exception to the First Amendment,<br>because the restriction on terrorists is a valid state interest, and the<br>limitation only affects radical Islam.\<br>\<br>The plan would be highly unworkable, but if you wanted to do it, that\'s<br>how.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
