<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Then I think the problem may be that you're asking the wrong questions.<br><br>Whether or not a phrase generates resentment in a person is irrelevant<br>to the discussion. It's purely tangential. Why would someone's feelings<br>about a discussion change anything at all? This is a discussion of fact,<br>and things that can be legislated, or can't be legislated because to do<br>so would be unconstitutional. Feelings have no place in such a<br>discussion; they simply muddy the water. Unless you only want to talk<br>about feelings and not goals. You can't "feel" your way to better laws.<br><br>This is the main difference between conservatives and progressives. When<br>evaluating a course of action, progressives ask, "Does it feel good?" In<br>other words, does it make me feel good that I'm doing something, even if<br>that something may not necessarily benefit the group that it was<br>intended to benefit. Conservatives, on the other hand, ask, "Does it<br>do good?" In other words, I understand that some feelings may be<br>hurt, but ultimately it helps people and works towards a good outcome.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Gun-owners-in-an-ideal-world-can-you-consider-an-understanding-between-the-anti-gun-position-and-yourself/answer/Mike-S-1686<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
