<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We already have a method to eject a sitting president in the event we<br>believe he cannot perform his duties competently.<br><br>Amendment 25, Section 4 of the Constitution was added for this expressed<br>purpose. If the president cannot perform his duties, the Vice President<br>can remove him from office:<br><br>> *Section 4**. Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either<br>> the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other<br>> body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro<br>> tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives<br>> their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge<br>> the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall<br>> immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting<br>> President.*<br>><br>> *Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore<br>> of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his<br>> written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the<br>> powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a<br>> majority of either the principal officers of the executive department<br>> or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within<br>> four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker<br>> of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the<br>> President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.<br>> Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within<br>> forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress<br>> within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written<br>> declaration, or, if Congress is not in session within twenty-one days<br>> after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote<br>> of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers<br>> and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to<br>> discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall<br>> resume the powers and duties of his office.*<br><br>We already have this mechanism in place which uses Congress (who are<br>elected by the people, unlike the President who is elected by the<br>states) to determine whether or not the President is fit to perform his<br>duties.<br><br>Besides, we don't need another "no confidence" measure. Presidents are<br>automatically removed from office every four years, unless the people<br>decide to leave the president in office for two terms, at which the<br>president is forcibly limited to two terms.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
