<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We can *cultivate* and *encourage* a culture that values and cares for<br>life, but we cannot *create* one. No one individual or group<br>*creates* culture, and any attempt to do so sounds way too Orwellian and<br>Huxley's *Brave New World*-ish to me. Society as a whole creates<br>culture. The best we can do is to *encourage* people to value and care<br>for life. If people do not do this on their own, no amount of<br>encouragement will change their minds.<br><br>No one can force anyone else to believe as they do. That's the nature of<br>free will, and we all have it. We are all free to believe as we wish. If<br>we do not already value life, no amount of laws will change that.<br><br>Therefore, the best we can do as pro-lifers is to, at the very least,<br>prevent people from killing babies. Valuing life is a long way from<br>simply not killing babies.<br><br>\<br><br>Now, if you asked me *personally* how best to create a culture that<br>values and cares for life, I'd tell you that we would have to get back<br>to a place where we quit kicking God out of our lives. Once we do that,<br>we'll start to see that things like valuing life and loving our<br>neighbors comes naturally. In other words, the reason that we as a<br>culture do not value life is because we have rejected God.<br><br>Now, you as an individual or even a small group may value life, even<br>without God in your life, but that's nothing more than a happy accident.<br>We cannot expect society as a whole to magically value life if there is<br>no arbiter of values outside of themselves. Implicitly necessary for an<br>entire society to value life is a fundamental belief in God.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
