From whom would you be<br>concealing the contents of that board? How would relevant parties be<br>invited to join?\<br>\<br>I\'m asking because it has been my experience that public forums have<br>always provided many more viewpoints than I ever could have gathered on<br>my own. ]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
