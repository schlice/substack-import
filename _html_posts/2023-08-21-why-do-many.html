<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is a particularly insidious deviation in the Christian community<br>called the "prosperity gospel."<br><br>The prosperity gospel is a doctrine in Protestant Christianity that<br>teaches that faith can bring health, wealth, and happiness into<br>believers\' lives. The prosperity gospel is also called prosperity<br>theology.<br><br>Adherents to the prosperity gospel believe that wealth is a sign of<br>God\'s blessing and that the poor are poor because of a lack of faith.<br>They also believe that faith, expressed through positive thoughts,<br>positive declarations, and donations to the church, can transcend<br>poverty and illness.<br><br>The prosperity gospel has its roots in the American occult tradition<br>called New Thought. It is a fast-growing movement associated with<br>Pentecostalism, evangelicalism, and charismatic Christianity. Some<br>notable prosperity gospel preachers are T.D. Jakes, Joel Osteen, Kenneth<br>Copeland, Oral Roberts, and Benny Hinn.<br><br>The prosperity gospel took root in the Pentecostal revivals of the<br>post-World War II years. Its popularity among American Christians has<br>boomed in recent years. It relies on the particular misunderstanding of<br>the book of Malachi<br><br>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=023e33&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>The prosperity gospel movement does make a few valid points. While the<br>love of money is indeed the root of all evil, we should also not<br>demonize success. Additionally, it is easier to make a positive<br>influence on society when you have disposable capital.<br><br>However, as you rightly noted, there is a valid and palpable difference<br>between "having wealth" and "idolizing money." Jesus explained just how<br>hard it is for people who idolize material wealth to enter heaven:<br><br>> It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for<br>> someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God. --- Mark 10:25 NIV<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
