<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Why should \"how\" a business does business make them<br>\"immune\" to anti-trust laws?\<br>\<br>Amazon doesn\'t manufacture any products. They may OEM some products,<br>but they don\'t manufacture any unique products, with the exception of<br>their Kindle e-readers and Fire Phones, and you can buy a Kindle from<br>Best Buy and Fire Phones from AT&T. They don\'t hold a monopoly on any<br>one product.\<br>\<br>However, let\'s assume that they did. Let\'s assume that they<br>manufactured a product that you couldn\'t get anywhere else and they<br>only sold it through their web channels. Would that be a \"monopoly?\"<br>Only if Amazon was the only company offering their product/service and<br>they made sure that no one else could offer the same product/service.<br>Currently, this is not the case. If Amazon tried to buy up all other web<br>retailers, that might create a monopoly of web retailers, but the simple<br>fact that anyone can set up a web e-store and sell stuff means that<br>Amazon can\'t do that. And net neutrality means that ISPs can\'t<br>prioritize Amazon traffic above Mom&Pop Shop\'s Web Store, so Amazon<br>can\'t bully their way onto your computer over Mom&Pop Shop.\<br>\<br>TL;DR: Being in online sales doesn\'t make you immune to antitrust<br>legislation. Amazon doesn\'t hold a monopoly in<br>anything.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
