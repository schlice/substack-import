<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Under federal law, it is illegal to possess, receive, distribute, or<br>access with the intent to view, child pornography. The thought on the<br>viewing clause is that by viewing the content, you are becoming the<br>consumer, which fuels the demand for the creation of content, and they<br>want to stop the creation of content. By cutting off the consumer, you<br>reduce the demand.<br><br>It is true that both acts being videoed are illegal. Sex with a child is<br>illegal. Killing people is illegal. Again, the thought behind the<br>viewing clause is to try to stem the flow of child porn by making it<br>illegal to consume it.<br><br>Since the ISIS videos are not created for the purpose of selling videos,<br>preventing people from watching them would not reduce the desire for<br>ISIS to create them. They will continue creating the videos, or if the<br>videos become wildly unpopular, they will just continue beheadings<br>without distributing the recordings. For them, the beheadings are the<br>goal; the videos spread the propaganda. For the producer of child porn,<br>if his market dries up, he's out of business. You can't stem the flow of<br>ISIS by making their videos illegal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
