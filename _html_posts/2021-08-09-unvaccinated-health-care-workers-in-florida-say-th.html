<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Of course they do. And unvaccinated health care workers should not be<br>required to be vaccinated.<br><br>**However, the hospital does not have to keep unvaccinated health care<br>workers in direct contact with patients.**<br><br>The hospital can reassign unvaccinated personnel to desk jobs in<br>offices, away from patients.<br><br>And if the hospital does not have a suitable position to relocate the<br>unvaccinated, they may be forced to terminate them.<br><br>Alternatively, the hospital can divide their ER and their ICU into<br>locations for "vaccinated" and "unvaccinated" patients, if they have the<br>capacity to do so. Then they can leave all the unvaccinated health care<br>workers to deal only with vaccinated patients. But most hospitals don't<br>have the capacity to split their ER and ICU like this; it's just not<br>practical.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Unvaccinated health care workers in Florida say that mandating the<br>COVID-19 vaccine violates their rights. But don\'t patients, many of<br>whom already have serious underlying health issues, have the right to<br>receive care in a safe environment?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
