<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It is not illegal to ask where you can buy illegal drugs.<br>This is not considered solicitation, because there is no intent to<br>participate in the sale and/or purchase of illegal drugs. For example,<br>you could be doing research on where illegal drugs are sold in a<br>particular city.\<br>\<br>It may be illegal to walk up to a drug dealer and tell him you want to<br>buy drugs. \"Solicitation\" of a crime involves verbal indication that<br>you want to commit a crime and intent to participate in the commission<br>of that crime. You don\'t actually have to buy the drugs in order to be<br>convicted of the crime of solicitation.\<br>\<br>It is definitely illegal to actually hand over the money in exchange for<br>drugs.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
