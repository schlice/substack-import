<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there anything other than an EpiPen that can help with<br>anaphylaxis?**<br><br>No.<br><br>It must be made clear: if you know you are prone to anaphylaxis, you<br>need an EpiPen. Without epinepherine, you can die.<br><br>You can, however, improve your chances until the ambulance arrives. You<br>should absolutely be calling 911 if you experience an anaphylaxis, even<br>if you do have an EpiPen. Deploying your EpiPen and calling 911 are<br>essential to do together. You should never deploy your EpiPen without<br>calling 911. Never. Deploy EpiPen, call 911. Every. Single. Time.<br><br>Your best best will be to buy some Children's Benadryl chewables.<br>Because of the quick dissolve strips and the Fast Melt pills being<br>discontinued, this is likely your best bet.<br><br>[[Amazon.com: Children's Benadryl Allergy Chewables with Diphenhydramine<br>HCl Antihistamine, Grape Flavor, 20 ct: Prime<br>Pantry](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=690b6a&url=https://www.amazon.com/Childrens-Benadryl-Chewables-Diphenhydramine-Antihistamine/dp/B01M0L2HWV/ref%3Dsr_1_5?keywords%3Dbenadryl%2Bfast%2Bmelt%26qid%3D1555093716%26s%3Dpantry%26sr%3D8-5){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>You'll want to start chewing four of them, and stick the resultant<br>mush under your tongue. Hold it there for as long as you can, then<br>swallow.<br><br>Of course, you must also call 911. Anaphylaxis, with an EpiPen or not,<br>needs immediate medical attention, or you could die.<br><br>If you know you're at risk of anaphylaxis and you either don't have (or<br>can't get yet) an EpiPen, buy a bottle of liquid Benadryl, or the<br>aforementioned quick-dissolve strips, and keep it with you at all times.<br>I recommend keeping the Benadryl with you, even if you do have your<br>EpiPen.<br><br>You may be able to find some fast-melt tabs or other dosing options at<br>your local drug store. Just remember that the adult dose is 50 mg every<br>4 hours, max 300mg per day.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
