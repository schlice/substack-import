<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So it doesn't seem like you asked a question here. You made a statement.<br><br>In most cases, doxing in and of itself is not illegal, especially at the<br>federal level.<br><br>That said, depending on where you live, doxing may violate certain other<br>rules, like laws designed to combat stalking, threats, and harassment.<br><br>So while doxing itself may not be technically illegal, you still may<br>find yourself on the wrong side of the law if you do it.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>The beauty of the US legal system is you can ruin someone\'s life online<br>by posting private information about them, or dox them, and there\'s<br>nothing they can do because it\'s protected by First Amendment?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
