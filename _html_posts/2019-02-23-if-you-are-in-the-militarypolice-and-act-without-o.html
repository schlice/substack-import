<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you are in the military/police and act without orders, is that<br>illegal?**<br><br>The answer is "it depends."<br><br>Your duties and responsibilities are assigned to you. Technically, you<br>have a standing order to fulfill your responsibilities. You have wide<br>latitude to do what is needed to fulfill your responsibilities and<br>duties.<br><br>It is unlawful to act *against* your duties and responsibilities. So if<br>you're ordered to do something, and you do the opposite, that's a<br>failure to follow orders or a dereliction of duty. In the military, it<br>violates the Uniform Code of Military Justice. For the police, as long<br>as the action taken wasn't illegal in and of itself, then it violates<br>department policy, so while not necessarily "illegal," it can still get<br>you fired.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
