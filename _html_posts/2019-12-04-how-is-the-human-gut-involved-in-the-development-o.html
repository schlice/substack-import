<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How is the human gut involved in the development of multiple<br>sclerosis?**<br><br>The answer is "we don't know exactly how yet, but we know that it is<br>involved."<br><br>Along with the research you indicated, which shows that certain signal<br>proteins are found more often in MS patients than in the general<br>population, [[a longitudinal pilot<br>study](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c763ba&url=https://onlinelibrary.ectrims-congress.eu/ectrims/2019/stockholm/278432/caterina.ferri.effect.of.dimethyl.fumarate.on.gut.microbiota.in.patients.with.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ectrims-congress.eu"}]{.qlink_container} published at<br>ECTRIMS has been monitoring how dimethyl fumarate (marketed in the US as<br>Tecfidera) affects the gut microbiome, and has even gone so far as to<br>say that *one of the primary modes of the drug's operation is to alter<br>the gut microbiome*. (From my own experience with Gilenya, I wouldn't be<br>surprised if the same were true for that drug as well, along with any of<br>the other oral MS meds).<br><br>So put those two together. You have a drug which alters the gut<br>microbiome. That microbiome has a definite correlation to disease<br>progression in MS. It is natural to conclude that there could be a<br>causal relationship there.<br><br>In fact, we have long recognized in medicine that there is a [[gut-brain<br>connection](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=62b894&url=https://www.google.com/search?q%3Dgut%2Bbrain%2Bconnection){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container}. You know all about the<br>Central Nervous System (CNS) and the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS),<br>but how much do you know about the [[Enteric Nervous System<br>(ENS)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=dbfceb&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteric_nervous_system){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}? I bet a good half of you<br>reading this don't even know it exists. The ENS is a portion of the<br>Autonomic Nervous System and consists of a mesh-like coating of nerve<br>fibers around the entire digestive system. It actually performs the<br>"heavy-lifting" of controlling the digestive process. Those ENS nerve<br>cells, most especially the ones surrounding the gut, are virtually<br>identical to nerve cells found in the brain and CNS. So when someone<br>says they got "a gut feeling," it could be because the gut responds<br>physically to the same signals which trigger emotional centers in the<br>brain. This is also why dyspepsia causes us to be in a bad mood. In<br>other words, when our gut hurts, our emotions are affected, and<br>vice-versa.<br><br>Recognizing that there is a connection between what happens in our gut<br>and what happens in our brain seems straightforward, but may be a key to<br>unraveling the disease process in MS.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
