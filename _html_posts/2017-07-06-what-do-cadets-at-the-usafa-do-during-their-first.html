<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Original question: What do cadets at the USAFA think during their<br>> first week?*<br><br>*Probably not much.*<br><br>It's such a whirlwind while you go through your first week that it's<br>really hard to process anything. You're woken up at oh-dark-thirty (you<br>don't know because you have no watches or clocks) to screaming and<br>banging and telling you you're late before you even had a chance to be<br>on time. You're shuttled around to lots of different activities and you<br>basically just *go along* and don't think a whole heck of a lot.<br><br>Thinking comes later, not during the first week.<br><br>Before you can be a good *leader*, you have to be a good *follower*. And<br>to be a good follower, you need to learn how to follow.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
