<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The salient part in the Fifth Amendment is bolded:<br><br>> No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous<br>> crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except<br>> in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when<br>> in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any<br>> person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of<br>> life or limb; **nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a<br>> witness against himself,** nor be deprived of life, liberty, or<br>> property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be<br>> taken for public use, without just compensation.<br><br>The 5th Amendment simply says that you cannot be forced, in a criminal<br>case, to be a witness against yourself.<br><br>So if, in answering a question, the answer would implicate you<br>criminally, you are not required to answer that question.<br><br>It doesn't matter the subject of the question. If the answer would<br>implicate you, then you are not required to answer it.<br><br>Now, prosecutors could *cut a deal* with him, wherein he would<br>answer the question with a guarantee that he would not be indicted<br>for any criminal behavior of his which his testimony may or may not<br>reveal. If they really want to "nail Trump," they'd offer him that deal.<br><br>If they're not offering him that deal, it's because they're not going<br>after Trump. That's probably because they don't believe they have enough<br>on Trump to go after him, and this testimony wouldn't be enough either.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>In the transcript of John Eastman\'s attempt to block the release of his<br>emails to the 1/6 Committee, he consistently pleads the Fifth. He<br>continues to plead the Fifth when the questioning shifts to Trump\'s<br>actions. Does the Fifth still apply here?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
