<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There is no law that distinguishes unmarked lanes. For<br>example, when you\'re at a traffic light on a 4-lane road (two straight<br>lanes in both directions and no road markings), you can go straight from<br>either lane.\<br>\<br>]<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-f0daf21f0e84b96d0337526847aa0843){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-f0daf21f0e84b96d0337526847aa0843" master_w="799"<br>master_h="484"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br>(*image courtesy* [[*Google<br>Maps*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0d0abd&url=https://www.google.com/maps/@38.948856,-104.769899,3a,75y,128.59h,90t/data%3D!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sN32CKUAcUFaOIFD8gBWsRA!2e0){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container} *Street View, Lexington Dr<br>and Union Blvd, Colorado Springs, CO*)\<br>\<br>\<br>In this street view, it\'s clear that the left lane is a turn lane. But<br>the next two lanes (the one that says Lexington Dr and the right lane)<br>can both go straight across. Legally, you can go straight from either<br>lane. However, I tend to move left (into the lane that says Lexington<br>Dr) if I\'m going to go straight. I do this because I know that people<br>can turn right from the right lane, and I don\'t like to impede them. I<br>know I don\'t like to be impeded from turning right on red, even though<br>I know it\'s not an exclusive turn lane. However, I DO know that I<br>can\'t go anywhere but straight in the left lane (not the turn lane) at<br>the red light, so I move left. I\'m not impeding any traffic at the red<br>light because you can\'t go anywhere from that lane on red. The same<br>would hold true if there was no turn lane there; you can\'t go anywhere<br>on red, where you can turn right from the right lane on red.\<br>\<br>So in that situation, if I\'m going straight, I do move left, but it\'s<br>out of courtesy, not legal obligation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
