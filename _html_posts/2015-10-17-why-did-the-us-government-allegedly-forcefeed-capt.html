<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Under the Geneva Convention, which we are holding to as<br>far as treatment of prisoners (even though the combatants do not fall<br>under the legally recognized criteria for inclusion), say that prisoners<br>of war must be provided full medical care while they are prisoners.\<br>\<br>Widespread hunger strikes have taken place at Gitmo, and when the chief<br>medical examiner determines that the body has fallen below healthy body<br>mass, he can order force feeding through a nasal tube. Many of the<br>prisoners accepted the force feeding, while others needed to be sedated<br>and/or restrained as they would induce vomiting to attempt to remove the<br>forced nutrition.\<br>\<br>Doctors cannot, in good conscience, \"let them die.\" We don\'t allow<br>anyone else in the world to starve themselves to the point of death; we<br>intervene and provide them with mental health counseling. However, when<br>counseling fails, and the person still refuses to eat, doctors can<br>intervene.\<br>\<br>Some have called force-feeding \"torture,\" alleging that the military<br>made the process unnecessarily painful and humiliating, a charge which<br>the United States vigorously denies. The US believes that failing to<br>intervene when a person becomes dangerously malnourished is torture, and<br>we may have to forcefully intervene to save that life.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
