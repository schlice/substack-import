<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How are Colorado Springs and Boulder different? How are they<br>similar?**<br><br>I like [[Chuck<br>Corwin](https://www.quora.com/profile/Chuck-Corwin)]{.qlink_container}'s<br>answer, but let me give you the *other* answer.<br><br>First, let me agree with him: Colorado Springs and Boulder are as<br>different as cowboys and hippies. And let's be clear: the cowboys live<br>in Colorado Springs and the hippies live in Boulder.<br><br>There's a reason why it's called the "People's Republic of Boulder."<br>I'll let you figure that one out on your own.<br><br>Look, Boulder is a college town. It has a lot of liberals. Colorado<br>Springs is a military town (it's right in the middle of four military<br>installations). It hosts the headquarters of *Focus on the Family*. It's<br>a conservative town.<br><br>But beyond the fact that Boulder is smaller and has a small, quaint town<br>feel, and Colorado Springs is a city of over a million people and has a<br>large town/small city feel, they're pretty much the same. They both have<br>direct access to the mountains. They both have the same climate.<br>Colorado Springs does get the evening shadow of the sun setting behind<br>the mountains (because it's at the foothills of the Rampart Range) and<br>Boulder does not (because it's in the mountains).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
