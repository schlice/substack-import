<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The statements are completely incorrect and incongruous<br>because they are incorrect.\<br>\<br>**Guns don\'t kill, people, who use the guns, kill, so no need for<br>stricter gun control.**\<br>\<br>This is an accurate statement. We shouldn\'t focus so much on the gun.<br>We should focus more on the person who uses the gun.\<br>\<br>Then you went on to make a completely unrelated comparison.\<br>\<br>**Cigarettes don\'t kill, people, who smoke them, kill, so no need for<br>strict controls on sale.**\<br>\<br>First, while people who smoke can (over many years) kill bystanders, it<br>is completely unintentional. Gun users can intentionally kill people.\<br>\<br>Second, guns do not kill the person using them (by default). Cigarettes<br>do kill the person using them (by default).\<br>\<br>Third, gun makers have no qualms about telling users that the gun kills<br>whatever is standing in front of it when it goes off. That\'s its<br>designed purpose. Cigarette makers spent half a century and hundreds of<br>billions of dollars trying to convince you that cigarette smoke was<br>harmless. Now we know the difference, and the public health backlash has<br>been nothing short of an epidemic. No such epidemic exists with guns<br>(despite what media hype leads you to believe).]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
