<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**A neighbor\'s dead tree is threatening to damage my property. I\'ve<br>sent a letter which he ignored. Can I take a lien on his house if he<br>attempts to sell without addressing the issue?**<br><br>Short answer is no. You do not have standing to take a lien since no<br>damage has yet occurred. And even if you did, you still do not have<br>standing just because (in tort) he has trespassed and caused damage.<br>Your claim has to be adjudicated by the court; you do not have a prior<br>financial interest, nor do you have any financial control over his<br>property, so you cannot take a lien against his property<br><br>You will have a civil claim once the tree falls, but until actual damage<br>occurs, you have no claim.<br><br>Your best bet is to talk to him.<br><br>If you've talked to him and gotten nowhere, send a ***certified<br>letter*** (I know you're only sending a letter next door, but do it<br>anyway) so that you can prove you sent a letter and he got it. He can<br>indeed refuse to respond to it, as is his right, but you can prove that<br>you notified him well in advance of any actual damage.<br><br>Then, when damage does occur, you'll have an easier time suing him in<br>small claims court to recoup your losses.<br><br>Beyond that, there is nothing more you can do until actual damage<br>occurs.<br><br>A reputable home inspector will tell him that he has to disclose the<br>dead tree and its potential to fall as part of the sale of the home, and<br>a buyer could make him take it down before they accept the house, if<br>they chose to make that part of the agreement to buy the house.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
