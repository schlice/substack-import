<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How likely is one to be a victim of a home invasion?<br><br>Crimes against property are on the rise in my neck of the woods. People<br>are getting more desperate, as drugs have become more plentiful and jobs<br>have not. We've had two smash-and-grabs in my neighborhood, both in<br>broad daylight. Thankfully no one was home in those houses, but I work<br>from home...<br><br>Statistics say that people are unlikely to be involved in a home<br>invasion crime. If you choose to put your faith in statistics, you can<br>feel secure knowing that it's unlikely that someone would target your<br>house.<br><br>But I ask you: if you have a newer (\< 20 years old) house, how likely<br>is it that you'll be the victim of a home fire? This doesn't preclude<br>you having at least one fire extinguisher within reach somewhere, if<br>you're smart. And an empty (unloaded) fire extinguisher isn't going to<br>do you much good when you need it most.<br><br>Is \"home defense\" a valid reason to have a loaded firearm?<br><br>I compromise slightly on this, but it's my personal choice. I like the<br>intimidation factor of racking the slide on my M&P .40, or allowing the<br>bolt to slam forward on my M4. It's akin to racking a shell into a<br>shotgun: nothing beats that sound. Plus, I've trained doing just that a<br>million times, so I'm fully confident in my ability to get a round in<br>the chamber in less than a second.<br><br>So the guns in my house which are prepared for home defense sit in<br>Condition 3 (full magazine inserted, chamber empty). I need only rack<br>the slide or charge the weapon to make it ready to fire. I know this,<br>but I'm the one who will be using these weapons should they need to be<br>employed, so I'm willing to take the extra second to do that, even<br>knowing that gunfights are usually over within five seconds.<br><br>It's a small compromise, but it enhances the safety of the weapons,<br>while still leaving them in a state where they could be made ready in<br>less than a second.<br><br>So do I have a "loaded firearm?" I would say that I don't, but it could<br>be loaded in less than a second. It's about as close as you can get to<br>having a loaded weapon without actually having a loaded weapon.<br><br>Maybe something like this will assist you in your decision.<br><br>By the way, I always carry handguns in what is commonly known as<br>Condition 2 in the "four condition" spectrum where Condition 4 is "safe<br>and clear." Condition 2 is when there is a round in the chamber and the<br>hammer is down (uncocked). There is usually no external safety, but for<br>example my gun can optionally have one. If it does, that safety is OFF.<br>Most \'modern\' handguns like the SIG, Glock, H&K, S&W, and other DA/SA<br>autoloaders are designed to be carried this way (first shot DA, rest<br>SA). These guns typically have two or three internal safeties that block<br>the firing pin, and disconnect the sear & trigger so that the gun may<br>only be fired by pulling the trigger. This type of gun is quite safe in<br>this mode (our instructor said you could literally hammer nails with a<br>gun in this condition; we decided not to test that), whereas SAO (single<br>action only) autoloaders are not. Again, I train with my guns this way,<br>so I understand how it feels and I'm ready for that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
