<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It is true that there is a difference between law and morality, and you<br>cannot legislate morality. But from there, things get confusing.<br><br>At a basic level, you can say that is is immoral to break the law<br>because part of being a good citizen is obeying the laws, and it is a<br>moral good to be a good citizen and do your part to promote the general<br>welfare of the society in which you live.<br><br>But as you dig deeper, you may find that there may be laws which may be<br>immoral (to you, as morality is personal), but not illegal. Some<br>examples of things which may be immoral but not illegal might include<br>getting an abortion, or cheating on your spouse.<br><br>Conversely, some things may be moral (to you), but illegal. Some<br>examples of these may be underage drinking, smoking marijuana, going<br>through a red light if you're driving an injured person to the emergency<br>room (guilty, btw), or even assisting someone with suicide.<br><br>But because everyone's morality is different, we cannot rely on morality<br>to be the arbiter of behavior. We have to set a baseline for conduct<br>that keeps everyone safe and allows everyone to freely exercise their<br>rights without impinging on anyone else's free exercise of *their*<br>rights. That's part of the government's charter to "promote the general<br>welfare and secure the blessings of liberty." So it's entirely<br>acceptable to tell someone who has voluntarily become part of a society<br>that they acted "wrongly" when they knowingly violated a law, and even<br>to punish them for it, ***even if it was a moral good for them to do<br>so.***<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>It\'s wrong to commit a crime. Just philosophically, wouldn\'t it be<br>unreasonable to expect someone who chose to commit a crime not to commit<br>that crime? Because he chose to commit a crime. We should ask him to be<br>punished and say \'you did it wrong\'?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
