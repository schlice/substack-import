<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Many pro-life people make exceptions for the mother's life but what<br>about medical procedures or medication that the mother needs but could<br>harm the fetus? Ie. chemotherapy for a cancer that isn't guaranteed to<br>be but could be fatal.**<br><br>We seem to be missing what *is* and *is not* a choice between the life<br>of the baby and the life of the mother.<br><br>It sounds like the medical procedures the mother needs can probably be<br>delayed until the baby is born. If they can, then it *is not* a choice<br>between the life of the mother and the life of the baby. If they cannot,<br>then it *is*.<br><br>Doctors take the Hippocratic Oath which begins "First, do no harm." That<br>means no harm to anyone, including the baby. They would only risk the<br>health of the baby if the mother's life was at stake. Otherwise, they<br>would delay those treatments until the baby is born.<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance<br>for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough<br>shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion<br>masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your<br>own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.<br>If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"<br>don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything<br>vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a<br>block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
