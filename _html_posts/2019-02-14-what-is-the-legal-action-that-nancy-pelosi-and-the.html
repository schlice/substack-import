<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the legal action that Nancy Pelosi and the House can take now<br>that the White House has confirmed that Trump will take executive action<br>to build the wall?**<br><br>The House can sue the Trump Administration for spending money without<br>Congressional approval. As Matthew Bohrer [[already<br>explained](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-legal-action-that-Nancy-Pelosi-and-the-House-can-take-now-that-the-White-House-has-confirmed-that-Trump-will-take-executive-action-to-build-the-wall/answer/Matthew-Bohrer)]{.qlink_container},<br>Republicans sued the Obama Administration over ACA funding.<br><br>However, this lawsuit would be different. Trump does have various<br>methods by which he could *legally* use DoD funding to build a fence,<br>following a declaration of national emergency. If the court finds that<br>these methods are, in fact, lawful (and don't violate the Constitution<br>in and of themselves), then the decision to utilize them would be<br>political questions, not legal ones. I'd think you would find the courts<br>failing to render a decision because it would be primarily a political<br>question, not a legal one.<br><br>In that case, the House would be left with impeaching the President over<br>an abuse of power, abusing the national emergency system to bypass<br>Article I of the Constitution. The Senate still won't remove him from<br>office over that, as they would equivocate about whether or not the lack<br>of funding actually constituted a national emergency. They would<br>probably defer to the President's judgement over that, and still<br>wouldn't see it as something which would prevent the President from<br>completing his term in office.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
