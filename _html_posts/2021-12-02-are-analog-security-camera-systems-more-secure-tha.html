You can have wired<br>digital cameras (using CAT5 Ethernet cable), or wired analog cameras<br>(using BNC, or "coaxial" cables). You can also have wireless versions of<br>both analog or digital cameras (which I'll discuss in a minute).<br><br>*Theoretically,* wired cameras are less prone to hacking or jamming<br>because they are wired. There isn't a wireless signal which can be<br>jammed.<br><br>However, there are two types of wireless cameras: *wireless*<br>*analog* *cameras,* and *wireless digital cameras*. Older wireless<br>cameras communicated to their base station DVRs using wireless analog<br>signals. These wireless cameras used RF antennas to communicate with<br>their base stations. The RF signal was far less reliable than today's<br>cameras, as it was prone to interference from other wireless devices<br>like cordless phones or sometimes cell phones.<br><br>*Wireless digital cameras* communicate using Wi-Fi. This is an IP-based<br>network, not a radio transmission of an analog signal. Wi-Fi cameras are<br>just as secure as any other wireless device on your home wireless<br>network. They do not rely on a base station receiver to work; they<br>connect to your wireless access point (AP) on your home network. Usually<br>that is your Internet Service Provider's (ISP's) home router supplied to<br>you when you signed up for their service. It could also be a Google or<br>Netgear or eero or other mesh network device.<br><br>So these days, you don't have to run a wire to get secure, clear video<br>pictures. Wi-Fi cameras will do the job for you.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Are analog security camera systems more secure than ones with antennas<br>for its DVR receiver through which they communicate. (lorex. com) How<br>secure they are and or what is needed to ensure they are not easily<br>jammed or hacked etc?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
