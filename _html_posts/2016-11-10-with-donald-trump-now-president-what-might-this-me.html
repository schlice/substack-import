<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This pretty much sums up what it means:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-aa7297473b0f8408dcfe314fd61f9932){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-aa7297473b0f8408dcfe314fd61f9932" master_w="557"<br>master_h="820"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Specifically, it means several things:<br><br>- We don't have to worry about calls for repeal of the PLCAA (Protection<br>  of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act), which protects gun manufacturers from<br>  liability and lawsuits simply when properly-functioning guns are used<br>  illegally<br>- We don't have to worry (quite so much) about calls for "common-sense<br>  gun regulations" which, as we've learned under an Obama<br>  administration, are really calls to reduce access to guns for<br>  law-abiding citizens to try and control lawlessness, and for silly<br>  regulations that govern cosmetic changes and limitations on<br>  standard-sized magazines.<br><br>And the big one:<br><br>- We don't have to worry that our government will support hate groups<br>  like Black Lives Matter and their defense and encouragement of open<br>  murder of police officers. We can be certain that if anything can be<br>  done to crack down on those types of ideas, it will be done. Don't get<br>  me wrong, if they have legitimate complaints, we'd be happy to hear<br>  them, but so far they have spewed nothing but lies, hate, and vitriol.<br>  We don't need that.<br><br>Some other pro-2A legislation we may see:<br><br>- Congress may propose "nationwide concealed carry" or "national<br>  reciprocity" such that any state would recognize the concealed carry<br>  permits issued in any other state, assuming a minimum level of<br>  training and background checking is performed by every state (which<br>  also, by extension, standardizes currently disparate training and<br>  background check requirements across the states).<br>- Congress may seek to standardize punishments for using a gun in the<br>  commission of a crime, making those charges mandatory and not subject<br>  to plea bargaining.<br><br>What it will also mean:<br><br>- Declining gun sales. When there is no threat that "guns will be taken<br>  away" or severely limited, sales of new guns will go down. Fear is a<br>  great motivator. When there is no fear, there is little motivation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
