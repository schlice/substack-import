<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Indeed, this is a valid question. I mean, abortion is legal, but not<br>everyone agrees that it's right. Polygamy is illegal, but some people<br>believe that it should be legal.<br><br>We live in a nation of *laws*. Laws are basically designed so that while<br>*you* exercise your freedoms, you don't negatively impact anyone else<br>who is exercising their own freedoms.<br><br>Let's just take one example: abortion. How does abortion negatively<br>impact anyone else's rights? It most definitely impact's the baby's<br>rights, doesn't it? So how is this disagreement handled? The courts had<br>to determine whether or not the law allowing abortion violated the<br>baby's rights. Essentially, what they came up with (and this is a *very*<br>basic summary) is that the baby *has no rights* because it's not a<br>"person" for the definition of person in the Constitution until it is<br>*born*. Before that, it's a "fetus" and is not subject to the<br>protections granted to "persons" in the Constitution.<br><br>So in general, how this works:<br><br>- A law is written.<br>- Someone disagrees with the law, and argues that the law violates<br>  one of their Constitutional rights.<br>- The court decides whether or not the law actually violates their<br>  Constitutional rights. If it does, the law is stricken. If it does<br>  not, the law stands.<br><br>People can certainly have differences of opinion. You can argue that<br>polygamy doesn't hurt anyone, and you should be able to take more than<br>one wife or a woman should be able to take more than one husband. Good,<br>honest people can disagree in this way.<br><br>However, people also understand that in order to live *harmoniously*<br>with other people, we all have to *agree* on what laws we are to live<br>by. We all understand that we have to *cede* a small amount of our<br>autonomy to do *whatever we want* so that we can all live together<br>without negatively impacting each other.<br><br>As a citizen in a society, we all agree to follow the law (despite our<br>personal preferences) so that a civil society will follow. We can always<br>attempt to change the law (legally, of course), but until the day when<br>the law is changed, we agree to follow that law. It's foundational to<br>being a member of a civil, law-abiding society.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
