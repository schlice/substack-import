<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The passage you are referring to when you reference "no more crying in<br>heaven" is from Revelation. While the apostle John was in exile on the<br>island of Patmos following the resurrection and assumption of Christ<br>into heaven, he was shown the future. He recorded what he was shown and<br>it became the book of Revelation.<br><br>Chapter 21 of Revelation discusses when John was shown "the new heaven<br>and the new earth":<br><br>> Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the<br>> first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. And I saw the<br>> holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared<br>> as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the<br>> throne saying, "Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will<br>> dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be<br>> with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes,<br>> and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor<br>> crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away." ---<br>> Revelation 21:1--4 ESV<br><br>So it doesn't exactly say that no one will be able to cry in heaven.<br>What it *does* say is that people will dwell together with God in the<br>hew heaven and the new earth, and all of the mourning and pain would be<br>gone. All of the sadness and all of the tears would be gone, because<br>God is going to defeat evil. So all the pain and all of the sadness will<br>be gone, and we won't have to cry because we won't be sad.<br><br>TL;DR: There won't be any sorrowful crying in heaven because<br>there won't be anything to cry about. *Tears of joy*, however, should be<br>the default, as there won't be anything that could be *more* joyful than<br>living in the presence of God for all of eternity.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
