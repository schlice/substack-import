You *can* be prosecuted for<br>admitting that you gained your knowledge of how to commit a crime *by<br>actually committing a crime*.<br><br>It doesn't matter where or when you admit to a crime, be it an online<br>forum or in a bar. If you admit to committing a crime, you can be<br>investigated and prosecuted based on your own un-coerced admission.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
