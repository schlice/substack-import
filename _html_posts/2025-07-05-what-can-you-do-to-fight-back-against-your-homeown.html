<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It depends on what you mean by "unreasonable demands.\"<br><br>For example, the HOA may be telling you to tear down the shed you just<br>spent all weekend putting up. Unreasonable? Certainly sounds like it.<br>But what if your neighborhood does not allow sheds? Is it unreasonable<br>then?<br><br>What counts as unreasonable is whether their request can be reasonably<br>related to the authority granted to them by the Governing Documents.<br><br>If you truly believe that the HOA is making demands that are *so<br>unreasonable* as to be not authorized by the Governing Documents, you<br>should have little trouble retaining a real estate attorney in your area<br>who specializes in HOA law. Because that\'s the only way you can stop<br>the HOA from enforcing the Covenants and fining you for non-compliance.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
