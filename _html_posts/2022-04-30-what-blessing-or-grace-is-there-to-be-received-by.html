<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>None whatsoever. We are not baptized in order to gain favor or to become<br>acceptable to God. We don\'t get baptized *in order to* be saved. We get<br>baptized *because* we are saved. Baptism is an outward sign of an inner<br>reality.<br><br>We get baptized for a number of reasons. Primarily, we are baptized<br>because it is commanded by God. Jesus said that if you are a follower,<br>you show that you are a follower by being baptized.<br><br>Secondly, baptism mirrors and celebrates Christ\'s death and<br>resurrection. Submerging in the water signifies Christ\'s death and<br>burial. Surfacing from the water signifies Christ\'s resurrection into<br>eternal life, and the fact that believers will join him in that new<br>life. This is often echoed by the words that we sometimes say when we<br>baptize. We'll say, "I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son,<br>and the Holy Spirit,"<br><br>\<Lower the person into the water\><br><br>"Buried with Christ..."<br><br>\<Raise the person out of the water\><br><br>"Raised with him into New Life."<br><br>(Note that there is no "script\" to baptism, but this is just one thing<br>that we say when we baptize someone, and it is right to reprint it here)<br><br>You don\'t "get\" anything from baptism. You demonstrate your love for<br>God by being baptized.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
