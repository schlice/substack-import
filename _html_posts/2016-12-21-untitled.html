They will bang on doors, knock on windows, and might even<br>peep in windows to see if the person is okay.<br><br>If they notice smells outside of the house that might indicate a person<br>was deceased inside the home, they may enter the home without a warrant.<br>The "plain smell" test is equivalent to the "plain sight" test.<br><br>If they hear a fight inside, and it sounds like someone is in trouble,<br>this is an exigent circumstance and officers can forcibly enter the<br>home.<br><br>In any circumstance, the officer must be able to articulate to the court<br>the reason for the forced entry, and it must comport with a valid<br>definition of exigency.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Someone-prank-calls-911-They-send-police-to-my-address-it-is-1-am-and-I-am-sleeping-I-injure-kill-the-cop-thinking-he-is-a-criminal-What-happens-The-cop-cops-didnt-yell-Police-when-coming-into-my-property/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
