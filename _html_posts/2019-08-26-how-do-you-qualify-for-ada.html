<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How do you qualify for ADA?<br><br>An individual qualifies for protection under the ADA if they have a<br>recognized disability.<br><br>Remember that this definition of disability is a *legal* one, which<br>differs from a *medical diagnosis*. A person with a disability<br>*under ADA* (which means the legal definition) is defined as a person<br>who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or<br>more major life activity. This includes people who have a record of such<br>an impairment, even if they do not currently have a disability. The<br>definition also includes individuals who do not have a disability but<br>are regarded as having a disability.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
