<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Constitution provides a method for presidents to be removed from<br>office in the event of "high crimes and misdemeanors." That method is<br>called *impeachment.* Impeachment is generally reserved for things that<br>a president does which are *criminal* or *unethical.* That said, it's<br>important to note that *impeachment is not a legal process, but a<br>political one.* So it's not about prosecutors and judges and police,<br>it's about Representatives and Senators.<br><br>So what happens if a president actually commits a crime while in office?<br><br>The president isn't above the law. The president is indeed subject to<br>the law just like any other citizen of the country. But indicting a<br>sitting president, arresting him and jailing him has broader<br>implications for the country. Arresting a president would be very<br>damaging to the country, and we recognize that fact. The general legal<br>philosophy here is that you don't arrest a sitting president. He's<br>certainly not a flight risk; we know exactly where he is at all times.<br><br>So what do you do? If a president (as Trump alluded to) shoots someone<br>in the middle of Fifth Avenue, what do you do? You make him no longer a<br>sitting president so that you can indict him. Therefore, you must first<br>*impeach* the president and remove him from office, and *then* you may<br>indict and arrest him.<br><br>I've often thought about this, and I've wondered about the statute of<br>limitations. What if it expires while we are waiting to impeach and<br>remove from office? What if we impeach but we do not remove from office,<br>and then the statute of limitations expires? I'm reasonably sure that<br>the statute would be *tolled* until such time that the president becomes<br>*eligible* for prosecution, but because it has never happened before,<br>there is no legal precedent to say either way. I'd like to say that I'm<br>confident in my analysis, but I have no real world experience to back it<br>up.<br><br>Nevertheless, to answer the question, the Constitution does not provide<br>any immunity for *criminal* acts while a president is in office.<br><br>\<br><br>Since the question did not specify, let's talk about a president's<br>*political* acts while in office. As we just discussed, impeachment is<br>the Constitutional remedy for high crimes and misdemeanors. But what if<br>the president just does *bad things* while in office? What if he signs<br>treaties which are not in the best interest of the US? What if he's just<br>a *bad president?*<br><br>Unfortunately, there is no remedy for a president who simply does his<br>job badly. The Framers chose to not add a provision into the<br>Constitution whereby a president could be *recalled* from office. They<br>certainly could have, but they chose not to. They wanted the presidency<br>to have some permanence. They wanted presidential elections to be<br>meaningful. They wanted people to only elect people into office who can<br>do the job; they did not want presidential elections to say "We'll elect<br>you today, but we reserve the right to decide later on if you're doing a<br>good job." Then we have to deal with the ramifications of a recall. Does<br>someone else serve until the end of that term? Do we hold new elections?<br>We have a hard enough time getting an election done every four years,<br>could you imagine if we had to do it more frequently?<br><br>So if a bad president is elected, what do you do? The answer is **you<br>don't re-elect him**. The next time he is up for election, you elect<br>someone else. The downside is that you have to live with his bad<br>presidenting for four years, but that's why people will often say<br>"elections have consequences."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
