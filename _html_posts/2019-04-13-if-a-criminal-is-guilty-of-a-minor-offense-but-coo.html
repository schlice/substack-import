Most police departments do not allow<br>anyone under arrest to ride without that shiny pair of silver bracelets.<br>Many departments don't allow officers to cuff you in front, either. Some<br>departments allow the officer to decide to cuff in front with the<br>addition of a lap belt and buckle, pinning your wrists to the front of<br>your body. Generally, this is only allowed in the case of medical<br>necessity (i.e. the arrestee's arm physically cannot move in the<br>direction a traditional behind-the-back handcuffing would require).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
