<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The taxi can bill you if their credit card system is broken and they<br>only will accept cash. In some cities, city ordinance requires cabs to<br>take credit cards. If their cab advertises that they take credit cards,<br>it\'s reasonable for you to assume that you can pay by credit card.<br>Therefore, they can\'t \*force\* you to pay by cash if there are clear<br>advertisements on the door of the cab that show they take cards. If this<br>ever happens, make the cab company bill you for the ride. Give them your<br>name, your address, show them your driver\'s license, etc., and make<br>them bill you. If the cabbie wants cash that badly, make him drive you<br>(off the clock) to an ATM, then drive you back to your original<br>destination (off the clock) and pay him the original fare.<br><br>Ideally, however, you and the cabbie should work this out before you<br>ride.<br><br>Protip 1: Tell the cabbie when you get to the door, before you \*start\*<br>your ride that you have no cash and can only pay credit. If the cabbie<br>can\'t take your card, he\'ll call you another cab that can.<br><br>Protip 2: When you call to request your ride with the cab company, tell<br>them over the phone your driver \*must\* be able to accept your credit<br>card because you have no cash. Then when the cab arrives, use Protip 1.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
