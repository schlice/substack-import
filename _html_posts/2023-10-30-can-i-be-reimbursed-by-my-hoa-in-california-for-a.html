<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Certainly! But I think you may be unclear on the method by which you<br>obtain your "reimbursement."<br><br>Yeah, that's right, lawsuit. Retain an attorney and "request" that they<br>refund the money you sunk into removing the cover that they approved,<br>and when they don't pay (they won't), file a lawsuit.<br><br>In other words, there's no statutory way to be "reimbursed." If you were<br>monetarily damaged by another's incompetence, the remedy is a lawsuit.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
