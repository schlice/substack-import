Do Blink<br>cameras (owned by Amazon) also share footage with law enforcement?**<br><br>Ring started its "Neighbors" app to help combat crime in neighborhoods.<br>Ring also partnered with over 400 law enforcement agencies, allowing<br>them to request video clips from Ring users who have opted in to the<br>program. Ring users must consent to share the clips with law<br>enforcement; law enforcement does not have unfettered access to your<br>Ring camera or any clips without end user consent.<br><br>To the best of my knowledge, Blink (owned by Amazon) has not entered<br>into any partnerships with law enforcement, nor do they have a network<br>like the Ring "Neighbors" network.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
