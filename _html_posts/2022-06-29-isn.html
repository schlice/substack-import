<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The representation numbers, according to the Constitution, are<br>determined based on the population of (or the fact that you are in) a<br>state. DC is not a state, it is a special district.<br><br>So there is no Constitutional authority to give Congressional<br>representation to the district.<br><br>There are a few ways to address this:<br><br>- Legislation<br>- Constitutional amendment<br>- Return the District to the state of Maryland<br>- Make DC the 51st state<br><br>While these have all been proposed, they have all faced challenges, both<br>political and Constitutional.<br><br>But *taxation without representation?*<br><br>Those people live in a not-state. Only states have representation in<br>Congress.<br><br>Personally, I think the *best* argument is to return most of DC (all of<br>the *residential areas*) to Maryland, and reduce DC down to the areas<br>that only encompass government buildings. In this way, 95% of the<br>population of the district would end up in a state, and have voting<br>representation in Congress. Those who chose to continue living in the<br>areas immediately around the major government buildings would have to<br>accept the fact that they live in a not-state and keep living as<br>they are. Or they can move down the street and get their representation.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Isn't disallowing the District of Columbia a voting member of the House<br>and representation in the Senate considered taxation without<br>representation?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
