Can the doctor be held liable if the passenger he/she<br>helped dies?**<br><br>Despite Good Samaritan laws, doctors can be held liable in many<br>jurisdictions if they fail to render assistance.<br><br>However, failing to render assistance and failing to keep the patient<br>alive are two very different things.<br><br>If the doctor assisted and did everything in his power to keep the<br>patient alive, and the patient dies anyway, the doctor is not held<br>liable for that death. If, however, it can be shown that the doctor did<br>not provide adequate medical assistance, a case may be made for wrongful<br>death. It's highly unlikely that this would actually be the case,<br>however.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
