<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**The legal principle \"Ignorantia juris non excusat\" was reasonable<br>once, but given sheer number of laws it has become unreasonable if not<br>downright evil. Is there a movement to repeal it?**<br><br>First of all, it's a legal principle, not a law, so it can't be<br>"repealed."<br><br>Secondly, are you saying that, simply because the sheer volume of laws<br>makes it *physically impossible* to know them all, that it's acceptable<br>to violate the laws you claim you don't know about?<br><br>Hopefully you can understand why this would be unworkable in any<br>reasonable system of justice, because I can merely claim that I was<br>unaware of the law I violated, and I should therefore not be convicted<br>of it because I claim I didn't know. Then, the state would not only have<br>to show that I violated the law (which is objective), but then they<br>would have to show that I'm lying and that I actually knew that what I<br>was doing was illegal.<br><br>In other words, ignorance of the law is not an excuse because I would<br>merely have to claim that I had no idea that something was illegal in<br>order to avoid liability for that particular crime.<br><br>The justice system assumes that **for all basic activities that take<br>place outside your home, you are aware of what is legal and what is<br>not. This is a legal principle known as imputation**. If you intend<br>on engaging in other than basic activity outside of your home, the<br>justice system expects that you will study the law as it pertains to<br>your specific activity, as all laws are published in many different<br>formats and is accessible to all citizens. For example, if you want to<br>go hunting, the laws surrounding where you can hunt, what permits you<br>might need, and what training you will need to accomplish in order to<br>receive your permits, is all available for you to consume before you<br>hunt. That you did not know what was legal and what was illegal is not<br>an excuse when you shoot a deer from your car window, or if you shoot<br>across a road.<br><br>Additionally, the justice system must still balance the fact that you<br>cannot know all laws at all times with the need for *justice*, meaning<br>the need for society to hold lawbreakers accountable for their crimes,<br>whether or not they were aware that the actual act was, in fact, a<br>crime. The legal system says that if you engage in something other than<br>basic activity outside of your home, it is your responsibility to know<br>the law, or learn the law, for your activity in your jurisdiction.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
