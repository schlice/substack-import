<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because sometimes it is legally justified to take a life.<br><br>If killing another human being was never justified in any<br>circumstance, then there would be no right to self-defense which<br>includes the use of deadly force. But there are several circumstances in<br>which killing is justified, and one of those circumstances is<br>self-defense.<br><br>In the United States, you have the right to life. This right to life<br>means that no one has the right to *unjustly* take your life from you.<br>And if you cannot defend your life, then do you really have a *right* to<br>life at all?<br><br>Therefore, the right to self-defense flows from the right to life. You<br>have the absolute right to defend your life with whatever tools you have<br>at your disposal, including tools that impart deadly force.<br><br>Additionally, someone seeking to *unjustly* take your life *forfeits*<br>his or her privilege to be secure in their right to life. In other<br>words, if you seek to take someone's life, your own life is forfeit.<br><br>It is also a well-established principle of true self-defense that you<br>can meet force with force. You can apply an equal force being<br>applied to you to your assailant. A valid self-defense structure permits<br>this.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
