<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [[[Adey<br>Hill](https://www.quora.com/profile/Adey-Hill)]{.qlink_container}\'s<br>assessment of issues with TV and UK policing are very similar to the<br>issues we have with TV and US policing.\<br>\<br>Most US TV police dramas depict police officers and detectives taking<br>great liberties with Constitutional rights, depicting police<br>organizations as highly political and highly corrupt, and the only way<br>that justice can be served is when line-level cops or squad-level<br>detectives break the rules to make it happen.\<br>\<br>Also, the whole \"drop your gun\" thing is completely untrue. I really<br>dislike that one, and I appreciate the shows that \"do it right\" and<br>show the cop not dropping his/her gun. Cops don\'t drop their guns for<br>anything.\<br>\<br>The image of the \"rogue cop\" who spends his career at odds with<br>everyone in the unit is a popular one in movies and TV, and it\'s about<br>as far from reality as you can get. Tolerance for that sort of behavior<br>is exceedingly limited in real life.\<br>\<br>Even \"reality-based TV\" shows like \"Cops\" are highly flawed because<br>of the way they are edited. There is a great deal of very important<br>interaction which is conveniently left out of the TV show due to the<br>constraints of time and format.\<br>\<br>Now, on the other hand, if there is any show at all that you should<br>watch to get a fairly decent idea what a detective\'s life looks like,<br>watch \"The First 48\" on A&E. That\'s about as close to reality as<br>you\'re going to get on TV.\<br>\<br>However, unlike the UK, police officers in the US are allowed to lie to<br>suspects in order to get them to talk. A common interrogation technique<br>is separating two suspects and then turning them against each other,<br>saying that the other already gave them the whole story \"and they<br>pinned it all on you, so we don\'t need to question you.\" This, of<br>course, infuriates the suspect being questioned, who usually says one of<br>two things: \"No way, my boy would never roll on me,\" or \"WHAT? It was<br>all HIS idea! Why would he even say that? The rat bastard!\" (Of course,<br>the usual coarse stream of expletives has been removed to protect your<br>eyes).\<br>\<br>\<EDIT\> I didn\'t mention shows like the \"CSI\" franchise because they<br>are all completely and totally made-up from start to finish. There\'s no<br>attempt at all to portray reality in any way.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
