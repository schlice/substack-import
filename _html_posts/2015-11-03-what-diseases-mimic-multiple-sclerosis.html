<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Question details:*<br>><br>> A patient\'s symptoms closely follow those of relapsing-remitting<br>> multiple sclerosis, eg episodes of visual problems (blurring,<br>> double-vision, eye-flicker, optic neuritis), fatigue, leg/arm weakness<br>> and leg/arm/facial parasthesia. However, apart from a few more than<br>> age-consistent white spots in the brain, MRIs do not show any evidence<br>> of plaques. The patient does have mild cervical and lumbar spinal<br>> stenosis.<br>><br>> What other diseases might be consistent with these symptoms.<br><br>The problem with your line of thinking is that diseases don\'t mimic MS,<br>because MS doesn\'t have any symptoms which are unique to it.<br><br>There are many diseases which can cause the symptoms you\'re describing.<br><br>- Strokes of the blood vessels supplying blood to the eye, tumors, or<br>  retinal disorders may mimic ON and can cause blurring and double<br>  vision.<br>- I can\'t even begin to list the number of diseases and conditions<br>  which cause fatigue.<br>- Leg/arm weakness and leg/arm/facial parasthesia can all be caused by a<br>  stroke, which could also produce the ON symptoms. They can also be<br>  caused by peripheral neuropathy, specifically symmetrical<br>  polyneuropathy.<br>- Spinal stenosis could be a contributor to symmetrical polyneuropathy.<br><br>Before a diagnosis of MS can be made, all of the other potential causes<br>of the symptoms in question must be ruled out. MS is still today a<br>diagnosis of exclusion. You must exclude all other potential causes of<br>the symptoms in question before MS can be considered.<br><br>Additionally, lumbar puncture and visual evoked potential tests can be<br>performed to help confirm a diagnosis of MS, should it come to that.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional medical advice.
