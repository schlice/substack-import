<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Along with [[Chaplain<br>Frank](https://www.quora.com/profile/Chaplain-Frank-1)]{.qlink_container}'s<br>excellent answer, I used to have the same problem with people taking<br>"smoke breaks." It was a bit unfair, no? I mean, I didn't smoke at the<br>time, so how did they get to leave their duty stations for 15 minute<br>smoke breaks while I didn't?<br><br>The answer: I was just as permitted to take "fresh air" breaks at the<br>same interval as they were to take "smoke breaks."<br><br>Sundays are time off for just about everyone who had a M-F 9--5 job in<br>the military. How you choose to spend your Sunday mornings is up to you.<br>You can use that time to attend church services if you like, or you can<br>just take that time to relax and unwind.<br><br>When it came to positions which were 24x7, sometimes the mission takes<br>priority and you have to work on a Sunday. Christians and other<br>believers understand and accept this, so long as accommodations are made<br>when building schedules for predicted work.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
