<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**To anyone following the Amber Guyger trial: What is your opinion about<br>what the verdict should be? How would you vote if you were a juror?**<br><br>So there are two things at issue here.<br><br>1.  Was her belief that she was in her own apartment reasonable?<br>2.  Did she act in accordance with the law based on the information she<br>    had at the time?<br><br>I think you can fairly honestly find that her belief was not reasonable.<br>There were many clues that she was not in her own apartment. There was a<br>skylight (his apartment was on the top floor, hers was one floor down).<br>There was a red floormat in his, not in hers. There were plenty of clues<br>as to whether or not she was not in the right apartment. A reasonable<br>person should have known that they were in the wrong apartment.<br><br>However, and this is a very very important point: **the courts do not<br>question the basis of a person's belief before using that belief in the<br>adjudication of laws where one must believe something in order for it to<br>apply.** For example, before you can use deadly force against a person,<br>you must believe that your life is in danger. Your life may not have<br>*objectively* been in danger. It may not have even passed the reasonable<br>person test (i.e. would a reasonable person have believed the same way).<br>That person may have been holding a BB gun, or a cell phone, or an ice<br>cream scoop, but you still *believed* that it was a gun, and you<br>*believed* that your life was in danger. The operative factor is whether<br>or not the defendant believed that his or her life was in danger.<br><br>In this case, Amber Guyger believed she was entering her own apartment.<br>Even if that belief was unreasonable, she believed it.<br><br>To that end, she acted in accordance with the law in defending herself<br>in a location she believed to be her own.<br><br>So while it is a terrible tragedy, it is not murder. She should not be<br>convicted of a crime. The Castle Doctrine should protect her from<br>criminal charges.<br><br>That said:<br><br>1.  Once the family raises the civil trial, she will almost definitely<br>    be found culpable for the wrongful death of the man.<br>2.  She will also lose her job and will never work in law enforcement<br>    again.<br>3.  She may also face a Federal civil rights violation case, which she<br>    should clearly lose as well.<br><br>So don't think for a second that just because she should not be<br>convicted of a crime that she gets to walk away from this scot-free. She<br>will never work in law enforcement again and she will lose every asset<br>she owns. She'll be lucky to find gainful employment anywhere but in the<br>service industry on the other side of the country after she legally<br>changes her name. Her life, as it is today, is effectively over.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
