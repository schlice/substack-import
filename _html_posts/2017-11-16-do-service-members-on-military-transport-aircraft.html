<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Box Nasties. Also known as<br>[A-Rations(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d5a153&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-ration){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. These are "cold meals"<br>which generally consist of a protein, some fruit, some pre-packaged<br>snack items, and a drink. A-Rations are distinguished from B-Rations,<br>which consist of mostly canned and preserved items for areas where<br>refrigeration is not readily available.<br><br>Notice I didn't say anything about heating, because that's a luxury.<br><br>As you board the cargo hold of the aircraft you'll be stuck in for the<br>next several hours, you're handed a nondescript white box and a set of<br>foam earplugs. Yay.<br><br>The last time I did this, I boarded a C-141 (yeah, just dated myself) to<br>fly from Peterson AFB in Colorado to Hickam AFB in Hawaii. My box nasty<br>had a few pieces of cold fried chicken, an apple, some assorted snack<br>items which I don't remember, and a water. You should also note that the<br>141 was decked out in passenger mode, with pallets attached to the cargo<br>deck with "airline seats" (a generous term for these seats) as well as a<br>"comfort pallet" which was a self-contained unit housing two full<br>bathrooms. For long-haul passenger flights, cargo aircraft are often<br>fitted with these, but not necessarily for passenger comfort, but<br>because it made it easier to fit more people inside than could be fit on<br>"jump seats."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
