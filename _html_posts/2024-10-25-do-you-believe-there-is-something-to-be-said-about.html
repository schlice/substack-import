<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There has to be something to be said about Jesus, because if there<br>is nothing special about Jesus, then we have a real problem.<br><br>We have a real problem because *Jesus claimed to be God.*<br><br>So if Jesus was simply a man, and He was *not* God as He claimed,<br>then He was either a charlatan, a trickster, a liar; or He was insane.<br><br>In other words, Jesus can either be a liar, a lunatic, or<br>Lord. He can only be one of these. So the questions to ask yourself:<br><br>- What does the *evidence* from the Bible show you?<br>- What does your *heart* tell you?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
