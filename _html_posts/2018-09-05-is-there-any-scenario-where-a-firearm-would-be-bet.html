Anything smaller and you<br>could literally just piss off the bear instead of stopping it.<br><br>If the bear spray isn't potent enough or isn't applied correctly, you<br>may also just piss of the bear with it as well.<br><br>So I don't like either scenario.<br><br>But if I had the choice, I'd have a Desert Eagle or a hunting rifle.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
