<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can I trade in my Samsung Galaxy 8 with cracked screen and get credit<br>towards a new phone?**<br><br>Depends on what you mean by "trade in."<br><br>If you're literally talking about a trade-in program, some carriers<br>offer this service. You can turn in a phone which you own outright, in<br>any condition, and they will give you a certain amount of money for that<br>phone, depending on the amount of damage. You can immediately apply that<br>money towards the purchase of a new device, take it as bill credits,<br>etc.<br><br>If you don't own the phone (i.e. you're leasing it or making no-interest<br>payments on its purchase), before you can trade it in, you have to fix<br>it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
