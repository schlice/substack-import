<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Woody Allen once said, "If you want to make God laugh, tell him about<br>your plans."<br><br>What does that mean? It means that you're not in control, God is.<br>God will not alter His plans because of something you want. God's plans<br>are God's plans; they are not alterable. You cannot alter God's plans.<br>You cannot affect God's punishment for sin.<br><br>That said, as others have told you, do not enter into promises lightly,<br>and don't make promises that you cannot keep.<br><br>Let me ask you this: when you made your promise to God, *what did He<br>say?* Did He say, "Okay, I'll accept that promise and alter my plans for<br>you"? Based on the number of times God has altered His plans when humans<br>have asked (exactly zero), I think that this is not how He answered you.<br>He likely said, "Good intentions, but no, I won't be making that<br>promise."<br><br>Try this instead:<br><br>Instead of telling God what you're going to do, and expecting Him to<br>follow your plan, ask God to reveal His plan to you, and to help you to<br>come alongside Him and participate in His plan.<br><br>Because no matter what you say, God is God, and He is going to<br>accomplish His plans in your life. Ultimately, you'll be better served<br>if you start trying to adapt yourself to God's plans rather than<br>persisting in trying to have God change His plans to fit you.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What if, I made a promise to a god that I will never masturbate and I<br>said if I ever break this promise as a punishment I said I could never<br>achieve my dream, I ruined my life and also relationship with god. will<br>I be forgived?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
