<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Question Details:*<br>><br>> *I live in a subdivision that has a home owners association.\<br>> I found out after thousands of dollars on the pool and equipment,<br>> excavator, and skid steer rental, sand delivery and about 80%<br>> completion that I can not have an above ground pool in my own fenced<br>> in back yard.\<br>> The president of the association stopped by on the day I started to<br>> level my yard and was about 80% done with digging and leveling the<br>> area to explain to me that it is written in the by-laws that home<br>> owners are not allowed to have above ground pools in this<br>> subdivision.*<br>><br>> *He explained to me that it was written into the by-laws by the land<br>> developer and had no clue of why it was not allowed, I then petitioned<br>> the HOA and submitted a detailed plan of what my intentions were for<br>> the pool. After 4 weeks I received am E-mail explaining that my plan<br>> had been denied because of the written by-law. When asked again of<br>> why? The answer was because the land builder had it written into the<br>> by laws.*<br>><br>> *I have only been here since August so I have not read the complete<br>> list of the 320 page by-laws. So it is definitely my fault for not<br>> looking into, and reviewing the by-laws but what can I do to over turn<br>> this stupid rule?\<br>> Or what are they legally capable of doing to me if I throw the pool up<br>> anyway?*<br>><br>> *Thank you in advance for your serious feedback.*<br><br>I hate to be the bearer of bad news...<br><br>It appears that you're not in a very good position. It was your<br>responsibility to know the HOA rules before you started work. You even<br>could have asked the HOA for clarification.<br><br>If you proceed with the installation, the HOA can fine you for every day<br>you are not in compliance.<br><br>If you don't pay the fines, the HOA will turn your account over to their<br>attorney and they will continue to fine you, apply late fees, and now<br>attorney's fees, to your balance.<br><br>Eventually, they will place a lien on your house for the unpaid fines<br>and fees.<br><br>And eventually after that, if your account is delinquent for long<br>enough, they can foreclose on your lien, selling your house to pay for<br>the fines.<br><br>You really have two options:<br><br>1.  Restore the grass and landscape back to the way it was. And then<br>    move.<br>2.  Retain a real estate attorney in your area who specializes in HOA<br>    law and challenge the legality of the Bylaws, or the clause in the<br>    Bylaws which you are in violation of.<br><br>NOTE: There is one notable exception, and it is *very new and very<br>hot off the presses.* If you happen to live in Florida, you just dodged<br>a bullet. Florida Statute 720.3045 was just passed by the Legislature<br>and signed by Governor DeSantis. It reads, in part:<br><br>> Regardless of any covenants, restrictions, bylaws, rules, or<br>> requirements of an association, and unless prohibited by general law<br>> or local ordinance, an association may not restrict parcel owners or<br>> their tenants from installing, displaying, or storing any items on a<br>> parcel which are not visible from the parcel\'s frontage or an<br>> adjacent parcel, including, but not limited to, artificial turf,<br>> boats, flags, and recreational vehicles.<br><br>So if it is not illegal to install a pool in your town or city, the HOA<br>cannot prohibit you from installing a pool so long as it is not visible<br>from the front of your house, or from a neighbor's property.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
