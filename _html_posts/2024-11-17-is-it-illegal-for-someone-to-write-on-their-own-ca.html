<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In general, no.<br><br>There are specific things you write on the car which could be<br>actionable, but the police probably won't be the one charging you. For<br>example, if you wrote "My neighbor Greg is a child molester," you could<br>be sued for libel and ordered to pay a big fine if you are wrong about<br>that, but you don't get arrested or charged by the police. And you could<br>run afoul of HOA regulations about cars with writing on them if your HOA<br>has such a regulation, but that doesn't involve the police either.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
