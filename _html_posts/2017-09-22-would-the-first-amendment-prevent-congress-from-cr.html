<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a great question, and very prescient, I might add.<br><br>Because of the proliferation of "fake news," and the attention it has<br>brought, some have questioned whether or not such a thing should be<br>legal.<br><br>So the question is: Does the First Amendment protect fake news?<br><br>The short answer is yes. We know that it does, but the real question<br>should be under what circumstances would fake news *not* be protected?<br>There are already some classes of speech which can run you into legal<br>trouble, and clearly the biggest one is libel. Defamation is closely<br>related. But knowingly publishing something you know not to be true is<br>not a crime, regardless of how untrue it really is.<br><br>But what if it's so compelling, and social media picks up on it, that it<br>spreads like wildfire and people start to believe it?<br><br>> I call this the Loser's Argument: If that other side would stop being<br>> so persuasive, people would agree with me. Typically, people deploying<br>> the Loser's Argument are losing, and they know it. Arguers are looking<br>> for some external leverage to control the debate. Juries are known as<br>> fact-finders, not because they are clairvoyant truth machines, but<br>> because eventually facts are needed to move cases forward. Searching<br>> for some source of authority, in the case of prosecutions for fake<br>> news appealing to the courts and eventually the police, doubles down<br>> on the Loser's position.\[1\](#qjgIL){#cite-qjgIL .citation_link}<br><br>So what then do we do? How do you counter free speech? Do you do so by<br>*restricting* that speech?<br><br>To that, I can say most definitely no.<br><br>**You counter incorrect but free speech with more, correct, free<br>speech.**<br><br>You win hearts and minds in the arena of ideas. You have to learn to<br>present better, more cogent arguments, and counter ideology with fact.<br>Don't try to *silence* your opponent. Instead, *debunk* your opponent.<br><br>There are some other ways around fake news distribution, and that is<br>with better editorial oversight. Facebook is building and refining tools<br>to do this automatically. Google is "demonetizing" content that does not<br>meet its "quality standards." Editorial discretion is actually also<br>protected free speech, so this fits quite nicely with the tenet of using<br>free speech to counter fake news.<br><br>**TL;DR: Criminalizing fake news is not the way to go. Countering fake<br>free speech with louder, correct free speech is the correct way to go.**<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-qjgIL){.citation_index} [[Should Publishing Fake News Be a<br>Crime?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f0894f&url=http://www.ozy.com/pov/should-publishing-fake-news-be-a-crime/80180){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ozy.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
