<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In actuality, **smartphones have not had any breakthroughs in the last<br>ten years.**<br><br>Not since the first iPhone was released and smartphone manufacturers<br>went away from physical keyboards to all-touch displays was there a<br>"breakthrough" in the smartphone industry.<br><br>Larger cameras, more cameras, better cameras, fingerprint readers, iris<br>readers, face readers, bigger screens, bezel-less screens,<br>brighter/flatter/rounder screens, etc. etc. are *evolutionary*<br>changes, not *revolutionary* changes. The move from a physical<br>keyboard to an all-touch display was the biggest change in smartphones<br>in the past ten years. Everything else has been simply improving what we<br>already have.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
