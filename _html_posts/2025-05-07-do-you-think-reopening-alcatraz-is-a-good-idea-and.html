<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, it's just not a good idea. Alcatraz was shut down because it became<br>too expensive to maintain. In today's dollars, it's just not<br>realistically feasible to re-open it.<br><br>Alcatraz is a relic. It's got the emotional appeal of this historical<br>badass prison, but practically, there are much better prison designs.<br><br>I bet if Trump visited ACX Florence (i.e. Supermax), he'd be singing a<br>different tune. He'd probably want to fund the construction of like five<br>more Supermax prisons, as the Supermax design is *functionally*<br>impervious to escape.<br><br>No island needed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
