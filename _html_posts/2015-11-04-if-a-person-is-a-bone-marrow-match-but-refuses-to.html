Patient A\'s sibling is<br>> a perfect match, but refuses to donate. Is there any legal action<br>> Patient A can take to compel them to donate?<br><br>None whatsoever. Donation is voluntary. Heck, registration in the bone<br>marrow registry is voluntary. If the sibling is not registered, you<br>cannot compel them to register either.<br><br>That said, there is a level of anonymity between donor and patient. If<br>they are utilizing the registry, the patient and donor remain anonymous<br>until long after the procedure is completed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
