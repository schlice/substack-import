<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the difference between illegal and unconstitutional in the<br>United States?**<br><br>Illegal refers to an action which violates a law. Laws are either<br>passed by Federal or state governments. They tell you things which you<br>are not allowed to do, and if you do them, you can be fined or arrested.<br><br>Unconstitutional refers to a Federal or state government action<br>which violates the US Constitution. The Constitution limits the scope of<br>the government and limits its power. When the government does something<br>that either violates the Constitution or does something for which it<br>does not have the authority, it is considered unconstitutional.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
