<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [As with everything, it depends.\<br>\<br>If you live in a \"just cause eviction\" city, a landlord must have<br>\"just cause\" to terminate your lease. Month to month leases<br>automatically renew at the end of the month. Raiaing rent to above<br>market value is illegal since it is an attempt to cause the tenant to<br>move (otherwise known as \"constructive eviction\"). Raising everyone\'s<br>rent may be enough of an excuse to avoid constructive eviction charges<br>if the landlord can show that the rent increase to above market value is<br>justified. Beyond this, a landlord would have to find another reason to<br>evict the tenant.\<br>\<br>If you do not live in a \"just cause eviction\" city, and you have a<br>month-to-month lease, a landlord would never do this. He would simply<br>tell you the agreement is up and give you 30 days to vacate. If you have<br>lived in the unit for over one year, he must give you 60<br>days.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
