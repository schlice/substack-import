<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you are in a condo or if you are in a neighborhood with a Homeowner's<br>Association (HOA), you may have recourse with them. Most Governing<br>Documents have rules about nuisances.<br><br>In most cases, HOAs do not address conflicts between neighbors, but in<br>this case, it does. Where the HOA can address nuisances, it does,<br>especially when nuisances are particularly bothersome and long-lasting.<br>For example, your neighbor practices with his band three nights a week,<br>and they...er...need more practice. Or your neighbor is cooking kidney<br>stew (IYKYK) every week. If your HOA has nuisance rules, it usually<br>applies to both nuisance noise, nuisance smells, and nuisance activity.<br><br>Clearly, you should try to address the issue directly with your neighbor<br>first. But if your neighbor is unwilling or unable to address the issue,<br>perhaps your HOA or your Condo Association can help. It's worth digging<br>into your Governing Documents to see if you have a rule addressing<br>nuisances.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
