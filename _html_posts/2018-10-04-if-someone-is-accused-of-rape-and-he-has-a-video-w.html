<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If someone is accused of rape, and he has a video where it shows that<br>after sex, there were cuddling and even kissing goodbye which like<br>nothing had happened, does that disprove the accusations in China and<br>the USA?**<br><br>Nothing *disproves* an allegation of rape short of the accuser saying<br>that it really didn't happen.<br><br>But the behavior you noted, which was purported to take place in the<br>immediate aftermath of the alleged rape, would definitely throw into<br>question the *credibility* of the accusation.<br><br>In other words, those behaviors are not the behaviors of someone who did<br>not *consent* to the contact taking place. And they are certainly not<br>the behaviors normally undertaken when one has just been raped. Kissing<br>and cuddling your rapist is not, on average, an accurate representation<br>of normal after-rape conduct.<br><br>Such video would certainly be used to raise what we in the United States<br>would call *reasonable doubt* as to whether or not the accusations are<br>credible.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
