<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Wow, a three-fer! Three questions in one!<br><br>Okay, let's dive into it.<br><br>> Is there an association with Money and Satan?<br><br>There is an association between money and evil.<br><br>> *For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through<br>> this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced<br>> themselves with many pangs. --- 1 Tim 6:10 ESV*<br><br>The implication here is that all wrongdoing can be traced back to an<br>excessive attachment to material wealth, and aggregating that wealth.<br><br>.<br><br>> **Why didn\'t Jesus use the money from the money bag Judas carried to<br>> pay temple tax instead of extracting from a fish?**<br><br>The story of the coin in the fish's mouth is an interesting teaching,<br>but it's more a teaching that was meant for Peter. And it's less about<br>the coin in the fish's mouth, and more about the interaction that leads<br>up to it.<br><br>The teaching begins when Peter and Jesus arrive at the temple and are<br>approached to remit the temple tax. The tax collectors came up to Peter<br>and asked him if Jesus pays the temple tax. Peter basically said "of<br>course He does," and then went to Jesus to ask about it. Jesus uses the<br>opportunity to teach a lesson. He asks Peter, "From whom do kings of the<br>earth take toll or tax? From their sons or from others?" Peter says<br>"from others." Jesus responds by saying, "So their sons are free."<br><br>This is a fascinating interaction. Jesus is comparing Himself and Peter<br>to earthly kings and their family. Jesus is comparing Himself to an<br>earthly king, and Peter would be compared to one of His sons. When a<br>king collects tax, he doesn't collect it from his own family, but from<br>others. The parallel is to Jesus' Kingdom. Jesus himself is the way to<br>God (John 14:6) and the true temple (John 2:21). And Jesus' "sons" (His<br>disciples) are "free" because they are part of His family.<br><br>But if they want to pay anyway so as to avoid offense, God has more than<br>enough resources to supply everything they need. Jesus tells Peter to go<br>cast a line into the ocean and take the first fish that comes out, and<br>in its mouth Peter will find a shekel, which Peter is to use to pay the<br>tax. In this way, Jesus is teaching Peter that they don't need to use<br>the money in the purse. God will provide everything they need.<br><br>> *And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in<br>> glory in Christ Jesus. \-- Phil 4:19 ESV*<br><br>.<br><br>> **Is it a coincidence that Judas who carried the money bag was the<br>> devil?**<br><br>It would be a coincidence if it were true. But Judas was not the devil.<br>Judas is Judas, and Satan is Satan. But we are well aware that Judas was<br>*heavily influenced by Satan*. Satan took Judas' heart. And we are also<br>well aware that this was by design. Jesus needed Judas to do what he<br>did so that Jesus could fulfill His purpose.<br><br>Secondly, Jesus *chose* Judas. It's unlikely that Jesus would choose the<br>devil to be His disciple.<br><br>Yes, Jesus called Judas "the devil." But that word, *diabolos,* also<br>means "slanderer" and it is used elsewhere in the Bible:<br><br>> *Their wives likewise must be dignified, not* *slanderers**, but<br>> sober-minded, faithful in all things. \-- 1 Tim 3:11 ESV*<br>><br>> *heartless, unappeasable,* *slanderous**, without self-control,<br>> brutal, not loving good, \-- 2 Tim 3:3 ESV*<br>><br>> *Older women likewise are to be reverent in behavior, not*<br>> *slanderers* *or slaves to much wine. They are to teach what is<br>> good, \-- Titus 2:3 ESV*<br><br>So it is just as correct to translate Jesus calling Judas a "slanderer"<br>rather than "the devil."<br><br>Jesus actually called Peter "Satan," but Jesus knew that Peter was not<br>actually Satan:<br><br>> *But he turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a<br>> hindrance to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of<br>> God, but on the things of man." \-- Matthew 16:23 ESV*<br><br>So no, it doesn't make sense to say that Judas was the devil.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
