<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, that's a cultural norm, not a Biblical command. The Bible says that<br>sex is to only take place between a married man and the wife to whom he<br>is married. The sex outside of marriage was already a sin, so we're<br>already well past following God's rules on this one.<br><br>A man marrying the woman he's knocked up is a man taking responsibility<br>for his actions, and committing to raise the child in a common household<br>with the child's mother. Despite the current society's elevation and<br>laudation of single motherhood, the statistics do not lie: children have<br>*the best possible chance for a good outcome in life* when they are<br>raised by their biological parents in a common<br>household.\[1\](#HarIJ){#cite-HarIJ<br>.citation_link}\[2\](#rqeYd){#cite-rqeYd .citation_link}<br><br>This well-known-but-not-frequently-discussed statistic morphed into a<br>societal norm, which is often expressed in polite company this way:<br><br>*Well, are you going to do the right thing and marry her?*<br><br>"Doing the right thing" means owning up to your mistakes (and the<br>implication here is that impregnating a girl outside of marriage is a<br>mistake, even without the religious context) and doing what's *best* for<br>the woman and the baby. The idea is that in the traditional context of<br>"being a man," fixing your own mistakes is at the top of the list.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-HarIJ){.citation_index} [[The U.S. Economy Needs More Two<br>Parent<br>Families](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a6fb2f&url=https://time.com/6317692/u-s-economy-two-parent-families/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="time.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-rqeYd){.citation_index} [[The impact of family structure<br>on the health of children: Effects of<br>divorce](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3eceff&url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4240051/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nih.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
