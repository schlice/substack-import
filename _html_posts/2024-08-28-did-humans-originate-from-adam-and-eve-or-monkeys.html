<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It depends on your worldview. And know that just for this answer, I am<br>not expressing my personal worldview.<br><br>Those of us with an atheistic worldview most generally believe that<br>we evolved from single-celled organisms from a "primordial soup" where<br>\*something\* happened and life spontaneously created itself. Then, over<br>millions and millions of years, those single-celled organisms started to<br>work together and create larger organisms and differentiate into the<br>estimated 100 million species on earth. It is those with the atheistic<br>worldview who believe that we evolved from monkeys or apes or whatever.<br>*From goo, to you, through the zoo.*<br><br>Those of us with a theistic worldview believe that God created the<br>world and intentionally created all of the plants and animals, and<br>eventually the human beings, the first two we call Adam and Eve. It is<br>this pair which seeded the world with humans.<br><br>Each side has their evidence for their belief, and each side thinks that<br>the evidence on the other side is lacking. *And they're both right.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
