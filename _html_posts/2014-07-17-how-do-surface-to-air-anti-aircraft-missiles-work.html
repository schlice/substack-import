<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [The missiles have active guidance systems on board that<br/>guide the missile to the target. While there are several different kinds<br/>of anti-aircraft missiles, the two most common are radar-guided and<br/>heat-seeking missiles. The one assumed to have shot down the<br/>Malaysian Airlines aircraft would presumably have been a radar-guided<br/>missile.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
