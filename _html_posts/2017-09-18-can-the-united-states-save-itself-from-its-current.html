<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I suppose you would have to believe that the United States is currently<br>undergoing some form of "political death" in order for it to "save<br>itself" from said death.<br><br>I see no evidence of this "death" you speak of. Our political system is<br>alive and (somewhat) healthy. Certainly, there are things that need to<br>be changed. We need Congressional term limits. We need a Balanced Budget<br>amendment. We need better border security. We need to allow DREAMers to<br>stay in country without allowing them all the rights and privileges of<br>citizens (i.e. voting), until they *become* citizens.<br><br>Sheesh, it almost seems like the vast majority of problems in this<br>country are Congress' fault, doesn't it?<br><br>#thingsthatmakeyougohmmm<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
