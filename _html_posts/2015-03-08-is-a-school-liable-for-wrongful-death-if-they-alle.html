<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [This is obviously a very hot issue these days, as bullying<br>has led to a number of suicide attempts as well as a few successful<br>ones.\<br>\<br>In common law, a person is not required to act when a crime is being<br>committed. Failure to act is not a crime. Notable exceptions are police<br>officers and doctors who are required to act by law.\<br>\<br>Criminally speaking, the school did not violate any criminal laws<br>because, as others have said, the school did not force the student to<br>commit suicide. The crime of assisted suicide is the one we are talking<br>about, and the school did not aid the student in his suicide by<br>providing materials and/or instructions.\<br>\<br>However, I think a civil case could be made if you could show a pattern<br>of willful ignorance and failure by the school to properly address<br>bullying. However, it certainly won\'t be an easy case. It\'s been 16<br>years since the Columbine High School shooting; the dialog about<br>bullying has been happening for some time now, so making such a case<br>would be an uphill battle at best. National bully prevention programs<br>have been implemented for many years, so I really doubt that a school<br>would not have such a program in place, and/or would be aware of<br>bullying and willfully fail to act (i.e. analyze the situation, know<br>that bullying is taking place, and then willfully choose to allow the<br>bullying to continue).\<br>\<br>So I think making a case for wrongful death against the school would be<br>a really tough case to make.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
