<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Nope. I mean he can try, which he may do for publicity, but it won't<br>win.<br><br>Calling someone a name is not against the law. It's protected speech<br>under the First Amendment. Defamation of character has a pretty high bar<br>to meet before it can really be seriously looked at. She would have to<br>have:<br><br>- Made a false statement. The statement must actually be false; truth is<br>  always a defense to defamation. She's got this one nailed; I doubt she<br>  has details of a crime when prosecutors for years have been unable to<br>  find them. And if she does know something and didn't tell anyone,<br>  she's going to be looked at pretty skeptically.<br>- Broadcast that statement. Clearly, if this question is being asked,<br>  she's done that.<br>- Acted with actual malice. Because Trump is a public figure, the<br>  standards for defamation are higher. It would have to be proved that<br>  she acted with *actual malice,* meaning that she knew the statement<br>  was false or that she acted with reckless disregard of the truth.<br>- Damaged his reputation. This false statement would have to be shown to<br>  have been harmful to Trump's reputation. But given<br>  Trump's...colorful...reputation, I doubt AOC could even move the<br>  needle on that front.<br><br>So while he *can* sue her, he won't, because he won't waste his time on<br>the likes of her, and even if he did, there's no way in The Hot Placeâ„¢<br>that he'd win.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
