<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In Colorado, are HOA\'s required to send a pre lien letter before<br>placing a lien?**<br><br>No.<br><br>In Colorado, HOAs are governed by the Colorado Common Interest Ownership<br>Act (CCIOA) which regulates how HOAs work and how they are administered<br>in the state, including the establishment of liens.<br><br>In Colorado, the recording of the HOA Declaration of Covenants,<br>Conditions, and Restrictions (often called CC&Rs or the declaration)<br>constitutes record notice and perfection of the lien. No further<br>recording of the claim of lien for assessments is required (Colo. Rev.<br>Stat. ยง 38-33.3-316(4)).<br><br>So not only do they not have to send a pre lien letter, but they don't<br>even have to record the claim of lien anywhere. In other words, as soon<br>as you are delinquent in your assessment payments, a lien *automatically<br>attaches*.<br><br>Even worse, it's a *super lien* (under Colo. Rev. Stat. ยง<br>38-33.3-316(2)(b)) which means it takes precedence over your mortgage<br>lien. This effectively means that even if you are current with your<br>mortgage payments, if you are delinquent with your assessment payments,<br>the HOA can still foreclose. It's automatically a super lien because of<br>the new rules for HOAs, passed in 2014.<br><br>In 2014, House Bill 13-1276 limited the ability of HOAs to *foreclose*<br>on that lien under certain circumstances. The Board must vote to<br>foreclose, and they must do so within six years of the full amount of<br>the assessments coming due. The Board may only initiate foreclosure on<br>the lien if the total amount equals at least six months of assessments<br>(which also means that the lien is automatically a super lien).<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.
