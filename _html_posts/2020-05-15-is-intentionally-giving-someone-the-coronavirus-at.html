<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is intentionally giving someone the Coronavirus attempted murder?<br><br>While cases are currently rare concerning COVID-19, we can use<br>intentional spread of existing viruses and infections in order to<br>determine what might happen to you if you know you are infected and you<br>intentionally put others at risk.<br><br>For example, here in Florida, if you have been diagnosed with an STI<br>(sexually transmitted infection) and you knowingly engage in sexual<br>relations with someone else without informing them of your infection,<br>you could be convicted of a crime (criminal transmission of an STI) if<br>that person becomes infected.<br><br>It's not a stretch to see that the same legal principles could be<br>applied to someone who knows they are COVID-19 positive and attempts to<br>spread (or succeeds in spreading) the infection with intent to infect<br>others.<br><br>In Texas, an 18 year old woman was arrested and charged with making a<br>terroristic threat when she claimed on Snapchat that she was COVID-19<br>positive and was spreading it on purpose. This just occurred the week of<br>April 6 of this year.<br><br>So, to the question, is it possible that intentionally spreading<br>COVID-19 could be considered attempted murder?<br><br>**If someone knowingly and purposefully infected someone else with the<br>knowledge and intention to cause death, then charges of attempted murder<br>are not outside the realm of possibility.**<br><br>In most cases under most state's laws, COVID-19 would likely fall into<br>the same category as STIs other than HIV, since it is not a lifelong<br>illness. Experts suspect that if criminal charges were to be imposed for<br>knowingly, purposefully or recklessly exposing people to coronavirus,<br>those charges would likely be categorized as a first-degree<br>misdemeanor.\[1\](#UOEwp){#cite-UOEwp .citation_link} Here in Florida,<br>conviction of a first-degree misdemeanor brings punishments of up to one<br>year in jail, and fines up to \$1,000.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-UOEwp){.citation_index} [[Coronavirus Crimes: COVID-19<br>spread intentionally could land you behind bars or in a lawsuit in<br>Florida](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=838639&url=https://www.criminal-defense-dui.lawyer/blog/intentional-covid-19-spread-can-put-you-in-jail-or-a-lawsuit.cfm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="criminal-defense-dui.lawyer"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
