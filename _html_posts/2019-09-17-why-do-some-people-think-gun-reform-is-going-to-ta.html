<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*"Hell yes, we're going to take away your AR-15s, your AK-47s." ---<br>Robert Francis "Beto" O'Rourke, Democratic Presidential Candidate*<br><br>Why do some people think gun reform is going to take away our right to<br>have guns?<br><br>Because they very plainly and emphatically said that's exactly what they<br>want to do. And were met with thunderous applause by the millions of<br>Democrats who believe similarly that if you ban honest citizens from<br>owning guns that criminals will somehow choose to change their behavior.<br><br>It has never worked at any time in human history, and there is exactly<br>zero evidence that it will work today. People who argue for the banning<br>of arms ask for automatic rule by the young, the strong, and the many,<br>and that\'s the exact opposite of a civilized society. A mugger, even an<br>armed one, can only make a successful living in a society where *the<br>state has granted him a force monopoly.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
