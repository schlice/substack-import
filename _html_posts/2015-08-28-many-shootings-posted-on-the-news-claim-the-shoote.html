<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There is a great deal of forensic evidence that is<br>processed even when a shooter takes his/her own life. For example, the<br>officer\'s gun is taken at the scene and is placed into evidence, along<br>with the shooter\'s gun. The officer would have to take the suspect\'s<br>gun, in the suspect\'s hand, and point the gun at the suspect and<br>discharge the gun, in order to attempt to fool the forensics.\<br>\<br>But as the other answerers said, this is very common. Most \"active<br>shooters\" go into their spree knowing that they are likely not coming<br>out alive on the other end. They\'re going down in a blaze of glory, and<br>they\'re taking a few of their closest enemies with<br>them.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
