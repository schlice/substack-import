<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The original prohibition on oral sex came from a misunderstanding of<br>Genesis 38, which persists in some Christian sects today.<br><br>So to understand what the Bible says and where the misunderstanding came<br>from, we need a little history lesson.<br><br>During the time of Jesus, the Jews had a religious practice called<br>yibbum (pronounced \jibum\, Hebrew: ייבום) As specified by<br>Deuteronomy 25:5--10, the brother of a man who died without children is<br>permitted and encouraged to marry the widow. At the time, a woman who<br>was not a virgin and not a mother was no longer "marriage material." She<br>would be destitute, unable to marry, unable to work. She'd either turn<br>to prostitution or die on the streets. Yibbum would give the widows life<br>purpose, and she wouldn't be a societal outcast, unable to marry and<br>unable to work.<br><br>So with this knowledge, let's look at the story. It's the story of<br>Judah, Er, Tamar and Onan in Genesis 38. Judah (the father) gets a bride<br>for his son Er, and her name is Tamah. Onan is Judah's second son. We<br>pick up the story there:<br><br>> Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. But<br>> Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the Lord's sight; so the Lord put<br>> him to death.<br>><br>> Then Judah said to Onan, "Sleep with your brother's wife and fulfill<br>> your duty to her as a brother-in-law to raise up offspring for your<br>> brother." But Onan knew that the child would not be his; so whenever<br>> he slept with his brother's wife, he spilled his semen on the ground<br>> to keep from providing offspring for his brother. What he did was<br>> wicked in the Lord's sight; so the Lord put him to death also.<br>> (Genesis 38:6--10 NIV)<br><br>So without understanding the historical context and the Jewish faith,<br>you could easily misunderstand what Onan did that God thought was<br>"wicked." The early Church thought that the pull-out game was the wicked<br>part, and they condemned it (interestingly, they called the practice<br>*onanism* in honor of Onan's supposed sin---onanism is a synonym for<br>masturbation). Thus, oral sex and masturbation, because they did not<br>allow the "seed" to go where it was supposed to go, were considered<br>sinful.<br><br>However, we have a different understanding, and that comes *after*<br>Jesus' ministry on earth. The New Testament gives us a better<br>understanding than the early Jews had for God's purpose for marriage and<br>sex. Though the Bible nowhere explicitly addresses masturbation, it does<br>outline the purpose of sex. According to 1 Corinthians 7:2--5:<br><br>> Each man should have sexual relations with his own wife, and each<br>> woman with her own husband. The husband should fulfill his marital<br>> duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. The wife does<br>> not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband. In<br>> the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body<br>> but yields it to his wife. Do not deprive each other except perhaps by<br>> mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to<br>> prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you<br>> because of your lack of self-control.<br><br>Implicit in this passage are these truths:<br><br>- God's plan for sex requires relationship, namely, that of a husband<br>  and wife (verse 2). Solo masturbation is sex disconnected from<br>  relationship.<br>- Foundational to God's plan for sex is giving one's body to another<br>  (verse 4). Solo masturbation is the keeping of one's body to oneself.<br>- The solution to a time of deprivation is to "come together" (verse 5).<br>  Solo masturbation is done alone, not together.<br><br>So right away, we see that solo masturbation is not in keeping with<br>God's plan for us, and the answers for married couples are all right<br>there. However, *couple's masturbation* and *oral sex*, when<br>it is done within the boundaries of a man/woman marriage, meets the<br>truths listed above (sex as part of a marital relationship, giving one's<br>body to another, coming together with sex). **So in the modern context,<br>couple's masturbation and oral sex is acceptable so long as it is<br>between a married couple, but solo masturbation is not.**<br><br>But there are so many who say that solo masturbation is good to equalize<br>the libidos of two sexual partners. It releases marital tension when one<br>spouse is more sexually active than another, and therefore builds a<br>healthier marriage. The biblical description of sex in marriage,<br>however, doesn't allow for that. It says that the woman yields her body<br>to her husband; it's her responsibility to take care of his needs, just<br>as it's his responsibility to address her needs. Remember, God's plan<br>for sex is that spouses give themselves to each other. Any sexual<br>activity apart from that goal is, therefore, sinful.<br><br>Singles say that it's a *physical need* that they must fulfill or they<br>can't sleep, their work suffers, etc. However, the Bible never presents<br>sexual fulfillment as a need. On the contrary, Paul says to the<br>unmarried, "It's better to stay unmarried" (verse 8). Paul continues in<br>verse 9, where he identifies the proper outlet for single people who<br>struggle with sexual desire: "If they cannot control themselves, they<br>should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion." Paul<br>suggests that self-control (one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit) is the<br>best answer. To singles who lack self-control, Paul does not say, "Let<br>them masturbate;" he says, "Let them marry." Again, marriage is the<br>God-given outlet for sexual tension, not solo masturbation.<br><br>While the Bible does not directly answer whether any form of onanism<br>(masturbation or oral sex) is sinful, there definitely are some biblical<br>principles to apply:<br><br>1.  "So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the<br>    glory of God" (1 Corinthians 10:31). If we cannot give God glory for<br>    something, we should not do it.<br>2.  "Everything that does not come from faith is sin" (Romans 14:23). If<br>    we are not fully convinced that an activity is honoring to God, it<br>    is a sin.<br>3.  "I will not be mastered by anything" (1 Corinthians 6:12).<br>    Christians have a responsibility to avoid anything that might<br>    enslave them.<br>4.  "I discipline my body and keep it under control" (1 Corinthians<br>    9:27). Self-denial is difficult, but self-discipline is worth it.<br>5.  "The fruit of the Spirit is \...\ self-control" (Galatians<br>    5:22--23). Masturbation is almost always a sign of a lack of<br>    self-control.<br>6.  Do "not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the flesh desires what<br>    is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the<br>    flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to<br>    do whatever you want" (Galatians 5:16--17). We are called to<br>    self-denial, not to self-gratification.<br><br>These truths should have an impact on what we do with our bodies. In<br>light of the above principles, it is doubtful that solo masturbation<br>can be a God-honoring activity. But while this new paradigm in the New<br>Testament tells us that solo masturbation  is definitely not in<br>keeping with God's plan for us in marriage, *couple's masturbation*<br>*and* *oral sex,* *within this context* would be acceptable. Notice<br>that the truths about sex in marriage say nothing about "where the seed<br>goes" or "it has to be penis-to-vagina (P2V) sex or nothing." It<br>emphasizes the marital relationship and doing things **together, as a<br>couple,** to keep the marital relationship strong and healthy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
