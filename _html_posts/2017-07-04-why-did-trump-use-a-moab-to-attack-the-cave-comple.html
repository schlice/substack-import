<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, I'm certain that Trump didn't make any choices regarding<br>ordnance. Trump and the National Command Authority makes *strategic*<br>decisions. It is the military commanders who make the *tactical*<br>decisions to accomplish the *strategic* goals.<br><br>Second, MOAB is capable of producing a concussive force which can<br>penetrate miles of cave systems, but it's not a great "ground<br>penetrator." MOP is a fantastic ground penetrator, able to get into some<br>of the most hardened locations, but its concussive force is limited<br>compared to the sheer force of the detonation of MOAB. Remember, MOAB<br>doesn't stand for "Mother Of All Bombs," really. It stands for "Massive<br>Ordnance Air Burst." This means it's detonating before it hits the<br>ground, allowing the concussive force to reach into the tunnels and<br>ultimately collapse them. MOP stands for "Massive Ordnance Penetrator"<br>which is appropriate for hardened targets.<br><br>In terms of the "proper tool for the job," MOAB was absolutely the right<br>tool for the job.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
