<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The article actually does a pretty good job of explaining why everyone<br>should agree with Professor Dershowitz' assessment of the situation:<br><br>> Let's recall that modern attempts to impeach Supreme Court justices<br>> have been directed against liberal members of the court: Chief Justice<br>> Earl Warren and Justice William O. Douglas. These efforts never went<br>> anywhere, because they were transparently political. So, too, would<br>> current efforts by the Democrats to manufacture a case for impeachment<br>> against a justice whom they oppose on ideological grounds. And if they<br>> were to succeed, it would establish a terrible precedent that could<br>> come back to haunt liberal justices and Democrats. Remember what<br>> happened when foolish Democrats employed the "nuclear option" to<br>> eliminate the super-majority rule for confirming judges.<br>><br>> I worked hard on behalf of Democratic candidates to assure that at<br>> least one house of Congress is under the control of the opposing<br>> party. A divided Congress is an important check-and-balance against<br>> one-party rule. But the Democrats risk weakening their power if they<br>> foolishly prioritize impeachment, investigations and revenge over<br>> legislative priorities that could help the American public. We need<br>> more bipartisan legislative efforts and fewer hyperpartisan show<br>> trials or investigations.<br>><br>> Impeachment is a constitutional remedy of last resort, deliberately<br>> made difficult by our Framers. Impeaching and removing a president is,<br>> of course, the most extreme step that Congress could take, but<br>> impeaching a justice, who has been confirmed by the Senate, comes<br>> close. It would be a flagrant abuse of power for the Democratic<br>> majority to act in so unconstitutional, unwise and shortsighted a<br>> manner. But in this age of hyperpartisan politics, nothing should<br>> surprise us.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
