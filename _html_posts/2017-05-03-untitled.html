<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Article I, Section 5, Paragraph 2 (emphasis mine):<br><br>"Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its<br>Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two<br>thirds, expel a Member."<br><br>The Senate Rules allow the Senate Majority Leader to set the calendar<br>and determine what bills will be brought before it. The Senate decided<br>this as a group, and since the Senate can set its own rules about how it<br>will operate, this is patently Constitutional.<br><br>If the Senate voted to vest the entirety of their power in the Senate<br>Majority Leader, including their actual votes (which would have to be a<br>unanimous vote, as is any Rule suspension or change), then the Senate<br>Majority Leader could then vote on behalf of the Senate, and that vote<br>would carry the full weight of the Senate. Yes, this would be<br>Constitutional, since it does not violate any text of the Constitution.<br><br>It would be stupid, and it would never happen, but if it did, it would<br>be legal and Constitutional.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-can-Gorsuch-revere-the-Constitution-as-he-claims-while-participating-in-an-unconstitutional-act/answer/Anthony-Zarrella<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
