<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do you believe walls can reduce illegal border crossings?<br><br>It doesn't really matter what I believe about walls and illegal border<br>crossings. What really matters is what the people on the ground, doing<br>the business of guarding the border, think.<br><br>And overwhelmingly, US Customs and Border Protection personnel believe<br>that a border barrier can reduce (not completely stop, but definitely<br>reduce) illegal border crossings.<br><br>Additionally, it will allow CBP to focus their spending and their<br>efforts in *other* areas, like people going over or under the barrier,<br>or processing entrants at the border checkpoint.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
