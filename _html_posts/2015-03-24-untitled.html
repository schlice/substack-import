<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [*The point is that current law allows states and local<br>municipalities to pass laws that restrict, qualify, and set the terms of<br>when, where and how people carry weapons without running afoul of the<br>2nd amendment. Whether or not they choose to do so is an issue with<br>those governments.*\<br>Those laws already exist! People follow them daily! And you call them<br>nutjobs and menaces! Your fight is not with me, it\'s with the people<br>who write your laws. Because as you\'ve said before, you believe the<br>laws are woefully inadequate.\<br>\<br>*The idea that people are walking around legally carrying weapons who<br>maybe go to the shooting range once or twice a month (if that) is<br>frankly ludicrous. Anyone who does that is as much of a menace as the<br>criminal element is.*\<br>Good that you\'ve spent summers at target ranges and stuff. I\'m in law<br>enforcement. I\'m a military sharpshooter. I completed the whole police<br>qualification course with my strong hand and my weak hand. As for time<br>at the range, our cops are required to shoot once a quarter. That\'s<br>it. And as far as local police departments across the country, that\'s a<br>lot. Many local departments are only required to shoot once a year.<br>They\'re encouraged to shoot more than that, but to be honest, it<br>doesn\'t take much more than once a month to keep your skills honed.<br>Twice a month is ludicrous? You clearly have no clue what you\'re<br>talking about. Twice a month is a lot. Our military doesn\'t even<br>shoot that much.\<br>\<br>And thankfully in America the Second Amendment prevents control freaks<br>like you from pressing your silly agendas on those of us who choose<br>exercise our rights. We do what\'s necessary to protect our families,<br>and we use our level heads to not let criminals get the drop on us.<br>It\'s the concealed-carriers who I trust more than anyone else.<br>Concealed carriers kill fewer people than the police. The open carriers<br>are the nutjobs; I keep an eye on them.\<br>\<br>I\'m glad that you feel confident enough in your surroundings that you<br>don\'t feel the need to carry a gun. Good for you. You have no right to<br>press your feelings onto those of us who not only feel the need to carry<br>a gun, but who exercise their rights and do so safely and legally.\<br>\<br>You do what you want, I\'ll do what I want, and ne\'er the twain shall<br>meet. And I promise I won\'t use my guns to save you; you can save<br>yourself. Good luck with that.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-not-treat-guns-like-cars-i-e-why-not-license-gun-owners-register-the-guns-and-require-gun-owners-to-carry-insurance/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
