<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes.<br><br>Police officers can lie about virtually anything. They can lie to you<br>when they are conversing with you. They can lie to you when they<br>question you. They can lie to you when they identify the reason they<br>stopped you. They can lie to other non-involved citizens.<br><br>There are virtually no restrictions on when an officer cannot lie to<br>you, with one exception.<br><br>When they are under oath, their statements must be truthful. This<br>could be while filling out official documentation, or when they are<br>testifying in court. When it comes time to explain an arrest to the<br>judge, or to give other testimony under oath, their statements must be<br>truthful.<br><br>Officers can be less than truthful for a variety of reasons. They can<br>use deception tactics in interrogations to gain information, so long as<br>it doesn't violate other laws, like laws against entrapment. They also<br>cannot fabricate evidence or coerce a confession through extreme<br>tactics, as there are separate laws about that which would render those<br>confessions invalid.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
