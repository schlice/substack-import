<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [September 11th is not a federal holiday; it is a national<br>day of mourning. As written by my colleague and friend [[Bill<br>Petro](https://www.quora.com/profile/Bill-Petro)]{.qlink_container} on<br>his<br>[website:(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3fcdbd&url=http://billpetro.com/history-of-patriot-day){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="billpetro.com"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>\<br>With the following words and many others, President George W. Bush<br>designated September 11 to be regarded as Patriot Day, or ***America<br>Remembers***:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> *By the President of the United States of America*\<br>> A Proclamation\<br>> On this first observance of Patriot Day, we remember and honor those<br>> who perished in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. We will<br>> not forget the events of that terrible morning nor will we forget how<br>> Americans responded in New York City, at the Pentagon, and in the<br>> skies over Pennsylvania --- with heroism and selflessness; with<br>> compassion and courage; and with prayer and hope. We will always<br>> remember our collective obligation to ensure that justice is done,<br>> that freedom prevails, and that the principles upon which our Nation<br>> was founded endure.\<br><br>\<br>The President inaugurated this observance on September 4, 2002 and<br>repeated it the next year, following a joint resolution approved<br>December 18, 2001 along with the US Congress, intending that it be<br>firmly planted into the consciousness of the American people, and each<br>year recalled to our memory "that more than 3,000 innocent people lost<br>their lives when a calm September morning was shattered by terrorists<br>driven by hatred and destruction" on September 11, 2001.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
