<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Here's a good one:<br><br>In Florida, if you buy a home which is part of a Homeowner's<br>Association, the buyer is responsible for ensuring that the home<br>meets all of the HOA's ongoing architectural approvals, and if it does<br>not, the buyer becomes responsible for anything unapproved by the<br>HOA when they take ownership.<br><br>I have always thought this was a patently ridiculous idea. The HOA is<br>under no obligation to tell a prospective buyer what is wrong with a<br>given property, and there isn't a mechanism for a buyer to get an<br>inspection of a home by the HOA before they buy it. But they become<br>liable for it once they buy it. The buyer, for his part, would have to<br>learn the entire Architectural Approval guidelines before they buy, and<br>that just seems unreasonable to me.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
