<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>HOAs in the United States are 501(c)(4) non profit corporations. This<br>means that none of the money they collect is disbursed as *profit* to<br>anyone or any entity. All of the money they bring in goes back into<br>things the HOA must pay for (like insurance, electricity, water, etc),<br>and in to capital improvement projects for common use.<br><br>If an HOA needs money for a community project, they can either increase<br>dues, or implement a special assessment (if their governing documents<br>allow them to do so).<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What are some unique ways HOA's can generate revenue?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
