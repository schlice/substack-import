<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The problem you will run into will be the interface between the user and<br>the 911 dispatcher. How will your system communicate to 911? Remember<br>that there are probably close to 6,000 different 911 dispatch centers<br>(called Public Safety Answering Points, or PSAPs) around the country, as<br>some states use regional call centers, so there isn't a dispatch center<br>for every department. Plus, the technology used by each PSAP is<br>different and evolving:<br><br>- Basic 911 is available everywhere, and it is simply an operator at the<br>  other end of the line.<br>- Enhanced 911 uses systems on the PSAP side to interpret information<br>  passed from the telephone service provider and correlate it with<br>  databases at the PSAP to display the location from where the call<br>  originated.<br>- Next Generation 911 is just beginning to roll out, and it will use<br>  IP-based communications to share voice, video and data between a<br>  caller and the PSAP<br><br>Until we get a single standard in place nationwide, your system will<br>have to work with the lowest common denominator, or at the very least be<br>able to adjust to the capabilities at the particular PSAP to which it<br>connects. It may only encounter a Basic 911 location, or it may<br>encounter a NG911 center. It should be able to handle both<br>contingencies.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
