You're<br>asking if any foods make it more likely or less likely to get the<br>disease, or for the disease to progress.<br><br>The short answer is no. **There is no diet that will either "cure" MS,<br>or will "make your actual disease advance more quickly or slowly."**<br><br>However, there is ample anecdotal evidence that *diet can help to make<br>symptoms less severe.* See the Wahls Protocol and the Swank MS Diet for<br>more information.
