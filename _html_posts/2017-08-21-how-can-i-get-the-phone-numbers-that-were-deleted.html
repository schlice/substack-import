<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you are the account holder, your mobile phone carrier has the log of<br>received/sent calls. If you have online account access, chances are you<br>can simply log in to your carrier's portal and find the call log. But<br>even if they don't display it on the screen, a quick call or chat with<br>Customer Service can usually net you the call logs you're looking for<br>sent to your email.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
