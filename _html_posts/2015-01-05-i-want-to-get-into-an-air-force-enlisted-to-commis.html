<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It\'s actually easier to transition between services as an<br>officer. As an officer, you can do what\'s called \"Inter-Service<br>Transfer.\"\<br>\<br>If you are enlisted now, you can transition to the Air Force by using<br>the Prior Service Program. Check out this information from<br>[airforce.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=69ba11&url=http://airforce.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="airforce.com"}]{.qlink_container}:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> If you are enlisted now, you must be completely separated from Active<br>> Duty service for a minimum of 90 days to qualify for the Air Force<br>> Prior Service Program.\<br>> \<br>> Prior Service is a direct duty assignment program, allowing a select<br>> number of separated individuals to return to active duty. You must<br>> hold an AFSC, MOS, or NEC which will qualify, or directly convert, to<br>> an Air Force Specialty. If not, the Air Force Prior Service program is<br>> not applicable to you.\<br>> \<br><br>> Your nearest Air Force Recruiter has a listing of jobs which we are<br>> currently looking for, based on years of service, and your successful<br>> qualifying.\<br>><br>> - Applicants must not have a break in service exceeding six years.<br>> - Applicants must have performed duties in the requested return AFSC<br>>   during their last term of enlistment.<br>> - Applicants must not require a waiver, Exception to Policy(ETP), or<br>>   eligibility determination to re-enter.<br><br>\<br>Please contact an Air Force recruiter for all of the details before you<br>separate from Active Duty.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
