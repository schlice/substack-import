<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why shouldn\'t tourists be armed in the United States providing they<br>pass certain criteria? It seems perfectly fair to defend ourselves.**<br><br>In order to be able to purchase a gun, you must go through a background<br>check. If we have no information on you (i.e. you're a tourist), we<br>cannot perform an effective background check.<br><br>I should think that in this time of mass shooters in the United States,<br>you would agree that we should only allow gun sales to those we can be<br>sure qualify to possess one.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
