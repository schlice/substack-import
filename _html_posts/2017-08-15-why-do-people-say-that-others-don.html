<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is somewhat of a misstatement of what actually happens in emergency<br>rooms.<br><br>The truth is that the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA)<br>is a federal law that requires anyone coming to an emergency department<br>to be stabilized and treated, regardless of their insurance status or<br>ability to pay. That doesn't mean they don't get a bill. It simply means<br>that their treatment in an emergency department is not contingent upon<br>their ability to pay. That said, you can't get blood from a turnip; if<br>they have no money to pay, no amount of billing will get them to pay.<br><br>This law is what's called an "unfunded mandate." If a patient cannot<br>pay, the question becomes: who pays for that service? No funding for<br>people who cannot pay was attached to this federal law. So it's a<br>"mandate" that requires the hospital to find the money to pay for those<br>who have no insurance or cannot pay on their own.<br><br>Hospitals either have to "eat" that cost, or they rely on private<br>donations to offset the cost, or they pass the cost on to other, paying<br>patients in the form of higher facility charges.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
