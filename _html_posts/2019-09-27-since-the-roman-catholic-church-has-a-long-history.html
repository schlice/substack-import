<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Since the Roman Catholic Church has a long history of lying and<br>deception, why should we believe the Bible is accurate?**<br><br>False equivalency. You have a statement (The RC Church has a long<br>history of lying and deception), and a question (Why should we believe<br>the Bible is accurate?). Those two statements do not belong together.<br>Just because the RC church has a long history of lying and deception (a<br>statement which I neither support nor explore) doesn't place the<br>veracity of the Bible into question.<br><br>The Bible is a collection of works spanning thousands of years; it's not<br>a single volume written by a single person or group of people. It's<br>certainly not a book that was written or even edited by the Roman<br>Catholic church.<br><br>About the question, I think you're asking the wrong question. Instead of<br>asking why we *should* believe the Bible, I'd instead ask why do you<br>*not* believe the Bible? Ultimately, the truth of the Bible is founded<br>on the truth of Jesus. Jesus, the one who rose from the dead and saved<br>all of us, is the one who authorized the Bible, quoted from it,<br>referenced it in his ministry on earth, and believed in it. Really, the<br>question has nothing to do with the Bible itself; it has everything to<br>do with the truth of Jesus. Instead of asking whether or not you believe<br>the Bible, ask whether or not you believe in the resurrection of Jesus.<br>If you don't believe that, then the veracity of the Bible is completely<br>irrelevant because it would be shown to be inaccurate on the most<br>important message it is trying to convey. The rest is just details.<br><br>The Roman Catholic church did not write the Bible, so the church's<br>alleged history of truthfulness does not change the truth of the Bible.<br><br>TL;DR: The truth of the Bible rests on the truth of Jesus.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
