<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In the US, can a company legally fire someone for being an alleged<br>rapist?**<br><br>Short answer: Yes.<br><br>Most employment is what is called "at-will" employment. This means that<br>you're not a contract employee. You work as long as both you and the<br>employer agree that your continued work is still needed and wanted. You<br>can be terminated at any time, and you can quit at any time.<br><br>There are only a handful of things for which you cannot be legally<br>terminated, and these are protected by law. They're the same things for<br>which you are protected during hiring - age, sex, race, religion, and<br>national origin. You also can't be terminated because of a disability,<br>unless you can't perform the essential functions of the job with<br>reasonable accommodations.<br><br>Anything else can legally be grounds for termination. I could see that<br>if you were accused of rape, your company may question your integrity.<br>Your company's customers may not want to deal with you, making you less<br>effective at work.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
