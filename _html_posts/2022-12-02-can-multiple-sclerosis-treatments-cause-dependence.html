<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you are referring to "dependence" along the same lines as "chemical<br>dependence," which has symptoms such as:<br><br>- Tolerance to or need for increased amounts of the drug to get an<br>  effect<br>- Withdrawal symptoms that happen if you decrease or stop using the drug<br>  that you find difficult to cut down or quit<br>- Spending a lot of time to get, use, and recover from the effects of<br>  using drugs<br>- Withdrawal from social and recreational activities<br>- Continued use of the drug even though you are aware of the physical,<br>  psychological, and family or social problems that are caused by your<br>  ongoing drug abuse<br><br>then the answer is no.<br><br>However, as other answerers have pointed out, we MS patients are<br>nonetheless *dependent* on our drugs to keep the progression of the<br>disease at bay. There is no cure for MS, and the best we can hope to do<br>is to slow it down. Basically, we'll keep taking the medications until,<br>as my doctor put it, we're "too old to care." I'd say that, in some<br>capacity, that qualifies as *dependence*.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional medical advice.
