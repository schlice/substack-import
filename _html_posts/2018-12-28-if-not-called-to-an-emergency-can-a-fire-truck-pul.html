<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If not called to an emergency, can a fire truck pull you over for<br>speeding?**<br><br>No. Fire trucks cannot stop vehicles.<br><br>The lights and siren *functionally* work the same way regardless of the<br>vehicle they are on: when you see them in your rear-view mirror, you are<br>to safely pull over to allow the emergency vehicle to pass.<br><br>But that's where the similarities end. If you pull over and a fire truck<br>pulls behind you, you're free to leave (in fact, it\'s encouraged; you<br>don\'t want to get in the firefighters' way). If a police car pulls<br>behind you, you've been pulled over and you need to wait until the<br>officer says you're free to leave.<br><br>The difference is that fire fighters are not authorized by the state to<br>enforce laws. They are authorized by the state to move cars out of their<br>way with noisy, blinky trucks so they can rush to a fire to put it out.<br>They are not authorized to enforce state traffic laws. That\'s someone<br>else\'s job.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
