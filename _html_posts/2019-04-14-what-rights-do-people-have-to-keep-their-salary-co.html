<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What rights do people have to keep their salary confidential or<br>private?**<br><br>What responsibility does anyone have to *disclose* their salary? As far<br>as I know, with some exceptions for government employees, employees of<br>private companies are under no obligation to disclose their salaries to<br>anyone.<br><br>So what right does a person have to keep his salary confidential? The<br>same right to not do something that is not required by law. Just as I<br>have a right to not cross the street if I don't want to, I have a right<br>to not disclose my salary if I don't want to.<br><br>It's true, sometimes when you apply for a new job, they want to know<br>your old salary. The truth: *they don't have to have it!* They don't<br>need your current salary to determine whether or not they are going to<br>hire you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
