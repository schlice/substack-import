Is it a sin? Something a Christian should do and<br>which God approves of? Is it wrong for a Christian to smoke? Looking to<br>make God happy**<br><br>There's a lot to unpack here. Let's take it a little bit at a time.<br><br>**Is smoking cigarettes like another master in your life such as serving<br>both God and money?**<br><br>It can be.<br><br>The problem with having two masters is that only one of them is worthy<br>of being master. So for example, if your smoking is interfering with<br>your ability to be a good Christian, a good spouse, a good parent, a<br>good friend, then it's certainly possible that smoking could be another<br>master in your life.<br><br>**Is it a sin? Something a Christian should do and which God approves<br>of?**<br><br>No, smoking is not sinful, in the traditional way we think of sins. It's<br>a habit, and like all habits, some are less dangerous than others. It's<br>a dangerous habit. Nicotine is not an intoxicant (and the Bible<br>definitely talks about drunkenness), but too much smoking can shorten<br>your life, and that damaging your body this way is selfish to others. It<br>can cause you to sin, such as if you lie to others about your smoking,<br>or quitting smoking.<br><br>Is it wrong for a Christian to smoke? Looking to make God happy<br><br>God is happy when you love him and you trust him. He's happy when you<br>give your life to him and you let him drive, so to speak. He's happy<br>when you bring your troubles to him, even though he already knows your<br>troubles and just wants to hear it from you.<br><br>So instead of talking to us about making him happy, talk to him. Tell<br>him that you want to do what's right and you want to please him with<br>your actions, and let him tell you what you should do, and then do that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
