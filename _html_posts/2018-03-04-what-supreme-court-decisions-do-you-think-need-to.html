<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Roe v Wade.<br><br>Before you rush to the comments, note that I'm not saying this because<br>of a personal distaste for killing children or a particular lack of<br>empathy for women.<br><br>I'm only saying this because this decision is bad law. Not its<br>outcome, but its method of implementation. This was a terribly sourced<br>decision.<br><br>I would have much rather seen a decision based on the 14th Amendment and<br>due process and equal protection, instead of creating a right to privacy<br>out of some cobbled-together "emanations and penumbras" to create a<br>right which doesn't actually exist.<br><br>And I would have much rather seen the Court actually place an age limit<br>on when a fetus becomes a person. Saying that a fetus is not a person at<br>39 weeks, 29 days, 23 hours and 59 seconds, but then once it moves two<br>feet out of the birth canal, it's a person? It's medically,<br>scientifically, philosophically, and morally unsustainable, but there it<br>is.<br><br>I would personally set that date at 20 weeks. But that's my opinion,<br>considering all of the medical, scientific, philosophical and moral<br>evidence I can piece together about how developed a fetus is at 20<br>weeks. I'd say no abortions after 20 weeks except in cases of incest or<br>to save the life of the mother. Yes, that means if you were raped and<br>you choose to carry the baby for 20 weeks, you can carry the baby for<br>another 20 weeks and then give it up for adoption. Violations of that<br>law are visited on the doctor/hospital, not the mother. No doctor in his<br>right mind would risk his medical practice by knowingly aborting a fetus<br>older than 20 weeks. Does this mean that some women would turn to<br>back-alley abortions? Yep. Does that risk the woman's life? Yep. Does<br>she make that decision willingly? Yep, and if she's not, if she's being<br>coerced into a back-alley abortion, that's a violation of a different<br>law and should be handled accordingly.<br><br>(EDIT, 25 Jun 2022) This aged well.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
