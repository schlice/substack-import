<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The problem is that the HOA is the one *imposing* the onerous<br>restrictions and fees.<br><br>The only way to prevent this is to get involved. Run for a Board<br>seat. If you don't want to be a Director on the Board, just stay in<br>contact with the Board and give them the "pulse" of the neighborhood.<br>Let them know what people think about proposed rule changes and/or fees.<br>Back it up with data if you have it.<br><br>The rub, of course, is that most people love to complain about their HOA<br>and their Board, and no one wants to do anything about it.<br><br>Every time I was on a Board, my Board email was connected with my phone.<br>I'd respond same-day to any homeowner who had questions or comments,<br>because I was committed to the neighborhood and the homeowners. I wanted<br>to do what was right by them, so they could always reach me.<br><br>I know it's not like that everywhere, but in general, HOAs do try to do<br>right by the neighborhood, as they are homeowners as well.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
