<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can private schools in the US teach whatever they want?<br><br>The short answer is yes.<br><br>The longer answer is that all schools in a state are *accredited* by<br>that state. Accreditation involves auditing the school's curriculum and<br>ensuring that the appropriate courses are indeed taught in accordance<br>with state law. Students must also be taught in such a way that they<br>score on par with public schools on standardized testing.<br><br>Beyond that, private schools can, indeed, teach whatever they want.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
