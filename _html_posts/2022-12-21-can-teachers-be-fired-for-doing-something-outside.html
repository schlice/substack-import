<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes. Not only teachers, but anyone can be fired for doing something<br>perfectly legal *but that reflects poorly on your employer.*<br><br>For example, if you're a military member, it's perfectly legal for you<br>to attend a political rally. But if you do it in uniform, you'll be<br>"fired."<br><br>If you're a teacher and you go to a strip club (perfectly legal), and<br>your picture at the strip club gets posted to social media, and your<br>students and their parents see it, the mere presence of that photo could<br>reflect poorly on you as a teacher, and the school might think twice<br>about retaining you as a teacher.<br><br>This can happen to anyone. Including me. I work for Dell Technologies<br>(#IWork4Dell). I'm perfectly legally permitted to post here on Quora.<br>But could one of my customers see something that I post that might not<br>fall in line with the values the company seeks to display to the world?<br>Of course. I have to be on guard for that all the time, and it's not<br>enough that my profile says that any posts I make which are work-related<br>will have the hashtag above as part of it. Even if I make it clear that<br>the post is my own personal opinion, a customer could be offended by<br>what I say, and if they bring it to the attention of Dell leadership, I<br>could face consequences for my writings. That's why anyone who wishes to<br>post on social media attends a "Social Media and Community" (SMaC)<br>Certification course and registers their certification with Dell. It is<br>then that we can post on social media using the #IWork4Dell hashtag.<br>It's not that there is never a possibility that I could be misunderstood<br>and that my posts could be offensive to someone. It's that I do my<br>utmost to protect Dell's brand when I post about the company. And<br>anything I do post with the hashtag must comply with Dell's social media<br>policy, or I could face consequences, up to and including termination.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
