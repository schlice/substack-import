<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>More related to the prison system in the United States, the system is<br>supposed to be rehabilitative, not punitive. Clearly, opinions differ on<br>that point. If we were really going for punishment, why don\'t we have<br>torture chambers in prison? Why do inmates get medical treatment and hot<br>food and television and workout facilities? If prison is punitive, why<br>don\'t guards routinely beat prisoners?<br><br>In the eyes of the public, prison is retribution. In the eyes of the<br>criminal justice system, prison is rehabilitation.<br><br>(EDIT) Since the answer was merged, I\'ll try to answer the bigger<br>question, \"should prisoners be punished?\" Let\'s be clear: prison is<br>punishment, and not just because of the environment that is a prison.<br>Prison in a free country is punishment because your freedoms are taken<br>away. Your Constitutional rights are limited. This constitutes a<br>punishment in every sense of the word. It is not \"corporal\" punishment<br>(literally, \"punishment of the body\"), but it is punishment<br>nonetheless.<br><br>Our system of government and our system of economy in the United States<br>is a system of \"incentive.\" Good behavior is \"rewarded\" and bad<br>behavior is \"punished.\" Capitalism is a system of \"incentive:\" if<br>your business operates more efficiently than your competitor, you make<br>more money than your competitor. You are therefore incentivized to<br>operate more efficiently, thus building efficiency into the system of<br>economy. Similarly in law, in a Constitutional government, a nation of<br>laws is one based on incentive. Good behavior allows you to enjoy all of<br>the freedoms offered to you. Bad behavior limits those freedoms by<br>placing you in jail or restricting your movements for a period of time.<br>This is a punishment in as much as the lack of punishment is incentive<br>to continue to follow the law. Simply by \"being in prison,\" a person<br>is punished.<br><br>Sometimes, people conflate \"justice\" with \"retribution.\" For<br>example, you will see a court decision in which an accused was<br>acquitted, and the family of the victim says that \"there was no<br>justice.\" This is not true, there was indeed justice. Justice was<br>served, the bad guy went to prison, and the good guy walked. That<br>outcome was *just*, and so justice was indeed served. So what exactly is<br>the family looking for? They\'re certainly not looking for \"justice.\"<br>What they are really looking for is \"retribution.\" They wan their<br>\"pound of flesh.\" They want someone to *suffer* in the same way that<br>they are suffering. This is not justice. This is retaliation, it is<br>retribution, it is reprisal. So clearly then, if someone goes to jail,<br>the family believes they are *suffering.* Therefore, you can conclude<br>that in the eyes of the public, prison is punishment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
