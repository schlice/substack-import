<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think you misunderstand the basis for when you can fire a weapon.<br><br>The level of scrutiny is \"fear for one\'s life.\" If you fear for your<br>life, you can use deadly force.<br><br>The police officer has a different level of scrutiny. The police officer<br>is not only charged with protecting his own life, but he is also charged<br>with protecting the lives of the general public. So while a civilian is<br>only authorized to defend himself, an officer has to make a judgment<br>call, in a split second, as to whether or not this person might continue<br>on and harm others. If the answer to that question *might* be yes, the<br>officer has a duty to stop that person. The law allows officers to<br>stop that person using whatever means are necessary.<br><br>If you don\'t believe that officers should have the authority to stop<br>criminals using whatever means necessary, you should lobby your<br>legislators to change the law in your state and remove that authority<br>from the police.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Would-cop-shoot-a-child-who-is-holding-a-toy-gun-even-if-he-is-certain-that-it-is-a-toy-Is-it-a-matter-of-policy/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
