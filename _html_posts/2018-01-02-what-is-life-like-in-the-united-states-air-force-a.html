<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Originally answered: **How is life as a student at the United States Air<br>Force Academy?**<br><br>Academically, which is what you asked, it is tough.<br><br>15 credit hours would be a heavy load at a civilian college. At the Air<br>Force Academy, that is the *bare minimum* you can carry in a semester. A<br>20--24 credit hour load is average, and there is really no such thing as<br>"study hall" at the Academy. Until you are a late-term senior and have<br>completed most of the classes for your academic major will you ever<br>potentially have free blocks in your schedule. I didn't ever see a free<br>block until second semester senior year.<br><br>You get homework in every one of your classes. In fact, you get more<br>homework than you can conceivably do in a night (or two nights, on a<br>block schedule). Therefore, you have to learn how to *prioritize* what<br>work is important, and what work you can blow off. Actually, this is a<br>very useful life skill to learn, and practicing it while you are earning<br>your degree isn't a bad way to go.<br><br>You also have to be able to shift gears quickly, between academics,<br>athletics, and military studies. In most cases, time is blocked out for<br>each activity, but on many days, military studies will often be<br>interspersed in the academic day (for you grads, I'm referring to M5).<br>Therefore, your study skills must be up to snuff; you must be able to<br>study efficiently, and use the limited time you have effectively.<br><br>Each weeknight from 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM is Academic Call to Quarters<br>(ACQ or "ack call") and is reserved for homework and study time. Three<br>hours a night are all that are "reserved" for study time, but if you<br>have other free time, obviously you can use it for study. Be aware,<br>though, that throughout most of your career, you won't have other free<br>time besides ACQ. If your study skills are not up to snuff, study skills<br>training is available.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
