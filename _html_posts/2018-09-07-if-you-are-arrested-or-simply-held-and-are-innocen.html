<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you are arrested or simply held and are innocent, should you still<br>refuse to speak to anyone without an attorney?**<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Let's shorten your answer:<br><br>**If you are arrested, you should refuse to speak to anyone without an<br>attorney.**<br><br>That's what they get for arresting you.<br><br>- The process is not designed to "let you go" after you are arrested. It<br>  is designed to "send you to jail" for the crime they are accusing you<br>  of.<br>- You are not equipped to navigate this process on your own. No<br>  disrespect to your level of life knowledge, but this process is<br>  *highly* slanted against you.<br>- The police are not your friends. They are doing a job. That job is<br>  sending you to jail in the most expeditious way possible.<br><br>And by the way, they can't "simply hold you" for more than 72 hours<br>without charging you with a crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
