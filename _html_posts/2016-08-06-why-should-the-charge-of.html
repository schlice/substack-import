<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The 4th Amendment does not protect you against "arbitrary" arrest, which<br>is not a legal term. All arrests are, in one way or another, arbitrary.<br>It's the officer's word against the suspect, who always claim they did<br>nothing wrong. The 4th Amendment specifically says "\t\he right of the<br>people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,<br>against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and<br>no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or<br>affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and<br>the persons or things to be seized.\" This means that you are protected<br>against unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. It<br>says nothing at all about being charged with a crime or arrested.<br><br>The police can arrest you for a violation of any law. The District<br>Attorney is left with the task of proving what you did in court.<br>Generally, the police provide enough evidence that you did what you were<br>arrested for doing. That's how the system works: the police arrest you,<br>the police provide the evidence to the DA, and the DA takes you to<br>court. The DA and the police wouldn't get very far if they arrested<br>people who didn't do what they were accused of doing.<br><br>White was arrested for refusing to follow orders, refusing to provide<br>identification, and resisting arrest. The officer in question was<br>investigated by the department (as is every use of force) and was found<br>to have committed "no wrongdoing." The department reviewed the video,<br>and found that the officer did not use excessive force or violate the<br>law. Chief Vera Bumpers said, "He explained what was going on, what the<br>violation was and that he was focused on her safety, as well as his."<br><br>If White feels that her rights were violated, she is free to file a<br>lawsuit against the department. Her case got the attention of the local<br>NAACP chapter, so maybe they can hire an attorney for her.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
