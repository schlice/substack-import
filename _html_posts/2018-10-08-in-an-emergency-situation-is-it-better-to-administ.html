<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In an emergency situation, is it better to administer first aid or<br>avoid it at all costs in case of being sued?**<br><br>While my first instinct is to tell you to always assist because "Good<br>Samaritan laws," the reality is that there is no Federal Good Samaritan<br>Law. These laws are all state laws, and they vary by state. You should<br>be thinking about what you might do should you find yourself in this<br>situation, and you should think about that now. Research your state's<br>laws and how they might apply to you.<br><br>The bottom line is that *as long as you act reasonably when you help,<br>you should not be liable in a state which has Good Samaritan laws.*<br>Reasonableness is determined partly by what you do for a living. If you<br>are a medical professional, your standard of reasonableness is different<br>than someone who is not involved in medicine. If you're not involved in<br>medicine, it may be reasonable to simply call 911 and to ensure that no<br>one is hurt *further*. If you *are* in medicine, you should also know<br>that Good Samaritan laws are not applicable while you're at work.<br><br>It's also important to note that even if a Good Samaritan law exists,<br>this does not mean you cannot be sued. If you act recklessly or<br>unreasonably, you can still be sued for damages, even if your state has<br>Good Samaritan laws in place. Finally, Good Samaritan laws don't apply<br>to your *employer*. If you act, or fail to act, you may not be able to<br>be sued or be criminally liable, but your employer can take action if<br>your response doesn't match their expectations. For example, if you are<br>told to always call the employer's security team for medical care, and<br>you fail to do that, you can still face disciplinary action from your<br>employer for violating their rules, even if the victim can't sue you in<br>that state.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
