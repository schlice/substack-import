<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [However, even auto-drive cars will have to have a viable<br>driver behind the wheel. Whether or not the computer is driving, the<br>driver must be coherent enough to operate the vehicle and take over from<br>the computer when its driving becomes unsafe. You still can\'t do that<br>if you are under the influence.\<br>\<br>It will definitely take more creative policing to determine if someone<br>is DUI. The point here is that even if the computer is driving, the<br>person sitting behind the wheel is still the operator of the vehicle,<br>not the computer.\<br>\<br>I agree that it will become harder to determine whether someone is DUI<br>if the computer is driving.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-will-cops-get-their-drug-arrests-once-cars-are-automated/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
