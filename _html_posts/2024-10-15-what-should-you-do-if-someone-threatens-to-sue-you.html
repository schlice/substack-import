<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **What should you do if someone threatens to sue you over something<br>> that didn\'t even happen?**<br><br>I suggest you ignore it. But if you've never looked into civil defense<br>attorneys in your local area, you might just acquaint yourself with who<br>they are and where you can find their numbers so you can be prepared in<br>case you are sued. But don't fret about it until you actually *are*<br>sued.<br><br>> **Is this legal? Shouldn't they have proof before threatening me with<br>> a lawsuit?**<br><br>Sure it's legal to threaten to sue someone. It's protected by the First<br>Amendment.<br><br>Should they have proof before they threaten you with a lawsuit? For<br>their sakes, they probably should, because if they go to hire an<br>attorney and they have no proof, boy are they going to look silly when<br>that attorney tells them to go kick rocks.<br><br>But no, they don't need proof to threaten to sue you, because they can<br>*say* whatever they want. It only makes a difference when they *do*<br>something.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
