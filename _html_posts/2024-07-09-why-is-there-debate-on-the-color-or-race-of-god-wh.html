<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>That's a great question, since God has no physical form.<br><br>You may be talking about Jesus, who took on flesh. Yes, Jesus is God,<br>but God is not just Jesus. God is God the Father, and God the Son, and<br>God the Spirit. But God the Father is not God the Son, and God the Son<br>is not God the Spirit, and God the Spirit is not God the Father.<br><br>Ah, the confusion of the Trinity...<br><br>Anyway, let's just assume we're talking specifically about God the Son,<br>aka Jesus.<br><br>Jesus would have most likely looked like a Middle Eastern man.<br><br>Jesus likely had dark brown to black hair, brown eyes, and olive-brown<br>skin, similar to most people in Judea and Egypt at the time. He may have<br>been around 5\'5\" (166 cm), which was the average height for men at the<br>time. Jesus would have had a Middle Eastern appearance and likely<br>appeared tough, coarse, and somewhat dirty, wearing simple clothing. The<br>Bible also describes Jesus as having curly hair that was woolly in<br>texture.<br><br>While I'm hesitant to "put Jesus in a box" by providing a picture, this<br>picture summarizes what Jesus *may have* looked like:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-3038bf4469a0aa2917746343e1823bb3){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-3038bf4469a0aa2917746343e1823bb3" master_w="353"<br>master_h="347"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
