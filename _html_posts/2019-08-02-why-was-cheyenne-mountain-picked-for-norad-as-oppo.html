<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why was Cheyenne mountain picked for NORAD as opposed to any other<br>place nearby or different location?**<br><br>This is an excellent question, thanks for asking.<br><br>Cheyenne Mountain was picked for several reasons, but the most central<br>were the following:<br><br>1.  Colorado Springs is home to several major military installations<br>    (Peterson AFB, Fort Carson) and can provide logistical support to<br>    the Mountain fairly easily<br>2.  Cheyenne Mountain is *geologically stable*. The facility is built<br>    into a mountain made of *solid granite*. It is not on any fault<br>    lines, and it is in an area of stable geological activity.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
