<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In most jurisdictions, the notice that a claim has been filed also<br>includes directions about not destroying any evidence, even if that<br>evidence has not been requested through discovery yet. From the moment<br>the claim has been made, and you have been notified about it, the<br>evidence is protected.<br><br>If you destroyed the evidence before you were notified of a claim, you<br>might be protected, but only if you had no knowledge that a claim was<br>forthcoming. If you knew that a claim was being processed, and you<br>destroyed evidence with that knowledge, and the opposing party is able<br>to prove that you knew the claim was being processed, the destruction of<br>evidence can cause you to lose your case.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
