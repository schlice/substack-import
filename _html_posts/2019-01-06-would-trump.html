<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would Trump's declaration of a national emergency to allow him to<br>build his wall without Congressional approval be a step towards<br>totalitarianism?**<br><br>It is a step towards totalitarianism, but it's a step like me standing<br>in New York City and taking one step west is a step towards California.<br><br>We still have a *long, long, long way to go before we become a<br>totalitarian country.*<br><br>Trump's actions would be less "totalitarian" and more "exercising a<br>loophole."<br><br>Title 10 of the USC allows the military to fund border barriers in<br>certain circumstances, such as during war or national emergency. The<br>money does not need to be approved by Congress because it is<br>"un-allocated" funds. Funds which are allocated must be re-approved by<br>Congress to be used somewhere else, so those funds aren't going<br>anywhere. But "un-allocated" funds can be used by the DoD without<br>additional Congressional approval, according to the law.<br><br>So while it may be a "totalitarian"-style move insofar as he is doing it<br>"unilaterally," it's currently completely within the bounds of the law.<br>It's a loophole: acting completely within the scope of the current law<br>to achieve a goal which was never envisioned by the writers of that law.<br><br>Now, when Trump throws out the Constitution, makes the GOP the only<br>political party, makes being anything other than Republican illegal and<br>forces all citizens to swear fealty to him, then we've become a<br>totalitarian nation.<br><br>But this? Not so much.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
