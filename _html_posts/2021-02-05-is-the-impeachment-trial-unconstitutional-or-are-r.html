<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is the impeachment trial unconstitutional or are Republicans<br>misleading the American public on the issue? It seems that the only<br>party that can declare something unconstitutional is the Supreme Court -<br>not me, you, a Congressman or the entire Senate.**<br><br>The Constitution is very clear. The purpose of impeachment is removal<br>from office. Only secondarily is its purpose to vote to not allow<br>someone to ever hold political office ever again. The Article of<br>Impeachment, the one that the Senate will be trying, calls for removal<br>from office as the prime remedy. Except that Trump has already been<br>removed from office. The primary objective, therefore, of the<br>impeachment article, as written by the House, has already been met.<br><br>There is a concept in law called *mootness* wherein when you have<br>already achieved your goal, your case is dismissed.<br><br>Second, impeachments are designed for the President, the Vice President,<br>and other Federal office holders. Trump, however, is not a Federal<br>office holder. He is a *former* Federal office holder. He is a civilian.<br>The Constitution has a very specific provision against Congress passing<br>*Bills of Attainder* which are Congressional bills which apply<br>punishments to specific civilians without the protections of a judicial<br>trial. It's the equivalent of the Legislative branch assuming powers of<br>the Judicial branch, and this is patently unconstitutional. This trial<br>would, in fact, apply a punishment to a specific civilian, without the<br>protection of a judicial trial. This makes this proceeding the<br>processing of a Bill of Attainder, not an impeachment trial, as the<br>person "on trial" does not qualify for a trial in the Senate.<br><br>It is for those specific reasons that the trial is unconstitutional.<br>Republicans can say that it is unconstitutional, but it would only be<br>after the Senate actually imposed a punishment that Trump could bring<br>the case to Federal court and argue that the Senate trial was, in fact,<br>unconstitutional, and then the courts could decide.<br><br>Regardless of the constitutionality of the action, the Senate has, by<br>the narrowest of margins, voted itself the power to conduct the trial.<br><br>But rest assured, the vote to convict will fall along similar party<br>lines. There's no way you'll get the 2/3 majority you need to convict,<br>or to ban the President from ever holding office again.<br><br>So Trump will have been twice impeached and twice acquitted, and he will<br>declare himself "totally innocent" and he will have this kabuki theater<br>of a Senate trial to hold up as proof. In other words, they're giving<br>the President more credibility than he had before, and all because they<br>are hell-bent on hurting the President as much as they can, because they<br>hate him so much.<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance<br>for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough<br>shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion<br>masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your<br>own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.<br>If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"<br>don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything<br>vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a<br>block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
