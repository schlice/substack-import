<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There\'s a long history that goes behind marriage<br>licenses. It has a lot to do with old marriage laws, along with the idea<br>that it was governments responsibility to take care of the children that<br>are produced by sex between men and women.\<br>\<br>In the United States, it used to be law that sex outside of marriage was<br>illegal. Laws against adultery has been removed from US law, but that<br>didn\'t change the fact that states felt as if it was their obligation<br>to take care of the children that resulted from sex between men and<br>women. Thus, marriage licenses were issued to ensure that genealogy was<br>upheld legally, and parental support for children was codified.\<br>\<br>In today\'s society, there is a de-emphasis on the tie between marriage<br>and children, the common view clearly indicating that such a tie is<br>outdated and unnecessary.\<br>\<br>Also, since religion is not regulated, any religion can marry any people<br>they choose. In order to maintain some order over who reaps the legal<br>benefits of marriage (such as they are), the state issues licenses to<br>ensure that all of the legal requirements for marriage are met. This is<br>the current use of the marriage license.\<br>\<br>When all governmental benefits of marriage are removed from federal and<br>state law, there will be no legal benefit to marriage, and licensing<br>will not be required any longer. But if there are any federal or state<br>benefits at all to marriage, licensing to ensure that state requirements<br>are met will still be required.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
