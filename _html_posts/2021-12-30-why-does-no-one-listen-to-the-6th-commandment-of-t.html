It appears in various<br>translations in various positions.<br><br>And people don't listen to them due to the same reasoning that everyone<br>uses when they sin: people choose man's way over God's way. Man's way is<br>more fun. Having no accountability for your actions is definitely more<br>interesting than being told you can't do something.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
