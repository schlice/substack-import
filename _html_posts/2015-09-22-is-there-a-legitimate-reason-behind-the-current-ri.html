<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content:<br>[[User-9730205778524425201(https://www.quora.com/profile/User-9730205778524425201)]{.qlink_container}<br>really nailed it. You\'re seeing more reports now because there are more<br>people with cameras recording things now.\<br>\<br>So let\'s look at the actual climate, and the ability for bad cops to be<br>able to \"get away with it\" (for lack of a better term). Do you think<br>that in this climate of \"cameras everywhere, even on the cop himself\"<br>that cops are more likely or less likely to engage in patently<br>illegal behavior, or behavior in violation of department policy?\<br>\<br>In today\'s society, it is far more difficult for a cop to do something<br>illegal and \"get away with it.\" So in actuality, cops are less<br>likely to engage in that type of behavior than just 10 years ago.\<br>\<br>But you see it more.\<br>\<br>The only logical explanation is that not only are there more cameras<br>around, but the attitude of the public, in general, towards law<br>enforcement has changed to an even more adversarial relationship than it<br>used to be. In other words, it\'s now even more of an \"us vs them\"<br>attitude than it was just 10 years ago. You can thank everyone from the<br>President on down for creating this current environment.\<br>\<br>Nevertheless, throughout all of it, law enforcement still has to do its<br>job, and still has to enforce the law. A thankless job has become twice<br>as thankless.\<br>\<br>One of the first things my training sergeant said was, \"If you want to<br>be loved, be a firefighter.\" Yep, he was right about that<br>one.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
