<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I can\'t tell you how many times we have answered this question here.<br>But maybe if I answer it, you\'ll get it. I doubt it, but here goes.<br><br>You can\'t make guns illegal, they\'re protected by the Constitution.<br><br>But let\'s say, somehow, you got the Second Amendment repealed. How do<br>you know who has guns? There\'s no national registry, because that\'s<br>illegal too (not coincidentally, because of this eventuality). You have<br>over 300 million guns in circulation in the United States. Are you going<br>to go door to door into every one of 150 million households in the<br>United States and break down the doors and ransack the houses until you<br>find the guns and rip them away? That violates a few amendments also,<br>namely the 4th and 5th amendments. Were you planning on repealing those<br>as well?<br><br>Because if we\'ve gotten to a place in this country where we have<br>repealed the second, fourth, and fifth amendments, we\'ve pretty much<br>lost the Constitution. At that point, there\'s nothing preventing the<br>government from usurping any of your rights, any time they feel like it.<br>The country, as it was, would be lost.<br><br>I also thought that your middle sentence was interesting, the one where<br>you said you didn\'t want to be hit by a Trump supporter's bullet. So it<br>would be okay for you to be hit by a Biden supporter's bullet? Or an<br>Independent's bullet? I wasn\'t sure that the bullets actually cared<br>what your political affiliation was. But whatever. Maybe you seem to be<br>of the opinion that only Trump supporters are mass shooters. Maybe you<br>forgot about the Bernie supporter who shot up the Congressional baseball<br>game and nearly killed Steve Scalise.<br><br>[[2017 Congressional baseball<br>shooting](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=190dfe&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Congressional_baseball_shooting){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
