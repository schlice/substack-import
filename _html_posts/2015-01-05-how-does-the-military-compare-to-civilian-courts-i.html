<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The problem here, of course, is that you are comparing<br>apples to oranges.\<br>\<br>Civilian courts are adjudicating using the US legal system which follows<br>Federal, State, or local laws. Military courts are adjudicating cases<br>based on the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the UCMJ. UCMJ is far<br>stricter than civilian law in most cases, as the military is expected to<br>be held to a higher standard.\<br>\<br>In fact, punishment in the military is much harsher than civilian law.<br>You can receive confinement (prison, which still includes hard labor;<br>i.e. turning big rocks into little rocks with sledgehammers),<br>garnishment of salary, and dishonorable discharge. For crimes like<br>treason, the UCMJ still offers execution as a punishment.\<br>\<br>Also, this is the only area of law in the US where \"double-jeopardy\"<br>doesn\'t apply. Double-jeopardy is the principle that states that if<br>you\'ve already been tried and convicted for a crime, you can\'t be<br>re-tried and re-convicted for the same crime (there was actually a<br>really good movie titled \"Double Jeopardy\" which explored this legal<br>principle). In situations where you have violated both a civilian law<br>and a military law, the military can try you, convict you, and sentence<br>you, and then at the completion of your sentence, you can be released to<br>civilian authorities to be tried again, for the same crime.\<br>\<br>In most cases, where civilian law and military law coincide, civilian<br>prosecutors defer to the military to try the case first. It\'s actually<br>pretty rare that a crime would be first tried by the military and then<br>tried by civilians, but it does happen. What doesn\'t usually happen is<br>for civilian courts to try and convict someone and then have the<br>military do the same. The military would consider the civilian court<br>decision an administrative matter and proceed with military discipline<br>(i.e. counseling, confinement, garnishment, or<br>discharge).]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
