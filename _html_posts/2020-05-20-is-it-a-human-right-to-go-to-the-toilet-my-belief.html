<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it a human right to be able to go to the toilet?<br><br>It's a bodily function, not a right. You're going to go whether or not<br>someone tells you to go. Indeed, while you may be able to not go for<br>some time, eventually you will have to go or you will suffer harm.<br><br>You might instead be asking whether or not it is a human right to go to<br>the toilet in a physical toilet. And if it is a human right to use a<br>physical toilet, then anyone can use any toilet, anywhere, without<br>restriction.<br><br>Clearly, that's not the case.<br><br>So even if using the toilet is a right, the government can still limit<br>the time, place, and manner of your exercising that right<br>without denying you the right.<br><br>In the United States, you have the right to free speech. But the<br>government can limit the time, place, and manner of your speech<br>in order to advance public safety.<br><br>So there's nothing that says you must be allowed to go in any toilet, at<br>any time you like, even if you do have a right to go to the toilet.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
