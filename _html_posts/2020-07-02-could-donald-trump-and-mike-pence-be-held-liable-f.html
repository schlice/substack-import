What would need to be shown to secure a<br>civil judgment against them?**<br><br>A2A<br><br>Not likely.<br><br>You can sue the United States in Federal court for most torts committed<br>by persons who act on behalf of the United States. The Federal Tort<br>Claims Act is the \"exclusive means by which a party may sue the United<br>States for money damages \\...\ in tort\" (28 USC ยง 2679.<br>Exclusiveness of remedy). Also, an FTCA action \"can be brought only in<br>a United States District Court\" (28 USC ยง 1346(b)) and it states that<br>the action must be brought \"within two years after the claim accrues,\"<br>or \"within six months after \\...\ notice of final denial of the<br>claim by the agency\" (28 USC ยง 2401(b)).<br><br>However, the FTCA limits liability for intentional torts, as well as<br>claims based upon the performance, or failure to perform, a<br>\"discretionary function or duty.\"<br><br>So it's unlikely that any person would be able to claim monetary damages<br>due to Trump and Pence "encouraging the spread of a virus."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
