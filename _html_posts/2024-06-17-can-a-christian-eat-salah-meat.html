<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So as I understand it, "Sallah meat" is not a particular cut or<br>preparation of meat, but it is meat which is prepared as part of the<br>"Sallah" celebration. Muslims around the world traditionally slaughter a<br>ram or another animal on Eid al-Adha, in memory of the prophet<br>Ibrahim\'s willingness to sacrifice his own son when Allah ordered him<br>to do so. As I understand it, Muslims will sometimes offer some of this<br>"Sallah meat" to their neighbors.<br><br>So while the Bible doesn't specifically refer to "Sallah meat," it does<br>discuss something else that happened in Corinth during Paul's apostolic<br>term: Christians eating meat which was once sacrificed to idols.<br><br>These new Christians in Corinth clearly did not believe in the idols, so<br>they found no problem going to the temples (which were common gathering<br>places, which also sold the meat previously sacrificed for people to<br>eat) and eating the meat.<br><br>Paul talks about this in his first letter to the nascent Corinthian<br>church (1 Corinthians 8):<br><br>> Now concerning food offered to idols: we know that "all of us possess<br>> knowledge." This "knowledge" puffs up, but love builds up. If anyone<br>> imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to<br>> know. But if anyone loves God, he is known by God.<br>><br>> Therefore, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that "an<br>> idol has no real existence," and that "there is no God but one." For<br>> although there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth---as indeed<br>> there are many "gods" and many "lords"--- yet for us there is one God,<br>> the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one<br>> Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we<br>> exist.<br>><br>> However, not all possess this knowledge. But some, through former<br>> association with idols, eat food as really offered to an idol, and<br>> their conscience, being weak, is defiled. Food will not commend us to<br>> God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do.<br>> But take care that this right of yours does not somehow become a<br>> stumbling block to the weak. For if anyone sees you who have knowledge<br>> eating in an idol\'s temple, will he not be encouraged, if his<br>> conscience is weak, to eat food offered to idols? And so by your<br>> knowledge this weak person is destroyed, the brother for whom Christ<br>> died. Thus, sinning against your brothers and wounding their<br>> conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ. Therefore, if food<br>> makes my brother stumble, I will never eat meat, lest I make my<br>> brother stumble.<br><br>So Paul says a few things notable here:<br><br>1.  "Food will not condemn us to God. We are no worse off if we do not<br>    eat, and no better off if we do." So Paul is saying there is nothing<br>    specifically wrong with the food itself, and the food itself will<br>    not "defile us" in some way. This is wholly Biblical and is<br>    discussed in many places throughout the Bible. Food does not make<br>    you "unclean."<br>2.  But there is an issue with Christians in the (former) idol temple<br>    eating meat sacrificed to idols. *You can cause non-Christians to<br>    lose any hope of Christian faith.* In other words, if those<br>    non-Christians see you, a Christian, eating Sallah meat, they may be<br>    "weakened" by seeing you "sin against your brothers and wounding<br>    their conscience."<br><br>So while you may be confident that the food will not defile you, if your<br>eating of the food causes the Muslim to believe more strongly in their<br>faith, then you, as a Christian, are not helping them come to Christ;<br>you are strengthening their resolve in what you would believe would be a<br>false teaching. And that would be the sin in eating Sallah meat. To you,<br>it's just meat. To them, they have successfully had you participate in a<br>celebration of Allah, *which pushes them further away from Christ and<br>true salvation.*<br><br>And knowingly participating in something which pushes others away from<br>Christ is sinful.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
