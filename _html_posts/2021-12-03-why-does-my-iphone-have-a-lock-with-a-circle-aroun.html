<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>While I'm not exactly sure which icon you are referring to, most likely<br>what you are seeing is the "Orientation Lock" icon. Your iPhone is<br>locked in Portrait mode, so even if you turn your iPhone sideways while<br>you watch a YouTube video, the screen will not rotate. This is useful if<br>you often lay down on your side while you look at your phone, and you<br>don't want it to rotate to where it will be sideways from how you are<br>looking at it.<br><br>To release the lock (assuming you are running iOS 12 or higher), from<br>the home screen, drag down from the top right corner. You'll see your<br>Control Panel (note that if you are running an older version of iOS, you<br>may need to drag up from the bottom right corner).<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-d8c8b891bdff3ee55d1e688251b1db03){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-d8c8b891bdff3ee55d1e688251b1db03" master_w="132"<br>master_h="263"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>If you see the same lock with circle highlighted (as it is in the<br>example), then your Rotation Lock is enabled. Click that icon to toggle<br>it off, and when you turn your phone sideways in compatible apps, the<br>screen will rotate to a Landscape orientation (long-ways) instead of<br>Portrait orientation (normal tall orientation).<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why does my iPhone have a lock with a circle around it?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
