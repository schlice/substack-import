<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Just look at this. Now Trump supporters have completely turned on<br>Lindsey Graham and threw profanities at him in while he was in the<br>airport , calling him a "traitor." How did Trump manage to create such a<br>dangerous, loyal cult following around him?**<br><br>Trump is not entirely to blame for this.<br><br>He is, primarily, to blame for not shutting it down. He is to blame for<br>promulgating the "stolen election" trope. He is to blame for stoking the<br>fire that people were already feeling.<br><br>But let's look at how we got here.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-0a5418a822dd9e31bbc92f3aea9bdc51){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-0a5418a822dd9e31bbc92f3aea9bdc51" master_w="960"<br>master_h="527"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Does no one remember this? The city of Kenosha is literally burning<br>behind him, but this is a "mostly peaceful protest."<br><br>I can't help but look at this image and see:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-0e4fce994a2561585d54f537f1c5998b){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-0e4fce994a2561585d54f537f1c5998b"<br>master_w="1024" master_h="485"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>The media in this country, promulgated and supported by progressives,<br>did this. And what has it done? It taught Trump loyalists that *violence<br>is an acceptable way to vent your outrage.* It taught Trump loyalists<br>that *your outrage justifies your behavior.*<br><br>***So why does it surprise anyone that this is how the fringe on either<br>side of the aisle behaves?***<br><br>The reason that it surprises people is that historically, *Republicans<br>do not do this.* Even Republicans were somewhat taken aback by the<br>behavior of Trump loyalists. Because Republicans, by and large, do not<br>react emotionally. They react logically. They react cautiously. They<br>preach taking time to fully analyze before making changes, and if the<br>change is at all going to be disruptive, they don't prefer to make it.<br>So this violence was even a little surprising to them.<br><br>While Trump deserves much of the blame for not quelling this sooner (and<br>not backing off of the "stolen election" rhetoric sooner), the<br>conditions which led to this were not Trump's fault.<br><br>The blame for creating the conditions which led to this lie squarely<br>with the media in this country, and the progressives who enable them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
