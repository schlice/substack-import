<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As a parent, you can look ahead to an eventual possibility of needing<br>guardianship for your children and you can *designate* a guardian, and<br>that's normally accomplished through your will. As long as the person<br>you designate in your will is available, capable, and willing, the court<br>will grant your request.<br><br>If a guardian must be chosen because *you have died without a will,* or<br>if a guardian must be chosen because *a child is being removed from the<br>home*, the guardian is chosen by the courts. The courts always hold as<br>sacrosanct and most important the welfare of the child, and the best<br>interest of the child. Tangentially, the court tries to place the child<br>with the closest relative on the family tree, and who has the most<br>runway to raise the child (financial means, time to devote to the child,<br>etc). The problem with allowing the court to choose a guardian is that<br>clearly, you as a parent don't have any input into that decision at that<br>point, and the court may choose someone who has the means to raise your<br>child, but maybe won't necessarily raise the child *as you would have*.<br>This is why you really want to have a will to account for your wishes<br>when it comes to your minor children.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Who has the legal right to choose a guardian for a grandchild?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
