The Commerce Clause does not force anyone to do business with<br>any other state.<br><br>The President does not enforce the Commerce Clause.<br><br>The President has no authority over governors.<br><br>The Commerce Clause simply says that Congress has the power to regulate<br>commerce between the states.<br><br>I know that many Supreme Court rulings over the years sorta blurred the<br>lines on the Commerce Clause, even going so far as to give Congress the<br>authority to force people to engage in commerce or face fines (see the<br>Affordable Care Act).<br><br>But even so, none of this gives any powers to the President to either<br>regulate interstate commerce, or force anyone (business or otherwise) to<br>engage in commerce.<br><br>The only exception to this is the Defense Production Act, which allows<br>the president to "require businesses to accept and prioritize contracts<br>for materials deemed necessary for national defense, regardless of a<br>loss incurred on business (it is unclear what would occur if business<br>refuses or is unable to complete request on<br>time)."\[1\](#hPbli){#cite-hPbli .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-hPbli){.citation_index} [[Defense Production Act of 1950 -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=126df4&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Production_Act_of_1950){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
