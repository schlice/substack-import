<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **Is it illegal to record your spouse in the bedroom without their<br>> knowledge?**<br><br>Yes, it is illegal. Nearly everywhere. I say "nearly" because there's<br>probably somewhere that has a "bedroom spousal exception" that I'm not<br>aware of.<br><br>**In general, you cannot place any surveillance cameras in any area in<br>which there is a clear expectation of privacy.** This includes<br>bathrooms, bedrooms, locker rooms, changing rooms, etc. **You can, with<br>some jurisdictional tweaks, place cameras in common areas** like living<br>rooms, hallways, entryways, etc.<br><br>Doesn't matter who you are recording. Doesn't matter why you are<br>recording. If you want your video footage to be used for a legal reason<br>(i.e. as evidence in a court proceeding), you cannot record areas where<br>there is an expectation of privacy.<br><br>However, if you were trying to catch your spouse in an affair and you<br>installed a "nanny cam" in your bedroom, feel free to use that video to<br>"encourage" your cheating spouse into confessing, mostly because you<br>have them on video, in all their glory. Note that the video would not be<br>able to be used in criminal or civil proceedings, but it certainly works<br>to get the spouse to confess.<br><br>Also, you can record someone with their full knowledge and consent.<br>So if you want to record your spouse fixing the drain in the bathroom<br>for a YouTube instructional video, that's a permitted recording.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
