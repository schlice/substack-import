<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it illegal for someone to use a text app pretending to be you,<br>screenshooting the conversation and sending to others as "proof" that<br>you're a bad person?**<br><br>No, that is not a crime for which someone could go to jail. At worst, it<br>would be a "parody" account, in which one person pretends to be a parody<br>of someone else. Depending on the platform, parody accounts may not be<br>allowed, and it might violate the terms of service on the platform,<br>causing the perpetrator to get booted from that service.<br><br>What you *might* be able to sue for (not have someone arrested for) is<br>libel. If you can show that the "proof that you're a bad person"<br>resulted in direct harm (i.e. you lost your job over the untrue<br>statements), then you can sue for libel. You can then tack on pain and<br>suffering, and possibly punitive damages.<br><br>Now, if the person was sending messages over SMS, this may be a bigger<br>deal. There are Federal laws which protect SMS conversations, so if<br>someone was able to send messages as you, there may be some charges<br>which could be pressed. But just taking screenshots of text on a screen<br>"pretending" to be someone else, while pretty cruel, is not a crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
