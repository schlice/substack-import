<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The legality or illegality of police actions in any case<br>is not a matter of \"letter of the law\" with a bright-line definition.<br>This is a point of fact to be determined by a jury. It is up to the<br>police to determine if the suspect is threatening, or if the suspect is<br>a danger to himself or others.\<br>\<br>If the suspect refuses to drop his weapon, he is already a threat<br>because he is refusing to follow orders. Police likely already have him<br>at gunpoint, so the situation is tense. Any false moves by someone<br>brandishing a weapon could result in that person being shot by police.<br>The officer simply needs to believe tha the suspect is raising the<br>weapon towards them, and they will fire. This would be, generally,<br>legal. But again, this is a point of fact to be determined by a jury, if<br>an investigation was warranted and charges were filed. In this case,<br>it\'s highly unlikely that charges would be filed, as the non-compliant<br>suspect was wielding a firearm and pointed it at a cop. That\'s the best<br>way to get yourself dead. Don\'t listen to the cops, and then point a<br>gun at them.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
