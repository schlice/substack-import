<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The chances are not very good.\<br>\<br>You can buy badges from any number of places. ID cards, however, are<br>much harder to fake. Unless you\'ve seen the agency\'s ID cards before,<br>you\'re not likely to be able to tell a fake from a real ID card.\<br>\<br>You can always call 911 and ask the dispatcher to assist you with<br>identifying the officer. It should only take a few minutes, and these<br>days a plainclothes officer or detective should allow you that luxury.<br>There is no set policy, usually, around doing this, but I would expect a<br>plainclothes officer would understand if someone is<br>wary.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
