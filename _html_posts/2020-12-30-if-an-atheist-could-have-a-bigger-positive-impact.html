<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If an atheist can have a bigger positive impact on the world than a<br>Christian, doesn\'t that disprove God?**<br><br>Well let's try to follow that logic and we'll see where the gaps are.<br><br>1.  An atheist has a bigger positive impact on the world than a<br>    Christian.<br>2.  ???<br>3.  Therefore, God does not exist.<br><br>So let's see if we can address some of these issues.<br><br>For statement 1 (an atheist has a bigger positive impact on the world<br>than a Christian), which atheist? Which Christian? There are lots of<br>atheists, and there are lots of Christians. Is it a specific atheist who<br>has this bigger positive impact on the world than a specific Christian?<br><br>And how do you quantify "bigger positive impact on the world?" By whose<br>standard? How do you measure who has a bigger positive impact?<br><br>Once you determine how you're going to quantify "bigger positive impact<br>on the world," to have some meaningful logical statement in statement 2,<br>you must show the Christian doctrine (presumably from the Christian<br>Bible) which states that in order to prove that God exists, all<br>Christians must have the biggest positive impact on the world, bigger<br>than anyone else in existence.<br><br>In fact, Christianity says *exactly the opposite*. It says that the<br>world will reject Christians. The world will hate them. And looking at<br>modern culture and history, that has most definitely been true.<br><br>From the Bible, the words of Jesus:<br><br>> "If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you<br>> belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do<br>> not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That<br>> is why the world hates you. Remember what I told you: 'A servant is<br>> not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will<br>> persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours<br>> also. They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not<br>> know the one who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they<br>> would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.<br>> Whoever hates me hates my Father as well. If I had not done among them<br>> the works no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. As it is,<br>> they have seen, and yet they have hated both me and my Father. But<br>> this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: 'They hated me<br>> without reason.'" John 15:18--25 NIV<br><br>The world rejected Jesus (they crucified him), so the world similarly<br>rejects and hates Christians as well.<br><br>So it's entirely possible that a Christian won't have a bigger impact on<br>the world than an atheist.<br><br>And none of that disproves God's existence.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
