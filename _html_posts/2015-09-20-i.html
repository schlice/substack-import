<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Thanks for the A2A, I\'ll limit my answer to the US Air<br>Force.\<br>\<br>If you want to enlist in the Air Force, you have to be between ages 17<br>and 39, be a U.S. citizen or a permanent, legal resident, have a high<br>school diploma, or have a GED with at least 15 college credits. You will<br>have to take an aptitude test, and you will also have to take a physical<br>test as well as undergo a full health exam. So if you want to join the<br>US Air Force, this is where you start.\<br>\<br>If you can become a US citizen before age 34, you can take your degree<br>and use it towards Officer Training School. OTS requires you be between<br>the ages of 18 and 34 and already possess at least a Bachelor\'s<br>Degree.\<br>\<br>[[United States Air<br>Force](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4ec95e&url=http://www.airforce.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="airforce.com"}]{.qlink_container}]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
