<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What should somebody with multiple sclerosis avoid doing?<br><br>In general, you should avoid doing anything which might aggravate your<br>symptoms. The reason why we talk about "in general" is that everyone's<br>symptoms are unique, and the triggers that everyone experiences with MS<br>are also different. Even when you have the same triggers as someone<br>else, you may experience them to a different degree than someone else.<br><br>However, some symptoms are more common than others, and are more<br>affected by common interactions. The classic example is **going in a hot<br>tub**.<br><br>In fact, before we had modern diagnostic instrumentation, doctors used<br>to put patients in hot tubs. If their symptoms got worse, and then upon<br>cooling off after getting out of the hot tub, their symptoms improved,<br>they had a good idea that what the patient was experiencing was MS.<br><br>However, even that is variable among people; not everyone is equally<br>affected by hot tubs.<br><br>Also, a majority of people with MS experience *fatigue*, also known as<br>"MS lassitude." It's one of the most common symptoms of MS. But even<br>then, I know my limit as to how much heat I can endure and how much<br>physical activity I can undertake before I will get too tired to<br>continue. That particular limit is different for everyone.<br><br>To that end, it's difficult to directly answer your question, because<br>that thing, or that number of things, that "people with MS" should avoid<br>doing is going to be different for everyone. There isn't one thing that<br>everyone with MS should avoid doing. It's a very individual thing. You<br>just have to live your life, experience your symptoms, and learn your<br>limits. Once you have found your limits, you figure out how to work<br>around them. For me, during the hot season, it's getting things done<br>early in the morning, as my energy level tends to taper off in the<br>evenings faster than everyone else. So if I have a relatively<br>high-energy project or activity planned, I try to get it done in the<br>morning or by early afternoon. If I go much more than that, I know I'm<br>going to start to lose steam.<br><br>Hope this helps. Let me know if you still have questions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
