<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Will Colorado Springs become larger than Denver? Why?<br><br>El Paso County (where Colorado Springs is located, along with a few<br>other small cities like Monument and Falcon) will take over the lead in<br>population over Denver county (which contains the city of Denver and a<br>few outlying cities) by 2020. The two counties are expected to trade the<br>lead until 2035, when El Paso County is expected to take the lead<br>permanently, and become the largest county in the state by population.<br>By 2050, El Paso County\'s population is projected to be 1,076,000,<br>where Denver county is expected to reach 952,000 people.<br><br>*Why* this is happening is a question which is still mostly undecided.<br>The changes in the near term are easily explainable: an increase in<br>migration (more people moved in than moved out) and natural increases<br>(more people were born than died).<br><br>But why El Paso County is growing faster than Denver county in the<br>longer term is less easy to pinpoint. We know that spillover from the<br>Denver area is a factor. People are buying property in Monument and<br>Falcon and commuting to work up I-25 and Colorado Highway 83 because of<br>favorable taxes and lower prices relative to the rest of the Front<br>Range. Also, the area attracts a lot of veterans (with a new VA clinic<br>consolidating several other smaller clinics in Colorado Springs),<br>retirees (with three military facilities available for their use,<br>including healthcare), and young families. Even non-military retirees<br>are finding conditions favorable in Colorado Springs, with UCHealth<br>taking over two of the hospitals in the city and bringing them into the<br>fold of the largest hospital group in the state, significantly improving<br>(from what I've seen and heard) care at those facilities and making it<br>easier to get care. And purely anecdotally (no one would dare publish<br>such a study), it it any wonder that Denver's status as a sanctuary city<br>and odd policy choices like decriminalizing mushrooms is driving more<br>citizens and non-drug users away? Not to me.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
