<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [What I was getting at is that there are no protections in<br>the law to allow for the rest of us to determine whether or not someone<br>is actually disabled, or whether or not a service dog is actually a<br>trained service dog.\<br>\<br>I am a disabled person, I don\'t need a service dog, and I still think<br>that we should have some sort of documentation process that proves that<br>a service dog is a trained service dog. I personally think we should<br>also have some sort of documentation process that shows that a person<br>has a disability that is recognized by ADA. I think it would make it<br>much easier for businesses to offer reasonable accommodations if people<br>had the ability to prove they had a disability that required a specific<br>accommodation.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Does-it-upset-you-to-see-someone-with-no-visible-disabilities-take-a-service-dog-into-a-store-or-other-public-building/answer/Chris-Lynam-2<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
