<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: no, pork projects should not be considered corruption.<br><br>Longer answer: The projects which get attached to other bills as<br>\"riders\" are valid projects. They provide meaningful funding to local<br>projects, albeit in the Congressman\'s district. But this is what<br>Congressmen are supposed to do: take care of their constituents. If that<br>means getting funding for projects that they need to have accomplished,<br>so be it.<br><br>The problem, as I see it, is that these projects are attached as<br>\"riders\" to other bills. Thus, when the main bill is approved, the<br>Congressman\'s pet spending bill is approved as well. Sometimes, many<br>pet projects get attached to bills coming out of Congress, especially<br>when there is little chance of the bill failing. If a Congressman would<br>never want to be seen voting \"no\" on an important piece of<br>legislation, riders can be safely attached, knowing that no one would<br>dare vote against the main legislation. Attaching riders to bills is<br>what causes \"pork barrel\" spending.<br><br>One way that the government attempted to fix this issue was by granting<br>the President the [[**line-item<br>veto**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fe8fd9&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-item_veto){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} power. This could allow<br>the President to sign the bill but veto the riders. The Line Item Veto<br>Act of 1996 was ruled unconstitutional in 1998 when the Supreme Court<br>heard *Clinton v City of New York*. They found that the line-item veto<br>violates the Presentment Clause of the Constitution because the<br>President can use the line-item veto to selectively approve or veto<br>*parts* of bills, not a bill as a whole as required by the Constitution.<br><br>We still have not found a way to legislatively limit riders on bills, as<br>sometimes they are important parliamentary methods by which spending<br>bills get approved. Nevertheless, a President can veto a bill and return<br>it to Congress with comments like \"Vetoed because of excessive<br>riders\". The problem exists when the public looks at the President\'s<br>veto record and tries to understand why the President would veto a bill<br>just because he didn\'t like the riders, especially when the bill itself<br>is very important.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
