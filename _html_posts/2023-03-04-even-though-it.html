<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Of course! It's a wonderfully creative story. I bet it could easily be<br>turned into a book or even a made-for-TV movie.<br><br>But the fact that it exists doesn't make it plausible, or even Biblical<br>reality.<br><br>Revelation is very clear about how the end times are going to look, as<br>revealed to the apostle John. There will be wars, famine, disease, and<br>great world suffering for 3.5 years. Then, the antichrist will be<br>revealed, but he won't come as a demon or a monster. He'll come as a<br>beautiful savior, almost indistinguishable from Christ, but instead of<br>saving the world, he will *enslave* the world. He will require that if<br>you want to participate at all in his new world order, you'll have to<br>take a mark, either on your forehead or on your hand, that will allow<br>you to participate in society, and will denote your absolute fealty to<br>him.<br><br>It will be a visible mark, so even if it's a biochip, it will still be<br>visible. Everyone will know, just by looking at you, whether or not you<br>took the mark. And anyone who does not take the mark will be unable to<br>participate in society. No stores, no movies, no malls, no doctors,<br>nothing.<br><br>And eventually, those without the mark will be rounded up and killed,<br>because any ills which befall the marked will be blamed on the unmarked<br><br>This is the time of the Great Tribulation, the time when the unmarked<br>are tortured and killed.<br><br>And at some point during the Great Tribulation, Christ will return. He<br>will resurrect the believers and take them up to heaven. And then, God<br>brings the pain. The Day of the Lord will come. And he won't flood the<br>whole earth with water, but with fire. He will destroy everyone and<br>everything that remains on the earth. He will finally put Satan and his<br>minions into the lake of fire to be tormented for all of eternity. Then<br>He will destroy sin, restore the world, and lift up Israel (the 144,000<br>who bear the Mark of the Lord) and they will reign for 1,000 years.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
