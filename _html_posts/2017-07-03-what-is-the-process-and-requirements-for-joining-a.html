<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Thanks for your question.<br><br>In order to attend one of the service academies, there are a few things<br>you have to do.<br><br>Admission and Acceptance. Like any university, you have to be<br>admitted. That means you have to meet the university's admissions<br>requirements. Of course, because this is a military academy and not a<br>purely academic university, the standards for admission go above and<br>beyond pure academics.<br><br>The general quantitative selection criteria (with an emphasis on USAFA)<br>includes the following:<br><br>- Academics. About 50% of your overall selection score in determining<br>  whether or not you can be accepted is based on your academic<br>  performance. Generally, applicants need to rank in the top 40% of<br>  their class to be eligible, but reviews of recent admissions to the<br>  academy found that most candidates rank in the top 3% of their<br>  respective classes. Your academic score consists of your SAT or ACT<br>  score combined with your Prior Academic Record (PAR).<br>- Athletics. A little over 95% of candidates who were accepted into the<br>  Air Force Academy played on some team sport in high school. About 80%<br>  of those earned a varsity letter in that sport. As you can tell from<br>  those numbers, athletics are very important. You will take a Candidate<br>  Fitness Test to determine your ability to complete the training.<br>- Extracurricular Activities. The academies are always looking to see<br>  your activities, both athletic and non-athletic, that you do outside<br>  the classroom. This includes activities in your school, in your<br>  community, and if you work, in your job.<br><br>Your packet also meets a Selection Panel, which will do a *qualitative*<br>review. This review addresses all of the "intangible" things which may<br>be present in a candidate's record.<br><br>Your combined score from the Weighted Composite (academic and<br>extracurricular scores) and the Selection Panel score forms your<br>Selection Composite, a single score which will allow you to be ranked<br>against all of the other candidates competing for admissions into the<br>Academy.<br><br>Nomination. What makes the Service Academies unique in admission<br>requirements is that, in order to be accepted, you must be nominated.<br>Nominations are granted by Congress, or by the Vice President.<br><br>Each Member of Congress (and the Vice President) can have up to five<br>cadets in any service academy at any one time. Those spots free up as a<br>cadet graduates or leaves the academy. Each nominator can nominate up to<br>ten candidates to fill any one open slot that they have. Each nominating<br>authority has its own process for seeking a nomination, but it generally<br>mirrors the Academy process, requiring a combination of academics,<br>athletics, and community service. Some nominating source selection<br>processes involve interviews, or board records reviews.<br><br>The President also has nominations, but these are reserved for children<br>of career military personnel. The President has 100 appointments per<br>year that can be made.<br><br>Children of deceased or 100% disabled military veterans also receive<br>automatic nominations, but they are limited to 65 cadets in the academy<br>at any one time.<br><br>There are a few other categories of military nominations which can also<br>be made.<br><br>By far, the largest number of nominations comes from Congress.<br><br>Admissions Process: As you can see, the process to be nominated and<br>accepted into a service academy is not easy. It takes perseverance and<br>commitment throughout your high school career to even be eligible to<br>attend one of these schools. It should be difficult; nothing worthwhile<br>is ever easy, or everyone would do it. Service academy graduates join an<br>elite group of people who are among the best and brightest leaders our<br>nation has ever produced.<br><br>Specifically for the Air Force Academy, [[a<br>website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60e33c&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} has been built<br>which will walk you through the entire admissions and nomination<br>process. In addition, we have Admissions Liaison Officers (ALOs)<br>nationwide who will guide you through the admissions process and help to<br>make sure your admissions process is smooth and that you don't miss any<br>important steps or deadlines.<br><br>If you have specific questions regarding admissions into a service<br>academy, please ask, and good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
