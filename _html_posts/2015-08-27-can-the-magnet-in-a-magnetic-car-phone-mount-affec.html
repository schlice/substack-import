<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It shouldn\'t, because even though the phone has a \"compass app\", it<br>usually just uses GPS and cell tower triangulation to tell you what<br>direction you are going.<br><br>Magnets have no effect on reporting battery charge (which simply uses<br>the output voltage of the battery to determine remaining charge) or on<br>navigation software, which once again relies on the phone\'s GPS<br>reception and a working cellular data connection to relay the<br>information back to the nav site for calculation, or back to the app if<br>it\'s an app with pre-loaded maps. There is a magnetometer in your<br>phone, but it works in conjunction with the GPS and cellular signals, so<br>interference on any one of them won't hurt the compass app.<br><br>There aren\'t any magnetic storage media inside a phone, so magnets<br>should not have an effect on it.<br><br>The only impact I can think of: some phones have a magnetic proximity<br>sensor that allows the use of \"smart covers\" which turn the display<br>off when they are closed, and turn it back on when the cover is open.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
