<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: no.<br><br>Longer answer: Mythbusters "sort of" tested this. They tested whether or<br>not you could dodge a bullet if you were a sufficient distance away from<br>the shooter and could see the muzzle flash. With the help of a US Army<br>sniper, they tested the theory. They found that using standard loads,<br>you simply couldn't see the muzzle flash outside of 200 yards away. A<br>sniper round traveled 200 yards in 231 milliseconds.<br><br>So they set up a test. They used a sniper rifle loaded with blanks set<br>up 200 yards away, and set up a paintball gun at roughly point-blank<br>range (i.e. within about 4 feet of the target) and wired its firing<br>mechanism so that it would fire a paintball 231 ms after the sniper<br>rifle was fired, and neither Adam or Jamie came close to being able to<br>dodge the bullet, even when they could see the muzzle flash.<br><br>The only way they could dodge a bullet was when they switched to<br>Hollywood blanks which make very large muzzle flashes and moved the<br>rifle out to 500 yards. It takes a bullet 597 milliseconds to travel<br>that distance, and with the rig set to 597, they were finally able to<br>start dodging bullets.<br><br>But since they had to use Hollywood blanks, be ready and staring<br>directly at the shooter and even then they just barely got out of the<br>way, they declared the myth busted.\[1\](#iSkXF){#cite-iSkXF<br>.citation_link}<br><br>I would tend to agree. Even with a perfect set of circumstances, in the<br>real world it would be virtually impossible to dodge a bullet. And being<br>able to see a bullet mid-air means it has already traversed some of the<br>distance between the shooter and you, so you are extremely unlikely<br>to be able to dodge the bullet at that point.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-iSkXF){.citation_index} [[MythBusters Episode 167: Dodge a<br>Bullet](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b0d448&url=http://mythresults.com/dodge-a-bullet){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="mythresults.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
