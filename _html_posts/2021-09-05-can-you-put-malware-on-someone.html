<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's not quite that easy, but the number one way to get viruses on your<br>devices is by opening attachments in emails, or visiting<br>questionable/unknown websites.<br><br>And it's especially more difficult on a mobile device, unless you've<br>jailbroken/rooted your device.<br><br>If there's ever any question whether or not there is malware on your<br>phone, reset your device.<br><br>First, before you reset your device, make sure your backups are in<br>place. On iPhone, you should be backing up your device to iCloud. Make<br>sure you're signed in and backing up. For Android devices, make sure<br>you're backing up to Google. On current Android versions, it's under<br>Settings \> Accounts and backup.<br><br>Once that's done, reset your device:<br><br>- On iPhone, it's under Settings \> General \> Reset. Follow the<br>  instructions and choose "Erase All Content and Settings." The device<br>  will make sure you have a current backup before you proceed.<br>- On Android, it's under Settings \> General Management \> Reset.<br>  Follow the instructions. While Android won't ensure you have a current<br>  backup before you proceed, you should first ensure you have taken the<br>  step from before and created a full backup.<br><br>Once your phone wipes itself and re-installs the operating system, log<br>back into your online account (iCloud or Google), and as part of the<br>setup process, you will be given the option to restore your device from<br>one of your backups.<br><br>Malware applications aren't installed from the approved app stores, so<br>any malware will be erased.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can you put malware on someone's phone by sending an email and me<br>opening it? My crazy boyfriend said he did that and now he can listen to<br>all my conversations.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
