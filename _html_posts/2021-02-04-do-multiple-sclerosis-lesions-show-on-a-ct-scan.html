<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why yes, yes they do. But the CT scanner is of limited usefulness in MS<br>treatment.<br><br>The CT scanner can see active MS lesions (after two or three doses of<br>contrast material), but it cannot see chronic lesions, and the lesions<br>it does see are highly nonspecific. In other words, it's very hard on a<br>CT to tell that they are MS lesions; they just appear as any other<br>enhancing white matter lesion. It may even be misdiagnosed as a tumor.<br><br>Because the CT scanner is of limited usefulness, and the MRI is so much<br>more precise in terms of diagnosing MS, the CT scanner is very rarely<br>used in the diagnosis and treatment of MS.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
