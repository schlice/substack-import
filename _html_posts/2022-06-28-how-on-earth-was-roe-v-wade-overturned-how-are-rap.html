<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> How on Earth was Roe v. Wade overturned?<br><br>Because it was a horrible decision legally. You may have liked its<br>outcome, but the way it got there was unsustainable and<br>unconstitutional. It caused *continuous* legal trouble because the<br>decision was really unsustainable.<br><br>It doesn't make legal sense to keep a bad ruling in force just because<br>you like the outcome. If you want the outcome, get it the right way: get<br>Congress to pass a nationwide law permitting abortion. Or (as we have<br>today), get your state to permit it.<br><br>> How are rape victims going to be treated as a result?<br><br>With compassion, first and foremost. And referring to the point above,<br>most states have some provision which allows abortion in the case of<br>reported rape. We can talk about whether or not that makes moral sense,<br>but legally, it's up to the states to determine that.<br><br>But even if the state does not allow abortion in the case of rape, the<br>rape victim is treated with respect and compassion. We clearly<br>understand that she is not interested in being in the position in which<br>she is in. She never asked for it. She never wanted it. So compassion is<br>the word of the day.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
