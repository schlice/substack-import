If the item<br>could be seen from outside the car, it is covered under an exception to<br>the Fourth Amendment called "plain sight." If the item was visible in<br>plain sight, without any touching, it can be confiscated and used as<br>evidence. Additionally, that evidence becomes the probable cause needed<br>to effect a continued search.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is opening a car door a search under the Fourth Amendment?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
