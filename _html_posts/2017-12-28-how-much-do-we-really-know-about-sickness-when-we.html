<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The question is illogical. Let me frame it in terms of logic, and you<br>tell me if these statements follow:<br><br>- The only way to know sickness is to cure diseases.<br>- We have not cured the common cold.<br>- Therefore, we do not know much about sickness.<br><br>Man, I don't even know where to start. The premise is flawed (the only<br>way to know sickness is to cure disease), because we can know tremendous<br>amounts about "sickness" without finding "cures." The terms are<br>undefined. What does "sickness" mean? What does "cure" mean? And<br>finally, what's so special about "curing the common cold," giving the<br>impression that we haven't accomplished this "simple" task of curing the<br>"common" cold, so therefore our scientific capabilities are somehow<br>weak?<br><br>So I know that the logic is flawed in this question and it's basically a<br>really poor question, but I'll address one part of it for your<br>edification: the "common cold."<br><br>The common cold is not one disease, but many that are lumped together<br>based on general symptomology and disease course. They are caused by<br>many different viruses, but rhinoviruses are the most common. It's a<br>virus, and our bodies are fully equipped to handle viruses. The common<br>cold, especially, is usually harmless, even though it doesn't feel<br>harmless. It takes a few weeks, but the virus in the common cold is<br>usually dealt with by the body naturally. Some viruses, and some people,<br>can't successfully deal with viruses, and in some people, the common<br>cold can progress to other conditions, such as acute sinusitis<br>(inflammation and infection of the sinuses), which is a bacterial<br>infection, or otitis media (an ear infection), or other secondary<br>infections like bronchitis, strep throat, or pneumonia.<br><br>So it's important to take care of yourself and help your body to rid<br>itself of the cold virus in as expeditiously a manner as it can. Drink<br>lots of clear fluids. Eat right. Get lots of sleep. Stay home from work<br>to give yourself a chance to heal and to not infect others.<br><br>So hopefully you got some useful information from a poor question.<br><br>(Interesting tidbit: I actually have a cold right now. I picked it up<br>Christmas shopping. Symptoms appeared Christmas day. The joy of the<br>holidays...)<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
