<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is that no one is actually ignorant except for those who are<br>willfully ignorant.<br><br>Yes, there may have been some who never heard of Jesus, but God has<br>written His truth on our hearts. Whether or not they have "heard about<br>Him," all people are accountable to God. Scripture says that God has<br>clearly revealed Himself in nature (Romans 1:20) and in the hearts of<br>people (Ecclesiastes 3:11).<br><br>The problem is that humans are all sinners. We know what is on our<br>hearts, yet we actively reject it in favor of what "feels good" or<br>whatever the desires of the flesh hold for us. If it were not for God's<br>grace, we would be trapped in our sin, unable to see just how useless<br>and miserable life is apart from Him. He allows those who choose their<br>own desires over Him to suffer the due penalty for their sin (Romans<br>1:24--32).<br><br>Therefore, this is not a problem of not ever hearing about Jesus. It's<br>about rejecting the truth of what you know in your hearts and you see<br>all around you.<br><br>It might be comforting to believe that someone shouldn't go to hell just<br>because they haven't heard of Jesus. But that presents a problem. If we<br>assume that those who never hear the gospel are granted mercy from God,<br>there is no reason for us to ever tell anyone about God. If people who<br>never hear the gospel are automatically saved, then it is logical to<br>make sure no one ever hears the gospel, because then there would be a<br>chance they would hear it and reject it, and then be condemned. It would<br>be better that they never heard it at all.<br><br>Clearly, Jesus commands us otherwise.<br><br>The Bible is clear that those who die without knowing Jesus will face an<br>eternity in hell. And the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19--20) is still<br>in force. People need to repent and believe, but "How, then, can they<br>call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in<br>the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without<br>someone preaching to them? And how can anyone preach unless they are<br>sent?" (Romans 10:14--15).<br><br>We have been sent. The onus, therefore, is on us to spread the Good News<br>to everyone.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
