<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends." But if your<br>"something suspicious" doesn't rise to the level of probable cause, they<br>cannot search inside the home, and certainly not without a warrant.<br><br>There are some exceptions to the need to get a warrant. Here's a few<br>examples:<br><br>- Is the "something suspicious" they see accompanied by sounds from<br>  inside the home which would indicate to a reasonable person that<br>  someone was hurt or injured inside and needed medical assistance or<br>  was otherwise in trouble?<br>- Is someone in the house on parole?<br>- Did someone in the house give permission to search?<br><br>In other words, are there "exigent circumstances" that would lead a<br>reasonable person to believe that a crime was taking place, or was about<br>to take place, or someone was hurt, or a fugitive was about to escape,<br>or evidence was about to be destroyed? If so (and if the officer can<br>articulate that suspicion in court), then he can search without a<br>warrant.<br><br>But all of those things amount to "probable cause" in some way. There<br>must always be probable cause, either through exigency, or a warrant. A<br>police officer cannot search a home without probable cause if he wants<br>any of the evidence to be admissible in court.<br><br>Also don't forget, he doesn't have to tell you what his probable cause<br>is. He only has to tell the judge.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If cops see something suspicious outside of your home, can they search<br>without probable cause?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
