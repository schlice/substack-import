<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I know who can be trusted to correctly interpret the Bible.<br><br>*The Holy Spirit*.<br><br>That's who interprets the Bible. It was the Spirit who inspired the<br>original writers to write the words they did, when they did it. And it<br>is the Spirit which indwells the believer who whispers the truth of the<br>words into our hearts.<br><br>If you've never taken part in an exercise with your Bible called<br>SOAPing, I recommend you do it. SOAP is an acronym, and it<br>stands for Scripture, Observation, Application, and<br>Prayer. You get a chapter (in my case, it was from a 40-day reading<br>plan) and you read the chapter. Then you pick out a verse which stands<br>out to you, write what you observe about that passage, then how you can<br>apply it to your life, and then author a quick prayer about it. I kept a<br>SOAP journal while I was actively SOAPing at a previous church. Here's<br>one of my SOAP pages on John 1:<br><br>> Scripture\<br>> There was a man sent from God whose name was John. He came as a<br>> witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all<br>> might believe. He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness<br>> to the light. (John‬ 1‬:6-8‬ NIV)<br>><br>> Observation\<br>> I love how God sends \"the Light,\" but He also sends messengers to<br>> testify about the light. I can only imagine that those messengers<br>> appeared crazy to the people, especially when John said things like<br>> "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! This is<br>> the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed<br>> me because he was before me.'\" (John‬ 1‬:29-30‬ NIV). What more can He<br>> do to try to tell us the Good News?<br>><br>> Application\<br>> God sends me messages all the time. I need to do a better job at<br>> receiving them.<br>><br>> Prayer\<br>> God, please help me to \"get it.\" Because I don\'t often get it. You<br>> keep calling and I don\'t hear. Help me to know Your voice so I may<br>> better separate You from the noise.<br><br>Now, here's the thing. I'm no Bible scholar. But I didn't need to be in<br>order to read John 1 and find a Scripture passage which resonated with<br>me that I could think about, make an observation about, apply it to my<br>life, and then pray about it.<br><br>Therefore, *when it comes to me and my salvation*, the Holy Spirit<br>helps me to hear God's voice through the reading of the Bible, when I<br>actively prepare myself for reading, and then read, and then reflect.<br><br>Now, ***when it comes to instructing others on the truths of the<br>Bible***, I don't think myself enough of a Bible scholar to do that. I<br>would rely on someone who has studied the Bible far more thoroughly.<br>Perhaps someone who has attended Seminary. Perhaps someone who has<br>studied under one of the great masters, like my pastoral staff who has<br>studied under the great [[John<br>MacArthur](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d55b4f&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._MacArthur){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} (you know you're a great<br>master when you have *authored* several translations of the Bible<br>itself).<br><br>TL;DR: Depending on the application, the amount of theological<br>training required may be different. But to directly answer the question,<br>the only one who interprets the Bible for any of us is the Holy Spirit.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Who can be trusted to correctly interpret the Bible?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
