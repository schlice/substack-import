<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>According to the Catholic Church, during the time he was dead, he was in<br>Hell.<br><br>From the Catechism of the Catholic Church, part 1, section 2, chapter 2,<br>article 5:<br><br>> **PART ONE\<br>> THE PROFESSION OF FAITH**<br>><br>> **SECTION TWO\<br>> THE PROFESSION OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH**<br>><br>> **CHAPTER TWO\<br>> I BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST, THE ONLY SON OF GOD**<br>><br>> **ARTICLE 5\<br>> \"HE DESCENDED INTO HELL. ON THE THIRD DAY HE ROSE AGAIN\"**<br>><br>> 631 Jesus \"descended into the lower parts of the earth. He who<br>> descended is he who also ascended far above all the heavens.\"<br>><br>> The Apostles\' Creed confesses in the same article Christ\'s descent<br>> into hell and his Resurrection from the dead on the third day, because<br>> in his Passover it was precisely out of the depths of death that he<br>> made life spring forth:<br>><br>> Christ, that Morning Star, who came back from the dead, and shed his<br>> peaceful light on all mankind, your Son who lives and reigns for ever<br>> and ever. Amen.<br>><br>> *Paragraph 1. Christ Descended into Hell*<br>><br>> 632 The frequent New Testament affirmations that Jesus was<br>> \"raised from the dead\" presuppose that the crucified one sojourned<br>> in the realm of the dead prior to his resurrection.<br>><br>> This was the first meaning given in the apostolic preaching to<br>> Christ\'s descent into hell: that Jesus, like all men, experienced<br>> death and in his soul joined the others in the realm of the dead. But<br>> he descended there as Savior, proclaiming the Good News to the spirits<br>> imprisoned there.<br>><br>> 633 Scripture calls the abode of the dead, to which the dead<br>> Christ went down, \"hell\" - *Sheol* in Hebrew or *Hades* in Greek -<br>> because those who are there are deprived of the vision of God.<br>><br>> Such is the case for all the dead, whether evil or righteous, while<br>> they await the Redeemer: which does not mean that their lot is<br>> identical, as Jesus shows through the parable of the poor man Lazarus<br>> who was received into \"Abraham\'s bosom\":<br>><br>> \"It is precisely these holy souls, who awaited their Savior in<br>> Abraham\'s bosom, whom Christ the Lord delivered when he descended<br>> into hell.\"<br>><br>> Jesus did not descend into hell to deliver the damned, nor to destroy<br>> the hell of damnation, but to free the just who had gone before him.<br>><br>> 634 \"The gospel was preached even to the dead.\"<br>><br>> The descent into hell brings the Gospel message of salvation to<br>> complete fulfilment. This is the last phase of Jesus\' messianic<br>> mission, a phase which is condensed in time but vast in its real<br>> significance: the spread of Christ\'s redemptive work to all men of<br>> all times and all places, for all who are saved have been made sharers<br>> in the redemption.<br>><br>> 635 Christ went down into the depths of death so that \"the dead<br>> will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.\"<br>><br>> Jesus, \"the Author of life\", by dying destroyed \"him who has the<br>> power of death, that is, the devil, and \delivered\ all those who<br>> through fear of death were subject to lifelong bondage.\"<br>><br>> Henceforth the risen Christ holds \"the keys of Death and Hades\", so<br>> that \"at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on<br>> earth and under the earth.\"<br>><br>> Today a great silence reigns on earth, a great silence and a great<br>> stillness. A great silence because the King is asleep. The earth<br>> trembled and is still because God has fallen asleep in the flesh and<br>> he has raised up all who have slept ever since the world began. . . He<br>> has gone to search for Adam, our first father, as for a lost sheep.<br>> Greatly desiring to visit those who live in darkness and in the shadow<br>> of death, he has gone to free from sorrow Adam in his bonds and Eve,<br>> captive with him - He who is both their God and the son of Eve. . .<br>> \"I am your God, who for your sake have become your son. . . I order<br>> you, O sleeper, to awake. I did not create you to be a prisoner in<br>> hell. Rise from the dead, for I am the life of the dead.\"488<br>><br>> IN BRIEF<br>><br>> **(636) By the expression \"He descended into hell\", the Apostles\'<br>> Creed confesses that Jesus did really die and through his death for us<br>> conquered death and the devil \"who has the power of death\" (*Heb***<br>> 2:14).<br>><br>> 637 In his human soul united to his divine person, the dead Christ<br>> went down to the realm of the dead. He opened heaven\'s gates for the<br>> just who had gone before him.\[1\](#CYepf){#cite-CYepf<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-CYepf){.citation_index} [[Catechism of the Catholic<br>Church](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=285cdd&url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p122a5p1.htm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="vatican.va"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
