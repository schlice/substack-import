<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No.<br><br>Everyone is here saying yes he can, but he cannot. Once his term is<br>over, he *de facto* has no more authority. He's a former president.<br>He cannot stay "in office" (meaning, still as President) longer than the<br>end of his term. Once his successor is sworn in, *he is no longer<br>President*. So he can't "hang on" to Presidential power because the<br>Constitution requires that the office of the President change to the<br>duly-elected, newly sworn-in President-Elect.<br><br>So at that moment, the previous President automatically becomes the<br>*former* President. He can't do anything to "stay in office." And that<br>process does not require his consent. It happens whether he likes it or<br>not.<br><br>Now, can he "stay in the *physical* office?" Sure, for a little while.<br>He can refuse to leave the *physical* office. But the Secret Service and<br>the Capitol Police may have something to say about a civilian remaining<br>in the White House after being ordered to leave. And that's just a bad<br>look for a former President.<br><br>Even when parties change, former presidents are at least cordial to<br>their replacements. I love the letter that George W. Bush left for<br>Obama:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-dbb2d831f7c83b84424c658535bcfa23){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-dbb2d831f7c83b84424c658535bcfa23" master_w="763"<br>master_h="992"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>It says:<br><br>*Jan 20, 2009*<br><br>Dear Barack,<br><br>**Congratulations on becoming our President.

And from this day you are<br>President of all of us. I salute you and wish you success and much<br>happiness.**<br><br>**The burdens you now shoulder are great but often exaggerated. The<br>sheer joy of doing what you believe is right is inexpressible.**<br><br>My prayers are with you and your family. Godspeed.<br><br>**Sincerely,\<br>Bill**<br><br>*This* is what a cordial transition of power looks like.
