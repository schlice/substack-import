<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It was handled at the time. A "payoff for silence" is an agreement<br>between two parties. One agrees not to move forward, the other agrees to<br>give them a pile of money. Takes two to tango here. She accepted that<br>money and agreed to not pursue further action or to discuss the issue<br>further. So I guess it was settled for her, wasn't it.<br><br>An affair is a lot different from a sexual assault. So yeah, I<br>view them completely differently. The results of an affair are between a<br>husband and his wife. And while sexual assault is a criminal activity,<br>an affair is not.<br><br>We as a nation already knew Trump played it a little loose with the<br>women. We all heard the *Access Hollywood* tape. And we elected him<br>anyway. How does this change anything at all?<br><br>These days, we call this a "political nothingburger."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
