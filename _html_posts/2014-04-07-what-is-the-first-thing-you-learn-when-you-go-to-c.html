<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [The first thing I learned is that computers are dumb,<br/>meaning they are utterly unintelligent. A computer is only as good as<br/>its programming. Some computers may have exceptional hardware, but<br/>hardware sits idle without running some kind of software, either the<br/>firmware which makes the hardware work, or the software which makes the<br/>computer perform some meaningful task. The computer itself is a brick.<br/>It is the software that makes a computer shine.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
