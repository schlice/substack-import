<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is called when a police officer encourages you to commit a<br>crime?**<br><br>I'm pretty sure the word you're looking for is entrapment.<br>Entrapment is a legal defense to a crime when a government agent or<br>government official originated the idea of the crime and encouraged the<br>accused to engage in it. If the crime was promoted by a private person<br>who has no connection to the government, it is not entrapment.<br><br>The police can use deception to induce people to commit crimes, but it<br>has to be established that the person was already predisposed to<br>committing crime in the first place in order to avoid having the offense<br>be considered entrapment. For example, a police officer can pretend to<br>be a drug addict to get a drug dealer to sell him drugs, and this would<br>not be considered entrapment. However, a police officer cannot use<br>deceptive tactics to induce a person to commit a crime if that person<br>was not previously willing to commit a crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
