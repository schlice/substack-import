<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Presumably, you have a full flight and passengers have<br>checked in and hold boarding passes for all the seats. A number of<br>passengers also have tickets for that flight, but there are no more<br>seats. The difference in whether or not you will be compensated for<br>changing flights is whether or not you are currently holding a boarding<br>pass for the flight (i.e. you\'re booked on to the plane instead of<br>having a ticket and no boarding pass).\<br>\<br>As you get closer to flight time for an overbooked flight, the airline<br>will offer compensation for passengers to rebook onto a later flight.\<br>\<br>If you are not currently holding a boarding pass, you\'re mostly out of<br>luck. You can wait to see if anyone else leaves, or you can have them<br>book you on a later flight. You\'re not getting anything for it either,<br>because you checked in last (after the plane was full).\<br>\<br>If you are holding a boarding pass, wait them out. The closer to flight<br>time you get, the more compensation you will receive for switching to a<br>later flight. Be careful though, if you wait too long, the compensation<br>they are currently offering may be good enough for someone else\...\<br>\<br>The \"keyword\" to use when you\'re standing at Customer Service being<br>booked onto another flight is \"inconvenience.\" When explaining that<br>you need to get to place X to attend function Y, you need to add that<br>this \"is a terrible inconvenience.\" Customer Service reps know that<br>they need to compensate \"inconvenienced travelers\" lest they take<br>their business elsewhere where they will not be inconvenienced by the<br>inept practice of overbooking.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
