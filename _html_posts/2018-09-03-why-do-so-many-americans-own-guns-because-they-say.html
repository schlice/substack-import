The rights existed<br>before the Constitution; the Bill of Rights ensures that the government<br>cannot "infringe" on the rights you already have.<br><br>It's just easier to say that I have the "right" to do something because<br>of the Constitution, when in fact, the Constitution merely ensures that<br>your right (which was pre-existent) cannot be infringed by the<br>government.<br><br>But while the government cannot prevent you from owning a gun (in most<br>circumstances), they would have to let you own cows. I'm certain that<br>there's at least one zoning law which would have to be followed in order<br>to own a cow.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
