<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So let's dissect what you said:<br><br>*I went through the stages of relapsing-remitting into secondary<br>Progressive and finally primary Progressive MS.*<br><br>Unless you went back in time, you didn't "progress" from SPMS into PPMS.<br>You may have progressed from RRMS to SPMS (this is understandable,<br>patients do move from RRMS to SPMS (as it is in the name:<br>*Secondary* Progressive MS), and it's possible that your entire<br>disease course was then re-evaluated and found to be Primary Progressive<br>MS (i.e. no Relapsing disease course first, only a steady progression<br>with no discernable relapses). So you either had RRMS and then SPMS, or<br>you had PPMS for your entire disease course. That's my guess based on<br>what you said.<br><br>So how exactly did that work? Did one neurologist diagnose you with<br>improving symptoms, and then another neurologist said, "No, your<br>symptoms never really improved, so we're going to call you PPMS"? The<br>other differences between progressive forms of the disease and relapsing<br>forms of the disease is *inflammation*. You either have it or you don't.<br>If you do have inflammation, it usually indicates a relapsing disease<br>form, where less inflammation is usually characteristic of progressive<br>disease forms. Finally, in progressive disease courses, you find more<br>lesions in the spinal cord than you do in the brain, as with relapsing<br>forms of the disease.<br><br>Something interesting you find from the [[National MS<br>Society](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cd1e74&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/Types-of-MS/Primary-progressive-MS){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}:<br><br>"Being able to characterize the course of your disease course at<br>different points in time helps you and your MS care provider have<br>important conversations about your treatment options and prognosis. For<br>example:<br><br>- "If you have PPMS that is active, with new MRI activity or relapses,<br>  your conversation with your MS care provider could be about starting<br>  treatment with a disease-modifying therapy to reduce the risk of a<br>  relapse, as well as rehabilitation to help improve function and<br>  mobility.<br>- "If you have PPMS that is stable without activity or progression, the<br>  conversation with your MS care provider should include the role of<br>  rehabilitation to help you maintain function, as well as other symptom<br>  management strategies that you may need.<br>- "If you have PPMS that is not active (no new MRI activity or relapses)<br>  but is progressing with increasing accumulation of disability, the<br>  conversation with your MS provider needs to focus on the<br>  rehabilitation strategies that can help you maintain function and keep<br>  you safe and independently mobile."<br><br>So how is it then that you determine you have "no disease progression?"<br>You can have PPMS and have no disease progression for a very long time<br>(i.e. no new MRI activity and no increasing disability). Tysabri, I<br>believe, is a very big part of that. As I mentioned, I was on Tysabri<br>myself for 18 months, and it was the only time that I was able to shrink<br>some of my 20+ brain lesions. Tysabri is a great drug, so long as you're<br>JC negative. Thankfully, I am, and I remain, JC neg, because I'm on<br>Gilenya now, and we've seen a few cases of PML related to Gilenya use.<br><br>I think your book idea is great. However, I have a problem with your<br>title. You make it sound like you're cured. You make it sound like you<br>could go off of your medications and you'd be perfectly fine because you<br>"healed" yourself. However, with all of your "healing," you're still on<br>Tysabri, and the truth of the matter is that you still have MS. If you<br>stopped all of your medications tomorrow, you'd likely find yourself in<br>a rebound relapse in short order (6 months to a year).<br><br>I wonder if you're a student of Dr. [[Terry<br>Wahls](https://www.quora.com/profile/Terry-Wahls-MD)]{.qlink_container}<br>and if you've used the Wahls Protocol to heal your MS. Perhaps that's<br>what you're referring to when you say you "healed" your MS. You have<br>reduced disease activity to such a low level that you would call it<br>something akin to what HIV patients call a "functional cure" without the<br>lack of indicated disease. You still have indicated disease, because you<br>still take Tysabri.<br><br>The fear that I have, for followers of Dr. Wahls' work as well as<br>someone reading your book, is that they say, "Oooo, it's a cure! Look<br>how well it worked in this person! I'm going to go off of all of my<br>medications and just do this!" It worked wonders for Dr. Wahls, and many<br>people who have followed her treatment protocol have experienced amazing<br>results. But not everyone. Studies are underway, and grant money has<br>been secured, but currently her results, as well as yours, are<br>*anecdotal*. They are a wonderful story, and great to hear, but they<br>don't work for everyone. Filling people with hope is disingenuous. Dr.<br>Wahls says things like, "All disease begins at a cellular level." I am<br>always concerned when anyone speaks in absolutes. Nutrition is just one<br>potential cause of disease, consuming too much or too little of any one<br>nutrient. But it's absurd to think that all disease is caused by an<br>imbalance of nutrients, and that it is the basis of most or all<br>diseases.<br><br>Your protocol helped you produce something akin to a functional cure,<br>but let's avoid words like "healing my disease" or "curing my disease"<br>because these were not done. If that were so, you could stop your<br>medications today and you'd be great for the rest of your life. The only<br>treatment that even has the potential to do this is HSCT. Beyond that,<br>no treatment has the ability to completely stop the disease, requiring<br>no further medication. It's not that you stumbled upon the cure, and<br>that modern medicine is just hopelessly bogged down in red tape, it's<br>that we simply do not have the technology yet to find the cause. Without<br>the cause, we can't even begin to discuss the cure.<br><br>Finally, no one is disputing your results. As I have repeatedly said,<br>"you can't argue with results." And don't misunderstand, I am thrilled<br>that you are doing so well. I only caution you to not conflate disease<br>*management* with disease *modification,* in your own mind as well as in<br>your book. You are managing your disease, but if you have PPMS, or any<br>progressive form of MS, you are actually not slowing the course of the<br>disease, because Tysabri has not been shown to do that. We don't know<br>how to slow the progressive form of the disease yet, and in progressive<br>disease, without inflammation, you cannot see disease progression<br>through scans. I hate to break it to you, but if you had MS, *you still<br>have MS*. You did not "heal" or "cure" your MS. As I said earlier, if<br>you stop your Tysabri, your symptoms will eventually come back, and with<br>a vengeance. Your catch phrases for your title might sell a few books,<br>but they are not scientific, they are anecdotal. I'm happy for your<br>anecdote, but it doesn't apply to everyone.<br><br>The danger is believing that it does.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/If-I-am-writing-a-nonfiction-book-about-how-I-sent-long-term-severe-multiple-sclerosis-into-remission-how-much-total-pledge-money-should-I-request/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
