<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [To follow with the theme of \"flashing lights alert you to<br>a road hazard ahead,\" my USAFA grad colleagues will remember this from<br>their days at The Hill.\<br>\<br>The Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, is also designated<br>as an animal refuge. As a consequence, the local fauna (specifically<br>mule deer) flourish on the 18,000 acre campus (second largest in the<br>United States). Deer strikes are the most common auto accident that<br>takes place on the Academy, more common than off-base. The base does an<br>annual hunt to try to control the population, but the population still<br>grows at a faster pace than off-base.\<br>\<br>Consequently, it is well known that if a driver flashes his lights at<br>you on Academy property, you are likely approaching deer in the road or<br>near the road.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
