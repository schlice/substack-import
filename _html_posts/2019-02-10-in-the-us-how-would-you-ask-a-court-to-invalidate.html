<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In the US, how would you ask a court to invalidate a state of<br>emergency that was illegitimate?**<br><br>Short answer: you can't, unless the president violated the National<br>Emergencies Act<br><br>Longer answer: The judicial branch does not decide political questions.<br>National emergencies are governed by the National Emergencies Act.<br>Congress has given the President 136 distinct, statutory emergency<br>powers, and has written special powers into 470 different Federal laws<br>which the president can activate via the declaration of a national<br>emergency. Congress has already provided this authority to the<br>President, and has given him wide latitude to use that authority to<br>protect the country in the way in which he sees fit.<br><br>To that end, if the President follows the National Emergencies Act and<br>declares a national emergency in accordance with it, he can then invoke<br>those emergency powers which have already been written into the law.<br><br>The President also has the authority to declare other emergencies, such<br>as "public health emergencies" under the Public Health Service Act, and<br>he can declare areas of "natural disaster" under the Stafford Act.<br><br>Unless you claim that the President failed to follow the provisions of<br>the National Emergencies Act, then it's unlikely that you can make the<br>statement that the president's determination of a national emergency is<br>"illegitimate."<br><br>You *can* claim that the President used his legal authority in a way<br>in which it was not intended. While his actions may not be "unlawful"<br>*per se*, they may constitute an abuse of power. The Constitutional<br>remedy for a President who abuses his office, abuses presidential power,<br>or abuses authority, is impeachment. The courts do not intercede in<br>political matters. The courts decide matters of law, and it appears that<br>what you're claiming here is that the President, while acting lawfully,<br>abused his authority. That is an area for Congress to address, not the<br>Courts.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
