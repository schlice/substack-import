<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It depends on the conditions of the order.<br><br>If the location where the car is parked is more than the distance<br>specified in the order, then they can legally be present there.<br><br>However, in this day and age, someone sitting in their car in front of<br>your house without a stated purpose is *loitering*, and it can be a<br>sign that someone is engaging in, or planning on engaging in, criminal<br>behavior, and should be reported to the police (non-emergency line,<br>please).<br><br>If the restraining order is in relation to a domestic violence<br>complaint, then you might want to advise the dispatcher that the person<br>loitering in the vehicle is just outside of the distance specified in an<br>active restraining order for DV, and you are afraid that he/she intends<br>on violating that order, since he/she doesn't appear to be doing<br>anything productive. Based on that information, the police may be able<br>to re-prioritize their response. Domestic violence situations are highly<br>volatile and rapidly evolving, and it is better to get ahead of them<br>before they get out of hand.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
