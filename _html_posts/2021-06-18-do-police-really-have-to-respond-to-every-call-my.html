<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, police are actually under no obligation to respond to any call. I<br>mean, it's a bad look if they don't respond at all, but nothing says<br>that you must get a response from an actual sworn police officer. There<br>are volunteers who also work for the department, and they're called<br>different things in different departments. Some departments call them<br>"community service officers" and some call them "community patrol" but<br>what they are is a group of unarmed civilian volunteers who handle a lot<br>of lower-level work which doesn't necessarily require a sworn officer to<br>attend to. They may be involved in gathering evidence for an<br>investigation, or assisting with traffic flow following an accident<br>(their vehicles, while coming from the same source of police cruisers<br>and usually painted with the same or similar paint scheme \[albeit<br>usually different colors to distinguish them from police cruisers\],<br>will normally only have orange light bars and traffic directors).<br><br>The "trespassing rooster" call might be handled by a community service<br>officer instead of a sworn officer, leaving the sworn paid officers to<br>handle the higher-severity calls.<br><br>Eventually (and this is the dangerous part), you can be labeled as a<br>"nuisance caller" and much like the Boy who Cried Wolf, even your<br>actually-urgent calls may fall on deaf ears (or at least muffled ears).<br>Your calls will certainly be treated with skepticism as to their actual<br>urgency, and that's never a good thing.<br><br>Worse, if the police *do* respond and it turns out there was no<br>emergency, you can face charges of abuse of the 911 system, or worse.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Do police really have to respond to every call? My neighbors are<br>harassing me and are friends with the local police- and police recently<br>spent over two hours investigating an alleged \"trespassing rooster\"?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
