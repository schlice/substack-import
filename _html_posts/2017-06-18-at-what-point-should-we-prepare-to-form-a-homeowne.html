<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Oh, you should most definitely begin right now.<br><br>The main reason: the builder controls the remaining 40% of incomplete<br>units, and casts the votes on them. If you want to enact a<br>homeowner-operated HOA, it will never be easier to do than right now,<br>especially if you have the endorsement of your builder. You generally<br>need a 2/3 majority of homeowners to vote in changes to your covenants<br>(or to approve the formation of a new covenants), so if the builder<br>approves 40% of the vote, you only need 26% of the remaining homeowners<br>to approve the HOA and it's in.<br><br>We were even better off when we started: our neighborhood was only 50%<br>complete when we modified our covenants to form a homeowner-operated<br>HOA. We had broad approval from the actual owner-occupied units, but<br>having 50% of the neighborhood voting yes made the process very easy.<br><br>Your builder should help you with the process. You'll need a management<br>company, an attorney to draw up the documents and file them with the<br>city, and an initial HOA board. If you're fortunate, the builder will<br>actually chip in some of the money needed for the attorney's fees. You<br>should recommend that if it's in the builder's best interest for you to<br>form an HOA, they can help with the upfront cost. You can modify your<br>association dues to pay ongoing fees later on, but the builder should<br>chip in to make the requisite changes to get the thing off the ground.<br><br>Even though you only need 26% of the remaining homeowners to approve the<br>change, keep your homeowners in the loop. This is 2017; go online!<br>Establish a website (another upfront cost) and get your homeowners to<br>build accounts on that site where they can pay their dues. There are<br>tons of HOA website hosts out there that provide this service and more;<br>integrate online services early into your HOA model. You'll enjoy<br>faster, easier payment of dues, fewer late payments, and better<br>communications with your homeowners.<br><br>Finally, make sure your HOA provides value to your homeowners. What<br>services will you provide? What benefits will your homeowners see from<br>making this move? Hopefully, they will see transparency in how their<br>dues are spent, and they will have a hand in making those decisions. The<br>biggest benefit your homeowners will see is more control over how the<br>community is run, and more transparency in how community money is spent.<br>But the services you can offer, and thus the value you can offer your<br>homeowners, is only limited by your imagination.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
