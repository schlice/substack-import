<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Part of the problem is what you will consider "evidence." Are you<br>waiting for a scientific proof to show that God exists?<br><br>If that's the case, you're going to be waiting for a very long time. If<br>God does exist, then necessarily, He is immaterial and eternal.<br>Therefore, science will never be able to detect the immaterial. So<br>you're never going to find one of God's hairs or see one of God's<br>footprints. Such evidence is not only currently unavailable, but it is<br>also impossible in principle.<br><br>Does that mean it is impossible to demonstrate that God exists? No. It<br>simply means that science is not the right means, just as a metal<br>detector is not the right tool to find a plastic cup.<br><br>The correct tools, or proofs, are logical proofs found in the discipline<br>of *philosophy*. Philosophy deals with life\'s most significant issues,<br>including morality, meaning, and the existence of God. Philosophy<br>enables us to investigate realities that cannot be perceived through our<br>senses. Therefore, philosophy offers an excellent method to explore<br>evidence for the existence of God.<br><br>But because these philosophical proofs rely on *inductive* reasoning,<br>they can never be 100% accurate. They can only be *highly likely*. This<br>means that these proofs will always leave room for doubt.<br><br>But here's the secret: *this is not a bug, but a feature.*<br><br>> The beauty of God's scheme here is that if you're not willing to<br>> accept Christianity, then you're free to reject it. This freedom to<br>> make choices---even the freedom to reject truth---is what makes us<br>> moral creatures and enables each of us to choose our ultimate destiny.<br>><br>> This really hits at the heart of why we exist at all, and why God<br>> might not be as overt in revealing Himself to us as you would like.<br>><br>> For if the Bible is true, then God has provided each of us with the<br>> opportunity to make an eternal choice to either accept Him or reject<br>> Him. And in order to ensure that our choice is truly free, He puts us<br>> in an environment that is filled with evidence of His existence, but<br>> without his *direct* presence---a presence so powerful that it could<br>> overwhelm our freedom and thus negate our ability to reject Him.<br>><br>> In other words, God has provided enough evidence in this life to<br>> convince anyone *willing to believe*, yet He has also left some<br>> ambiguity so as not to compel the *unwilling*.<br>><br>> In this way, God gives us the opportunity either to love Him or to<br>> reject Him without violating our freedom. In fact, the purpose of this<br>> life is to make that choice freely and without coercion. For love, by<br>> definition, must be freely given. It cannot be<br>> coerced.\[1\](#umCmP){#cite-umCmP .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-umCmP){.citation_index} [[I Don\'t Have Enough Faith to Be<br>an Atheist: Geisler, Norman L., Turek, Frank, Limbaugh, David:<br>9781433580758: Amazon.com:<br>Books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=770f5b&url=https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Have-Enough-Faith-Atheist/dp/1433580756){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
