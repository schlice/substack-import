<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Bible is not an Ann Landers column. It does not give dating advice.<br><br>What it does do is give God's Word.<br><br>And God's Word is very clear about some things. The Bible is replete<br>with admonitions against homosexual behavior (all quotes from NIV):<br><br>> Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that<br>> is detestable. --- Leviticus 18:22<br>><br>> If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman,<br>> both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to<br>> death; their blood will be on their own heads. --- Leviticus 20:13<br>><br>> Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of<br>> God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters<br>> nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the<br>> greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the<br>> kingdom of God. --- 1 Corinthians 6:9-10<br>><br>> We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for<br>> lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and<br>> irreligious, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for<br>> murderers, for the sexually immoral, for those practicing<br>> homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers---and for<br>> whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine --- 1 Timothy 1:9-10<br><br>And lest you think that only gay men are implicated in the Bible,<br>lesbians are also specifically called out:<br><br>> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their<br>> women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the<br>> same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were<br>> inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with<br>> other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.<br>> --- Romans 1:26--27<br><br>So while you can date¹ anyone you like, with whom you have sex is<br>another story entirely.<br><br>\<br><br>¹ I have become aware that I am old. And apparently, the word *date* has<br>taken on new meanings. Way back when in the late 80s and early 90s when<br>I was dating, dating did not involve sex. Apparently nowadays, when you<br>say that you're dating someone, it means that you're having sex *as a<br>matter of course*. So therefore, I must clarify that when I say "date,"<br>I do not mean "have sex."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
