<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Actually, *mens rea* (the guilty mind) has been a major component of<br>criminal liability since English common law. You need the *actus reus*<br>(the criminal act) and the *mens rea* (the criminal mind).<br><br>Under the current law, subsection (f) of the Espionage Act is the only<br>subsection which does *not* contain an element of intent. And no one in<br>the history of the Act has ever been prosecuted or charged under<br>subsection (f). There are lots of examples of others prosecuted under<br>the remainder of the Espionage Act, none ever under subsection (f).<br><br>The premise that you can be guilty of criminal liability without<br>criminal intent in Federal law is against English common law, something<br>that Federal law generally follows and has for hundreds of years.<br><br>The standard common law test of criminal liability is usually expressed<br>in the Latin phrase, *actus reus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea*,<br>which means \"the guilty act is not culpable unless the mind is<br>guilty\". This means you need the *actus reus*, the guilty act, as well<br>as the *mens rea*, the guilty mind. The intent has always been a part of<br>the criminal liability statute.<br><br>In other words intent is critical. Every other section of the Espionage<br>Act requires criminal intent. So when the FBI Director says that no<br>prosecutor would touch this case, it's because no prosecutor is going to<br>touch a law like this, especially after 100 years on the books without<br>case history, in a statute that has a lot of history in front of the<br>Supreme Court.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
