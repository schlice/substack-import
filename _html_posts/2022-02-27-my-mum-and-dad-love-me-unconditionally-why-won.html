<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think you may be misinterpreting what "unconditional love" looks like.<br><br>Do you mean the fact that if you don't follow God's rules, you don't get<br>to go to heaven when you die?<br><br>You do know that the same thing holds true for your parents, right? If<br>you don't follow their rules, you won't be allowed to live in their<br>house for very long (assuming you are a legal adult where you live).<br><br>The same is true for God. He loves you unconditionally. It doesn't<br>matter how many times you sin. It doesn't matter how many times you<br>screw up. He will always be there, waiting for you.<br><br>But you have to *follow his rules*, just as you have to follow your<br>parents' rules. If you steal all the silverware from your parents so you<br>can sell it to buy drugs, they're not going to allow you to live in<br>their house for very long. Yes, they still love you and they will never<br>stop, but that doesn't mean they don't have *boundaries* which you<br>must respect.<br><br>God has boundaries, too. If you don't do what he tells you, or if you do<br>what he tells you not to do, he won't allow you to live in his presence,<br>either.<br><br>So in that respect, I don't see a difference between God and your<br>parents.<br><br>The only real difference is the particular rules each one has.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>My mum and dad love me unconditionally. Why won't God do the same and<br>love me no matter what?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
