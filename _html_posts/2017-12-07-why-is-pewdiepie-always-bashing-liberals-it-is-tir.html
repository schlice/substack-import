<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>People change. PewDiePie changes as well...quite frequently, I might<br>add.<br><br>Demonetization forced him to change...a lot. So it's no surprise that<br>he's quite adept at changing quickly.<br><br>Being on the liberal-bashing bandwagon is just another temporary thing<br>for him.<br><br>So...vote with your wallet. Stop watching his videos for a while. If<br>enough people stopped watching his videos for a while and his viewership<br>numbers started to drop (which you know he watches like a hawk), he'd<br>make changes.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
