<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Should people be allowed to walk around naked?<br><br>I just answered a different question (but the fundamentals are the same)<br>regarding when it is no longer appropriate to allow little girls to run<br>around topless.<br><br>[[Bill Stein\'s answer to At what age does it become inappropriate for a<br>little girl to run around<br>topless?](https://www.quora.com/At-what-age-does-it-become-inappropriate-for-a-little-girl-to-run-around-topless/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>So why can't people walk around naked?<br><br>Well, depending on what part of the world you live in, maybe you can.<br>But at least part of the reason is related to climate.<br><br>Humans do not have thick coats of fur or layers of blubber to keep us<br>warm. Granted, we are warm-blooded so we don't rely on the environment<br>to heat us, but our skin is definitely not designed to be exposed to<br>bone-chilling cold. Our skin can freeze and our ability to regulate our<br>own body temperature is compromised when it is exposed to the elements.<br><br>But the question was not "can people walk around naked." The question<br>was "should people be allowed to walk around naked."<br><br>And the answer, *in current society*, is no.<br><br>In today's society, there is a thing called *modesty* and *propriety*.<br>Whether or not you believe those things *should* exist is certainly a<br>topic for debate. Regardless, those things *do* exist, and in<br>determining whether or not we should allow people to walk around naked<br>all the time, we must take society as it *is*, rather than how we *wish<br>it would be.*<br><br>In today's society, there is also a thing called *evil*. There are<br>people called *predators* who are literally itching for you to get your<br>proposal approved and start walking around naked. Combine your public<br>nudity with the laws which say that I can take pictures and video of<br>anyone in public, and you've got yourselves the makings of a world-class<br>pervert factory. I can't imagine that such a move wouldn't have a<br>non-trivial affect on the rate of crimes against the person, if you know<br>what I mean. I shouldn't have to spell it out. Oh, for heaven's sake,<br>rapes and sexual assaults will skyrocket. C'mon, work with me here.<br><br>If you want to talk about the creation of an *ideal society*, we can<br>certainly talk about whether or not clothing should exist. We can also<br>talk about whether or not certain articles of clothing should be<br>mandatory.<br><br>But in today's society, with today's issues, we simply can't support the<br>idea that anyone can walk around naked at any time. Americans are indeed<br>private about their bodies. It's not appropriate to call it "prudish,"<br>it's more appropriate to call it "private." Today's society sexualizes<br>nudity, and women use their, er, assets to their advantage when they<br>choose clothing. To suddenly declare that "no longer a thing" isn't<br>really possible.<br><br>And it's also important to remember that *not everyone in the world<br>believes as you do.* It is appropriate to take others' feelings into<br>account when we make policy that affects everyone, and there is a<br>sizable group of people who don't want everyone to be naked all the<br>time.<br><br>**TL;DR: In today's society, no, people should not be allowed to walk<br>around naked.**<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being<br>isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I<br>wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is<br>un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m<br>wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,<br>not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,<br>you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.<br>Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be<br>followed by a block and a mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this<br>immediately and with no compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
