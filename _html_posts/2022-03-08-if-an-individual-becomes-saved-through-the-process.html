<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Individuals are not saved through the process of sanctification.<br>Individuals are saved through the process of salvation.<br><br>What precedes salvation is a process called regeneration.<br>Regeneration is a sovereign work of God which prepares us for salvation.<br>*Regeneration precedes salvation because salvation is by faith, and dead<br>men cannot have faith. God, therefore, has mercy and imparts life.*<br><br>As for the second part of your question, yes, the saved are "set apart"<br>from the world. In other words, you are *in* the world, but you are not<br>*of* the world. You can be a light to the world (a conduit for Christ's<br>light) while not being *of* the world, or belonging to the world.<br><br>This will cause you pain. The world will reject you. The world will<br>hate you. It's not easy to be a Christian. *Salvation is free, but it<br>will cost you your life.*<br><br>But take heart, for Christ has overcome the world.<br><br>> "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In<br>> this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the<br>> world." --- John 16:33 NIV<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If an individual becomes saved through the process of sanctification,<br>are they to be set apart from the world but also to be a part as well to<br>transform lives?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
