<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I add to the body of evidence my ON story.<br><br>I woke up one morning to find that I "couldn't rub the sleep out of my<br>eye." My eye, specifically the lower part of my field of vision, was<br>blurry. My eye hurt any time I looked away from center. When I walked<br>into the darkened closet, I saw sparklers (รก la the 4th of July kind)<br>around the outside of my field of view. Thinking that it was just<br>pressure from allergies, I figured it would get better in the shower,<br>but it got worse. When I got out, it got better again. When I went out<br>into the bright sunlight or under fluorescent lights, my whole field of<br>view got washed out. Remember the "Brightness" and "Contrast" knobs on<br>old-style televisions? The image from my right eye looked like someone<br>had turned the Contrast knob way up. Also, my depth perception was<br>slower from my right eye than it was from my left, so when my son threw<br>the baseball, I couldn't catch it because I saw the ball in double while<br>it was flying at me.<br><br>The ophthalmologist knew right away that it was optic neuritis. The pain<br>was caused by pulling the optic nerve as the eye turned away from<br>center. The blurry vision and sparklers were effects of the swelling,<br>and the lower speed of image transmission was caused by the reduced<br>speed of image transmission through the area.<br><br>In people my age (at the time), it was about half of the time that the<br>issue was caused by Multiple Sclerosis, and the other half of the time,<br>it was not (the ON occurred on its own and resolved on its own).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
