<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does a person with a \"Do Not Resuscitate\" order have a right to sue<br>if EMTs save their life after a car accident?**<br><br>First of all, there is never a situation in which you do not have a<br>right to sue, unless you entered into a contract with an arbitration<br>clause in which you pledged that you would not sue.<br><br>Secondly, you can sue anyone for anything, that's not the question. The<br>question is how likely you would be to prevail.<br><br>In general, DNR orders apply to hospitals, where the order can be<br>confirmed with relatives and kept on file. They generally do not apply<br>to emergency responders, as they would usually not have a method of<br>determining the validity, or even the presence of, a DNR order. And for<br>the vast majority of people treated by EMTs, you wouldn't want them<br>wasting their time trying to find out if you have a DNR order before<br>treating you.<br><br>It would be difficult to indicate that you had such an order, in a<br>meaningful way, that EMTs would be able to follow. You could tattoo<br>"DNR" on your forehead, I suppose, but even then, would an EMT know that<br>this meant "do not resuscitate," or "David North Rules"? Who knows? And<br>what if it did mean "David North Rules" and an EMT thought it meant "do<br>not resuscitate" and let you die? Way too much risk for an EMT to *not*<br>do their jobs.<br><br>(EDIT) I should have added that some states recognize "Do Not<br>Resuscitate" bracelets from companies like MedicAlert. Usually the<br>bracelet has a scannable QR code which EMTs can scan with any smartphone<br>or tablet to retrieve a copy of your DNR. Other states require that a<br>DNR be on file with a doctor in addition to you wearing a DNR bracelet.<br>In any case, any EMT who complies in good faith with a DNR order will be<br>immune from liability. Additionally, any EMT who, in good faith,<br>attempts to determine if a DNR exists and fails to find one would<br>similarly be immune from liability for performing lifesaving procedures.<br><br>Ultimately, the answer is that you would be unlikely to prevail in such<br>a lawsuit against EMTs.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
