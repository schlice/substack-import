<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What damage can a tactical flashlight, like the police use, have on a<br>person\'s eyes if it is directed in the face for several minutes at less<br>than 3 feet away?**<br><br>Virtually none.<br><br>There have been some studies of long term exposure to bright lights<br>(i.e. less intense than directly staring into the sun, but brighter than<br>ambient light). [[It was<br>found](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bf5752&url=https://www.brightfocus.org/macular/article/are-bright-lights-damaging-eye){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="brightfocus.org"}]{.qlink_container} that there was a<br>correlation (note: not causation) between increased exposure to bright<br>light and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Basically, the study<br>found that chronic exposure over days or weeks to bright lights could<br>potentially increase the chance for long-term damage down the road.<br><br>I won't say that there is zero chance that there could be some damage<br>that presents itself, especially if pre-existing conditions are present.<br>However, under normal circumstances, bright light for a few minutes will<br>not cause any permanent damage.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
