They need a<br>*warrant* to do this, and the warrant is delivered to the company which<br>then must turn over whatever it has.\<br>\<br>If it\'s like WhatsApp, and they don\'t retain your messages, there\'s<br>nothing to turn over.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
