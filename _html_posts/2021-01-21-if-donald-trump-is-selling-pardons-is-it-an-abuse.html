<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If Donald Trump is selling pardons, is it an abuse of power, and is it<br>punishable or reversible?**<br><br>If credible evidence were presented to Federal law enforcement, it would<br>violate several Constitutional provisions and probably a few Federal<br>statutes as well. The person paying for a pardon would be charged with<br>Bribery of a Public Official (18 USC ยง 201), and the president could be<br>charged with Use of Public Office for Private Gain (CFR 5 ยง 2635.702).<br><br>The appropriate remedy is impeachment and removal from office, followed<br>by Federal indictment.<br><br>However, the pardons themselves are not reversible. You can't overturn a<br>valid pardon, so the only recourse would be to try to establish that the<br>pardon itself was invalid.<br><br>We already know that the DOJ in December uncovered [[a plot to try to<br>bribe the president into issuing<br>pardons](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3bb7f3&url=https://time.com/5916954/justice-department-white-house-pardon-bribery/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="time.com"}]{.qlink_container}, so this isn't so far fetched<br>of a question as you may think.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
