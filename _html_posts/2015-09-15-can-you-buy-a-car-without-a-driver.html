<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In the United States, you do not need a driver\'s license<br>to *purchase* a car. You only need a driver\'s license to *drive* a<br>car.\<br>\<br>That said, it\'s nearly *expected* that you do have a license to buy<br>a car, unless you want to do your test drive from the passenger seat.<br>While unusual to not be licensed, it\'s not illegal. Additionally, it is<br>expected that you are able to *insure* your car, since that too is<br>legally required, and it\'s difficult to get auto insurance unless you<br>have a license and a driving record which is reviewable by the company.<br>You may be able to get insurance without a license and a driving record,<br>but it will probably be pricey.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
