<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, it is not possible for science to either prove or disprove the<br>existence of God. Since God exists outside of the universe He created,<br>He must necessarily be immaterial (since He is outside of the material<br>universe) and eternal (He is outside of time). So you can't use physical<br>tests to find a non-physical thing. It's like using a metal detector to<br>find a plastic cup, or using your multimeter to find your pulse. Science<br>is the wrong tool to do it.<br><br>This doesn't mean you can't prove God exists *at all*, it just means<br>you can't use science to do it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
