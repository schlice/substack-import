<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So it sounds like you're talking about the enlisted oath. The officer<br>oath doesn't say anything about obeying orders. But that's just a side<br>note.<br><br>Yes, the oath says to obey the orders of the President and the officers<br>appointed over them, but then it says something else about those orders:<br><br>> ***according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military<br>> Justice***<br><br>So they are to obey orders according to regulations and the UCMJ.<br><br>So what do regulations and the UCMJ say about those orders? **They must<br>be lawful.** So if a president orders the military to do something<br>clearly unconstitutional, the military member is bound by regulation and<br>the UCMJ to refuse to follow that order. It really doesn't matter what<br>the order may be. If a superior orders someone to do something which<br>violates the Constitution, the member is duty-bound to refuse that<br>order.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
