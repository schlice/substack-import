<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Remember that we're answering this as a Christian. And as a Christian,<br>all abortion is wrong, regardless of the reason, because all life is<br>created by God. God knew you before you were even conceived. He knew<br>exactly what you would become. The Bible says that God formed you in the<br>womb, stitched together the very fibre of your being. Voluntarily taking<br>that life without justification violates the Sixth Commandment (you<br>shall not murder). The only time abortion is not wrong is to save the<br>mother's life. Other than that, abortion is morally wrong and violates<br>God's law.<br><br>What other crime allows you to kill the victim? I can't really think of<br>any. You do realize that the baby is an innocent victim, correct? Why<br>does it have to die? It's kinda illogical.<br><br>Legally speaking (not as a Christian), I can see that a rape is not<br>consensual, and therefore the woman did not consent to having her body<br>be used to grow a baby for nine months. In that limited circumstance, I<br>could see early-term abortion being permitted, even though I still<br>believe killing babies is wrong.<br><br>And that's about it for me. Late-term abortion should never be allowed.<br>Allow the baby to come to term and give it up for adoption. Abortions<br>out of nothing more than the mother's convenience should never be<br>allowed.<br><br>And why would abortion be allowed in the case of "stolen condom<br>self-impregnation?" The woman wants a baby so badly that they would be<br>willing to steal a condom and self-impregnate with its contents. I don't<br>think she'd *want* to terminate that pregnancy. The father might, but<br>she would likely not.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one. It's simply too contentious a topic,<br>and I don't really care to argue with pro-choice folks today.*<br><br>*If you don't like what I wrote, too bad, go kick rocks. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I'm wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is<br>a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply going<br>to comment to tell me "ackshually, you're wrong," then you're the reason<br>why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for everyone.*<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>As a Christian, is abortion wrong even if the foetus is conceived<br>involuntarily by a non-spouse such as rape or stolen condom<br>self-impregnation?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
