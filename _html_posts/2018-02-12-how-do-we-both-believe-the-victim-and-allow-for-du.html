<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do we both believe the victim and allow for due process when<br>someone is accused of abuse?**<br><br>FINALLY!!! Someone is asking the right questions!!! Well done [[David<br>Hinckley](https://www.quora.com/profile/David-Hinckley)]{.qlink_container}.<br>It's the right question because it's the one everyone is so confused<br>about. Let's try to cut through the confusion.<br><br>You're talking about two different things: believing the victim (or<br>showing that we believe the victim) and being able to prosecute a case.<br>One is a matter of belief, and the other is a matter of law. The reason<br>why there is so much confusion is because we are trying to blend the two<br>in some way, and we are failing miserably. We are telegraphing that we<br>"believe" the victim by destroying the life of the accused, and this is<br>a miscarriage of justice.<br><br>Before we get into the meat of the question, we need to discuss a legal<br>function called a statute of limitations. The statute of limitations<br>defines a timeframe after which charges for a certain crime cannot be<br>brought. The statute of limitations for crimes are different, and they<br>are different in each state as well. The statute of limitations exists<br>to protect the accused from bad prosecution, because over time, memories<br>fade, evidence degrades, and the possibility that the accused can get a<br>*fair trial* decreases. So when we pass the "point of no return" where<br>it becomes nearly impossible for the accused to get a fair trial, we cut<br>off the possibility of bringing charges.<br><br>We need to discuss one more point before we address the question: **the<br>truth.** Think of the truth as existing on a timeline. His story is on<br>one end, and her story is on the other end. The truth is somewhere in<br>between. It can be closer to one side than the other, but it is always<br>somewhere in between. Why can't one side be telling the complete truth?<br>Is this because everyone lies? Not at all. It's because everyone sees<br>the world differently. Everyone's perceptions are colored by their life<br>experiences. This is why two people can see the same incident and report<br>that they saw it happen differently. Especially when we miss seeing<br>things with clarity, our brains interpolate and fill in the blank spaces<br>in our recollection. When our brains do this, it is subconscious. We<br>don't know it's happening. We simply believe in the veracity of our<br>memories, even though they may not be exactly what happened; they may<br>have some pieces filled in by our brains. And when our brains<br>interpolate the spaces between our memories, they may not be accurate,<br>and what our brain adds to our memories is based on what we already<br>know, and that is where our life experiences come into play. So the<br>truth is always somewhere between the two stories. In law, we seek to<br>get as close to the truth as our limited memories allow us to do.<br>Evidence allows us to get closer than we've ever gotten before, and it<br>helps to support our fallible memories. But while we always seek the<br>truth, we actually are searching for what we can prove. And in court, we<br>try to prove guilt. In other words, *is it more likely than not that<br>this person did what they are accused of doing*. In criminal court, it's<br>guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and in civil court, it's liability<br>based on preponderance of evidence. *But it's not exact truth*.<br><br>Okay, so now back to the question. How can we believe the victim and<br>also allow for due process?<br><br>I think that in most cases, most victims are believable, and in most<br>cases, we do believe the victim. There are some accusers who were later<br>proven to have lied and made up their claims, but in most cases, I think<br>the victims are fairly believable.<br><br>What has happened in recent times is that victims of sexual abuse are<br>coming forward *decades* after their alleged abuse and are making<br>claims. Legally speaking, *nothing should happen in these cases.* Why?<br>In America, you are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. The<br>probability of getting a fair trial where guilt or liability can<br>reasonably be established, after so much time, is strikingly low. Does<br>this mean we don't *believe the victim*? Certainly not. We likely do<br>believe the victim believes that her account exactly explains what may<br>have happened. But because of all the reasons we've discussed, it<br>probably doesn't exactly describe exactly what happened. However, and<br>this part is critically important, **it matters not what we believe. It<br>only matters what we can prove.** And after so much time, we can't prove<br>much.<br><br>However, men's lives are being destroyed (they lose their jobs, their<br>homes, their marriages, their families) over mere *allegations* which<br>are unproven and the memories of which have likely degraded so badly<br>over time that they are unlikely to depict much of exactly what<br>happened.<br><br>So how do we merge believing the victim with **achieving due<br>process? *We separate belief from provability.***<br><br>Believe the victim. Believe that the victim endured *something* which<br>happened a long time ago (assuming that the victim is following the<br>current trend and is coming forward decades after an alleged abuse), and<br>support the victim. Ensure that the victim is cared for, physically and<br>psychologically. Understand that memories degrade over time, and that<br>what the victim remembers may not be an exact replica of what actually<br>happened, but believe that the victim endured *something* terrible, and<br>support that victim.<br><br>But (and here's the less-than-popular part), *don't expect that after<br>decades of silence, we can destroy the accused's life.* We shouldn't<br>expect his employer to fire him over an allegation. We shouldn't expect<br>a TV and movie actor to lose his role on a TV show because of an<br>allegation of abuse decades ago. We shouldn't expect a Congressman to<br>resign because of an allegation of abuse decades ago. And this is part<br>of societal expectations. If we expect these things to happen after an<br>allegation, they will. If we begin to expect that they should not, then<br>the trend will change.<br><br>So in my opinion, two things have to change.<br><br>1.  We the public have to stop believing that it is right that a man's<br>    life be destroyed over an allegation.<br>2.  We need to encourage victims to come forward *while we can do<br>    something about it*.<br><br>We should make sure that while we support the victims, we shouldn't<br>accept the current trend of destruction of the life and livelihood of<br>the accused so many years after the alleged abuse occurred. It is really<br>up to us to show businesses and industry and government that this<br>practice of retaliation against the accused, without so much as an<br>investigation, let alone a trial, is unacceptable. Before you reach for<br>the comment section to flame this, remember this is not an indictment of<br>the victim. But the victim *shares some responsibility* to bring the<br>allegation forward in a timely manner. We should be using this movement<br>to encourage victims to come forward while we can still prosecute a case<br>of sexual assault. In most states, the statute of limitations is only<br>two to three years for civil sexual assault. If you want to see<br>something done about these crimes, encourage victims to come forward<br>while we can prosecute the crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
