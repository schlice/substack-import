<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: yes it is.<br><br>Would it surprise you that the number of drug overdoses now outnumbers<br>the number of people killed by car crashes and gun homicides *combined*?<br><br>Would it surprise you to learn that 142 Americans die of drug overdoses,<br>every day?<br><br>Would it surprise you to learn that between 1999 and 2015, more than<br>560,000 people in this country died due to drug overdoses, a death toll<br>larger than the entire population of Atlanta?<br><br>Would it surprise you to know that the issue is not entirely related to<br>illegal drugs?<br><br>> *Since 1999, the number of opioid overdoses in America have quadrupled<br>> according to the CDC. Not coincidentally, in that same period, the<br>> amount of prescription opioids in America have quadrupled as well.<br>> This massive increase in prescribing has occurred despite the fact<br>> that there has not been an overall change in the amount of pain<br>> Americans have reported in that time period. We have an enormous<br>> problem that is often not beginning on street corners; it is starting<br>> in doctor's offices and hospitals in every state in our nation.*<br>> \[1\](#NgZpN){#cite-NgZpN .citation_link}<br><br>It probably would also surprise you that opioids are a prime contributor<br>to our addiction and overdose crisis.<br><br>- In 2015, nearly two-thirds of drug overdoses were linked to opioids<br>  like Percocet, OxyContin, heroin, and fentanyl, and **Americans<br>  consume more opioids than any other country in the world.**<br>- In that same year (2015), the amount of opioids prescribed in the U.S.<br>  was enough for every American to be medicated around the clock for<br>  three weeks.<br><br>It would probably also surprise you that of the 21 million people who<br>self-reported as having a substance use disorder, over 40% of them<br>*also* have a mental health disorder, **but less than half of them<br>receive treatment for either issue.** The reasons for these gaps include<br>shame and embarassment in seeking treatment, as well as lack of access<br>to care, and other reasons as well.<br><br>So yes, this most certainly qualifies as an epidemic. The moniker of<br>national emergency fits pretty well, as our current response to this<br>epidemic is nowhere near its actual magnitude.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-NgZpN){.citation_index}<br>[https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f1d346&url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/ondcp/commission-interim-report.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="whitehouse.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
