<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It would be nearly impossible to calculate.<br><br>For starters, many push ups take place at odd times and odd locations.<br>Basically, any time you are standing around waiting for something else<br>to happen, you will find yourself in the front leaning rest position.<br>Since those times are many and varied (you also become fully qualified<br>in "hurry up and wait,") calculating the number of push ups done would<br>be next to impossible.<br><br>Running is worse, since some people actually *enjoy* running. They<br>actually do it on their own! In truth, I used to be one of these truly<br>insane people.<br><br>I hesitate to even hazard a guess, mostly because I think it may scare<br>me.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
