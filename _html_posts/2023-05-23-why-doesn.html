<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, Quora has never concerned itself with "dealing with facts." In<br>fact, there are many spaces on this site which deal with things which<br>are objectively not facts.<br><br>Second, the implication in the question is that Christianity is<br>unsupported by facts.<br><br>I beg to differ.<br><br>The problems with the evolutionist's position are many. The universe is<br>not eternal, and so cannot be the First Cause. Before evolution can even<br>happen, you must start with an existing life. So which came first: the<br>first life, or evolution? DNA requires proteins for its formation, but<br>proteins are created using DNA; which came first? Even though the<br>evolutionist claims that random natural processes caused life to form<br>from existing chemicals, we cannot combine chemicals and create life.<br><br>Add to that the evidence that a creator god exists, including the fact<br>that natural processes have never been shown to create specified<br>complexity. Specified complexity is empirically detectable. When we<br>detect specified complexity (messages, like the message resident in DNA<br>for example), we know that it must come from an intelligent being<br>because all of our observational experience tells us that messages come<br>only from intelligent beings. Every time we observe a message, it comes<br>from an intelligent being. We couple this data with the fact that we<br>never observe natural laws creating messages, and we know an intelligent<br>being must be the cause. That's a valid scientific conclusion based on<br>observation and repetition. It's not an argument from ignorance, nor is<br>it based on any "gap" in our knowledge.<br><br>It's fact.<br><br>That some choose to ignore the facts to pursue their own dogma does not<br>change the facts.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
