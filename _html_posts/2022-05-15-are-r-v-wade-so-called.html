<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, nothing like that.<br><br>13 states composed "trigger laws," which are laws that would only go<br>into effect if *Roe* was overturned (that\'s the *trigger*). That\'s<br>literally the only unique thing about the laws. The laws vary in their<br>implementation. Some of the laws allow exceptions for rape and incest,<br>and some do not. Some of these trigger laws have been on the books for<br>years, simply waiting for the day that *Roe* would be overturned. Some<br>have just very recently been passed.<br><br>But make no mistake, **there is no law that would prevent a doctor from<br>saving a mother\'s life by taking the baby if it was medically<br>necessary.** None. Even if the law has no explicit exception for<br>abortion to save the life of the mother, a doctor can still do it. This<br>was never a question, even before *Roe* was decided. Abortion activists<br>try to muddy the water and claim that banning elective abortions would<br>somehow prevent a doctor from saving a woman\'s life. This has never<br>been the case in the United States. Yes, there are some obscure examples<br>from history in other countries where this may have happened, but not<br>here.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Are R v Wade so-called "trigger laws" outright bans on abortion, bans<br>that don't include exemptions for things like rape, incest, or even to<br>save the mother\'s life?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
