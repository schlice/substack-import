Most<br>times when this happens I don't even make it to bed; I fall asleep on<br>the couch right after dinner.<br><br>So no, my disability does not directly impact my legs. And if you<br>see me park in a handicapped spot and get out of my car, your first<br>thought might be, "Well, that guy looks perfectly healthy, why the heck<br>did he park there?"<br><br>Now you know.<br><br>Beware of hidden disabilities, and don't judge people before you are<br>fully informed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
