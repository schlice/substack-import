I\'m<br>turning myself in but what steps do I take before turning myself in?**<br><br>1.  Get a lawyer. If you don't already have one, now is the time. Don't<br>    wait until after you are arrested, because it will be much, much<br>    easier to do now. Pretty much all you'll need at this time is an<br>    attorney on retainer and a phone number to call should you need<br>    immediate assistance.<br>2.  Get prepared for incarceration, even though you should be granted<br>    bail on an assault 2. Make sure your home affairs are in order<br>3.  To that end, arrange for bail. If you don't have the cash available,<br>    visit the bail bondsman so you can be ready to post as soon as the<br>    judgement is handed down.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
