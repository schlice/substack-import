<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If your friend told you when they plan on committing suicide, you can<br>call 911 to report this attempt at self-harm. Understand what this will<br>do: your friend will be "arrested" for their own protection, and they<br>will be delivered to a hospital where they can be evaluated and can<br>hopefully get help. How that all happens and what the process looks like<br>will differ from state to state, but it will all take place looking<br>something like that.<br><br>Anyway, it doesn't hurt to call for help if you need it. If you believe<br>your friend was genuine with their statement, you really should call for<br>help.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can I call 911 for a suicidal friend who told me they are going to<br>attempt suicide?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
