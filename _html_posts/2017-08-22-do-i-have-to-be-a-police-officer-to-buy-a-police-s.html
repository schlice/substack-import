<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You may absolutely wear a police uniform and dress like a police<br>officer. You can buy police uniform shirts. There are some items that<br>are sold online which require your identification as an active police<br>officer. In that case, you need to provide the company documentation on<br>department letterhead indicating that you are an active officer in good<br>standing in their department before you can purchase any of those<br>restricted items. Basically, if you can't buy it, the company will tell<br>you. They won't sell you something you're not allowed to buy.<br><br>That said, you may not act in a way such as to make people think you are<br>a police officer, and you may not attempt to exercise any police<br>authority.<br><br>I do like [[Dave<br>Spinks](https://www.quora.com/profile/Dave-Spinks-2)]{.qlink_container}'<br>idea of adding a comedy element to your costume, such as a banana in the<br>holster, a paper badge, or something similar, so as to avoid any<br>confusion.<br><br>That said, in most jurisdictions, it is not required that you<br>distinguish your uniform appreciably from a police uniform; it is your<br>actions that determine whether or not you can be charged with<br>impersonating a peace officer.<br><br>As always, check your local laws, YMMV, and I am not a lawyer.<br><br>(Interestingly, we're getting a 5.11 retail store in northern Colorado<br>Springs, and I'm totally stoked)<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
