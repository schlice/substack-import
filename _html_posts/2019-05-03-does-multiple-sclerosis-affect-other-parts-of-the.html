The MS disease<br>process does not impact any other physical part of the body.<br><br>The *result* of that demyelination of nerves within the CNS can be<br>seen throughout the body, but the actual demyelination process only<br>affects the nerve cells of the CNS.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
