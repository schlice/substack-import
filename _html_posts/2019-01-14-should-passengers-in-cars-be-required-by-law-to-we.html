<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Should passengers in cars be required by law to wear seatbelts?<br><br>The answer is a solid "maybe."<br><br>In general, laws which protect you from yourself are bad laws. Seatbelt<br>laws do not make *me* safer from *your* stupidity. They make *you* safer<br>from *your* stupidity. And a law which does nothing but protect you from<br>you is a bad law. What public good does it advance to punish you for<br>being stupid? I know there is an incremental public burden when you<br>spend your time laid up in a hospital bed, but that belies our<br>pay-your-own-healthcare system in this country, and in most cases is<br>simply incorrect.<br><br>With all of that in mind, there is something to be said for not bouncing<br>around the inside of the cabin, distracting the driver further from<br>trying to control a car while in the middle of a crash, so I can't say<br>that no passenger should ever be forced by the state to wear a seatbelt.<br><br>Additionally, some parents are simply too stupid or uninformed to make<br>their children wear seatbelts, and since the state has a vested interest<br>in the wellbeing of children, forcing anyone under 18 in a car to wear a<br>seatbelt is also appropriate.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
