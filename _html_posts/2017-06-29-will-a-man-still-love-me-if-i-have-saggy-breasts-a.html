<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It saddens me that such a question exists.<br><br>Love is lots of things. Judgmental is not one of them.<br><br>> Love is patient, love is kind, love has no envy, love is not proud,<br>> love behaves, love is not selfish or easily provoked, love is not<br>> evil, love shares truth instead of spreading lies, love bears all,<br>> love believes all, love endures all, love is hope for all, love never<br>> fails.\[1\](#pmTxR){#cite-pmTxR .citation_link}<br><br>That passage is loosely translated from a particular religious book<br>which shall remain nameless, even though most people know what it is<br>(this particular interpretation of that passage is lyrics in a song).<br><br>When you find someone who loves you for *who you are* rather than for<br>*what you look like*, you know you found true love.<br><br>But you have to love yourself first, before you can handle what others<br>think of you. If you believe you have saggy breasts and loose skin,<br>others' reinforcement of that will not be beneficial to you. Love<br>yourself first, *then* you will be able to handle others' misguided<br>opinions about you.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-pmTxR){.citation_index} [[TAKE 6 - I L-o-v-e U<br>lyrics](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2680d6&url=https://www.directlyrics.com/take-6-i-love-u-lyrics.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="directlyrics.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
