<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I want to go to a military academy. What steps do I take to assure my<br>acceptance?**<br><br>Your appointment (not acceptance) to a military academy is never<br>"assured." It is entirely up to the Academy in question to accept you or<br>not.<br><br>The appointment process isn't much different than the acceptance process<br>at other colleges, other than the criteria for acceptance is much<br>stricter. In simple terms, you submit a package, and the Academy decides<br>whether or not they will accept you.<br><br>Of course, in order to attend, you must also be *nominated* by either a<br>Member of Congress or by the Vice President or the President. But you<br>didn't ask about nominations, you asked about acceptance, so I'll leave<br>nominations for another answer.<br><br>So, since you can never be "assured" of appointment, how can you put<br>your best package together? Here's a few pointers for putting the best<br>package possible in front of the admissions board. Note that a lot of<br>these pointers are what the Air Force Academy admissions board looks at<br>(I tend to know a little more about their process than the other service<br>academies), but a strong portfolio at USAFA will be a strong portfolio<br>at any of the service academies:<br><br>ACADEMICS:<br><br>- Take challenging classes. Special consideration is given to students<br>  who excel at honors and AP classes, and who have completed the<br>  International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme (DP).<br>  Dual-enrollment courses (in both high school and a local college) are<br>  also favorably considered.<br>- Achieve a high class rank. Note that in the most recent USAFA<br>  admissions statistics, 8% of admitted candidates were ranked first in<br>  their high school class. 52% were in the top ten percent, and 81% were<br>  in the top 25% of their class.<br>- Score well on standardized tests. While there are ranges where most<br>  candidates fall, suffice it to say that candidates who score below 580<br>  verbal and 560 math on the SAT Reasoning or below 24 English/reading<br>  and 25 math/science reasoning on the ACT normally will not be<br>  competitive for an appointment to USAFA. While the ranges are<br>  different for the other service academies, this level of academic<br>  performance is expected of candidates.<br><br>ATHLETICS:<br><br>- Remember that about 95% of accepted candidates participated in high<br>  school sports, and about 80% earned varsity letters. This means that<br>  the strongest candidates participated in team sports, and probably<br>  lettered in that sport.<br>- The academies aren't looking for *how many* sports you participated<br>  in. Instead, the academies are looking for *long-term* participation<br>  in a sport, and *advancement* in that sport, as well as some<br>  leadership position on that team, if such exists for your sport. For<br>  example, someone who plays football in the fall, basketball over the<br>  winter, and tennis in the spring, but never excelled in any one sport<br>  will be less of a strong athletic candidate behind someone who ran<br>  cross-country in the fall every year, worked his way up to varsity,<br>  was a demonstrated team leader, and eventually received the MVP his<br>  senior year. I'm not projecting, but maybe good examples do come from<br>  experience.<br><br>EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES:<br><br>- Similar to athletics, the academies are looking for demonstrated<br>  leadership in a few activities, rather than the total number of<br>  activities in which you participated. Here's some ideas from Air Force<br>  Academy admissions:<br>  - Church Organizations: Participate in leadership of church youth<br>    group.<br>  - Scouting: Join and excel in a scouting organization.<br>  - Public Speaking: Give speeches to local service clubs (Rotary,<br>    Lions, Kiwanis, etc.).<br>  - Music: Take lessons and give musical recitals in church or as a<br>    volunteer.<br>  - Community Service: Work or perform community service through<br>    church or community organizations\[1\](#MKPwn){#cite-MKPwn<br>    .citation_link}<br><br>These are some general pointers for putting the best package forward.<br>Good luck!<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-MKPwn){.citation_index} [[Home Schoolers \| Air Force<br>Academy](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=066b68&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/advice-to-applicants/home-schoolers/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
