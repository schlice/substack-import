<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is Donald Trump slowly turning into a dictator vowing to veto any<br>effort to block the national emergency he has called at the border?**<br><br>Is that true, or has Congress become the dictator, vowing to veto<br>anything that he does?<br><br>I'm not sure. But which political party has #RESIST as its motto?<br><br>Veto power is the President's alone. It's in the Constitution. He is<br>certainly free to use it. There are always political ramifications for<br>everything you do, but this is a no-brainer to him.<br><br>And in most cases, you can't "block a national emergency" through an act<br>of Congress. The National Emergencies Act says that every six months,<br>Congress can review the list of active national emergencies, and they<br>can end one by passing a joint resolution.<br><br>Congress isn't passing a joint resolution ending this national emergency<br>any time soon. Even if they do, Trump can still veto it. Congress would<br>still need a 2/3 majority in both houses to override it and end the<br>national emergency. That requires massive negative political capital<br>against the President, and it doesn't exist in either house.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
