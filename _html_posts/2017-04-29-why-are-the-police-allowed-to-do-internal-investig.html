<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Why are the police allowed to do internal investigations? Why would<br>> the police find other police officers at fault?*<br><br>**Because in this regard, the police are no different than any other<br>corporation or government agency.**<br><br>There are several different types of things a police officer can be<br>investigated for:<br><br>- Violations of department policy<br>- Misdemeanor or felony violations of law<br>- Violations of civil rights<br><br>Misdemeanor and felony violations are of course investigated by the<br>department, but they are *also* investigated by the District Attorney's<br>office. In this regard, police are subject to double investigations.<br>The police don't get to tell the District Attorney whether or not to<br>investigate; the DA will make that determination on his own. So it's not<br>like the police are involved in a shooting and claim that an<br>investigation took place and everything's good, and then no one else<br>looks at it. If there was a violation of law, the DA's office will<br>investigate, and the (elected) DA will be held to account if he does<br>not.<br><br>Violations of department policy are investigated by the department<br>itself. This is no different than any other corporation or government<br>agency, which manages violation of its own policies. If these violations<br>occurred, it could result in mandatory re-training,<br>decertification/recertification, or suspension/termination. Perhaps in a<br>civilian corporation, such violations would be investigated by an HR<br>department or a Legal department. In a police department, it is an<br>Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB) which investigates officers. Cases where<br>force is involved (which means anything from applying hands all the way<br>up to application of deadly force) is investigated by a Use of Force<br>(UOF) team, which includes command staff, the officer's direct chain of<br>command, HR, Legal, and Training (to determine if the officer was<br>following standards which were taught during training).<br><br>Violations of civil rights are investigated by the US Department of<br>Justice. Note that only police officers are subject to this type of<br>investigation; citizens are not normally independently investigated by<br>the USDOJ for civil rights violations.<br><br>Bottom line: a police department will investigate its own people for<br>violations of policy or law. Violations of law, however, are also<br>investigated by the District Attorney's office and potentially by the<br>Department of Justice. There is more oversight of police officers than<br>of any other government organization, including Congress.<br><br>Although, it does seem like the police are cleared of wrongdoing very<br>often, doesn't it? Like with all things related to the media, perception<br>does not make reality. With the very large number of investigations that<br>take place all the time, most of the time, you'll find that the police<br>were actually doing their jobs.<br><br>Let's put this into context. Let's say you produce 10 widgets a day at<br>your job. Let's say your employer launched an investigation into whether<br>or not you violated any company policies 10% of the time, so for every<br>10 widgets, you were investigated one time. I bet that for the vast<br>majority of the time, you would be found to be fully compliant with all<br>company policies. I'd also bet that after a while, you'd get tired of<br>hearing just how much you were in compliance with all company policies,<br>and it would seem like no one ever does anything wrong at that place.<br><br>This is exactly what happens with police.<br><br>Because departments are hyper-sensitive about public perception, they<br>investigate far more officer actions than is required, and the vast<br>majority of the time, the officer is found to be in compliance with<br>department policy, and no further action is needed. While this is<br>expected, it does leave the impression that when officers are<br>investigated, they are cleared because it happens so often.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
