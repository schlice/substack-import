<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Which NRA members on Quora would agree that 18-year-old Black Lives<br>Matter activists with AR-15s would constitute a \"well-regulated<br>militia\" deserving of Second Amendment protections?**<br><br>Again, that whole "well-regulated militia" clause is confusing people.<br><br>Please, please, please, take the time to read *DC v. Heller*  **so<br>you can understand who is allowed to own a gun and under what<br>circumstances**.<br><br>*Heller,* along with *MacDonald v. Chicago,* incorporated the 2nd<br>Amendment to the states. It basically said that gun ownership is an<br>individual right, not contingent on military service. If you are a<br>citizen of the United States, you have that right. Period, end of story.<br>You don't have to *do* anything to get the right. You don't have to be<br>part of any group to get the right. Just as you don't have to *do*<br>anything to get the right to free speech, you don't have to *do*<br>anything to get the right to keep and bear arms.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
