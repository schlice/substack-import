<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Most knowledge we possess is gained through induction. Induction is<br>the process by which we take specific observations and use them to come<br>up with a general conclusion. We all do this, every single day. For<br>example, you go to sit in a chair. Will that chair hold your weight? You<br>don't know, but you have some specific observations:<br><br>- The screws all seem to be in place.<br>- The chair appears to be sturdy.<br>- Historically, chairs designed with this material in this configuration<br>  have held your weight.<br><br>So while you can never know with 100% certainty whether or not that<br>chair will hold your weight, you can know *beyond a reasonable doubt*<br>(not beyond all doubt) that the chair will hold your weight when you sit<br>in it, and you rely on that knowledge.<br><br>*But you can't be 100% sure! How can you sit in the chair without being<br>100% sure?*<br><br>Faith.<br><br>You have faith that the knowledge you do have indicates the general<br>conclusion that the chair is safe to sit in. **Faith bridges the gap<br>between the undeniable and the unknowable.**<br><br>The exception to the induction rule is called the *perfect induction*<br>and it happens when all possible specific observations are known. For<br>example, I can say "My right hand contains nothing but pennies." You can<br>examine all the coins in my right hand and you can make the general<br>conclusion that the knowledge gained through induction is 100% true. So<br>there is one time where you can say that something is true beyond *all*<br>doubt.<br><br>However, in the vast majority of cases, knowledge gained through<br>induction is never 100% true beyond *all* doubt.<br><br>\<br><br>The case of the existence of God follows the same rules of inductive<br>reasoning. It is true beyond reasonable doubt, but not beyond all doubt.<br>We can never know with 100% certainty that God exists, because we cannot<br>know all the answers to make a 100% certain conclusion. Some things we<br>will never know while we are alive on this earth. No one observed the<br>Big Bang. No one saw what existed before the Big Bang. No one has the<br>ability to traverse past the end of the universe. There are certain<br>pieces of information we will never be able to access.<br><br>Therefore, we can never, while we are alive, know with 100% certainty if<br>God exists. We can only say that with the rational and logical evidence<br>we do have, we are certain *beyond a reasonable doubt*, but not beyond<br>all doubt.<br><br>There is abundant evidence to show that God exists, but it's not direct<br>evidence of God Himself. For example, the scientific evidence<br>overwhelmingly confirms that the universe exploded into being out of<br>nothing. Either someone created something out of nothing (the theistic<br>view), or no one created something out of nothing (the atheistic view).<br>Which view is more reasonable? The theistic view. Which view requires<br>more faith? The atheistic view.<br><br>Also, the simplest life form contains the information-equivalent of<br>1,000 encyclopedias. Theists believe only an intelligent being can<br>create a life form containing the equivalent of 1,000 encyclopedias.<br>Atheists believe non-intelligent natural forces can do it. Theists have<br>evidence to support their conclusion (scientific evidence based on<br>observation and repetition). Since atheists don't have any such<br>evidence, their belief requires a lot more faith.<br><br>So not only does the belief in the existence of God have evidence, the<br>belief that God does not exist requires a lot more faith.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
