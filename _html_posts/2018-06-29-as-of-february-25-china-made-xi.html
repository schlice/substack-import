<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**As of February 25, China made Xi 'President for Life'. Could<br>two-thirds of Congress extend the same courtesy to Trump?**<br><br>No.<br><br>The 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution limits the United States<br>president to two terms.<br><br>There is a Constitutionally-mandated procedure for repealing and<br>replacing an Amendment, and that is to pass a new Amendment.<br><br>The only thing that 2/3 of Congress can do is to pass a Bill of<br>Amendment to repeal the 22nd Amendment and allow Congress to appoint a<br>president for life.<br><br>However, this amendment must then be *ratified* by 3/4th of the<br>states before it becomes law, so you still need 38 separate states to<br>ratify the amendment.<br><br>So if 2/3 of Congress *AND* 3/4 of the states all want Trump to be<br>president for life, they can indeed pass the appropriate Constitutional<br>amendment to make it so. But 2/3 of Congress alone won't make it happen.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
