But not<br>> everyone instinctively knows that orange and blue is a perfect<br>> combination. If you can\'t trust your own judgement, understand and<br>> rely on the basics of color theory to always pick the right colors.<br>><br>> Learn the Color Wheel<br>><br>> :::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>> ::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>> !(images/qimg-0effd866b38de090a01cbc306aa73505){.landscape<br>> .qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>> master_src="images/qimg-0effd866b38de090a01cbc306aa73505"<br>> master_w="1600" master_h="919"}<br>> :::<br>> ::::<br>><br>> This is the basic color wheel and it will guide you in making color<br>> choices. You\'ve probably seen it in school, but here\'s a quick<br>> refresher just in case you\'ve forgotten.<br>><br>> Red, blue and yellow are primary colors. When you mix red and yellow,<br>> you get orange; mix blue and yellow, you get green; mix red and blue,<br>> you get violet. Orange, green and violet are hence called secondary<br>> colors. Tertiary colors like red-violet and blue-violet are derived by<br>> mixing a primary color with a secondary color.<br>><br>> All colors have tints and shades. A tint is the variation of that<br>> color when mixed with white; a shade is the variation of that color<br>> when mixed with black. But generally, you [[don\'t need to worry about<br>> tints and<br>> shades](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2c4095&url=http://www.color-wheel-pro.com/color-theory-basics.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="color-wheel-pro.com"}]{.qlink_container} for basic color<br>> schemes, says Color Wheel Pro:<br>><br>> "According to color theory, harmonious color combinations use any two<br>> colors opposite each other on the color wheel, any three colors<br>> equally spaced around the color wheel forming a triangle, or any four<br>> colors forming a rectangle (actually, two pairs of colors opposite<br>> each other). The harmonious color combinations are called color<br>> schemes -- sometimes the term \'color harmonies\' is also used. Color<br>> schemes remain harmonious regardless of the rotation<br>> angle."\[1\](#ojnOo){#cite-ojnOo .citation_link}<br><br>So according to this, pink (a tint of red) and peach (a tint of orange)<br>are on the same side of the color wheel, and so are not complementary<br>colors.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ojnOo){.citation_index} [[Learn the Basics of Color Theory<br>to Know What Looks<br>Good](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=10ad7a&url=https://lifehacker.com/learn-the-basics-of-color-theory-to-know-what-looks-goo-1608972072){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="lifehacker.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
