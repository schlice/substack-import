<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I have to agree with the other posters, you can\'t make a<br>left at any red light (unless you\'re on a one-way street turning left<br>onto another one-way street, but there are still seven states that<br>don\'t allow this), be it a red ball or a red arrow. So yes, you can get<br>a ticket even though the light is incorrect.\<br>\<br>It\'s unlikely that because the light is incorrect that you\'d get a<br>ticket for going \*straight\*.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
