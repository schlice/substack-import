<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If I unroot my phone will it be just as I bought it from the store?<br><br>That depends on the phone, but in most cases, yes it will. There are two<br>notable exceptions: manufacturer\'s warranty, and Samsung.<br><br>First, rooting your phone voids the manufacturer\'s warranty. If the<br>manufacturer has built a mechanism into the phone which allows them to<br>see whether or not you ever modified the boot loader, they can deny you<br>coverage under their standard 1 year hardware warranty. To that end,<br>never root a phone which is still under warranty.<br><br>Second, Samsung uses an *e-fuse* to indicate whether or not a custom<br>boot loader has ever been installed. The e-fuse is used by Samsung\'s<br>KNOX security software to create encrypted partitions within which<br>credit card information and other protected information is kept. The<br>presence of an intact e-fuse is required for KNOX to run. Installing a<br>custom boot loader, or modifying the existing boot loader,<br>permanently trips the e-fuse. Along with voiding the warranty, KNOX<br>software will never run again on that device, so you will never be able<br>to use some software like Samsung Pay, or other software which relies on<br>KNOX encryption.<br><br>Beyond those two examples, if you do install a custom OS or root your<br>device, in most other cases, restoring the factory image returns the<br>phone to the condition it was in before you rooted.<br><br>This, however, is no guarantee. Never root a phone that is still under<br>warranty, and never bank on the fact that you\'ll get your phone back to<br>its original condition after you unroot.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
