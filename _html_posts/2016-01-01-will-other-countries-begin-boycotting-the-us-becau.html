<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I\'m not sure what you mean by \"lack of gun control measures.\"<br><br>Ask people in New York, Chicago, or Los Angeles whether or not there is<br>a \"lack of gun control measures\" and they will probably look at you as<br>if you have three heads.<br><br>My guess is what you really mean when you say \"lack of gun control<br>measures\" is \"why haven\'t you outlawed guns yet.\"<br><br>Besides the fact that it would be exceedingly difficult (although not<br>impossible) to do so, if we boycotted every country who had policies<br>with which we disagreed, there would be a scant few countries with which<br>we would actually trade.<br><br>Economics is not morality-based. You don\'t stop doing business with<br>someone because you don\'t like the way they live. You can impose<br>economic sanctions against a nation who is violating international<br>treaty or has been shown to be inhumane to its own people, but to be<br>frank, we are the world\'s superpower. It does little for a nation to<br>stop trading with us because they don\'t like our policies. It doesn\'t<br>hurt us, it only hurts the smaller nation who ceases trading with us.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
