<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This question is way too broad to be able to answer with any level of<br>usefulness.<br><br>Are there violent agitators or paid Democrat full-time protesters mixed<br>in with the peaceful protesters causing trouble? If you are at a protest<br>and you are peaceful, you have no intention of causing harm, and<br>violence breaks out, I suggest you get the heck out of there. Police<br>will use crowd control to quell the violence, and you could<br>inadvertently be caught up in that. There is no law which says that if<br>there are peaceful protesters in a crowd which becomes violent that<br>crowd control measures cannot be deployed.<br><br>In other words, don't associate with violent agitators. If they are<br>there, you should not be there.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
