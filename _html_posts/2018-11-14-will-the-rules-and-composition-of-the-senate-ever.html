<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will the rules and composition of the Senate ever change to be more<br>representative of the population?**<br><br>No, and they should not.<br><br>This really goes back to the original reason we have a bicameral<br>legislature in the first place, what they were designed to do, and the<br>17th Amendment.<br><br>We have a bicameral (two house) legislature in America because of that<br>age-old argument between the large states and the small states,<br>resulting in "The Great Compromise," and our two-house legislature of<br>today.<br><br>Consider this:<br><br>> The Constitutional Convention included delegates from twelve of the<br>> original thirteen states. (Rhode Island boycotted the whole thing.)<br>> Those delegates came from small states and large states. The small<br>> states, afraid of losing influence in the new government, demanded<br>> that representation in Congress be awarded on an equal basis to all<br>> states, no matter how large or small. But the large states insisted,<br>> no less forcefully, that representation should be based on population;<br>> since larger states had more voters, they ought to have more votes in<br>> Congress, too. This fierce dispute over representation dragged on<br>> throughout the summer of 1787, threatening to derail the entire<br>> Constitutional Convention. But a bicameral legislature provided the<br>> perfect opportunity for compromise---in fact, for \"The Great<br>> Compromise.\" Small states got their equal representation in the<br>> Senate, large states got their proportional representation in the<br>> House, and everyone went home happy.<br>><br>> But was \"The Great Compromise\" really so great? If the first<br>> principle of democracy is \"one person, one vote,\" then how<br>> democratic is the United States Senate? Today, the largest state<br>> (California, home to more than 36.5 million people) has a population<br>> about 73 times larger than the smallest state (Wyoming, home to just<br>> over 500,000). But the two states\' representation in the Senate is<br>> equal---two seats each. That arguably means that an individual voter<br>> from Wyoming is worth 73 times as much as any one Californian. Is that<br>> fair? Is that democratic? (Your answer to that question will probably<br>> depend on whether you live in Cheyenne or San Francisco.) On the one<br>> hand, the current system does ensure that places like Wyoming aren\'t<br>> entirely ignored in our national politics. On the other hand, it<br>> hardly seems fair to deny Californians (and Texans, New Yorkers, and<br>> residents of other large states) the right to \"one person, one<br>> vote.\"<br>><br>> Whatever you think about the justice of equal representation in the<br>> Senate, the system is here to stay. Article V of the Constitution<br>> guarantees that no state can ever be stripped of its equal<br>> representation in the Senate without giving its consent\...and Wyoming<br>> is no more likely to agree to that now than the small states were back<br>> in 1787. \[1\](#HEYtc){#cite-HEYtc .citation_link}<br><br>I was considering going into a diatribe about how the 17th Amendment<br>should be repealed, but I think that what I've given you so far is<br>enough for now. In short, each state gets equal representation in the<br>Senate. Each state gets representation based on its size and population<br>in the House.<br><br>And that's never going to change.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-HEYtc){.citation_index} [[Bicameral Structure of<br>Congress](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6b93e0&url=https://www.shmoop.com/legislative-branch/bicameral-congress.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="shmoop.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
