<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The good news is that you get to determine who is on your MS treatment<br>team. You'll want a *holistic* team, but how you structure your team is<br>totally up to you.<br><br>Your team begins with your primary care physician. They may not be a<br>specialist, but they need to be fully up to speed on the fact that you<br>are dealing with a lifelong chronic illness, for which you will be<br>taking possibly dangerous medication, and for which you will be<br>experiencing lovely side effects, which they may see reflected in your<br>blood work and your physical signs and symptoms.<br><br>Next on your team is your neurologist. At a bare minimum, your care<br>team should consist of these two doctors. Your neurologist focuses on<br>your MS. They monitor your disease progression using diagnostic testing<br>and tools (MRI, neurological physical exams, other diagnostic tools) and<br>prescribe disease modifying therapies (DMTs) to slow down the<br>progression of your MS and lessen the severity of your relapses. By the<br>way, all of the DMTs do this. They also help you manage any side effects<br>using medication-based and other therapies to lessen their effects.<br><br>Also, it'd be really great if your PCP and your neuro get in touch with<br>each other and maintain open communications about your care. While it's<br>not technically required, it can definitely benefit you.<br><br>The remainder of your care team is really dependent on your specific<br>circumstances, as everyone's MS is different.<br><br>- You may have specialist doctors who can help you with specific MS<br>  symptoms. I, for example, have a urologist and a<br>  neuro-ophthalmologist on my care team as I have both urinary and<br>  vision issues related to my MS. You may also have a psychiatrist<br>  on your care team to deal with cognitive issues, and possibly<br>  depression (I did).<br>- You may have other healthcare providers who are not MDs to assist<br>  you further, depending on your specific needs. You may have a<br>  nutritionist on your team to help you with dietary needs. You may<br>  have a physical therapist to help you with strengthening exercises<br>  if you experience weakness. You may have holistic providers and<br>  Eastern medicine providers if you choose. You may have providers who<br>  specialize in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) if you<br>  so choose. I used acupuncture, deep tissue massage, neuromuscular<br>  therapy (NMT), and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) as part of my<br>  therapy.<br><br>Ultimately, the size and membership of your care team is entirely up to<br>you.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
