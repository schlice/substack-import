<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I disagree with some of the other answerers on the ease at which you can<br>"stumble" onto a true child pornography site. Those sites are not part<br>of the surface web; i.e. the 4% of the Internet indexed by Google:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-6e0714e86d18c9408d3b1e8f3a8b6f28){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-6e0714e86d18c9408d3b1e8f3a8b6f28" master_w="600"<br>master_h="540"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(Image courtesy* [[*Elixir Of<br>Knowledge*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fbfee2&url=http://www.elixirofknowledge.com/search/label/Dark%2520Web){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="elixirofknowledge.com"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br>True child porn sites are hosted in the dark web. The web servers are<br>part of the Tor network, and are only accessible through specific<br>pathways. One example would be ".onion" links which will only open in a<br>Tor Browser; you simply cannot open them in vanilla Firefox or Chrome or<br>(ugh) Internet Explorer. They are not indexed by Google, nor are they<br>linked to surface web sites.<br><br>The main way by which you can accidentally stumble on to deep web kiddie<br>porn sites (not dark web sites) is when you're already surfing porn.<br>Some kiddie porn site operators will leave their teaser information in<br>the public porn ad networks. They will leave a teaser photo or video to<br>entice you to go to their sites. So if you're already surfing porn, you<br>get into the porn ad networks and you start clicking around, you might<br>"stumble" onto a kiddie porn site. If this happens, follow all of the<br>instructions the other answerers gave (collect WHOIS data, disconnect<br>your computer from the Internet, run a full virus scan, run a full<br>malware scan, etc).<br><br>Beyond that, you really have to be searching for true kiddie porn sites<br>to find them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
