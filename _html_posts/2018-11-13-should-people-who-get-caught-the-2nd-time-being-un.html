There's a [[pretty good<br>website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=262c2e&url=https://www.dui-usa.drinkdriving.org/dui_dwi_state_laws.php){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="drinkdriving.org"}]{.qlink_container} which summarizes all<br>the penalties, by state, for DUI charges. There's also fines and jail<br>time, which similarly all vary by state.<br><br>If states think it's a problem, states can crack down harder. Even in<br>Nanny-State New York, you have to hit your fifth DWI before your license<br>is permanently revoked. California's rules are surprisingly lighter than<br>New York's, with only the fourth and subsequent DUIs even being<br>felonies, but if you get three or more DUIs within 10 years, you're<br>eligible for a 10 year revocation.<br><br>Ultimately though, if states think DUI is a problem, states can change<br>the penalties.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
