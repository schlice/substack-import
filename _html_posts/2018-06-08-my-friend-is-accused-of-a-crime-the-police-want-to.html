<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My friend is accused of a crime. The police want to interview me, they<br>say I don't need an attorney? What should I do?**<br><br>Here's the problem.<br><br>If you knew something about what your friend did, would you willingly<br>hand that information over? Would you willingly screw your friend over?<br><br>Now ask yourself: do you think it's a fair bet that the police know<br>this?<br><br>Therefore, why exactly would they believe in their wildest dreams that<br>you'd walk into that police station and willingly hand your friend over<br>to them on a silver platter? Even bad friends aren't that awful. Well,<br>maybe some are, but most aren't.<br><br>*Isn't it more likely that they actually do have something on you? And<br>they plan on using it against you when you arrive? And they want to<br>elicit a confession from you implicating your friend without the messy<br>involvement of lawyers and such?*<br><br>Don't go in there without a lawyer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
