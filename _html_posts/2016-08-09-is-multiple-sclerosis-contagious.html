<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, you cannot \"catch\" MS.<br><br>While we don't know exactly what causes MS, we do know that it is an<br>autoimmune disease which causes the immune system to attack normal,<br>healthy body cells. Specifically, MS causes the immune system to attack<br>the myelin sheaths surrounding nerve fibers in the central nervous<br>system (brain and spinal cord). What is left in their place are plaques,<br>or "scars." This is why it's called "multiple sclerosis," or "many<br>scars." Think insulation on electrical wires. When nerve signals pass<br>through these areas of "demyelination," they slow down, causing the<br>signal that reaches the muscle to be different than when it left the<br>brain.<br><br>[[What is MS? National MS Society<br>Video](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5602a0&url=https://www.facebook.com/nationalmssociety/videos/10153526398249315/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="facebook.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>There are certain risk factors for MS. These risk factors include sex,<br>family history, ethnicity, geography of birth and childhood, and<br>exposure to an as-of-yet unidentified infectious trigger.<br><br>SEX: Females are two to three times more likely to develop MS than<br>males. Scientists believe that one\'s tendency to develop MS therefore<br>has some hormonal connection.<br><br>FAMILY HISTORY: Statistics show that the chance of the average<br>person in the United States developing MS is about 1 in 750. But close<br>(first-degree) relatives of people with MS, such as children, siblings<br>or non-identical twins, have a higher chance, anywhere from one in 100<br>to one in 40. It\'s not all genetic, though, and you can see this<br>through the \"identical twin\" example. If one identical twin has MS,<br>the other twin (who has the identical gene structure as the twin) has<br>only a 1 in 4 chance of developing MS. If it were all genetic, the<br>unaffected twin would have a 100% chance of developing MS instead of the<br>25% chance they exhibit today.<br><br>ETHNICITY: MS is more common among Caucasians (particularly those of<br>northern European ancestry) than other ethnic groups, and is almost<br>unheard of in some populations, such as Inuit, Yakutes, Hutterites,<br>Hungarian Romani, Norwegian Lapps, Australian Aborigines, and New<br>Zealand Maoris.<br><br>GEOGRAPHY: MS occurs with greatest frequency in higher latitudes<br>(above 40Â° latitude) away from the equator, than in lower latitudes,<br>closer to the equator. This may have something to do with vitamin D<br>production in the skin, and the vitamin\'s prophylactic effect on the<br>development of MS. The exact details about vitamin D\'s involvement with<br>the prevention of MS, however, is still unclear. Moving from one<br>geographic area to another seems to alter a person\'s risk of developing<br>MS. Studies show that families and their children will assume the new<br>risk level (higher or lower) of the area to which they move. Those who<br>move before the age of 15 generally take on the new risk themselves.<br>Those who move after the age of 15 may not see the new risk appear until<br>the next generation.<br><br>INFECTIOUS TRIGGER: Scientists have been searching for years for an<br>infectious agent that might trigger MS. While many different viruses<br>have been suggested, including rabies, herpes simplex virus, measles,<br>corona virus, canine distemper virus, HTLV-1, Epstein-Barr virus, among<br>others, none has yet been confirmed. Chlamydia pneumoniae, a bacteria<br>which 90% of the population has been exposed to over their lifetime, has<br>also been suggested but never proven. Although no trigger has yet been<br>identified, most MS experts believe that some infectious agent is<br>involved in initiating the disease process.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
