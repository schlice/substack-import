<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can the U.S. make progress on gun laws that might satisfy both<br>sides of the aisle?**<br><br>Perhaps you are unaware of what makes a good compromise. A good<br>compromise is when both sides are *not* perfectly satisfied. If one<br>side is satisfied and the other is not, this is not compromise. It's<br>like the old saying, "Sure we have compromise in our marriage. She gets<br>what she wants, and I compromise."<br><br>In order to truly compromise, I have to give something that I don't want<br>to give, and you have to give something you don't want to give. Only<br>then have we reached a compromise.<br><br>Tell me: *what has the gun control crowd offered to give in exchange for<br>banning a particular kind of gun?*<br><br>This doesn't sound very much like compromise to me. One side demands<br>concessions from the other side, and offers nothing in return. Not even<br>empty platitudes. The gun controllers use leftist tactics to vilify<br>their opponents by calling them baby killers and insane gun nuts who<br>care more about their precious toys than the lives of our nation's<br>children. Emotional pleadings with no basis in reality is the only thing<br>they offer.<br><br>Will they offer national concealed carry legislation, or reciprocity?\<br>Will they offer re-classifying suppressors?\<br>Will they offer rolling back ineffective legislation like waiting<br>periods?\<br>Will they offer allowing new automatic rifles to be added to the<br>registry?<br><br>Until they come to the table with *something, anything*, then it's<br>abundantly clear that they're not really interested in compromise.<br>They're really only interested in control. And the gun rights<br>advocates will dig in their heels, bolstered by the fact that the Second<br>Amendment still exists, and we will never make any progress at all.<br><br>Therefore, **the only way that we will make progress on gun laws that<br>satisfy both sides of the aisle is when both sides of the aisle truly<br>give up something they want in exchange. *That's what compromise<br>looks like.***<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
