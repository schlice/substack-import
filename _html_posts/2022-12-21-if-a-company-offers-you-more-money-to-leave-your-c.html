<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends." And note that<br>this is an answer exclusive to labor laws in the United States; other<br>countries may be different.<br><br>In this case, it depends on whether or not you are an "at-will"<br>employee, or a "contract" employee.<br><br>A "contract employee" has signed an employment contract which specifies<br>things like the term of employment, the reimbursement rate, and how<br>employment will be terminated. If you are a contract employee, you must<br>follow your contract's rules about how to sever your employment. If your<br>contract requires a certain timeframe between notification of<br>termination and actual work end date, you must follow that, or you could<br>be in breach of contract.<br><br>For everyone else, most states follow the "at-will employment" model.<br>Both the employer and the employee can terminate the working<br>relationship at any time for any reason, or no reason at all, with the<br>exception of the fact that employers cannot terminate employees for<br>legally-restricted reasons (age, sex, religion, country of national<br>origin, color, etc). If you are an at-will employee, you technically do<br>not legally need to inform your employer of your desire to terminate the<br>employment relationship until you are walking out the door. All things<br>considered, you probably should give them some heads-up. Traditionally,<br>employees would provide "two week's notice" before leaving in order to<br>give the employer an opportunity to have you train someone else in your<br>job, or to find a replacement, but today that is just a formality. It is<br>not legally required to give two week's notice before you leave. You can<br>literally stand up and say, "I quit," drop your company-owned equipment<br>on the desk, and walk out.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
