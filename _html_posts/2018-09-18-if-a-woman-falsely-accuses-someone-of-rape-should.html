<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a woman falsely accuses someone of rape should there be strong<br>punishment if she really believes her version of history?**<br><br>The problem is your word choice. "Falsely" simply implies that she is<br>wrong.<br><br>She could be wrong because she has faulty memory (but she strongly<br>believes that what she remembers is the truth). Or, she could be wrong<br>because she is *deliberately* speaking untruths in order to harm her<br>alleged offender.<br><br>In the first case, she should not be punished.<br><br>In the second case, she *should* be punished (strongly, as you<br>worded it), since in today's society, the accusation carries far more<br>weight than the actual factual findings in a legal sense. Therefore,<br>accusations should never be made lightly, and they should **absolutely<br>never** be made maliciously, or with deliberate lies.<br><br>Deliberately lying about sexual assault *should* be a criminal charge,<br>not just what the civil slander laws (and its attendant penalties) can<br>recover.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
