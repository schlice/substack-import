<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Your question is too broad.<br><br>- Do you want schools to educate parents how to safely store firearms?<br>- Are you asking about "guns in schools" and how the school will keep<br>  the guns away from the children?<br>- Are you asking about how parents and teachers can teach children to<br>  stay away from firearms?<br><br>Each one of those questions has a completely different answer, but since<br>your question was far too broad and not nearly detailed enough, I'm not<br>sure what you are asking.<br><br>Please try asking again, and this time, please be more specific with<br>what you want to know.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
