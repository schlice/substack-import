<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Oh yes, every time. It's like American Express: "Don't Leave Home<br>Without It."<br><br>- It doesn't make the firearm any less safe. Most modern firearms have<br>  several internal safeties which prevent the gun from firing unless you<br>  pull the trigger. Our instructor in the military told us we could<br>  hammer nails with the back of the gun and it wouldn't fire. I wasn't<br>  about to test the theory, but I see where he's coming from.<br>- When you need that firearm, you need it *yesterday.* You have zero<br>  time to waste on anything, including chambering a round.<br>- When you draw your firearm, it's because you intend on using it. You<br>  don't draw it to play with it. You don't draw it to threaten someone.<br>  You draw it because you are planning on shooting someone. As in the<br>  previous bullet, you have zero time to waste on anything, because<br>  fractions of seconds count.<br>- Also, it means you can carry one more round of ammunition. That's why<br>  you'll sometimes hear that a firearm can carry "X+1" rounds, which<br>  means the capacity of the magazine, plus one round in the chamber.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
