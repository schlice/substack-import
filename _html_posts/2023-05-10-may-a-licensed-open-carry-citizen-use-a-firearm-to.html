<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, we must start with this: If you carry a firearm, you<br>*must* **know the laws in your area surrounding when you may use<br>your firearm.** This is an absolute must. Do not pass GO, do not collect<br>\$200, until you know the law in your area. Full stop.<br><br>That said, in general, your personal carry firearm is for your personal<br>protection. You use it when you feel you are in danger of ***losing your<br>life* or suffering *grave bodily harm***. This includes<br>kidnapping and rape as those imply a risk of death or grave<br>bodily harm. Defense of others falls under the heading of self-defense,<br>so you can defend someone from a kidnapping, a rape, or a murder<br>attempt.<br><br>In about half of US states, you can use deadly force to prevent<br>robbery (forcible theft from your person). And in some states, you<br>can use it to prevent arson (even arson that doesn\'t threaten death<br>or serious bodily injury, such as arson of some outbuilding) or<br>burglary of your home or possibly even your business or workplace.<br><br>\<br><br>*BEYOND THAT*, you may not use your firearm. You're not a police<br>officer. Your gun is to protect you from death, not to prevent crime. If<br>you draw your firearm when you see a law infraction or a misdemeanor,<br>you will be arrested and charged with any number of crimes: brandishing<br>a firearm, assault with a deadly weapon, false arrest, kidnapping, and<br>more.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
