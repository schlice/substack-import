The question<br>becomes whether or not you might succeed in your suit.<br><br>You can sue a school district for emotional distress. You can sue if the<br>school district was responsible for victimizing students or staff. You<br>can also sue if the school district was at fault or did nothing to<br>prevent emotional and physical injuries.<br><br>In most states, you can file a lawsuit against a private school within<br>two years from the injury\'s date. You can file a lawsuit against a<br>public school within three years.<br><br>Check with a personal injury attorney in your area to assess your<br>situation to see if you qualify for emotional distress compensation.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
