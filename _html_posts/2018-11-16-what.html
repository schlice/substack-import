<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What\'s your opinion on the news that judge ruled in favour of CNN in<br>initial proceeding and White House must restore Jim Acosta press pass<br>immediately?**<br><br>First of all, it's a temporary restraining order. There is no ruling.<br><br>Second, it's an order on *5th Amendment* grounds, not 1st Amendment. The<br>order states that Acosta was not granted his due process rights under<br>the 5th Amendment when his hard pass was revoked, so he can<br>*temporarily* have it back until the case is heard.<br><br>Finally, I think that much is correct. If you have a 5th Amendment right<br>to due process before the White House revokes your press pass, then he<br>should have it back until he has due process to argue his case.<br><br>Hopefully they just don't call on him during the briefings. I'm pretty<br>sure there's no Constitutional amendment that requires you to be called<br>on in a press briefing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
