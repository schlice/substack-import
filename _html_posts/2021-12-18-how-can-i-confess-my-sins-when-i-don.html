I was living in a state in which<br>I didn't know what I was doing was sinful, and depending on my frame of<br>mind at the time, I probably didn't care either.<br><br>What I *do* feel bad for is that I wasted so much time in my life, when<br>I could have been praising God and living in the way he wanted me to<br>live, rather than living in my own delusions, thinking that I was more<br>than I was, better than what I was, living in a "holier-than-thou"<br>mindset. I shudder when I look back at *how I was living*.<br><br>I don't feel bad about my sins, but I do feel bad for living like they<br>didn't matter.<br><br>In either case, God doesn't want you to feel bad for either your sin or<br>the way you lived.<br><br>Jesus died once, for all.<br><br>Accept Jesus now, and bygones become bygones. Jesus' blood washes us<br>clean. From here on out, we will be judged as brothers, as followers,<br>not as unbelievers.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How can I confess my sins when I don't feel bad for my sins (sins in the<br>past I forgot about and sins in the present and future)?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
