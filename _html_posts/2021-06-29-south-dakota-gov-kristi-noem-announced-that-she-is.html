<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Her *motivation* may be political, considering she is a politician.<br>Everything she does is seen through a political lens.<br><br>But she isn't just sending law enforcement officers to the southern<br>border for her own benefit. She's doing so *because they asked for<br>help.*<br><br>Texas and Arizona sent requests for help under a mutual law enforcement<br>support agreement between the states, and South Dakota is sending<br>National Guard troops to help. Florida said about a week ago that it was<br>sending 50 law enforcement officers to Texas and Arizona to help as<br>well.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem announced that she is sending law<br>enforcement officers to the U.S. border with Mexico. Is this simply a<br>political move to support and highlight Trump\'s plan to visit the<br>border this week?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
