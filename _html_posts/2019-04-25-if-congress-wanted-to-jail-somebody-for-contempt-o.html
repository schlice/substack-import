<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, Congress can request that persons be incarcerated, as the other<br>answers have stated. However, this authority does have limits. Congress<br>must demonstrate that the testimony of the person in question will aid<br>in its ability to create laws. If not, the original contempt charge<br>would be invalid.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
