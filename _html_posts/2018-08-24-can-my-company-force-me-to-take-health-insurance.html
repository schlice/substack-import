<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can my company force me to take health insurance?<br><br>No, your company cannot force you to buy health insurance. Let's say,<br>for example, you're a retired military veteran who has served at least<br>20 years on active duty. In that case, you have healthcare for life from<br>the military and you do not need health insurance from your company. You<br>could also be using your spouse's insurance to cover your health needs.<br><br>There are plenty of reasons why you would not want to buy health<br>insurance from your company.<br><br>Your company should be pleased with this, as it's not cheap to insure<br>someone. During your company's "open enrollment" period, you will have<br>the option to buy health insurance, or "opt out" and receive a portion<br>of that money back in your paycheck.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
