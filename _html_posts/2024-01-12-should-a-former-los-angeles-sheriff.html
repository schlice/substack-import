<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, because his plea deal only included 30 days jail time.<br><br>It sounds a bit harsh. And it would be, if you had actually represented<br>the facts of the case correctly.<br><br>The former LA County Sheriff's deputy, Andrew Lyons, was charged with<br>one felony count each of assault with a semiautomatic firearm and<br>assault under the color of authority. There's no murder charge there.<br>There's no manslaughter charge there. In fact, there are no "killing"<br>charges there at all.<br><br>So despite what you asked, there is no proof that Andrew Lyons killed<br>Ryan Twyman.<br><br>How do I know this?<br><br>**The prosecution refused to continue manslaughter charges against Mr.<br>Lyons.**<br><br>Lyons had originally been charged with involuntary manslaughter and two<br>felony counts of assault with an assault weapon. He accepted a plea deal<br>and pled down to assault with a semiautomatic firearm and assault under<br>the color of authority. He was sentenced to two years probation and 30<br>days in jail. He also is permanently barred from owning a firearm.<br><br>So for what he was *actually* charged with, his sentence seems<br>reasonable.<br><br>But if you're so sure that Andrew Lyons killed Ryan Twyman, *why didn't<br>the prosecutor charge him with murder or manslaughter?*<br><br>Because there were *two* deputies who fired a total of four bullets that<br>struck Twyman. A full investigation by the LA County Sheriff's<br>Department resulted in no definitive determination as to which bullet<br>from which gun killed Ryan Twyman.<br><br>Knowing that they couldn't get a conviction on murder or manslaughter<br>charges, they knew the best they could get was assault with a<br>semiautomatic firearm and assault under color of authority. So they let<br>him plead out.<br><br>Lyons' attorney stated the following after the trial:<br><br>\"From the outset, we have stated this is a case based in politics, not<br>facts. The facts in this case demonstrate that Mr. Lyons did not kill<br>Mr. Twyman. The dismissal of the voluntary manslaughter charge by the<br>District Attorney\'s Office underscores this truth. Mr. Lyons has<br>reluctantly agreed to accept a plea in this matter and to end his<br>15-year law enforcement career out of his belief that it is in the best<br>interest of his family.\"\[1\](#dlpuD){#cite-dlpuD .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-dlpuD){.citation_index} [[Ex-LA County deputy pleads no<br>contest to charges in fatal 2019 Willowbrook<br>shooting](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=26368c&url=https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/former-la-county-deputy-2019-willowbrook-shooting-ryan-tyman/3311073/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nbclosangeles.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
