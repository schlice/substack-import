<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is a big difference between *voluntarily accompanying* the police<br>to the station, and *custodial interrogation.*<br><br>When you voluntarily accompany the police to the station, you can leave<br>any time you choose. You can choose to end the questioning at any time.<br><br>When you are detained or arrested, leaving is not an option. The police,<br>as part of custodial interrogation, must read you your Miranda rights.<br>That\'s one of the ways you know you are a suspect and you can\'t leave.<br><br>Once you hear that Miranda warning, it\'s in your best interest to<br>stop speaking. Get a lawyer.<br><br>Anyway, officers can choose where the best place for you to speak would<br>be. If the porch is not a strategically appropriate location, they can<br>choose to not speak there. That is the officer\'s choice. And either<br>inside or at the station are reasonable choices.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-a-police-officer-allowed-to-disobey-my-house-rules-Two-police-officers-came-to-my-home-and-I-asked-them-to-remove-their-shoes-which-they-did-not-do-It's-for-religious-reasons-I'd-like-my-rules-respected-What-can-I-do-about-this/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
