<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is a penitent bound by the seal of confession?<br><br>Not according to the canon of the Catholic Church. But it wouldn't make<br>sense that the penitent would have to be bound by a confessional seal;<br>it's most likely that he doesn't want that kind of stuff getting out,<br>anyway. The point of the seal of confession is that when the penitent<br>confesses to the confessor (always a priest), that priest can never<br>reveal what he has heard.<br><br>The canon law of the Roman Catholic church states clearly, \"The<br>sacramental seal is inviolable; therefore it is absolutely forbidden for<br>a confessor to betray in any way a penitent in words or in any manner<br>and for any reason.\"<br><br>Additionally, anyone else who overhears the confession *is* also bound<br>by the confessional seal.<br><br>But if the penitent chooses to tell someone else his sins, there is no<br>such seal forbidding that. So a penitent can confess in the confessional<br>to committing a crime, and then can later confess to the police without<br>violating church law. For more serious offenses, a priest may even<br>advise a penitent to "turn himself in" and doing so would not violate<br>the seal of confession. The priest, however, can only advise the<br>penitent to do so; he may not divulge anything heard in confession to<br>anyone, including authorities.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
