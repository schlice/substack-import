<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When it comes to the law, you were nude in a place where public nudity<br>is allowed. In most cases, while it is considered quite distasteful to<br>take pictures at a nude beach, it is not usually illegal.<br><br>And it is not automatically child pornography, as most legal definitions<br>of child pornography include a clause which states that the photography<br>must be sexual in nature. In other words, if you were doing something<br>sexual and the picture was taken, then it could be considered child<br>porn. But simply taking pictures of a person who is nude and underage<br>does not automatically constitute child porn. Additionally, a child<br>doesn't even need to be nude in order for it to be considered child<br>porn. A child in her underwear in a sexual orientation can be considered<br>to be child porn, even though she's not naked. It's not the nudity that<br>makes the porn.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>When I (16) was at a nude beach some guys took pictures of me without my<br>consent. I told them I was underage and they said it didn\'t matter<br>because I was in public. What do I do?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
