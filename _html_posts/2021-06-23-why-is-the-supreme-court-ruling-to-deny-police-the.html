<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So it seems you're talking about *Lange v. California*. In the *Lange*<br>case, the court ruled that a fleeing misdemeanor suspect (known as a<br>*misdemeanant*) who flees into a home may not always be pursued without<br>a warrant.<br><br>This is a victory for Fourth Amendment Constitutionalists, as it limits<br>the exceptions to its protections. But it also leads to a quagmire of<br>legal decisions for an officer, and will eventually lead to *every* case<br>where someone suspected of a misdemeanor who was followed into his home<br>ending up as a lawsuit. So it's a win for lawyers, too.<br><br>Taking away bright-line rules for police officers is never a good idea.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
