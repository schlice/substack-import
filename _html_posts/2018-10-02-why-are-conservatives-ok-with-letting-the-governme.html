<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **Why are conservatives OK with letting the government dictate who<br>> people can marry?**<br><br>**Because the government has a compelling interest in safeguarding<br>children.**<br><br>The only reason that the government cares (or should care,<br>legislatively) at all who you marry is because **sex between men and<br>women regularly produces children.**<br><br>Not always. Not mandatory. *Regularly*.<br><br>Marriage has, for centuries, been the exclusive purview of the church.<br>Whether or not you were married was for the church to decide.<br><br>So why is the government involved at all?<br><br>The state has a compelling interest in safeguarding the welfare of<br>children. It is a tremendous burden on the state to care for unwanted<br>children. Therefore, ensuring that there is a stable family which can,<br>and desires to, raise a child is important to the state.<br><br>Secondly, and this is the point that most people love to disagree with<br>but that doesn't make it less of the truth, all reputable statistics<br>show that a child has the *best* possibility of a positive outcome<br>later in life when they are raised in a common household with their<br>biological parents. All other configurations of family have a lower<br>possibility of a positive outcome. Before you run screaming to the<br>comments, note that I did not say that it is impossible for a child of a<br>single mother or a child living with two women to have a good life and<br>experience a positive outcome. I know several in my own life. And I also<br>didn't say that being raised in a home with your biological parents<br>*always results* in the best outcome (I'm living proof of that).<br>What I said (which I'll repeat because even the bold and italics don't<br>give it away) is that the *best* possibility of a positive outcome<br>is achieved by a child being raised in a common household with their<br>biological parents.<br><br>Therefore, the state incentivizes the relationship they wish to<br>cultivate. They offer tax breaks to married couples who choose to marry<br>to raise children. The offer survivorship benefits to ease the<br>transition of property from parents to children.<br><br>This is why the state cares who you marry. It's not because they want to<br>dictate who you love, or because they're homophobic, or for any other<br>reason you can come up with. The only reason the state is involved at<br>all is because of their role in safeguarding the welfare of children.<br>That doesn't make a marriage invalid if you don't have children. It<br>doesn't mean that you must marry to have children. It doesn't mean<br>anything else other than the following:<br><br>- The state is concerned with the welfare of children.<br>- Sex between men and women (and no other combination) regularly<br>  produces children.<br>- The state recognizes (for better or worse) that a child has the best<br>  chance of a positive outcome later in life when they are raised in a<br>  common household with their biological parents.<br>- Therefore, the state incentivizes the family configuration that offers<br>  the child the best possible chance for success.<br><br>To answer your question, this is the only reason why the state is<br>concerned with who you marry.<br><br>\<br><br>Of course, after *Obergefell*, where the Supreme Court redefined<br>marriage for all the states, this all went out the window. Now you can<br>marry whomever you want.<br><br>And the slippery slope begins. Next up: if two men can marry, why can't<br>I marry two women? Or have a group marriage?<br><br>After that: why can't I marry my dog?<br><br>After that: why can't I marry this 11 year old?<br><br>Love is love after all, right? States really have a hard time saying no<br>to any of that, considering all the arguments made in *Obergefell* now<br>equally apply to any other marital arrangement you can think of.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
