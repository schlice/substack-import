<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [OK, I\'ll bite and take the police\'s view here, since<br>we\'re all playing Monday Morning Quarterback and none of us know ALL<br>the facts.\<br>\<br>This is why we don\'t routinely stop people using unmarked vehicles.\<br>\<br>If you\'re being \"lit up\" by an UNMARKED vehicle, the first thing I<br>would do is NOT stop and call 911 and tell the dispatcher that there is<br>an unmarked vehicle following me with red and blue lights, is this a<br>police officer. If I\'m told that it is a police officer, I\'d stop<br>immediately. The defendant in this case did not do that. She simply kept<br>driving. She did turn her flashers on and wave her arm out the window,<br>but that\'s not what the law says to do when a police officer is behind<br>you. The law says you must immediately yield, not yield when YOU think<br>it is safe, or yield when you find the nearest parking lot. The law says<br>yield immediately.\<br>\<br>She did not call 911 and ask if the person behind her was a police<br>officer. If she was concerned for her safety, she should have<br>immediately called 911. I think she would have a better defense if this<br>is what she did, but she instead just turned on her flashers and kept<br>driving. The officer was driving a MARKED squad car, and he was using<br>his lights and siren, in accordance with the law. She turned on her<br>flashers indicating that *she was aware the person behind her wanted to<br>pull her over*, and then she refused to stop.\<br>\<br>I don\'t think her case has a good chance of succeeding, regardless of<br>how \"safe\" she felt pulling over. If she felt she was in danger, she<br>should have called 911.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
