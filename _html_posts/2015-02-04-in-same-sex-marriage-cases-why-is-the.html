<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Because whether or not one state recognizes a gay marriage<br>from another state is not at issue, unless it is.\<br>\<br>The 14th Amendment, or the \"due process\" or \"equal protection\"<br>clause, is most often cited in marriage cases because the plaintiff is<br>challenging the marriage laws within a state, saying that according to<br>the 14th Amendment, the law must be applied equally to all groups of<br>citizens. It forbids states from denying life, liberty, or property<br>to anyone without due process of law, or denying to any person within<br>its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Because of its direct<br>application to the states, the 14th Amendment is cited in more<br>Constitutional challenges than any other Amendment in the Constitution.\<br>\<br>If the case was that State A did not recognize the legal marriage in<br>State B, then the case would turn on the \"full faith and credit\"<br>clause.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
