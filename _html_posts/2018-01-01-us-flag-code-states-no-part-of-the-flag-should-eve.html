<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The short answer is no, a flag decal is not subject to this portion of<br>the flag code. Similarly, people wear flag patches and flag pins and<br>flags embroidered on their jerseys for baseball and soccer and all sorts<br>of sports, and none of this is in violation of the flag code.<br><br>If the flag code was actually enforceable (see other answers about why<br>it is not), *this* would actually be a violation of that portion of the<br>flag code:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-ab81cda3c13f4f14e7467df1dfa126d9){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-ab81cda3c13f4f14e7467df1dfa126d9" master_w="300"<br>master_h="300"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>BTW, I have nothing against Kid Rock. But this particular American Flag<br>Poncho would be a violation of the flag code. Notice how **the flag<br>itself** is being used as a piece of clothing. This is what the flag<br>code is referring to.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
