<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is trump trying to declare a fake national emergency when there is<br>no national emergency at the border?**<br><br>Whether or not a national emergency exists at the southern border is<br>entirely up to the President to decide. Congress gave the President that<br>authority when they wrote the National Emergencies Act in 1976. Let's<br>not misunderstand: it's not for anyone but the President to decide if a<br>national emergency exists. It is a power that has been delegated to the<br>President by Congress to invoke certain provisions of Federal law. There<br>are about 470 provisions of Federal law that a President can invoke by<br>declaring a national emergency.<br><br>If the President declares a national emergency at the southern border in<br>order to secure military funding to build a border barrier, Congress may<br>perceive this as an abuse of the national emergency authority he<br>currently has, and they may impeach him for what would be considered an<br>abuse of power.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
