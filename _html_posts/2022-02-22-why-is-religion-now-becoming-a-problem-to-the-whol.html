<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because religious beliefs are *naturally* exclusive. If I believe that<br>Islam is true, then I therefore believe that anything that is not Islam<br>*is not true*. If I believe that Christianity is true, then I believe<br>that anything that is not Christianity is not true.<br><br>This directly contradicts the concept of "tolerance" and "pluralism"<br>promoted in today's society, because *society sees "tolerance" as more<br>than just "coexisting."* Society's definition of "tolerance" today means<br>not just treating those with different ideas civilly and respectfully.<br>"Tolerance" today means *affirming their ideas are valid*, which<br>traditional religious people (Christians especially) cannot do without<br>denying their own beliefs. For example, if you believe that the Bible<br>says that homosexual behavior is sinful, you can't at the same time<br>agree that homosexual behavior is not sinful.<br><br>TL;DR: Religion is a problem because religion teaches that absolute<br>truth exists and can be known. Religion is now becoming a problem<br>because society's *belief about truth* is changing, and religion is not.<br><br>I gave a little more context about truth in another answer I wrote<br>today:<br><br>[[Bill Stein\'s answer to I can't stand the phrase "speak my truth", can<br>you give suggestions for anything else we can say for that<br>concept?](/I-can-t-stand-the-phrase-speak-my-truth-can-you-give-suggestions-for-anything-else-we-can-say-for-that-concept/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>So understand this was a secular answer, but this is especially poignant<br>when applied to Christianity.<br><br>The postmodern secularists (some of whom answered that question) don't<br>have to address the intrinsic contradictions in their views. They<br>reject the idea of absolute truth and the Law of Noncontradiction.<br>They just flit along their merry way moralizing to everyone about "new<br>Tolerance." These "tolerance peddlers" are exposed as frauds when you<br>realize that they don't practice what they preach, especially when it<br>comes to Christians. They certainly don't "tolerate" that Jesus is the<br>only way to salvation, as this would invalidate their ideas about<br>tolerance. To them, our insistence that absolute truth exists and that<br>Christ is the author of truth is so beyond the pale as to *disqualify<br>Christians from receiving the tolerance of others.* To justify their<br>positions, they use pithy (but logically incongruent) statements such<br>as, "we cannot tolerate the intolerant." They say these with a straight<br>face, not even realizing the glaring contradiction in their logic.<br><br>But when Christians claim that there is one true religion, this doesn't<br>mean that they are intolerant or disrespectful of others or their<br>beliefs. Modern culture has been intentionally confused by these<br>distinctions, so much so that they feel comfortable enough in their<br>confusion to paint the Christian as intolerant of those who believe<br>differently. However, we should realize that Christianity is not the<br>only religion which makes truth claims. All major religions make such<br>claims, which belies their assertion that all religions essentially<br>believe the same thing, but through different views. So much for<br>pluralism, eh? (NOTE: I said all *major* religions; this would<br>necessarily exclude belief systems like those found in sects like<br>[[Progressive<br>Christianity](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7cf4eb&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Christianity){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, itself a case study in<br>illogical contradiction.)<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why is religion now becoming a problem to the whole world?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
