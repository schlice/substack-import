<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How do I get a divorce when I don\'t know where my husband is?<br><br>As with all legal answers, this one depends on where you live.<br><br>In the US. when you file for divorce, you have to serve your spouse with<br>the divorce papers. Generally you have a specific period of time to do<br>this. If you can't find your spouse, you can ask the court for an Order<br>of Notice by Publication. This allows you to serve your spouse by<br>running your notice of intent to divorce in the local newspaper in the<br>last known area where your spouse was.<br><br>You will probably have to file an affidavit of marshal service attesting<br>to the publication, and the publicized notice will also have to be<br>filed. Depending on your jurisdiction, you may also have to file an<br>affidavit of military service showing that your spouse is not in the<br>military and that you are trying to divorce him while he is deployed.<br><br>Keep records of everything. Keep records of everything you tried to do<br>to contact your spouse, and the responses. If you sent letters to his<br>last known address and they were returned, keep those too.<br><br>You can still divorce your spouse if you can't find him. The court can<br>perform all of the divorce proceedings without him, but you must show<br>that you have tried to locate him, and that you tried to get the notice<br>of divorce to him.<br><br>Engaging a qualified divorce attorney in your jurisdiction is strongly<br>encouraged.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
