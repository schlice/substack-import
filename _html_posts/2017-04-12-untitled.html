For example, I bought a<br>gun with a 15-round magazine. The next year, the brilliant and gifted<br>state legislators in my state decided that your magazine shouldn't have<br>more than 10 rounds, and buying or selling such a magazine is illegal.<br>It's appropriate, then, that all sales of magazines larger than 10<br>rounds *going forward* would be illegal, but it's not appropriate (and<br>is an example of ex post facto) to say that my purchase, before the law<br>was even created, was also illegal based on the new law.<br><br>In the case of Deputy Harding's QI, the 4th Amendment had not changed.<br>It was the same 4th Amendment before and after the SCOTUS ruling. The<br>only thing that changed was the interpretation of the Amendment. Without<br>Qualified Immunity, if it is really a violation of the 4th Amendment<br>now, it was a violation of the same, unchanged 4th Amendment then.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-do-police-have-immunity/answer/Paul-Harding-14<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
