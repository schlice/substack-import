<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There\'s not much I can add to<br>[Cliff\'s(https://www.quora.com/profile/Cliff-G-13)]{.qlink_container}<br>answer. I\'d say your best bet at this point is just to pay it and move<br>on. It\'s probably going to cost you more to fight it because you may<br>not be able to fight it remotely (i.e. if your remote attorney can\'t<br>get the charge resolved without a court hearing, you\'d have to go to<br>California to appear in court with your attorney, so you\'ll have travel<br>costs as well as attorney\'s fees).\<br>\<br>Do you think it will be cheaper to hire an attorney to argue on your<br>behalf, and risk that they may not be able to resolve the ticket without<br>a hearing, in which case you\'ll have to travel back to CA to appear in<br>court? I think it\'s far cheaper and more convenient to just pay it.\<br>\<br>At this point, it\'s just a fine. Points are generally not assessed on<br>red light camera violations. But even if they are, it would be<br>relatively low. And if you don\'t drive much anyway, it\'s not something<br>to be seriously worried about.\<br>\<br>Additionally, the fine is assessed against the registered owner (or<br>renter) of the vehicle at the time the infraction occurred. It makes no<br>difference who was driving the car. If you were the primary driver on<br>the rental agreement, you are getting the ticket. If the car was not a<br>rental, you should not have received the ticket in the first place,<br>because it\'s not your car.\<br>\<br>If you\'re saying it\'s not a rental, and it\'s not your license plate,<br>then it should be pretty straightforward to get resolved. The extended<br>time can be explained by the move out of state.\<br>\<br>So I think your best bet is to contact a traffic violation attorney in<br>California and see if they are willing to try to resolve the issue for<br>less than \$780. If they can\'t do it, just pay it and be done with<br>it.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
