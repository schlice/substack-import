<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with ALL legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>In some cases, police can enter your home without permission and without<br>knocking. Primarily, this is during *exigent circumstances.*<br><br>Exigent circumstances, as defined in [[*United States v.<br>McConney*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=da6e94&url=https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-mcconney){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="casetext.com"}]{.qlink_container} are \"circumstances that<br>would cause a reasonable person to believe that entry (or other relevant<br>prompt action) was necessary to prevent physical harm to the officers or<br>other persons, the destruction of relevant evidence, the escape of the<br>suspect, or some other consequence improperly frustrating legitimate law<br>enforcement efforts.\"<br><br>Some examples of exigent circumstances include:<br><br>- Someone in the house who, when heard from the outside, is in apparent<br>  danger or needs medical assistance<br>- Someone in the house is wanted in a serious crime and is at risk of<br>  flight<br>- Someone in the house is in possession of evidence known by the police<br>  due to an active investigation and the potential exists that<br>  announcing themselves will give the person enough time to destroy the<br>  evidence<br><br>You want to *prevent* the police from being able to do this? First, good<br>luck. Second, and here's the truth: **you can never spend enough money<br>to *prevent* the police from breaking in if they are determined<br>to do so.**<br><br>In my home town when I was growing up, the police literally drove a tow<br>truck through a ranch style home's picture window to catch a drug<br>dealer.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-b3dc6f645ff688c698a73d82da8ead8d){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-b3dc6f645ff688c698a73d82da8ead8d" master_w="882"<br>master_h="499"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(This is not the tow truck, but it is similar to this one. Just imagine<br>diamond pattern stair-step fender flares on the front, and you get the<br>idea)*<br><br>After driving the truck through the front wall of the house, officers<br>used that stair-step fender flare on either side of the truck to enter<br>the drug dealer's house. The drug dealer's armed henchman in the front<br>room *literally* pooed his pants.<br><br>Point is, you can try to fortify your home enough to prevent the police<br>from getting in if they want, but it's unlikely you'll be able to do so.<br><br>Instead, save your money and retain a good lawyer, because if the police<br>didn't have probable cause or exigent circumstances, any entry without a<br>warrant makes anything found in the house inadmissible in court.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
