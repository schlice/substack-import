<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>An unfortunate translation error in one version of the King James Bible.<br><br>In that version, the word *ratsach* was translated as *kill* instead of<br>the actual translation, which is *murder*.<br><br>Therefore, in most translations today, you will see that the commandment<br>actually says that you shall not murder. Soldiers do not murder, thus<br>they are not violating the commandment.<br><br>There is killing in the bible, and in some cases it\'s even God who does<br>it. But God does not *murder*, which would be killing without<br>justification, and we are commanded to not do that either. Soldiers take<br>lives only when they must, and they do so with justification.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
