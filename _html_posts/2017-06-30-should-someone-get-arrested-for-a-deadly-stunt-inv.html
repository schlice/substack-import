<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Oh yes, most definitely.<br><br>First of all, it's not the victim's fault, despite his persuasion. It's<br>not the book's fault, or the gun's fault. It's the girl's fault, because<br>she held the gun, and she pulled the trigger. When you take on the<br>responsibility of pulling the trigger, you take on the responsibility<br>for what happens to the bullet. Anything the bullet touches is your<br>responsibility. If you are unaware of this, you should not touch a gun,<br>let alone a Desert Eagle chambered in .50 AE. Taking someone's *word for<br>it* is a fatally-flawed line of reasoning.<br><br>Secondly, there is *exactly* a crime for this. Manslaughter is "the<br>unlawful taking of a life." There was no forethought; in fact, she<br>thought that she was *not* going to kill (a terribly ill-contrived and<br>incorrect thought, but that was her honest thought nonetheless). There<br>was no malice; she had no intention to kill. She was charged exactly as<br>she should have been under the statutes in her jurisdiction.<br><br>She was legally allowed to own a gun, so there was no crime there. Where<br>they were located, there are no laws against discharging a firearm, so<br>no crime there.<br><br>The manslaughter charge was absolutely justified.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
