<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [High speed car chases are going the way of the dodo.\<br>\<br>Many jurisdictions have banned them outright. Some jurisdictions are<br>\"positive consent\" jurisdictions for pursuit. The on-duty sergeant<br>must authorize the pursuit before it can continue, and it will only be<br>authorized in extenuating circumstances, during low traffic periods, and<br>for severe crimes. It will be rare all other times.\<br>\<br>The vehicle will not be tracked by helicopter, since the department does<br>not routinely fly the helicopter and it does take time to get into the<br>air and on scene. Generally, the officer simply takes the registration<br>of the vehicle and follows up on it later.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
