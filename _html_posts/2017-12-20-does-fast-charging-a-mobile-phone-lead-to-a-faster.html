The fast charge circuit and the increased load on the battery<br>generates more heat, and the battery components break down faster over<br>time.<br><br>However, we're talking something like an 11% reduction in battery life<br>over two years (IIRC), and many people will swap out their phones for<br>newer, shinier ones before that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
