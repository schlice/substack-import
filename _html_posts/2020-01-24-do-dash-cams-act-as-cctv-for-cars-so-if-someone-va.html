<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do dash cams act as CCTV for cars, so if someone vandalises it in a<br>parking lot, for example, will it record the crime?**<br><br>They can, but in their default mode of operation, they usually do not.<br><br>In order for your dash cam to do this, it has to have a few features,<br>and you have to install a feature.<br><br>1.  Your dash cam has to be able of recording in what's called "parking<br>    mode" or "parking surveillance mode." This means that when the car<br>    is off, the camera can continue to operate. This requires sufficient<br>    battery to maintain a motion sensor and activate when it senses<br>    motion. Most dash cams, by default, are not programmed to use this<br>    feature even if they have it.<br>2.  In general, in order to use a parking mode feature, you need to<br>    provide continuous power to the camera, even when the car is off.<br>    Simply cutting off the 12v power socket and hard-wiring the camera<br>    to an always-on power source is not adviseable, because if your car<br>    sits too long, you can drain the battery and then your car won't<br>    start. To accomplish this, you need a smart power controller. The<br>    controller is wired to both an always-on power source, and a<br>    switched power source (one which turns on and off with the car). The<br>    smart power controller draws power from the always-on feed, but uses<br>    the switched power source as a sense cable. When it senses the car<br>    has been turned off, it tells the camera to switch to parking mode.<br>    It also monitors the amount of amperage coming from the battery, and<br>    when it drops too low (i.e. the car battery is running out of<br>    juice), it turns off the camera so that you can still start your<br>    car, saving your battery. Also, the dash cam has to be able to<br>    understand the signals from the power controller such that it can<br>    switch from real-time recording mode to parking sensor mode.<br>3.  Finally, as others have mentioned, the vandalism must be of a<br>    sufficiently jarring nature as to trigger the camera to record. If<br>    someone is scratching your car or spray painting your car, it likely<br>    won't be enough motion to trigger the camera.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
