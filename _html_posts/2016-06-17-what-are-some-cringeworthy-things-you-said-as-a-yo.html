<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I was sitting at a barbecue restaurant in St. Louis with a bunch of my<br>college-age friends (we were all a bit rowdy anyway), and the place was<br>noisy. I said, in a normal tone of voice,<br><br>"Man, I'm so hungry, I could eat the ass end of a dead rhino."<br><br>The waitress must not have heard me clearly, and in looking back, she<br>must have thought I said something else, perhaps something derogatory<br>about *her* ass, because she asked me what I said.<br><br>So I repeated it.<br><br>I guess she still didn't hear me, because she asked me to repeat it<br>again.<br><br>So I did, louder. Mind you, the first time I repeated it, it was still<br>funny. The second time was just annoying.<br><br>At that point, something changed.<br><br>Have you ever said something and it seemed like everyone got quiet and<br>listened to you?<br><br>That's exactly what happened.<br><br>Everyone stopped for a minute, processed what I said, and then turned<br>back to their own conversations, probably a little confused and probably<br>a little grossed out as well. Some of my friends probably learned a<br>little more about me at that point than I hoped they would.<br><br>*Mortified.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
