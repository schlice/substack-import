<br><br><div><br><br># Answers<br><br>## Answer<br><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Bible doesn't *allow* slavery. The Bible only allows it insofar as<br>it doesn't outright *condemn* it. But why? Even if the Bible doesn't<br>*allow* slavery, why doesn't the Bible *condemn*<br>slavery?<br><br>So, we must discuss a few things to set the stage before we dive in to<br>the discussion. First, we must be very careful to not apply our modern<br>sensibilities to a culture which existed more than 2000 years ago. Even<br>just 100 years ago, it was considered Constitutional that a black man<br>could be "separate but equal." So it's clear that certain social issues<br>change over time, even in the relatively short span of a century.<br><br>Second, we must understand what we're talking about. The Bible discusses<br>several different concepts of slavery. The slavery we are used to<br>discussing is "chattel slavery," which is an involuntary form of<br>slavery. In the Bible, enemy soldiers captured in battle are sometimes<br>subject to chattel slavery. The next most common type of slavery in the<br>Bible is what is more commonly referred to today as "indentured<br>servitude," where a person essentially asks someone else to pay their<br>debts, and the person becomes *indebted* to the payor, and agrees to<br>live as a servant until such time as that debt has been paid off. Our<br>modern-day employment contracts are an outgrowth of that form of<br>indentured servitude.<br><br>Finally, we have a tendency, because we live in the United States and<br>Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery in the 1800s, to think of slavery as a<br>*past* thing. But it is most definitely not. It is estimated that<br>roughly 27 million people today, worldwide, are still subjected to<br>slavery: forced labor, the global sex trade, inheritable property, etc.<br><br>As those who have been redeemed from the slavery of sin, Christians<br>today should be the foremost champions of ending human slavery in the<br>world. But if that's the case, why does the Bible not speak out strongly<br>against slavery?<br><br>In other words, **why does the Bible seem to support the practice of<br>human slavery?**<br><br>Slavery was a common practice long before the Mosaic Law was written. So<br>rather than *condemning* the practice, the Law instead sought to<br>*regulate* it. It gave instructions for how slaves should be treated<br>rather than outright condemning the practice. And the law also gave<br>specific directions based on who you were, and who your slaves were:<br><br>> Hebrews with Hebrew slaves. The law allowed for Hebrew men and<br>> women to sell themselves into slavery to another Hebrew. They could<br>> only serve for six years, however. In the seventh year, they were to<br>> be set free (Exodus 21:2). This arrangement amounted to what we might<br>> call indentured servanthood. And the slaves were to be treated well:<br>> "Do not make them work as slaves. They are to be treated as hired<br>> workers or temporary residents among you" (Leviticus 25:39--40). The<br>> law also specified that, "when you release them, do not send them away<br>> empty-handed. Supply them liberally from your flock, your threshing<br>> floor and your winepress. Give to them as the Lord your God has<br>> blessed you" (Deuteronomy 15:13--14). The freed slave had the option<br>> of staying with his master and becoming a "servant for life" (Exodus<br>> 21:5--6).<br>><br>> Hebrews with Gentile slaves. When the Israelites conquered the<br>> land of Canaan, they were to drive out or destroy all the former<br>> inhabitants. However, that order was not fully obeyed, and many<br>> Gentiles remained in the land. God allowed the Hebrews to take slaves<br>> from among that population \[and these were the equivalent of "chattel<br>> slaves"\]: "Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations<br>> around you; from them you may buy slaves. You may also buy some of the<br>> temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born<br>> in your country, and they will become your property. You can bequeath<br>> them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves<br>> for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites<br>> ruthlessly" (Leviticus 25:44--46).<br>><br>> \...\<br>><br>> Gentiles with Hebrew slaves. Under the Mosaic Law, and if economic<br>> circumstances demanded it, a Hebrew had the option of selling himself<br>> as a slave to a Gentile living in Israel (Leviticus 25:47). The law<br>> also provided for the slave's redemption at any time (verses 48--52).<br>> And the treatment of the Hebrew slave was to be considerate: slaves<br>> were "to be treated as workers hired from year to year; you must see<br>> to it that those to whom they owe service do not rule over them<br>> ruthlessly" (verse 53). If no redemption came, the slaves were still<br>> released, with their families, on the Year of Jubilee (verse 54).<br>> \[1\](#LSNZY){#cite-LSNZY .citation_link}<br><br>So clearly, the Mosaic Law made provisions for slavery. But *any* sort<br>of provision for slavery was *revolutionary*. In the time of the Bible,<br>slaves had no rights. But the Mosaic Law in Exodus 21 gave slaves<br>rights: right to keep a wife (verse 3), the right not to be sold to<br>foreigners (verse 8), the right to be adopted into a family by marriage<br>(verse 9), the right to food and clothing (verse 10), and the right to<br>be free from corporal punishment by their masters (verses 20, 26--27).<br><br>So why didn't Jesus and His apostles immediately condemn every slave<br>owner? *They didn't need to.* Jesus' earthly ministry was never<br>intended to be a political movement. It was instead intended to change<br>*individual hearts*, and those changed people would go on to make social<br>and political change. Indeed, everywhere where slavery was ended, you<br>could find at the nexus of that change a Christian. The Bible already<br>contains all the concepts a person needs to end slavery: men are all<br>made in the image of God (Genesis 1:27), people should not kidnap and<br>sell a person (Exodus 21:16; cf. 1 Timothy 1:8--10), and that a slave<br>can truly be "a brother in the Lord" (Philemon 1:16).<br><br>So like the questioner, people criticize the Bible because it didn't<br>immediately call for the banning of every social and political evil. But<br>that was never its goal. The truth of God's Word changes *people*, and<br>*changed people* *change people.* The Bible creates Christ-followers who<br>themselves create Christ-followers. Even today, you'll find the mission<br>statements of many Christian churches describe them as just that: Christ<br>followers who create Christ followers. And since Christ followers<br>themselves have been released from slavery (the slavery of sin), they<br>should desire to spread that belief to others who would then be released<br>from their own slavery to sin.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-LSNZY){.citation_index} [[Does the Bible condone<br>slavery?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7f9a75&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/Bible-slavery.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
