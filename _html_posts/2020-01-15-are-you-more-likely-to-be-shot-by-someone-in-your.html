<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Are you more likely to be shot by someone in your home if a gun is<br>kept there?**<br><br>Doesn't this sound like a silly question?<br><br>"Are you more likely to drown if your home has a pool?"<br><br>"Are you more likely to eat fried foods if your home has a deep fryer?"<br><br>"Are you more likely to be stabbed if your home if a kitchen knife is<br>there?"<br><br>There is a big difference between the statistical probability that an<br>action can occur and the *likelihood* that a particular action will<br>occur.<br><br>And there is nearly zero correlation between the two.<br><br>In other words, *just because a home has a gun does not increase the<br>likelihood that any one person will be shot in any one scenario.* For<br>instance, if that gun is secured properly, there is zero chance of<br>accidental discharge. If all of the people in the home are properly<br>trained and socialized on guns, then the risk of negligent discharge is<br>so close to zero that it is functionally zero.<br><br>Don't believe me? Just replace guns with another object in the house<br>that is equally as deadly: kitchen knives.<br><br>These things exist in nearly every home in America, and yet you are<br>never concerned when you walk into a house and you see a butcher block<br>with knives in it on the kitchen counter.<br><br>Yet more people are stabbed in domestic violence attacks using those<br>very kitchen knives than are shot.<br><br>In theory, you should be more worried when you walk into a house and see<br>kitchen knives than if you walk into a house in which you know a gun is<br>present.<br><br>But the mainstream media and gun grabbers have made it their mission to<br>make guns the next cigarette. They want to make the gun so socially<br>unacceptable that people will eventually eschew them, even though guns<br>are involved in fewer incidents of violence in the home than kitchen<br>knives, and no one is seriously seeking to ban those.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
