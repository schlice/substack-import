<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [1. No police department is going to store anything in<br>Google Cloud. You can just get that idea out of your head right now. If<br>anything, police departments will build out new [[Enterprise Hybrid<br>Clouds](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e8c79a&url=http://www.emc.com/cloud/hybrid-cloud-computing/index.htm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="emc.com"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>to store the video. Storing the video in the cloud is too risky,<br>legally, for departments. They will need to store the highest-risk data<br>in-house.\<br>\<br>2. While you\'re close with the total number of police officers in the<br>United States (it\'s closer to 300,000 uniformed officers now), the<br>United States does not have one nationalized police force for the entire<br>country. Remember that the United States is a federation of (mostly)<br>independent states. Police forces are controlled and funded by the<br>states. Revenue to run the police department comes from the taxes<br>collected by the state.\<br>\<br>3. You\'re also way off on how much data the cameras actually capture.<br>You were looking at *streaming* data over an Internet connection.<br>The cameras in question will record 640x480 VGA, 30 FPS, medium-quality<br>recording, it will take 9 hours to fill the camera internal memory of 8<br>GB (so less than what you assumed). Assume 25 cameras per shift, three<br>shifts a day, all filling 8GB camera buffers is 600 GB per day. 30 days<br>is 36 TB of storage in a month, which matches real-world examples<br>([[Adam<br>Christensen](https://www.quora.com/profile/Adam-Christensen-13)]{.qlink_container}<br>said 60 TB in two months, so that matches). Video needs to be saved for,<br>at a minimum, one year. Felony videos need to be saved for 10 years. So<br>we\'re talking roughly 4.3 PB to save all of that video for 10 years.<br>You can probably shave that back to 4 PB, and with some tiered storage<br>we can save the older video on lower-cost drives while keeping the<br>higher-cost (faster) drives for serving the newest data that would<br>likely be referenced within the first three months.\<br>\<br>4. All that said, you\'re WAY off on price. It would be tough to<br>speculate on numbers, but an Enterprise Hybrid Cloud with at least 4 PB<br>of storage is going to be over \$1M to build out, and that\'s just for<br>one large town of just over 500,000 residents. The cost to roll this out<br>in every department across the country is just staggering. Are residents<br>really ready to shell out that kind of tax money to just one department?<br>We have multiple police departments in one jurisdiction, we have over<br>100 departments in the state alone. *That\'s a lot of money*. Taxpayers<br>just aren\'t ready to spend all that money on storage. Why? There are<br>things that taxpayers believe are more important than an Enterprise<br>Hybrid Cloud for the police department. We can\'t fund our departments<br>well enough to keep patrols on the street; you really think that<br>governments are going to put that money towards *data storage*? Not<br>happening.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Should-cops-be-required-to-wear-recording-devices-in-order-to-solve-the-problem-of-controversial-shootings/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
