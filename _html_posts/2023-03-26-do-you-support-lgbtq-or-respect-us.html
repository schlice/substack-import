<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Define "respect."<br><br>I respect you for who you are. You have every right to be you and live<br>as you choose. End of discussion.<br><br>But for many people today, that's not enough. They conflate *respect*<br>with *affirmation*. I can respect someone who voted for Bernie, but I<br>don't have to put a "Vets for Bernie" bumper sticker on my car to prove<br>it.<br><br>Let's be abundantly clear: **forcing someone to indicate public support<br>for a position they personally disagree with will always be wrong**. End<br>of other discussion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
