<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *If the police served a search warrant on the wrong house (mine) and I<br>> defended my home with a firearm (in theory legally), what would the<br>> repercussions be for me legally?*<br><br>Let's break this down, since you actually have a few questions here.<br><br>> *If the police served a search warrant on the wrong house (mine)*<br><br>If the house is wrong, when the police knock on the door and you open<br>the door, they tell you they have a search warrant to search your house,<br>and ask to see the warrant, you say, "114? No, 114 is down the street.<br>This is 144." Or, you say, "Yes, this is 144, but there is no Smith that<br>lives here, I'm Mr. Jones, and this is Mrs. Jones, and we are the owners<br>of this property."<br><br>This is what's known as a "mistake of fact." It is an error, everyone<br>has a good laugh and the police go their own way.<br><br>(EDIT) Lots of people seem to be conflating "serving a search warrant"<br>with "no-knock warrants," and I credit the media for causing the<br>confusion. Let's be clear: in the vast majority of cases, you serve a<br>search warrant by knocking on the door, waiting for the homeowner to<br>answer, and presenting them with the warrant as you enter. No-knock<br>warrants are what you usually see on TV, where the door is busted in<br>with a ram and the police scream while they enter, "Police! Search<br>warrant!" The difference between an announced warrant and a no-knock<br>warrant is the condition of the front door when the police leave.<br><br>We've discussed the intersection between the Castle Doctrine and<br>no-knock warrants on here before:<br><br>[[When a no-knock warrant meets a castle doctrine, which prevails<br>legally?](https://www.quora.com/When-a-no-knock-warrant-meets-a-castle-doctrine-which-prevails-legally)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>[[Bill Stein\'s answer to If I\'m in my home asleep when my doors and<br>windows are violently breached, I\'m probably going to start shooting at<br>intruders with my gun. Am I justified? What if the police get the wrong<br>address?](https://www.quora.com/If-Im-in-my-home-asleep-when-my-doors-and-windows-are-violently-breached-Im-probably-going-to-start-shooting-at-intruders-with-my-gun-Am-I-justified-What-if-the-police-get-the-wrong-address/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>[[What are the implications if a police officer is mistaken for an<br>intruder, during a raid, and<br>shot?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-implications-if-a-police-officer-is-mistaken-for-an-intruder-during-a-raid-and-shot)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>(EDIT2) It was then asked, "Well, what if you tell them they have a<br>mistake of fact, and they proceed to search anyway?" The short answer is<br>*you let them*. There are a scant few circumstances in which anything<br>they find would be legally admissible in court. Even plain view items<br>would be ruled inadmissible as the only reason the police were present<br>in the house was a mistake in fact, and there is no criteria to show<br>inevitable discovery. Admission of evidence found as part of a mistake<br>in fact search would be dismissed under 4th Amendment protections, as<br>such an admission would almost certainly be considered "unreasonable."<br><br>> *I defended my home with a firearm (in theory legally)*<br><br>In the vast majority of jurisdictions (Texas being a notable exception),<br>you do not defend your *home* with a firearm. You only defend your<br>*person* with a firearm. Most Castle Doctrine states start their law<br>by saying that a homeowner has an absolute right to feel secure within<br>their home, so you may defend your life with a firearm if you are<br>threatened. This means that someone must<br><br>1.  Unlawfully enter your home<br>2.  Armed, and<br>3.  With the intention of doing you harm.<br><br>The police only meet one of these criteria (they're armed), they're not<br>entering your home unlawfully (the entered under mistake of fact, which<br>is not technically unlawful), and they do not intend on harming you.<br>Because of that, you are not legally authorized to use deadly force.<br><br>Therefore, had you defended your home against the police with deadly<br>force, if you manage to make it out of that situation alive (which is<br>unlikely), you would be arrested and charged with aggravated assault<br>against a peace officer, and if you happened to kill one of them,<br>murder.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
