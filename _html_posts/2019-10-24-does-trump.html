<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does Trump\'s lawyer\'s claim of the President being above the law<br>make you believe that Trump will not leave office if he is not<br>re-elected?**<br><br>There are two questions here:<br><br>- Does Trump's lawyer have a point when he says that the President is<br>  essentially "above the law"?<br>- Will Trump not leave office if he is not re-elected?<br><br>Let's start with the second question. If Trump loses, he will leave<br>office. Period. Trump has prided himself on being a Constitutionalist<br>and a globalist. He is certainly not someone who has ever acted<br>extra-Constitutionally (at least, not with any real evidence that he has<br>done so --- Russiagate and Ukrainegate are fake news). Regardless, these<br>claims come up every four or eight years, and similar to just a few<br>years ago, they have never been an issue. Trump will absolutely leave<br>office if he is not re-elected. He may not go quietly (as long as you<br>count Twitter rants as a noisy departure), but he'll go.<br><br>With that in mind, let's answer the first question. Does Trump's lawyer<br>have a point that a President cannot be prosecuted *while president*?<br>While it's never been tested Constitutionally, the answer is likely yes,<br>a president cannot be prosecuted while serving *as president*.<br><br>Does this mean the President is *above the law?*<br><br>Certainly not.<br><br>What it *does* mean is that while the President is president, he<br>cannot be prosecuted. As soon as he's no longer President, he can be<br>prosecuted. Once the former Marine One helicopter lands, he can be<br>placed into custody and indicted, as any citizen can. It's unlikely such<br>an event would take place, and the former President would arrange a time<br>to go to court without the handcuffs and the frog marching, but he will<br>still face justice.<br><br>But while he is President, all authority to enforce laws *flows from his<br>office*. The Constitution is very clear about this in Article II,<br>Section 1, Clause 1: "The executive Power shall be vested in a President<br>of the United States of America." This means that the office of the<br>President is the executive. All executive branch agencies derive<br>executive authority from the President, as he sees fit to delegate it.<br>This means the Department of Justice, the FBI, and every other Federal<br>law enforcement agency gets its authority directly from the President,<br>*the Chief Executive*. This means the power to authorize (or deny) an<br>indictment flows from the power of the president. That officeholder must<br>necessarily be immune from prosecution. It's like a deputy trying to<br>arrest his own Sheriff. It cannot be done. If a US Attorney tried to<br>prosecute the President, he could simply say "no" to that prosecution,<br>and the US Attorney could not continue.<br><br>But this does not mean the President is not immune from prosecution. The<br>President *while serving as Chief Executive* cannot be prosecuted. *Once<br>he leaves that position,* he is no longer part of that organization. The<br>Constitution has a method to deal with that as well: impeachment.<br>Once the President is removed from office, he can be indicted.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
