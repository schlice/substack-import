<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's check the whole passage so we have context:<br><br>> *The Jews answered him, "Are we not right in saying that you are a<br>> Samaritan and have a demon?" Jesus answered, "I do not have a demon,<br>> but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me. Yet I do not seek my own<br>> glory; there is One who seeks it, and he is the judge. Truly, truly, I<br>> say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death." The<br>> Jews said to him, "Now we know that you have a demon! Abraham died, as<br>> did the prophets, yet you say, 'If anyone keeps my word, he will never<br>> taste death.' Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And<br>> the prophets died! Who do you make yourself out to be?" Jesus<br>> answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father<br>> who glorifies me, of whom you say, 'He is our God.' But you have not<br>> known him. I know him. If I were to say that I do not know him, I<br>> would be a liar like you, but I do know him and I keep his word. Your<br>> father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day. He saw it and was<br>> glad." So the Jews said to him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and<br>> have you seen Abraham?" Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to<br>> you, before Abraham was, I am." So they picked up stones to throw at<br>> him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple. \-- John<br>> 8:48--59 ESV*<br><br>When Jesus said this, He knew exactly who He was talking to. These were<br>Pharisees who were well-versed in the Jewish Holy Scriptures.<br><br>Jesus knew that when He said, "I AM," they would know that He was<br>referring to the time when Moses was talking to God before visiting<br>Pharaoh. Moses asked God what He should be called when Pharaoh asks who<br>sent him:<br><br>> *God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM." And he said, "Say this to the<br>> people of Israel: 'I AM has sent me to you.'" \-- Exodus 3:14 ESV*<br><br>The Pharisees knew this well. Jesus was literally telling them that He<br>is God. Before Abraham was born? That was hundreds of years before Jesus<br>lived. So saying "Before Abraham was born, I AM" means very<br>specifically, "I am God."<br><br>How can we sure that Jesus meant to tell them that He is God? *Their<br>reaction.* Immediately, they picked up stones to stone Him. Why?<br>Because, in their mind, He had just committed the sin of *blasphemy* for<br>claiming that He is God.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
