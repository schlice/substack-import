How is the beacon\'s \"pinger\" powered?<br>What would be the technical difficulties with extending the lifetime of<br>the beacon\'s<br>pinger?](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-an-aircrafts-underwater-locator-beacon-only-last-for-30-days-after-the-plane-crashes-How-is-the-beacons-pinger-powered-What-would-be-the-technical-difficulties-with-extending-the-lifetime-of-the-beacons-pinger)]{.qlink_container}\<br>\<br>I am not certain about testing individual beacon brands, but I\'m<br>certain that any limitation on testing is due to cost.\<br>\<br>Based on their specifications, a 37.5 kHz (160.5 dB) ULB can be<br>detectable 1--2 kilometres (0.62--1.24 mi) from the surface in normal<br>conditions and 4--5 kilometres (2.5--3.1 mi) in good conditions. A 37.5<br>kHz (180 dB) beacon can be detected 4--5 kilometres (2.5--3.1 mi) in<br>normal conditions and 6--7 kilometres (3.7--4.3 mi) in good conditions.<br>A 10 kHz (180 dB) beacon can be detected 7--9 kilometres (4.3--5.6 mi)<br>in normal conditions and 17--22 kilometres (11--14 mi) in good<br>conditions.\<br>\<br>So even the shortest range beacon can be detected at almost 16,000 feet<br>under good ocean conditions.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
