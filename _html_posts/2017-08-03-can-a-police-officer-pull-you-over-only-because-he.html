<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think *stopping a vehicle* *because* *an officer smelled marijuana<br>as you drove by* would be a pretty thin reason to establish reasonable<br>suspicion. It would have to be, like, *clouds* coming out of your car as<br>you rolled by an officer standing outside of his car.<br><br>I mean, it's theoretically possible that an officer could have smelled<br>pot as *you* drove by, but I find that highly suspect.<br><br>I would think my lawyer would be all over that one in court.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
