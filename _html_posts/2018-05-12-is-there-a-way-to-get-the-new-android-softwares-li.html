<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, you can apply whatever software you want to your phone. In the case<br>of the S6, the only way to do this is to root your phone and apply the<br>software yourself. It's absolutely feasible and can actually be done<br>fairly easily if you have some computer and hardware knowledge.<br><br>However, there is less of a question of whether or not you could.<br>There is more of a question of whether or not you should.<br><br>Newer operating systems are going to be optimized for newer hardware.<br>The reason why the S6 never got Android O from the carriers is because<br>it would run like crap on that hardware. Putting Android P on that<br>hardware would make it run like hot crappy crap.<br><br>If I may be so bold as to make a suggestion. You want the new features,<br>but you want something that will actually run on your hardware. I would<br>suggest an open source port. I would formerly suggest Cyanogenmod,<br>but that project was discontinued. Some savvy developers took over the<br>source for the Cyanogenmod project and now produce an open source<br>firmware called<br>[LineageOS(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=05c99b&url=https://www.lineageos.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="lineageos.org"}]{.qlink_container}. In this way, you can get<br>the best of both worlds: you'll get many of the most recent additions to<br>the Android baseline, but you'll get it in a package that will actually<br>run on an S6. That hardware is out of warranty now, so there's no risk<br>in installing it on your phone. It's not like you're going to void a<br>warranty or anything like that.<br><br>If you don't have any phone hardware experience, this might be a good<br>project to try to learn on. You can always use Odin to put the original<br>firmware back on the phone. I'd say save off all of your personal data,<br>and load Lineage.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
