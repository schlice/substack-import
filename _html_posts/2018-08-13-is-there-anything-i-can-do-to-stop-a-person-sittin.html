<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there anything thing I can do to stop a person sitting in a car on<br>my street from videoing me working in my yard?**<br><br>In the United States, very little. When you are outside of your home,<br>you have no expectation of privacy. You can be freely videoed and<br>photographed. Those photos and videos can also be posted on social media<br>or the Internet in general as well.<br><br>In general, those photos or videos cannot be used for commercial<br>purposes, but beyond that, in general the rule in the United States is,<br>"if you can see it, you can record it."<br><br>There are a few things you can try:<br><br>1.  You can call the non-emergency number of your local police<br>    department and report a suspicious person/suspicious vehicle. DO NOT<br>    expect a quick response. In fact, it will likely be *hours* before<br>    someone shows up, so this may not be the ideal route to go. However,<br>    even if they don't show up for hours, it may be a good idea, as your<br>    complaint is officially recorded when you call the police, even on<br>    the non-emergency line.<br>2.  Take pictures and video of the vehicle and its occupant. What's good<br>    for the goose is good for the gander, so they say. You can take<br>    pictures and video of the car exactly as legally as they can take<br>    pictures and video of you. I suspect the driver won't hang around<br>    for too much longer once you start. Feel free to post those on your<br>    social media site, your local news channel's Facebook page, or if<br>    you have a neighborhood community website like<br>    [Nextdoor(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e57ab4&url=http://www.nextdoor.com){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="nextdoor.com"}]{.qlink_container} (not a sponsor), post<br>    it there.<br>3.  If you're feeling brave, you might approach the vehicle and ask the<br>    driver if they are lost or if they need something, but remember the<br>    first point in this answer: it's perfectly legal for the person to<br>    take pictures and video of you outside of your home.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
