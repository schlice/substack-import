<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The most violent that Jesus is ever recorded to have been<br>was when he threw the moneychangers out of the temple:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and<br>> selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the<br>> benches of those selling doves. \"It is written,\" he said to them,<br>> \"\'My house will be called a house of prayer,\' but you are making it<br>> \'a den of robbers.\'\"\<br>> (Matthew 21:12-13, NIV)\<br><br>\<br>Even this display of anger on Jesus\' part did not rise to the level of<br>anger needed to fire a weapon. An analogy would be Jesus using a sword<br>or spear, which he never did.\<br>\<br>So who would Jesus have shot in biblical times? No one.\<br>\<br>I think the analogy is to today\'s times, implying that Jesus would<br>never shoot anyone. I think that\'s a pretty poor analogy, as times are<br>different. Jesus would shoot whoever needed to be shot, with an utter<br>sadness in His heart for having to do it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
