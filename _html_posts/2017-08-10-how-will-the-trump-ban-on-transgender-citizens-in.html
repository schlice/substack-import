<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So this is mostly a misstatement in the question causing a lot of<br>confusion.<br><br>First, Trump is not banning transgendered people. Trump is reversing<br>an Obama-era policy which would have allowed transgendered people to<br>openly serve on Active Duty and in the Reserves. However, Obama gave the<br>military services a year to implement the policy, and the policy was<br>still in the planning stages; it was never implemented. Trump is<br>reversing Obama's reversal of an original transgender ban which has been<br>in place for as long as we've had a military.<br><br>That said, what will happen to transgendered individuals in the military<br>is nothing at all. The only difference: they will not be allowed to<br>"come out" as transgender. They will have to continue serving in exactly<br>the same way they are serving today. They will not be allowed to wear<br>the uniform that matches their gender identity; they will have to<br>continue wearing the uniform that matches their biological sex. They<br>will not be able to get gender reassignment surgery paid for by the<br>military. If they have already "come out" as transgender but have not<br>received surgery, my guess is that they will be allowed to remain under<br>the current rules. If they choose to continue to serve under those<br>conditions, they certainly can. If they haven't "come out" yet, and they<br>decide to come out after Trump's reversal takes effect, they will be<br>honorably discharged after they come out.<br><br>The policy will "keep the door closed" to new transgendered individuals<br>joining the military, but since the question didn't discuss new<br>recruits, we will stick to what will happen to existing transgendered<br>troops.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
