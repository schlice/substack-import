<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What can the President do with the Presidential Alert function on my<br>phone other than show messages?**<br><br>It seems that people have the false notion that the President can use<br>WEA in the same way he uses Twitter. Let's dispel some myths, shall we?<br><br>1.  "The President" by himself cannot activate the Emergency Alert<br>    System (EAS) and its component system, the Wireless Emergency Alert<br>    (WEA) network.\<br>    \<br>    The network is activated in conjunction with the FCC, FEMA, and<br>    NOAA, and can only be used as a "last-ditch" communication measure<br>    when the President cannot reach the media, during a national<br>    emergency.\<br>    \<br>    For example, the system was not engaged during the last national<br>    emergency, September 11th, 2001, because the agencies determined<br>    that the media was fully conveying all relevant information without<br>    the need to activate EAS or WEA.<br>2.  WEA, despite claims to the contrary, cannot control your phone. It<br>    can't activate your microphone. It can't access your location. It<br>    can't activate any functionality that E911 can. Essentially, it's<br>    nothing more than a text message. Your phone receives it. It<br>    displays the message. That's about the extent of it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
