<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Under Federal law, non-immigrant aliens are forbidden from possessing<br>any firearms or ammunition, unless they hold a hunting license or permit<br>issued by a state. Most states only issue permits to citizens, but a<br>small handful of states allow non-immigrant aliens to get special use<br>permits for hunting or for shooting competitions.<br><br>Immigrant aliens (even if you don't hold your green card yet) can<br>possess firearms, although many people are not aware of the hunting<br>license exception, and they usually think "no green card, no gun" which<br>is inaccurate.<br><br>Also, non-immigrants cannot legally purchase a firearm from a FFL dealer<br>unless they have been a resident of their state for 90 days. So people<br>on tourist visas can't just pop in on holiday and buy a gun "for<br>protection."<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can a non US citizen have a license to carry a gun?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
