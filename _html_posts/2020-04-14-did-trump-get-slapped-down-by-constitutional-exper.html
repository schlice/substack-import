Call it a "slap down" if you like.<br><br>Let's all just remember that this isn't the first time we had a<br>president who thought he could step outside the bounds of the<br>Constitution. Let's all remember this the next time we have a president<br>who says that he doesn't care whether or not Congress does its job,<br>because he has a pen and a phone.<br><br>Whether or not you like what the President is claiming he can do should<br>not matter to the Constitutionality of the action.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
