<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's unlikely. Because while the First Amendment allows you the freedom<br>to speak, the government still has a compelling interest in maintaining<br>public safety. Therefore, it has long been recognized that the<br>government can restrict the time, place, and manner of speech.<br><br>For example, I could parade around naked downtown and I could claim that<br>my exhibition is an artistic display and is thus protected by the First<br>Amendment, right? Well, not so fast. Since the state has the compelling<br>interest in *public decency* (for now), they can limit such a display to<br>areas where people must *actively consent* to see such things. The state<br>also has the interest in protecting children from such displays.<br>Therefore, the state can restrict my display.<br><br>Similarly, the new Public Nuisance law made it illegal in Florida to<br>display or project images onto a building, structure or property without<br>permission. Limiting public nuisances is part of the state's compelling<br>interest in creating a well-ordered environment for public safety.<br>Therefore, not being able to post messages on buildings or structures or<br>property without permission is in line with the state's compelling<br>interest and limits free speech in the least restrictive way possible.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
