<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are so many problems with this question. Where to start...<br><br>1.  MAGA â‰  Christian. You can be a MAGA Republican and not be Christian.<br>    You can be Christian and Republican but not consider yourself a<br>    "MAGA" Republican.<br>2.  I can't say how many times I've said this, but Trump was never<br>    convicted of rape. You claim he did, but you have no evidence. No<br>    criminal court ever convicted Trump of rape. He was found to be<br>    partially liable for sexual abuse in a civil trial and was forced to<br>    pay money, but that's a much lower standard than a criminal trial.<br>    The civil court uses a "preponderance of evidence" standard, not a<br>    "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard.<br>3.  Just curious where in the Bible it says that your president must be<br>    sinless. The last sinless guy who walked the earth was nailed to a<br>    cross about 2000 years ago. So I'm just curious how voting for<br>    someone who has sinned (read: *everyone alive*) somehow makes you a<br>    "pretend Christian."<br>4.  What do you know about my life? Who exactly do you think you are<br>    that you can call me a "pretend Christian" and selfish? What do you<br>    know about what "Christian" acts I've done? And what, exactly, is a<br>    "Christian act?" I bet you're not even Christian, but you somehow<br>    believe it's your right to tell me how to live my Christian life.<br>    How utterly reprehensible and hypocritical. Should I start looking<br>    into your life and judging you for the choices you've made? Sadly,<br>    most people are really bad at the "shoe on the other foot" test.<br><br>Sheesh, the nerve of some people. The absolute, unmitigated gall.<br>Keyboard warriors the lot of them. Move out of your mom's basement.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
