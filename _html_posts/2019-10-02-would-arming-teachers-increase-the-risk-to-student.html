<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Would arming teachers increase the risk to students? Why or why not?<br><br>I'm going to buck the apparent trend and say no.<br><br>First of all, ***NO ONE IS SAYING THAT WE WOULD BE FORCING TEACHERS TO<br>BE ARMED.* There are currently 22 states in which teachers *may***<br>be armed if they are qualified and permitted in their county of<br>residence. Never once has anyone even *entertained the idea* that we<br>should *reuquire* teachers to be armed. Never once.<br><br>To that end, any teacher who *chose* to arm themselves would be<br>required to pass all state and county requirements for obtaining a<br>concealed weapons permit. This includes all required safety courses and<br>background checks.<br><br>Thankfully, we already have teachers who do have their concealed carry<br>permits in their counties. They are currently prohibited from carrying<br>their lawfully permitted handguns in school because schools are a<br>gun-free zone.<br><br>Any other teacher who then *chose* to take the time (and use their<br>own personal funds) to obtain a concealed carry permit would be allowed<br>to conceal a firearm while at school.<br><br>Second, the law is *extremely* clear when it comes to a concealed<br>firearm. ***NO ONE WILL EVER SEE THE CONCEALED FIREARM UNLESS YOU ARE<br>DRAWING IT IN ORDER TO FIRE.*** That's the point of a "concealed"<br>firearm: *no one knows you have it*. I've seen some answers saying that<br>this would increase risk to students because a teacher may be<br>"improperly handling" the weapon. *WRONG*. Handling a concealed<br>firearm is a violation of law and would cause the holder to lose his CCW<br>permit. Some are also saying that a student could find a firearm in a<br>classroom. *WRONG**.* Firearms remain concealed on the carrier at<br>all times. The law is very clear: in order to remain a "concealed<br>weapon," it must never come out of concealment unless you intend to use<br>it. Some states clarify that "accidental exposure" of the firearm does<br>not constitute "brandishing," but this doesn't relieve the holder of the<br>responsibility to keep their firearm concealed.<br><br>So is there a risk that a teacher who is also a concealed carrier might<br>inadvertently discharge a firearm? Yes, of course there is, there is<br>always a statistical non-zero chance that a holster may fail or that a<br>teacher may improperly holster their weapon in the morning. But there is<br>nothing special about a school which makes this any more or less<br>possible than when that same teacher goes back to their home and arms<br>themselves before going out anywhere else in public. That same teacher<br>runs exactly the same risk of inadvertently discharging a firearm (which<br>is so ludicrous a thought that I'm surprised I'm actually typing it)<br>*inside* the school as they do *outside* the school.<br><br>So sure, overall, the risk of a firearms discharge in a school increases<br>slightly when we allow more firearms to be present inside the school.<br><br>But when we weigh the slight increase in risk to students by having more<br>lawfully permitted concealed carriers in the school against the massive<br>benefit of potentially stopping a mass shooter in their tracks, the<br>benefit clearly outweighs the risk.<br><br>Additionally, once we change this sign<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-414cf1e91090c6c7f205f601aa45ae4f){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-414cf1e91090c6c7f205f601aa45ae4f"<br>master_w="1920" master_h="1000"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>into this sign<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-7a8052dc26ca4621e5eb42d65f2a74b0){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-7a8052dc26ca4621e5eb42d65f2a74b0" master_w="900"<br>master_h="503"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>mass shooters (who may be crazy but are far from stupid) will most<br>definitely think twice before walking into a school to shoot it up.<br>Until we can do better at preventing firearms from entering a school<br>building, increasing security inside the building is the best way to<br>stop mass shootings in schools.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
