<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sometimes, Google is your friend. If you were to Google the Republican<br>party platform and specifically ask about healthcare, you would get this<br>response from<br>[GOP.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cca836&url=http://GOP.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gop.com"}]{.qlink_container} (emphasis mine, where your<br>specific questions are answered):<br><br>> We believe that taking care of one's health is an individual<br>> responsibility. Chronic diseases, many of them related to lifestyle,<br>> drive healthcare costs, accounting for more than 75 percent of the<br>> nation's medical spending. To reduce demand, and thereby lower costs,<br>> we must foster personal responsibility while increasing<br>> \preventative\ services to promote healthy lifestyles. We believe<br>> that all Americans should have improved access to affordable,<br>> coordinated, quality healthcare, including individuals struggling with<br>> mental illness.<br>><br>> Our goal is to encourage the development of a healthcare system that<br>> provides higher quality care at a lower cost to all Americans while<br>> protecting the patient-physician relationship based on mutual trust,<br>> informed consent, and privileged patient confidentiality. We seek to<br>> increase healthcare choice and options, contain costs and reduce<br>> mandates, simplify the system for patients and providers, restore cuts<br>> made to Medicare, and equalize the tax treatment of group and<br>> individual health insurance plans. For most Americans, those who are<br>> insured now or who seek insurance in the future, our practical,<br>> non-intrusive reforms will promote flexibility in State leadership in<br>> healthcare reform, promote a free-market based system, and empower<br>> consumer choice. All of which will return direction of the nation's<br>> healthcare to the people and away from the federal government.<br>><br>> To return the States to their proper role of regulating local<br>> insurance markets and caring for the needy, we propose to block grant<br>> Medicaid and other payments to the States; limit federal requirements<br>> on both private insurance and Medicaid; **assist all patients,<br>> including those with pre-existing conditions, through reinsurance and<br>> risk adjustment**; and promote non-litigation alternatives for dispute<br>> resolution. We call on State officials to carefully consider the<br>> increased costs of medical mandates, imposed under their laws, which<br>> may price many low-income families out of the insurance market. We<br>> call on the government to permanently ban all federal funding and<br>> subsidies for abortion and healthcare plans that include abortion<br>> coverage.<br>><br>> To achieve a free market in healthcare and ensure competition, we will<br>> promote price transparency so that consumers will know the actual cost<br>> of treatments before they undergo them. When patients are aware of<br>> costs, they are less likely to over-utilize services. We support<br>> legislation to cap non-economic damages in medical malpractice<br>> lawsuits, thereby relieving conscientious providers of burdens that<br>> are not rightly theirs and addressing a serious cause of escalating<br>> medical bills. We will empower individuals and small businesses to<br>> form purchasing pools in order to expand coverage to the uninsured.<br>> **Individuals with pre-existing conditions who maintain continuous<br>> insurance coverage should be protected from discrimination.** We<br>> support technology enhancements for medical health records and data<br>> systems while affirming patient privacy and ownership of health<br>> information.<br>><br>> \\...\<br>><br>> Consumer choice is the most powerful factor in healthcare reform.<br>> Today's highly mobile work force requires portability of insurance<br>> coverage that can go with them from job to job. The need to maintain<br>> coverage should not dictate where families have to live and work.<br>> Putting the patient at the center of policy decisions will increase<br>> choice and reduce costs while ensuring that services provide what<br>> Americans actually want. We must end tax discrimination against the<br>> individual purchase of insurance and allow consumers to purchase<br>> insurance across State lines. While promoting "co-insurance" products<br>> and alternatives to "fee for service," government must promote Health<br>> Savings Accounts and Health Reimbursement Accounts to be used for<br>> insurance premiums and should encourage the private sector to rate<br>> competing insurance plans. **We will ensure that America's aging<br>> population has access to safe and affordable care. Because seniors<br>> overwhelmingly desire to age at home, we will make home care a<br>> priority in public policy. We will champion the right of<br>> individual choice in senior care. We will aggressively implement<br>> programs to protect against elder abuse, and we will work to ensure<br>> that quality care is provided across the care continuum from home to<br>> nursing home to hospice.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
