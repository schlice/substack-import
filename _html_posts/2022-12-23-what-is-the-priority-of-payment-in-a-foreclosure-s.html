<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Note that this answer varies by state, although it pretty much holds<br>true across the US. My example specifically applies to Florida, your<br>mileage may vary. Check your state's laws on Homeowner's Associations to<br>find how your state handles this.**<br><br>Generally, the HOA can still foreclose on a line if a superior mortgage<br>is present, so long as the mortgage was recorded before the HOA's lien<br>claim.<br><br>That said, the HOA becomes the first non-mortgage lienholder.<br><br>The mortgage lender gets paid first. Any other mortgages (i.e. if the<br>house had a second mortgage against it) are then paid.<br><br>Any remaining proceeds go to the HOA to satisfy their lien.<br><br>Any remaining proceeds are distributed to any other lienholders based on<br>the order of the recording of their liens.<br><br>Finally, once all liens are satisfied and the house is sold, any<br>remaining profits are distributed to the homeowner.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
