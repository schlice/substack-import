Should I report him, even though<br>he is legally not seen as a pedophile?**<br><br>Since you are not a cop, I don't expect you to act like a cop. I expect<br>you to act like a human, and find the best solution.<br><br>In this case, if you are not an adult (I don't know how old you are),<br>get an adult to help you, because the best solution would be to sit down<br>with both sets of parents, preferably together, but separately if you<br>must (and preferably at some public venue like a coffee shop) and<br>explain that even though both of their children are underage, in most<br>jurisdictions, they can legally be charged with distribution of, and<br>possession of, child pornography. (Oh, even better, if they text that<br>picture to someone in another *state,* now it's a Federal crime, and the<br>FBI handles it, and they're going to be a lot less lenient than your<br>local police department). Then you must explain that children who have<br>access to technology which has the means of taking photographs and<br>sending them electronically to others must be educated about the proper<br>use of said technology lest they find themselves on the wrong side of<br>the law. This could become a very bad situation, especially if that<br>photo finds its way onto the wider Web, from whence it will *never*<br>disappear, and repercussions for the subject of the photo can be severe.<br>Finally, document your meeting if you can, and even better, record it if<br>you can.<br><br>At this point, if you can contain the situation, it's more of a<br>*parenting* issue than a *legal* issue, but as you can see, it can<br>easily become a legal issue unless the parents can get a handle on it<br>right away.<br><br>Look, I'm no saint, and I know my kids are going to be kids and they're<br>going to do stuff. I'm not stupid. So the rules for my boys state that<br>no matter what they do, they may not use drugs, they may not get girls<br>pregnant, and they may not request nor send nudes of any kind. They know<br>my rules, and they know that they'll probably not see much more than the<br>inside of the school and the inside of their rooms until they turn 18 if<br>they break them. As a parent, you must be able to have these<br>conversations with your children, especially if they have access to<br>electronics which can take pictures and send those pictures to other<br>devices.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
