<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [V-MADS is an Active Denial non-lethal system which was<br>developed when field commanders requested a non-lethal system to turn<br>back advancing adversaries. It is a system that fires a 95 GHz frequency<br>transmitter beam directly at advancing personnel. The waves penetrate<br>normal clothing and approximately 1/64th of an inch into the outer layer<br>of the skin and produces an extremely quick, extremely hot sensation.<br>Two seconds in the beam raises skin temperature from normal to 130<br>degrees. It induces the individual\'s natural reaction to withdraw from<br>pain. The pain will stop when the beam is switched off or the target<br>steps out of the beam. You would need to be present in the beam for over<br>200 seconds before you were burned by the beam. The system has a range<br>of approximately 700 yards.\<br>\<br>It can be countered by a variety of methods: thick clothes, trash can<br>lids, even sprayed water that can absorb some of the beam before<br>striking the troops.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
