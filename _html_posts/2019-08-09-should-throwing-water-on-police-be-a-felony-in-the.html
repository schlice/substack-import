<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should throwing water on police be a felony in the US? Why or why<br>not?**<br><br>No. We do not need a new law.<br><br>We already have laws which describe assaulting a police officer. The<br>problem is that city councils do not have the fortitude to tell their<br>police chiefs to enforce those laws when those participants are clearly<br>engaging in targeted harassment while a police officer is actively<br>engaged in enforcing the law (i.e. throwing water on a cop who is making<br>an arrest). It has to be logical though; an officer can still engage in<br>good-natured fun with water without it being viewed as a crime. There<br>will always be plenty of video to show the context in which it happens,<br>not only the officer's body cams. Time to start using those body cams<br>which everyone was clamoring for to enforce the law.<br><br>It is high time for state, regional and local governments to start<br>protecting the police officers *they* have commissioned to do the job of<br>enforcing the laws *they* have written.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
