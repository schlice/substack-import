<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: no.<br><br>Longer answer: It sounds like you are trying to find a middle ground<br>surrounding the use of deadly force. But there are a few things you need<br>to know:<br><br>The firearm is considered *deadly force*. I think that has been fairly<br>well established by now. Guns are designed to kill, and they do so very<br>efficiently.<br><br>Police are not permitted to use lethal force in a specifically<br>non-lethal way.<br><br>*Well, that just seems silly. Why can't they aim for the leg or<br>something?*<br><br>Several reasons:<br><br>1.  It's hard enough to hit what you're aiming at. Now add in the<br>    adrenaline in a high-stress situation, and it gets even harder. New<br>    York City police statistics show that simply hitting a target, let<br>    alone hitting it in a specific spot, is a difficult challenge. In<br>    2006, in cases where police officers intentionally fired a gun at a<br>    person, they discharged 364 bullets and hit their target 103 times,<br>    for a hit rate of 28.3 percent, according to the department's<br>    Firearms Discharge Report. The police shot and killed 13 people that<br>    year. In all shootings --- including those against people, animals<br>    and in suicides and other situations --- New York City officers<br>    achieved a 34 percent accuracy rate (182 out of 540), and a 43<br>    percent accuracy rate when the target ranged from zero to six feet<br>    away. 43% standing no more than six feet away. You really think<br>    someone can accurately hit a person in a foot at 50 yards? In<br>    reality, it would be a miracle if it did happen (note that more<br>    recent statistics are not available as NYPD has gone away from hit<br>    ratios in reporting).<br>2.  Police do not shoot to kill. They also do not shoot to "not kill."<br>    They shoot to stop the threat. The most effective way to stop the<br>    threat is to shoot in the "center of mass" of the individual.<br>    Shooting the periphery of mass may wound, but may not stop the<br>    threat. Our military fighters found this to be true with their M-16s<br>    firing 5.56 NATO rounds. The high-velocity darts would punch clean<br>    through an adversary (which is what they are designed to do --- take<br>    the person out of the fight). In modern warfare, the military found<br>    that not only is that type of wound survivable (good), but it didn't<br>    actually stop these fighters from fighting (not good). They had to<br>    change their bullets to something more substantial to actually stop<br>    the opponent (7.62 rounds, and change from the M-16 to the SCAR).<br>    You stop the act in the most effective way possible. You have a much<br>    greater chance of missing if you don't aim for center mass.<br>    Additionally, even if you shoot for a leg, you can hit something<br>    like the femoral artery and the suspect will bleed out before help<br>    can arrive, and he will be dead anyway.<br>3.  If you have the authority to use your firearm, it is because you<br>    need to stop someone who poses a threat to life or poses a threat of<br>    bodily harm to yourself or to others. The only time police are<br>    shooting a fleeing suspect is when he poses a danger to the lives of<br>    others. This would be a situation which *clearly* called for the use<br>    of lethal force. If lethal force is authorized, trying to use<br>    non-lethal force is counter-intuitive.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
