<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [The short answer is yes, you can file a suit. You would<br/>have a simple tort claim for \"trespassing\" and the case could be made<br/>that the government\'s inaction created the condition which allowed the<br/>trespass onto your property. You\'re going to have a tough time coming<br/>up with a suggested remedy, because there hasn\'t been any<br/>damage\...yet.\<br/>\<br/>This would be the time to petition the city to get the problem addressed<br/>sooner rather than later, because if damage does occur, you will have to<br/>pursue legal action. Make sure you include the city engineering<br/>department as well as the city legal department. Don\'t be surprised if<br/>they try to bully you and say it\'s your fault or whatever; it\'s not.<br/>You are responsible for your property, they for theirs. And if their<br/>property is in a condition that is causing a trespass on to your<br/>property, they are liable for that condition.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
