<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**As voters in a democratic system do we all share responsibility for<br>the actions of those in office? To a degree would you say<br>representatives even a president can only do what the people will<br>allow?**<br><br>No, voters do not share responsibility for what an elected official does<br>while they are in office. Even elected officials are responsible for<br>their own actions, and voters are only responsible for giving the<br>elected official the opportunity to perform actions in office.<br><br>Legally, campaign promises are not enforceable. Therefore, a candidate<br>can say one thing and do another thing once in office. In fact, it<br>happens all the time.<br><br>Voters *should* recognize that they do have a responsibility for using<br>the tools given to them by the nation's founders: when the next election<br>comes up, if the elected official did not perform in the way that you<br>expected/wanted/thought they would/whatever, you take the responsibility<br>you were given and vote for someone else.<br><br>Additionally, you worded your question oddly. We do not have a<br>democratic system. Democracy means that everyone votes on everything. We<br>have a representative government, not a democracy. Representative<br>government means that we vote for *representatives*, people who will<br>represent us, and they vote on everything. If you don't like how your<br>representative is representing you, vote for someone else.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
