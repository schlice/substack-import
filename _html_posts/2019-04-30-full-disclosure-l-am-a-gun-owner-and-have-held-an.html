<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Full disclosure: l am a gun owner and have held an AK-47, and fired an<br>AR-15. As a progressive, I have advocated closing the "gun show<br>loophole" to mandate universal background checks. Why have so many<br>Conservatives never even HEARD of that loophole?**<br><br>Because it doesn't exist.<br><br>Please allow me to explain.<br><br>There are only two types of people who sell guns: people who sell guns<br>for a living, and people who don't. Those categories are defined by<br>BATFE. If you fall into the former, you must obtain a Federal Firearms<br>License, and every person to whom you sell a gun must be run through<br>NICS (the National Instant Criminal Background Check System). If you<br>fall into the latter group, in the vast majority of states, you do not<br>need to do background checks. For example, I own "a few" guns but I<br>don't sell guns for a living. That doesn't mean I can't sell a gun I<br>own. If I do, I'm not required under Federal law to perform a background<br>check on the buyer.<br><br>Now my state may require me to do so (and Colorado does), but Federal<br>law does not.<br><br>This began with the Gun Control Act (GCA) of 1968, which said that<br>unlicensed sellers (i.e. private citizens) can only sell guns to people<br>who live in the same state, and who they reasonably believe are not a<br>prohibited person. It doesn't require that they do background checks.<br>The Firearms Owners Protection Act (FOPA) was passed in 1986, and helped<br>to clarify the GCA. The scope of those who \"engage in the business\" of<br>dealing in firearms (and are therefore required to have a license) was<br>narrowed to include only those who devote \"time, attention, and labor<br>to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the<br>principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive<br>purchase and resale of firearms.\" FOPA excluded those who buy and sell<br>firearms to \"enhance a personal collection\" or for a \"hobby,\" or who<br>\"sell all or part of a personal collection.\" The DOJ said that this<br>clarification was necessary to ensure the GCA did not \"place any undue<br>or unnecessary federal restrictions or burdens on law-abiding<br>citizens\.\"<br><br>While the vast majority of sellers at gun shows are actually dealers<br>(who must actually do background checks), there are always a few private<br>party sellers who come to sell their collection. These private party<br>sellers still don't have to do background checks, even if they are<br>selling at a gun show. Still others will bring personal firearms to a<br>gun show, leave them locked in their car, and watch for other attendees<br>to look at a dealer's gun, and then offer to sell their own private<br>firearm for less. The two then proceed out to the car and make the<br>transaction, with no background check needed, so long as the prospective<br>buyer wasn't background checked at the table and denied.<br><br>The moniker "gun show loophole" makes it appear that *every* sale at a<br>gun show is background check-free, and this simply isn't the case. It's<br>a sloppy name for a provision entered into the GCA to reduce the load on<br>the NICS system. Additionally, a "loophole" is when there is a provision<br>of the law that, while completely legal, produces a completely<br>unintended result. In this case, private sales not requiring background<br>checks is by no means a "loophole." It is an intentional feature added<br>to the law to not \"place any undue or unnecessary federal restrictions<br>or burdens on law-abiding citizens\.\"<br><br>In order to provide all private citizens access to NICS, it would have<br>to be completely redone, as its current implementation couldn't handle<br>the load, and it would pose that unnecessary burden on law-abiding<br>citizens. This would open it up to Constitutional challenges, and I<br>don\'t think lawmakers want to risk the whole thing being struck down as<br>unconstitutional.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
