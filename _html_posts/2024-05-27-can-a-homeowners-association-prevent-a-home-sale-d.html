<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Indirectly.<br><br>They cannot just step in and cancel a sale, but in order to sell the<br>house, the HOA's balance sheet must be clean. If there are any<br>outstanding fines or fees that have been unpaid, those must be paid<br>before the deed can transfer. You need a certificate from the HOA that<br>the account is in good standing before the house can be sold.<br><br>And if the HOA has a *lien* on the house, the house can absolutely not<br>be sold until the lien is cleared and the HOA is paid what they are due.<br>And if there is a lien, then there are multiple fees, fines, late fees,<br>and attorney's fees which must be paid.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
