title: '"Why would a family who are Christian church-goers disown a non church-going
  niece because she gave a vacation house they wanted to a Christian charity for children
  instead of to them? Seems like it would be the opposite."'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We can't speak to why one particular person, or one particular family,<br>would do or not do something.<br><br>People only act in a Godly way when they choose to follow God's will for<br>their lives. And people choose every day to either act in a Godly way or<br>not. Our free will often leads us to choose actions which are not in<br>keeping with "God has prepared for those who love Him" (1 Cor 2:9).<br><br>Their choice doesn't make them Christian or not Christian. It makes them<br>*human*. And again, I can't speak to what they did because I don't know<br>why they did what they did. I can only tell you that *as a Christian*, I<br>can't speak to what they did because that's not what Christianity is<br>about.<br><br>When you become a Christian, you don't automatically do everything in a<br>completely obedient manner. Your flesh remains. Your old habits remain.<br>Your old proclivities remain. It is only through willing and active work<br>and study that you become, over time, a better version of yourself.<br>Sometimes, it's a lifelong process, one which Christians call<br>*sanctification*. Over time, through work and prayer, we become more<br>like God in our thoughts, words, and actions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
