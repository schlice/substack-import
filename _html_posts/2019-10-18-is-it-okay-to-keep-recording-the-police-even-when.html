<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(US Answer)*<br><br>**Is it legal to video record a police officer who is performing his<br>official duties even if he tells you to stop?**<br><br>If you have been ordered by a police officer to stop recording and you<br>fail to do so, you are violating the lawful order of a peace officer,<br>which is illegal.<br><br>Whether or not that order *is actually lawful* is a matter of law<br>which can only be settled by a judge in a courtroom, not on scene<br>between you and the officer.<br><br>So an officer can tell you to stop recording, you can refuse claiming<br>you have a right, and he can arrest you and seize your recording device.<br>But again, whether or not that arrest will hold up in court is a matter<br>for a judge to decide.<br><br>There are two competing interests: the police may have a valid reason to<br>disallow recording, and you have a First Amendment right to record<br>anyone in a public place. Only a judge can sort out whose interests take<br>precedence in any particular case.<br><br>**TL;DR: If you have been ordered to stop recording, it is illegal to<br>continue recording.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
