<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Everybody's answers are spot on here. A neurosurgeon who has specialized<br>in MS can certainly treat an MS patient. But it's like having a NASCAR<br>mechanic fix your car: it's overkill. Neurosurgeons are far more<br>specialized, and have moved from general neurology into neurosurgery, an<br>area which is decidedly not where MS lives.<br><br>You are, in general, better off finding a neurologist who specializes in<br>MS. You're most oft to find those in "MS centers" which is a neurology<br>department which specializes in treating MS. There, all of the<br>neurologists, PAs and nurses are MS specialists. If you need ancillary<br>care, they will refer you to specialists who are well-versed with MS.<br>For example, I needed a GI consult; my neurologist referred me to the GI<br>doc who was most well-versed in MS drugs, and had taken previous<br>referrals of MS patients on oral drugs.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
