<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Bible doesn't say anything about homophobia. But I will tell you<br>that the Bible declares that homosexual activity is indeed sinful, so<br>clearly in fact that it defies reinterpretation. "Sexism" is only a<br>thing insofar as the Bible definitely has well-defined gender roles, as<br>God designed men and women for specific tasks and equipped them properly<br>to do those tasks.<br><br>Believing that the Bible does not say what it clearly says is not<br>something that Christian believers do. We believe that the Bible is<br>inerrant, and it's really, really easy to find out whether or not the<br>BIble was "misinterpreted" or had anything "added" to it, because we<br>have it in its original languages. We can therefore see the original<br>words as they were written, so you can find out for yourself whether or<br>not anything was "misinterpreted" or "added." There are even websites<br>which will show you, side by side, the original language and the<br>modern-day translations. I would recommend BibleHub to you if you are<br>interested in doing that work yourself, and if you question whether the<br>Bible says what it clearly says, I encourage you to use that resource.<br><br>[http://www.biblehub.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fce8e1&url=http://www.biblehub.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>You can absolutely call yourself Christian. Many people call themselves<br>Christians. Mormons call themselves Christians (their official church<br>name even has Jesus in it), even though they hold beliefs which run<br>counter to those core Christian beliefs we expect to see in Christians.<br><br>But *calling* yourself Christian doesn't *make* you a Christian.<br><br>\<br><br>Here's the problem with your belief.<br><br>If you believe Jesus is your savior, how do you know? From where do you<br>get your information? Is it from the Bible? If it is, how can you trust<br>that the Bible is reliable if you believe that the Bible has errors?<br><br>What exactly is the Bible wrong about? And how do you know it is wrong?<br>Because either the Bible is the unequivocal standard of what is true, or<br>something else is.<br><br>In order for you to say the Bible is wrong, you must know what is right.<br>Where do you get your standard of right and wrong if it is not from the<br>Bible?<br><br>And that's the problem. Usually, the answer is "because sexism and<br>homophobia is wrong, society says so." Usually, you will cite some<br>source for morals outside of God and outside of the Bible, and none of<br>those sources are reliable or universal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
