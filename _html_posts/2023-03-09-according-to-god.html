<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You are correct, the Bible says clearly that Jesus did not sin (c.f. 2<br>Cor 5:1, 1 Peter 2:22). The question you pose, of course, is *how* did<br>Jesus not sin.<br><br>And the answer comes down to whether or not Jesus was *capable* of sin.<br>We believe the clear teaching of the Bible is that Jesus was<br>*impeccable*; He was not capable of sin.<br><br>Jesus was born sinless because He did not inherit the sin of Adam by<br>being conceived of a man. Therefore, He did not have sin within Him. Sin<br>is, by definition, breaking God's law. Since Jesus is God, Jesus cannot<br>sin because Jesus (God) cannot violate His own nature and break His own<br>law.<br><br>Jesus was indeed tempted, but He never sinned because He is incapable of<br>sin. Temptation alone is not sin, as Satan tempted Jesus in the desert<br>and He still did not sin. Temptation is experiencing an outside<br>influence suggesting that you sin. *Going beyond the temptation* would<br>be to consider actually sinning and to consider the possible pleasures<br>and consequences of such an act, *to the degree that the act is already<br>taking place in your mind*. That is sin. Jesus never did that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
