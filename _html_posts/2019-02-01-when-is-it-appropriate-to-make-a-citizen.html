<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When can you, as a caring citizen, make a citizen\'s arrest?<br><br>It sounds like you might be sincere and actually want to help, which is<br>why you phrased it as making a citizen's arrest as a caring citizen.<br><br>Let me give you a piece of advice:<br><br>*don't.*<br><br>Don't make a citizen's arrest. They are legally perilous, physically<br>dangerous, and in most cases, unnecessary. They will cause you many<br>months of ongoing legal issues that you simply don't need to subject<br>yourself to.<br><br>*So what should I do instead?*<br><br>*BE A GOOD WITNESS.*<br><br>While you're sitting there watching (and recording on your phone),<br>answer the W questions (who/what/when/where/why) *in as much detail as<br>you can muster.* What was the person wearing? How did their hair look?<br>How did their skin look? How did they speak? What words did they say?<br>Did any of their mannerisms stick out to you? Which way did they leave?<br>Did they walk or get into a car? Did you get the plate? Were they<br>holding anything?<br><br>Then, while you're waiting for the police to arrive, review the video.<br>Answer the questions again, but don't change your answers even if you<br>see something funny on the screen. Be able to relate your answers to<br>what you see, but if you can't, just remember that and continue, don't<br>change your answer.<br><br>When the police get there, tell them everything, show them your video,<br>and make yourself available for whatever questions they want to ask you.<br><br>This puts you in a much more secure legal position than anything else<br>ever could. Trust me, you're much better off being a witness than being<br>somebody trying to effect an arrest.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
