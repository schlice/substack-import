<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer is yes, but with many governmental caveats.<br><br>The FCC governs transmitting radio base units, so you would have to be<br>licensed by them in order to operate your radar station. Anything over a<br>certain transmit wattage is regulated. Very small transmitters are<br>unregulated (for example, the transmitter which plugs into the cigarette<br>lighter in your car and allows you to play your phone's music onto a<br>quiet FM frequency which can be received by your car stereo).<br><br>Your radar station would also have to be separately certified for<br>operation by the FCC. They would have to understand the total output of<br>the station and on what frequencies so they can understand the overlap<br>your station may have with other nearby stations. This, by the way, was<br>the original charter of the FCC, regulating radio and television<br>stations to avoid frequency overlap.<br><br>The parts to build your radar station are not individually regulated.<br>You can build a radar station, you just can't operate it without the<br>proper licensing for yourself and certification of the station.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
