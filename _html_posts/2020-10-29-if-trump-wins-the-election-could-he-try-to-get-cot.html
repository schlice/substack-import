<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If Trump wins the election, could he try to get COTUS and SCOTUS to<br>change the 22nd amendment so he could run a third time?**<br><br>In order to be able to modify a Constitutional Amendment, you must<br>pass a new amendment which supersedes the old one. There are a very<br>limited number of ways this can be done, and none of them involve the<br>Supreme Court, nor do they involve the President. It is done in two<br>phases:<br><br>1.  The Amendment must be written<br>2.  The Amendment must be ratified<br><br>To write the Amendment, the Constitution allows for two methods:<br><br>- A supermajority of Congress (both houses) must pass a Bill of<br>  Amendment. This is the preferred method for writing a Constitutional<br>  Amendment. All of our existing Constitutional Amendments were written<br>  in this way.<br>- 34 states can call for and convene a Constitutional Convention<br>  (sometimes called an "Article V Convention" since it is described in<br>  Article V of the Constitution). In the entire history of the nation,<br>  this has never been implemented, even though the Constitution has<br>  instructions for doing so. The reason it is in there is so that states<br>  always retain the power to amend the Constitution, even over the<br>  collective will (or lack thereof) of the Congress. The down side to an<br>  Article V Convention is that *multiple* items can be written or<br>  amended, all at one time. This cannot be done with a Bill of Amendment<br>  in Congress; you would need a separate Bill for each Amendment you<br>  wish to ratify. This makes an Article V Convention a very risky<br>  proposition.<br><br>Once the Amendment is written, it is distributed to the states to be<br>ratified. 38 states need to ratify the Amendment (or if you're a<br>"glass half empty" type, 12 states are all that is needed to kill an<br>Amendment). How the states ratify the Amendment is up to them, but<br>usually it will be by statewide ballots, just like ballot initiatives<br>that you would normally see on Election Day.<br><br>So now that we've answered the "how" it could happen, let's discuss the<br>"could" question.<br><br>Could Trump try to get Congress to change the 22nd Amendment so that he<br>could run again? Sure he could. But remember, you need a *supermajority*<br>of Congress (that means you need 2/3 of *both houses of Congress*) to do<br>it, and there's a snowball's chance in The Hot Place that that'll ever<br>happen. The last time Congress agreed on anything was right after 9/11,<br>and that wasn't even unanimous.<br><br>And all changing the 22nd Amendment does is *allow him to* *run*<br>*again*. It says nothing about his ability to get *elected* again. You<br>think the RNC would put him up against a Nikki Haley (if she were to<br>run)? Heck no, they'd have her in there in a hot second. Trump would<br>never get the nomination over Haley. I'm sure we're going to have quite<br>a few Republicans who are more, shall we say, *temperate* than our<br>current president who will run in 2024. They're already planning on it,<br>even without Trump being able to run again.<br><br>**TL;DR: Trump can certainly ask Congress to amend the Constitution, but<br>there's little chance they would do it, and all it does is allow him to<br>run again, and there's even less chance the American people would**<br>*nominate* him a third time, let alone *elect* him.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
