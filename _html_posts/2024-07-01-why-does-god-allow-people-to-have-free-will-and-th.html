<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Love, by definition, must be freely given. It cannot be coerced.<br><br>C. S. Lewis wrote, "the Irresistible and the Indisputable are the two<br>weapons which the very nature of \God's\ scheme forbids Him to use.<br>Merely to over-ride a human will (as His felt presence in any but the<br>faintest and most mitigated degree would certainly do) would be for Him<br>useless. He cannot ravish. He can only woo."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
