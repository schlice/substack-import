And if you don't get people<br>in their right mind, you get *everyone else*, and I'm not sure that<br>accomplishes your goal, either.<br><br>It's hard enough to get officers to fill job vacancies with the months<br>of tests and evaluations that must be done before you are even offered a<br>job. In 2013, out of a pool of about 200 applicants, we were able to<br>field a class of 14 recruits. 14 out of 200. That's 7%. And if you don't<br>protect officers from frivolous lawsuits which could personally bankrupt<br>them just for doing the job you asked them to do, how many people are<br>going to show up for that first test? And they might, in your words, go<br>to jail or be killed for doing the job you asked them to do. Who's going<br>to do that? 100 if you're lucky, but I'd bet it's far fewer than that.<br>What's 7% of 50? 4. You can't field a new class with 4 recruits. And<br>with the new legislation going in to place to prevent police brutality,<br>there's only going to be more restrictions on who can enter law<br>enforcement academies, not less.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
