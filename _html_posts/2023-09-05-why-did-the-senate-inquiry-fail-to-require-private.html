<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because a Senate inquiry is not how you change law. The Hyde Amendment<br>is still the law of the land, and has been re-enacted every year since<br>1976. It is not a permanent law, but rather a temporary "rider" to the<br>Congressional appropriations bill. Congress has the opportunity to lift<br>the Hyde Amendment each year, but they have added it to the<br>appropriations bill every year.<br><br>The Hyde Amendment prohibits federal Medicaid funding for abortion<br>services. The only exceptions are when continuing the pregnancy will<br>endanger the patient\'s life, or when the pregnancy results from rape or<br>incest. These circumstances are considered medically necessary health<br>services.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
