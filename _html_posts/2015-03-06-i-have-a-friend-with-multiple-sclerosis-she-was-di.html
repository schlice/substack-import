<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If you are there for her, there\'s no \"wrong thing\" you<br>can say or do.\<br>\<br>Just let her know that while you don\'t fully understand what she feels<br>because of her disease, you\'re there for her in whatever way she<br>needs.\<br>\<br>Most MS patients have symptoms which can\'t be seen, and really the only<br>way you know she has MS is when she has trouble walking. Just having<br>someone there who knows that \"how you look on the outside is completely<br>different from how you feel on the inside\" is a great<br>comfort.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
