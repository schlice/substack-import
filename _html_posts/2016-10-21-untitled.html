<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I understand it, but I don't agree with it. If the town doesn't want to<br>pay firefighters, that's all well and good. But not providing them with<br>resources to do their jobs is simply criminal, and violates the spirit<br>of the Constitution in many ways. It's sad that volunteer fire<br>departments have to hold bake sales to buy fire trucks.<br><br>And thanks for adding your opinion, but you really should have made this<br>an answer to the original question, rather than a comment on my answer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-do-police-officers-and-firefighters-need-to-do-fund-raising/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
