<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I'm 15 years old and a VERY lukewarm Christian. I really, really want<br>to know Jesus, but I have no idea where to start. Do you have any<br>advice?**<br><br>I want to tell you to go dig in to the Bible, because all the answers<br>are there, but reading the Bible with a correctly-oriented heart is<br>important.<br><br>So I think it's more important to become "less-lukewarm" in your faith<br>before you really dig in to the Bible. You'll really get more benefit<br>from your time with the Bible if your heart is in the right frame.<br><br>Let me suggest a great book, easy to read, that may help you tease out a<br>little more faith and a little less lukewarm-ness: [[*I Don't Have<br>Enough Faith To Be An<br>Atheist*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=317866&url=https://smile.amazon.com/Dont-Have-Enough-Faith-Atheist/dp/1581345615){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container} by Norm Geisler and Frank<br>Turek. They use discussion, based on logic and reason, not the Bible, to<br>help explain why faith in Christ is not only reasonable, but is actually<br>more rational than unbelief.<br><br>*Then* you can follow the advice of my contemporaries here on this<br>answer and dig in to the Bible to learn even more about Christ and how<br>to live as a Christian.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
