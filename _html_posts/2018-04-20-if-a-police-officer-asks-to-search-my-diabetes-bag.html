I transported the needles inside the<br>blister pack (so it was clear what was inside) and along with it, I<br>transported the prescription for the same medication.<br><br>Police know about diabetes. I don't think you'll be in for too much<br>hassle so long as you have your insulin with your other supplies and<br>hopefully a prescription card (which you should also have).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
