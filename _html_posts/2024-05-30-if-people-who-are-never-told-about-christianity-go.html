<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer to your question is yes. *IF* people who are never<br>told about Christianity go to heaven because they had no chance to<br>learn, it would be better for us Christians to tell nobody about it.<br><br>Which begs the question: ***do people who are never told about<br>Christianity go to heaven?***<br><br>The answer to *that* question is **no. People do not automatically go to<br>heaven if they never heard about Christ during their lives.**<br><br>As others have pointed out:<br><br>> Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes<br>> to the Father except through me." --- John 14:6 NIV<br><br>The only way to the Father is through Jesus. It is only faith in Christ<br>which is a saving faith.<br><br>Additionally, all people are accountable to God whether or not they have<br>"heard about Him." The Bible tells us that God has clearly revealed<br>Himself in nature:<br><br>> For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities---his<br>> eternal power and divine nature---have been clearly seen, being<br>> understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.<br>> --- Romans 1:20 NIV<br><br>God has also been clearly revealed in the hearts of people:<br><br>> He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity<br>> in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from<br>> beginning to end. --- Ecclesiastes 3:11 NIV<br><br>The problem is that the human race is sinful; we reject this knowledge<br>of God and rebel against Him:<br><br>> For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave<br>> thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish<br>> hearts were darkened. Although they claimed to be wise, they became<br>> fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to<br>> look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles ---<br>> Romans 1:21-23 NIV<br><br>If it were not for God's salvific grace, we would be given over to the<br>sinful desires of our hearts, and we would perish. So the reality is not<br>that people haven't heard of God. The reality is that people have<br>rejected what they have seen in nature and has been written in their<br>hearts. If they were to not reject what they have seen in nature, and if<br>they were to seek Him, they would find Him.<br><br>> But if from there you seek the Lord your God, you will find him if you<br>> seek him with all your heart and with all your soul. --- Deuteronomy<br>> 4:29 NIV<br><br>But no one seeks Him:<br><br>> there is no one who understands;\<br>> there is no one who seeks God. --- Romans 3:11 NIV<br><br>The Bible is telling us that people reject the truth of God seen in<br>nature and written in their hearts. But those people are responsible to<br>God for their response to that knowledge. The Bible doesn't say anything<br>about how unfair it is for those who simply haven't heard the Gospel.<br>The Bible says that people have rejected the knowledge they already<br>have. Therefore, God is just in allowing them to choose hell.<br><br>\<br><br>That said, we should not be debating how fair it is for people who<br>haven't heard the Gospel to be condemned to hell. **We should be<br>focusing on our own responsibility in this situation.**<br><br>That responsibility is the Great Commission.<br><br>> Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on<br>> earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all<br>> nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and<br>> of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have<br>> commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the<br>> age." --- Matthew 28:18--20 NIV<br><br>Rather than focusing on whether or not people who have never heard the<br>Gospel will go to hell, we should be focusing on how we can reach these<br>people and ensure that they have had an opportunity to hear the Gospel.<br>As we have discussed, people reject the knowledge they have learned from<br>nature and their own hearts. As such, it is even more imperative that we<br>reach them with the Gospel message. Because in this case, it is only the<br>grace of God through Christ that will save them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
