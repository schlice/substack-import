<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Democrats, if Julie Swetnick\'s accusations are true, do you think she<br>should be charged with aiding and abetting 10+ cases of gang rape for<br>failure to report them years ago?**<br><br>I'm not a Democrat, but I'm going to answer anyway, because your<br>assumptions are slightly off.<br><br>*(EDIT) Maryland has no laws which require reporting of a rape.*<br><br>But I see where you're going. Since none of this has anything to do with<br>the criminal justice system, and it's all about credibility, we have as<br>much right to look at Julie Swetnick and determine if she is credible,<br>just as we are looking at Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford to see just how<br>credible their stories are.<br><br>So let's do that, shall we? Let's have a quick look at Julie Swetnick's<br>story and see just how credible it is.<br><br>1.  She claims to have attended "more than ten" drug-and-rape parties.<br>    Is this rational? Is this credible? Would any rational human being<br>    go to *one* drug-and-rape party and then decide, of their own<br>    volition, to go back to a *second*, let alone *ten*?<br>2.  She says she believes that women were raped at that party. How does<br>    she know? Did she talk to these women? Or is she just assuming that<br>    the sex was not consensual?<br>3.  She says she saw boys lined up to enter a room to "train" a girl.<br>    Again, is she certain that this is what was going on? Was she sure<br>    that this wasn't just the line for the bathroom?\<br>    \<br>    And of course, the elephant in the room:<br>4.  If she was aware that in over ten occurrences of these parties that<br>    sexual assaults were taking place, **why didn't she tell anyone? Why<br>    didn't she make an anonymous call to the police? Anything?** Again,<br>    is this rational human behavior?<br><br>There are only three possibilities for what happened at these alleged<br>parties that Ms. Swetnick claims to have attended:<br><br>- It is all a lie. It is nothing but a complete fabrication.<br>- The parties did happen, and sex was happening at these parties, but it<br>  wasn't rape. The people who attended these parties were all looking to<br>  have sex, and the sex was all consensual.<br>- Judge Kavanaugh and all of his friends are closet serial gang-rapists,<br>  and Ms. Swetnick knew this fact, but kept coming back to the parties<br>  anyway, with her fingers crossed that she wasn't going to be next.<br><br>The first two options are actually believable. People do lie. People do<br>have sex. People do lie about having sex. These things do happen. and it<br>is consistent with human nature. The third option is less believable,<br>because it is inconsistent with human nature. Yet she is claiming that<br>the third option is the truth, which makes her claim less believable<br>because it is inconsistent with human nature.<br><br>Finally, as you mentioned, she claims to have attended these parties in<br>the 80s, when she herself graduated in 1980. Therefore, if this is true,<br>she was an adult, attending parties where underage sexual assaults were<br>taking place, and she failed to report it, after seeing it happen<br>multiple times. This changes the short list a little bit:<br><br>- She's lying about the whole thing<br>- She was a willing participant<br><br>So if her story is to be believed at all, and if the parties did take<br>place, it appears most likely that there was no rape, and that all of<br>the sex was consensual, and that women repeatedly attended these parties<br>for the express purpose of having sex.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
