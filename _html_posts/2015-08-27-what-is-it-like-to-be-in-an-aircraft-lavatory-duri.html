<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There is an oxygen mask in the lav. If there is rapid<br>decompression while you are in the lav, the door will pop open and you<br>will see your mask, or it will drop out of the compartment (depending on<br>lav configuration). If this happens, **put your mask on and stay<br>there.** Feel free to get up off the bowl if you so choose, but I\'d<br>hang on while the plane completes rapid descent. Once the flight<br>attendants make the announcement that masks are no longer needed, **take<br>your mask off and return to your seat as quickly and safely as you<br>can.**]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
