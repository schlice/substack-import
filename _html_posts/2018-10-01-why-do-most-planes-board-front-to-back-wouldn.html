<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Mythbusters actually tested this, as there are multiple ways to board an<br>aircraft. They actually found that the back-to-front method is the<br>slowest way to board an aircraft.<br><br>> To allow them to easily test various boarding methods, Adam and Jamie<br>> built an accurate replica of an airliner's interior that included 173<br>> real airplane seats as well as real overhead luggage compartments.<br>> Volunteers were staged at a simulated boarding gate and were given<br>> tickets with their seat assignments before each of the tests. To<br>> further simulate reality, 5% of the passengers were given instructions<br>> to behave problematically by going "upstream", sitting in the wrong<br>> seat, boarding with small children, or wasting time by folding a coat<br>> in the aisle. Professional flight attendants were also brought in to<br>> assist with the boarding process.<br>><br>> Each method of boarding was judged objectively on the time it took to<br>> board all of the passengers and subjectively by the passengers'<br>> satisfaction after each boarding experience. The satisfaction score<br>> was calculated as a sum of votes wherein "great" votes earned 1 point,<br>> "neutral" votes earned 0 points, and "terrible" votes earned -1<br>> points.<br>><br>> These are the results from the boarding methods that were tested:<br>><br>> :::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>> ::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>> !(images/qimg-9ff62aeb39be39dbfd0de13a19bbc995){.landscape<br>> .qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>> master_src="images/qimg-9ff62aeb39be39dbfd0de13a19bbc995"<br>> master_w="843" master_h="357"}<br>> :::<br>> ::::<br><br>You can see that the "Southwest Method" (no assigned seats) is actually<br>the fastest boarding method, but it earned the lowest satisfaction<br>score. You can see that the WILMA (Window, Middle, Aisle) method, and<br>the zoned WILMA method (Rear zone WILMA, Middle zone WILMA, Front zone<br>WILMA), and the Reverse Pyramid method, while all somewhat slower than<br>the Southwest Method, earned some of the highest customer satisfaction<br>scores in the test.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
