<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Pantheism is not compatible with any of these other religions, as they<br>are all *theistic religions*. Pantheism, as the name impllies, is a<br>*pantheistic* religion.<br><br>Most of the world's major religions fall into one of three main<br>categories: theism, pantheism, and atheism.<br><br>Theism is the belief that a personal God created the universe, but<br>is not part of the universe. Think about the analogy of a painter and<br>his painting. Theism would believe that God is the painter and the<br>universe is the painting. Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and Baha'i are<br>all theistic religions.<br><br>Pantheism is the belief that there is an impersonal god who<br>literally *is* the universe. So in our painting example, rather than<br>making the painting, Pantheists believe God *is* the painting. In fact,<br>Pantheists believe God is *everything*. God is the sky. God is a tree.<br>God is the air. God is you, God is me, etc. Most Eastern religions<br>(Hinduism, some forms of Buddhism) and many "New Age" religions are<br>pantheistic.<br><br>Finally, Atheism does not believe in any form of god. To keep the<br>painting example, atheists believe that the painting simply always<br>existed, and no one created it. Religious humanists fall into this<br>category.<br><br>Here's an easy way to remember the three religious worldviews:<br><br>- Theism: God *created* all<br>- Pantheism: God *is* all<br>- Atheism: *No* God at all.<br><br>TL;DR: To answer your question, Pantheism is not compatible with any<br>of the religions you listed, as they are all theistic religions which<br>believe in a personal God who created the universe but is not part of<br>the universe, while pantheism believes that God *is* the universe. Feel<br>free to read their books, but the religions are fundamentally<br>incompatible.<br><br>To answer the last part of your question, Abrahamism is another name for<br>monotheistic religions which believe in the God of Abraham, such as<br>every one you listed.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is Pantheism compatible with Christianity, Judaism, Islam, or Bahá'í? I<br>am a Pantheist, but I want to read the Bible, Tanakh, and Quran. Are<br>Pantheism and Abrahamism compatible?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
