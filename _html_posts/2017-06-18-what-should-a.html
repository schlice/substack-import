<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There was an inherent problem in the Castile case. Castile was working<br>under two separate orders: reach for your license, but don't reach for<br>your gun.<br><br>In my opinion, the police erred by telling Castile to simultaneously<br>reach for his license but not reach for his gun, making it very<br>difficult for the officer to distinguish between the two "reaches." The<br>officer still feared for his life, which was the only reason why he was<br>acquitted of murder charges. That doesn't make the incident any less<br>tragic. It also doesn't fit the BLM mantra of racist cops just looking<br>for reasons to kill blacks.<br><br>It makes no difference why he was in fear for his life: whether Castile<br>was black, whether or not the officer was racist, or because Castile had<br>a gun. It doesn't matter. The police officer told Castile to do<br>something, and then shot him for doing exactly what he was told. The<br>police officer should have been held accountable for causing the error<br>that led to Castile's death, and I'm sure he will be held to account in<br>civil court, when Castile's family follows with their wrongful death<br>suit. Murder wasn't going to stick, but I see a very clear case of<br>wrongful death here.<br><br>There's no evidence that the officer was afraid for his life because<br>Castile was black. That's not why the officer should have been<br>convicted. He should have been convicted because Castile died following<br>the lawful orders of the police.<br><br>Don't turn his death into something that it's not.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
