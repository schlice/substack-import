Is it for the remainder of the term or for a whole additional<br>four years?**<br><br>Impeachment is a two-part process.<br><br>1.  The House must vote to approve Articles of Impeachment against the<br>    President. You only need a simple majority of Representatives to<br>    pass the Articles. With Democrats in control of the House, if they<br>    all vote in lock-step, you can pass Articles of Impeachment. At that<br>    point, the President is said to have been "impeached."<br>2.  The Senate must hold a trial. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court<br>    (currently John Roberts) will preside over the trial. The trial will<br>    determine whether or not the President should be removed from<br>    office. You will need 67 votes in the Senate (a 2/3 majority) to<br>    remove the President from office. With Republicans in control of the<br>    Senate, there's no way in Hades that you'll get 67 people to vote to<br>    remove the President from office. Yeah, you might get a few RINOs to<br>    vote to remove, but not nearly enough to reach 67 votes.<br><br>But to answer the question I think you were trying to ask, if the<br>President is impeached *and removed from office,* the Vice President<br>becomes President and then remains President for the remainder of the<br>current term.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
