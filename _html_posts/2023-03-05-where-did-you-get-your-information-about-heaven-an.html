<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Where did you get your information about Heaven and Hell? \...\ Who<br>> told you? Why do you believe them?<br><br>I understand your questions, but you're coming at the problem from the<br>wrong direction.<br><br>As Christians, we have studied and researched the Bible. We know that<br>the Bible is the inspired word of God.<br><br>This is an important point, and you must understand that we as<br>Christians believe this. Since this answer isn't about proving the truth<br>of the Bible, to answer your question, you simply must understand that<br>Christians believe in the truth of the Bible.<br><br>Taking the logic further:<br><br>- The Bible is the inspired Word of God.<br>- The Bible discusses Heaven and Hell.<br>- Therefore, the message of Heaven and Hell comes from God.<br><br>> Since no one has ever come back from death, how did you find out?<br><br>Actually, two men have come back from the dead: Lazarus, and Jesus.<br>Lazarus was dead for four days, and Jesus was dead for three days,<br>before they were resurrected. This information is, once again, recorded<br>in the Bible. The statements of eyewitnesses were passed down until they<br>were written, which surprisingly didn't take all that long from the<br>actual events before they were recorded. At that time, things weren't<br>quickly written down. For example, the first writings about Alexander<br>the Great were written nearly 300 years after his death, while writings<br>of the resurrection of Jesus was written 40 years after His death<br>(although that archaeological writing fragment is currently disputed)<br>but was recorded by 10 *non-Christian* writers within 150 years of His<br>death and resurrection. Add onto that the number of Christian writers<br>detailing those events, and you have as much documentation about the<br>life, death, and resurrection of Jesus as was written about Tiberius<br>Caesar, the emperor at the time.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
