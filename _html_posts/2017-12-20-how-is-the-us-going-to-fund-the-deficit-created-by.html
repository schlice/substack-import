<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How is the US going to fund the deficit created by the new tax<br>legislation that was recently passed by Congress?**<br><br>*It won't! We've just indebted our children and our children's children<br>for the next 1245607656.7 years!*<br><br>*We're just going to borrow more money from China!*<br><br>*Duh! Corporations aren't going to re-invest that money! They're going<br>to line their own pockets with it!*<br><br>Thankfully, there are some people in the world who are still rational<br>thinkers.<br><br>The figures that are being used to show that these tax cuts will raise<br>the deficit come from the Congressional Budget Office. It still amazes<br>me that such a group exists, since Congress hasn't passed a Budget in<br>decades. But that's neither here nor there. The CBO also doesn't know<br>how to factor time value of money or discounting.<br><br>But in all cases, **it is above-average spending, not below-average<br>revenues,** which accounted for 92 percent of rising budget deficits by<br>2014 and will account for 100 percent by the end of 2017.<br><br>So it's cool that we're really worried about the tax cuts causing<br>deficits in the same way that dropping a rock into the Pacific will<br>cause a tidal wave.<br><br>So, a few takeaways to quash the nay-sayers:<br><br>1. Declining revenues do not drive future deficits.<br><br>In fact, it is *runaway entitlement spending*, not declining<br>government revenue, that drives the deficit. Even with the tax cuts,<br>revenues are still expected to outpace their historical averages.<br><br>2. You can't tax your way out of a deficit.<br><br>If we're going to stick with numbers from the CBO, in order to finance<br>the Obama administration's 10 percent of GDP long-term cost increase for<br>Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, it would require permanently<br>raising taxes by \$12,000 per household (adjusted for both inflation and<br>income growth). You must stop runaway spending in order to fix the<br>deficit.<br><br>**3. Even with modest GDP increases caused by tax cuts, they do pay for<br>themselves.**<br><br>If the tax cut adds 0.3% to the GDP (and everything else stays the same,<br>which is not true either), the deficit caused by the tax cuts would be<br>paid off in 27 years. But even that fails to take into account the<br>discounting factor (future money is less valuable than today's money) so<br>that figure is still too high.<br><br>Over the past 50 years, Washington has collected an average of 18% of<br>GDP in revenue, spent 20.3% of GDP, running a sustainable deficit of<br>2.3% of GDP. And even as tax revenue changes, government revenue from<br>taxes has rarely strayed from that 18% figure.<br><br>So if you want to fix the deficit, focus on fixing the plank of runaway<br>entitlement spending, don't worry so much about the speck of tax cuts.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
