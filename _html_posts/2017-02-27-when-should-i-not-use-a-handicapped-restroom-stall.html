<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Any time you can avoid it. This is not a hard-and-fast rule; anyone can<br>use that stall at any time. But the purpose is to afford the<br>wheelchair-bound a place to maneuver with handrails, so it is a<br>c*onvenience* for you, but it is a *necessity* for them. So there are no<br>"laws" against it (that I know of; states are weird though so your<br>mileage may vary), but it is a matter of *common courtesy* to leave the<br>stall open for the wheelchair-bound.<br><br>If all the other stalls are occupied and there are no persons in<br>wheelchairs waiting for a stall, you may use it.<br><br>Otherwise, try to use a standard-sized stall if you can.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
