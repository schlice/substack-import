<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What can you do if you don\'t want to sign a mandatory arbitration<br>clause in a cellphone or other utility contract (requiring disputes be<br>handled this way)?**<br><br>You don't sign the contract.<br><br>Is there an alternative besides not signing up for the service?<br><br>Of course. There are always other carriers, right? Especially for<br>utilities in your community, right?<br><br>That would be normally true, if they all didn't do it. And they all do.<br><br>Until the FCC gets off of its collective bums and forces carriers to no<br>longer include forced arbitration clauses in their contracts, this<br>practice will continue. But in some cases, courts have looked<br>disfavorably at those clauses, finding that they unreasonably restricted<br>consumers' right to get viable relief. In the Cingular Wireless case of<br>2007, Washington State allowed customers to file a class action lawsuit<br>because it found that the forced arbitration clause was "grossly unfair<br>and blocked the customers from obtaining meaningful relief."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
