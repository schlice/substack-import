<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>The best treatment for MS is the one that works the best for the<br>patient.<br><br>First, not all MS medications are indicated for use in all forms of MS.<br>Most of the disease modifying drugs (DMDs) available today treat the<br>disease by managing inflammation caused by the disease process.<br>Normally, inflammation is only present in relapsing/remitting forms of<br>the disease. Progressive forms of the disease do not present<br>inflammation as the mechanism of action; they present a steady<br>neurodegeneration, so the traditional DMDs are ineffective (for the most<br>part) against progressive forms of the disease.<br><br>However, for relapsing forms of the disease, each medication works a<br>little bit differently, but they all accomplish the same things: they<br>reduce the severity of relapses, they increase the amount of time<br>between relapses, and they slow the disease action in the brain.<br><br>Moreover, each medication works differently in each patient. Some people<br>respond well to synthetics like Copaxone, others find no benefit from<br>such medications. Some people benefit from beta-blockers (interferons)<br>like Avonex, Betaseron, Rebif, and similar, some only get the side<br>effects, but don\'t see any significant improvement in disease activity.<br>So there is a little bit of \"trial and error\" with the medications.<br><br>Basically, as a patient, you have to consider a few factors, namely the<br>efficacy of the medicine (how well it works) and the method of<br>administration (how you take it). There are three administration methods<br>available today:<br><br>- injection<br>- infusion<br>- oral<br><br>The injectables are either sub-cutaneous (SC), which means \"under the<br>skin,\" or intra-muscular (IM), which means \"in the muscle.\"<br>Betaseron, Rebif, and Copaxone are SC, and Avonex is IM. Betaseron and<br>Copaxone are taken every other day, Rebif is taken three times a week.<br>Avonex is once a week. Copaxone used to be daily, but the dosing<br>protocol and dosage have changed. Tysabri is available by infusion every<br>four weeks at an infusion center. The orals are taken daily; Gilenya,<br>Tecfidera, and Aubagio are some examples of the orals available today.<br><br>Once you decide on a method of administration, you need to look at the<br>efficacy (how well it works) and decide if a drug with another method of<br>administration might be more effective, and then you need to decide<br>which is more important to you: the method by which you take the<br>medicine, or how effective it is against the disease. You may choose to<br>sacrifice a little efficacy for a more acceptable method of<br>administration. Or you may not care so much about the administration,<br>but you want the most effective medicine you can get. It\'s a balancing<br>act.<br><br>Ultimately, you and your neurologist will need to decide together which<br>medicine will be best for you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
