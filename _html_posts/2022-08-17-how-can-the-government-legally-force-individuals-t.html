<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is an excellent question!<br><br>When we mandated the vaccine, we forced people to do something that only<br>benefited them, not anyone else. Sure, at a base level, getting<br>vaccinated may have contributed to fewer hospitalizations, so it may<br>have reduced some of the load on the hospitals, but by the time mass<br>vaccination was rolling out, hospitalizations were already on the<br>decline.<br><br>So it only makes sense to continue the logic. I mean, if we forced<br>people to do something for their own good *once*, why can't we *do it<br>again?*<br><br>There are SOOOOOO MANY areas in which we can force people to do the<br>most healthy things:<br><br>- A nationwide moratorium on all sugar, in all forms. Sorry baking<br>  community, but your stuff is unhealthy. Learn how to use natural<br>  products like fruit juices, stevia and honey to sweeten things.<br>  Processed sugar will go the way of the internal combustion engine. We<br>  can literally cut the rate of type-2 diabetes in half with one law.<br>- Literally shut down every fast-food restaurant in the country (with a<br>  few carefully selected exceptions, and even those would have their<br>  menus and food offerings closely scrutinized). Any unhealthy eating<br>  outside of the home causes a drain on the healthcare system.<br>- Every restaurant in America will have to have their menu approved by<br>  the government, and any restaurant which cannot modify its menu to<br>  meet strict health guidelines will be immediately and unceremoniously<br>  closed down.<br>- Then, to ensure that people are actually eating correctly, we can<br>  install cameras in their kitchens so we can see what they are feeding<br>  their children, and we can send CDC goons immediately to their houses<br>  if they try to feed anything unhealthy. It is for our good, after all,<br>  because unhealthy people are a drain on the healthcare system.<br>- Everyone gets a government-issued Fitbit and you must wear it and it<br>  must connect back to the government. You must get 10,000 steps a day<br>  and you must raise your heart rate to workout levels three times a<br>  week. If you fail to do this, the government carts you off to "health<br>  camp" where you will work directly with government trainers for a<br>  week-long boot camp where you will learn the finer points of push-ups.<br><br>And the benefits don't stop there! This will literally spur new<br>technology:<br><br>- In-body calorie sensors to detect your caloric intake and warn you<br>  (and the government) when calories in exceed calories burned<br>- In-body sensors which determine your level of exercise and notify the<br>  government if you don't get enough<br><br>There's just so many things we can do, my mind is racing! I can't write<br>them down fast enough!<br><br>\<br><br>For the uninitiated, the preceding was *sarcasm*.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-7112f861d15399ba1d75a959c4460098){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-7112f861d15399ba1d75a959c4460098" master_w="677"<br>master_h="307"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>As I was writing, I literally felt like what I imagine Orwell felt like<br>when writing *1984*.<br><br>Again, for everyone else, there is literally no way in Hades that we<br>would ever let any of that stuff happen, not here in the United States.<br><br>It literally only happened during COVID because it was so new and so<br>unknown. But not anymore. We know what COVID is. We know what it does.<br>We also know what the "vaccines" do and more importantly, what they<br>*don't.*<br><br>But we went along with it during the pandemic because...it was a<br>pandemic (or the closest thing we've had to one in decades).<br><br>In short, you can't mandate someone be healthy. At best, you can<br>provide "incentives" for people to become healthier. Perhaps you can tax<br>sugary drinks at a higher level than non-sugar drinks...oh wait, we<br>already do this. Perhaps you can move forward, and give tax breaks when<br>you complete fitness programs. Actually, most employers already do this,<br>because it saves them money when their employees are healthier. And it<br>makes them even more money when their employees are working and not out<br>sick. My employer even buys my Fitbit.<br><br>Maybe the government could think about tax breaks for fast food<br>companies which improve their menus; lower sodium, sugar, empty carbs<br>and fat, and increase minerals and vitamins, fiber, and greens.<br><br>But *forcing* people to be healthy is the first step towards<br>*totalitarianism*, and we will vigorously defend against that.<br><br>\<br><br>(EDIT) I read through my answer, and I heard you screaming at your<br>monitor. You were saying, "Yes, but how do we control the spiraling<br>costs of healthcare? Can't we reduce the drains on our healthcare<br>system?"<br><br>Yes we can, but those drains are not *patients*. The vast majority of<br>those drains come directly from *government intervention*, **exactly the<br>kind of intervention you wish to impose on the public.** The next<br>largest drain on the healthcare system comes from **healthcare insurance<br>companies,** which don't actually offer health *insurance*, but<br>*pre-paid healthcare plans*. Fixing that would greatly reduce the drain<br>on our healthcare system.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How can the government legally force individuals to be healthy in<br>America and not eat like pigs, we forced a vaccine on people, why not<br>health and fitness for those who are a drain on the healthcare system?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
