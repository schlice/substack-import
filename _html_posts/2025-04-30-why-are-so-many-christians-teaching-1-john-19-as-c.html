<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>They're confused by conditional forgiveness followers.<br><br>So first, let's make sure we understand what we're addressing. Here's<br>the verse in question:<br><br>> *If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our<br>> sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. \-- 1 John 1:9 ESV*<br><br>When we discuss conditional forgiveness, this verse is the one<br>discussed. Why? *It's the only one which talks about conditional<br>forgiveness*.<br><br>And that fact is important as we move forward in this discussion of<br>conditional forgiveness.<br><br>The main point: **the doctrine of conditional forgiveness is<br>incompatible with the entire New Testament message, as well as the words<br>of Jesus.** In fact, a great deal of the issue with the doctrine of<br>conditional sin is the interpretation of the Bible.<br><br>When you find a Bible verse which is apparently in contradiction with<br>other verses in the Bible, you must stop and consider that you<br>misunderstand at least one of the verses. In other words, it's not that<br>the verses contradict each other, it's that our *understanding* of the<br>verses contradict.<br><br>So let's "zoom out" and see what the remainder of 1 John says about this<br>subject:<br><br>> *But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have<br>> fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son*<br>> *cleanses us from all sin**. \-- 1 John 1:7 ESV*<br>><br>> *I am writing to you, little children, because* ***your sins are<br>> forgiven*** *for his name's sake. \-- 1 John 2:12 ESV*<br><br>Do these passages lead us to believe that Jesus' sacrificial work on the<br>cross cleanses us from *some sin*, or from *all sin*? I think the Bible<br>is wholly clear: Jesus' work on the cross cleanses us from all sin,<br>not just sin we confess.<br><br>So why the confusion? Perhaps the passage was directed at those who were<br>not saved. Perhaps he was addressing those who needed to come to faith<br>in Jesus, not those who already had. That said though, there's no<br>denying that *everyone* needs Jesus to atone for our sins.<br><br>Regardless, it's clear that Jesus' sacrifice cleanses us from *all*<br>sin.<br><br>Think about it. When we stand before the judgement seat, the Accuser<br>will be there speaking against us. What will happen when the Accuser<br>says, "Well, here's an example of a sin for which he did not repent!"<br>What will the Advocate (Jesus) say?<br><br>> *But if anyone does sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus<br>> Christ the righteous. \-- 1 John 2:1 ESV*<br><br>Will the Advocate say, "Oh yeah, I guess he didn't confess that sin, My<br>Grace doesn't cover that one"? *NO!* He will say, "My blood paid for<br>that sin." The Bible says "if anyone sins, we have an Advocate." It does<br>not say, "if anyone sins *and confesses that sin*, we have an Advocate."<br>All sin is covered. The Bible is exceedingly clear that there's no<br>prerequisite to your sin being covered.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
