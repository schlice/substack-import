<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I think I\'m going to take the middle-ground position<br>here.\<br>\<br>I\'m not sure that I see an immediate threat to the welfare of the<br>child. Nevertheless, if you have joint custody, you have as much input<br>into the decisions of the other parent as they do.\<br>\<br>I would start by writing a certified letter to the other parent (copy<br>the other parent\'s lawyer) and explain that you don\'t agree with the<br>choice of sitter because of the proximity of the sex offender and the<br>likelihood that because of the familial relationship, the offender will<br>likely be in contact with your child. You don\'t have to state *why* you<br>are uncomfortable with this; as a parent with joint custody, you have<br>the right to object to the choice of sitter.\<br>\<br>If she refuses to change sitters, a return trip to court to sort out the<br>childcare arrangements may be in order, but make sure you have tried to<br>sort out the issue beforehand, and can show the court documentation that<br>proves you tried and that your rights as a parent with joint custody are<br>being knowingly violated. The court can then compel her to change<br>sitters, and refusal to follow the judge\'s ruling would constitute<br>contempt of court and could force a change in custody status. Her lawyer<br>would know that and would likely advise her to at least meet with you to<br>hear your concerns before you got to court.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
