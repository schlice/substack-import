<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What is the best diet for someone suffering from multiple sclerosis?<br><br>If you're interested in trying an MS-specific diet, I would highly<br>recommend the [[Wahls<br>protocol](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cd9bfb&url=https://terrywahls.com/about-the-wahls-protocol/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="terrywahls.com"}]{.qlink_container}. I would also recommend<br>you review the [[Swank MS<br>Diet](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8599e1&url=http://www.swankmsdiet.org/the-diet/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="swankmsdiet.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>Dr. Wahls' diet uses paleo principles and what she learned from<br>supplementation rolled into a diet. Her story is amazing, and it's<br>really quite interesting to see how she basically found what you can<br>consider, for her, to be a functional cure for her MS. To that end,<br>while I won't go so far to say that it will cure your MS (or even be a<br>functional cure like hers), I will tell you that if you're looking for a<br>diet which has the best chance at improving your health and helping to<br>alleviate the symptoms of MS, this is the one I recommend. I stumbled on<br>much of what Dr. Wahls captured in her diet on my own, through my own<br>research and supplementation, but her work is definitely amazing (side<br>note: [[she's also on<br>Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Terry-Wahls-MD)]{.qlink_container}).<br><br>The Swank MS Diet operates on the theory that it is red meats and<br>saturated fats that contribute the most to MS symptoms. To that end, on<br>the diet, there is no red meat at all for the first year. Saturated fats<br>are limited to 15 grams per day. Fruits and vegetables are allowed in<br>any amount, and nuts and seeds are recommended as sources of good fats.<br>White meat poultry and white fish become the primary sources of protein.<br>This is another good, solid diet which will likely get you going in the<br>right direction.<br><br>I tend to think more naturally and holistically than fractionally, so I<br>prefer something more akin to Paleo (which I have done with great<br>success) when choosing a diet. Perhaps that's why I lean more towards<br>Wahls than Swank, but I put them both out there. They're both excellent<br>diets and many people have had great success with them.<br><br>Finally, and I can't stress this enough, *before you start, stop, or<br>change anything you're eating, talk to your neurologist*. If you want to<br>try one of these diets, let your neurologist know you're doing it. Also<br>(and it almost goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway), ***don't<br>stop, start, or change your MS medications AT ALL without the advice and<br>consent of your neurologist.*** These diets should not be considered a<br>replacement for any of the MS therapy drugs. They should be considered<br>*supplements* to your traditional MS therapy. Again, these diets, along<br>with regular exercise and your approved MS therapy drugs, offer you the<br>*best chance* of minimized MS symptoms and a healthy, improved<br>lifestyle, while living with MS. Everyone is different, and everyone who<br>has MS will experience it differently. In other words, your mileage may<br>vary. This may work well for you; it may not work quite as strikingly<br>for you as it does for others. But doing all these things together<br>(diet, exercise, and your MS drug) offers you the best chance for<br>success.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
