Automatic<br>braking may help you avoid a rear-end collision if you are not paying<br>attention, but that's about it. Every other kind of accident will still<br>happen. You can still blindly roll through a stop sign and get T-boned<br>(the most common and most deadly accident type caused by distracted<br>driving). You can still roll into oncoming traffic.<br><br>Even Tesla's "autopilot" system requires an attentive driver, as the car<br>doesn't understand things like red lights yet. It still requires you to<br>watch the road. It makes you apply input to the steering wheel on a<br>regular basis or it shuts off.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
