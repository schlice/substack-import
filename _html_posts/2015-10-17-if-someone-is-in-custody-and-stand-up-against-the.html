<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If the suspect lashed out at the officers and struck them,<br>the suspect could be charged with assaulting a peace officer. If the<br>suspect was violently resisting and he struck an officer, he can<br>similarly be charged. If, however, he was simply combative, but never<br>struck an officer, he would likely be charged with resisting arrest and<br>failure to follow lawful orders.\<br>\<br>Rules differ by jurisdiction, so not all rules about actual charges are<br>universal. Therefore, the actual charge which is filed may be different.<br>But in general, the suspect needs to strike an officer before assault<br>will be charged.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
