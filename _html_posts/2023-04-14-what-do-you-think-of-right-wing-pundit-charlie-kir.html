<br><br><h2>Space Submission</h2><br><div><br><br>Space name: Leftist Viewpoints & The Resistance<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I know the people in this Space are entirely disinterested in hearing<br>what the other side is thinking, but if any of you want to really know<br>what Kirk and his ilk are trying to say here (which is not adequately<br>captured in the quote), I'll tell you.<br><br>*If you have the freedom to speak, but then you seek to censor<br>viewpoints you don't like, such as what you call "hate speech," then you<br>don't really have the freedom to speak.*<br><br>*If you have the freedom of religion, but then you seek to regulate<br>certain religions because they espouse beliefs that you don't like, such<br>as those which believe that homosexual activities are sinful, then you<br>don't really have the freedom of religion.*<br><br>*If you have the freedom to keep and bear arms, but then you seek to<br>limit that right in a futile attempt to keep guns away from people who*<br>*might* *use them unlawfully, then you don't really have the freedom<br>to keep and bear arms.*<br><br>The truth is that the only people who will be affected by a gun ban are<br>people who follow the law. Criminals, by their very nature, don't care<br>about following the law. So they'll be the only ones armed. The only way<br>that a gun ban would work is if the only source of illegal guns is from<br>legal sources (either buying one legally, or stealing one from someone<br>who bought one legally). But criminals very clearly indicate that the<br>vast majority of their guns are sourced from *illegal* sources, not<br>legal ones. You might *stem* the flow of firearms to criminals by<br>removing guns from the law-abiding, but you'll hardly put a dent in it,<br>and you'll severely limit the ability of the law-abiding to engage in<br>lawful self-defense.<br><br>Therefore, what the quote was *really* trying to say is that the freedom<br>to own guns means the freedom for *everyone* to own guns, and some<br>people will use guns unlawfully. Just as the freedom to own cars means<br>the freedom for *everyone* to own cars, and some people will use cars<br>unlawfully, and the freedom to own chain saws means the freedom for<br>*everyone* to own chain saws, and some people will use chain saws<br>illegally, and the freedom to own fertilizer means the freedom for<br>*everyone* to own fertilizer, and some people will use fertilizer<br>unlawfully, **and those people who will use things unlawfully cannot be<br>stopped by removing the things.**<br><br>The gun is not unique in this calculus. It only seems unique to you<br>because it is specifically designed to kill, and that is distasteful.<br>It's distasteful for everyone, but we also recognize that killing is<br>justifiable in certain circumstances, such as self-defense and the<br>resistance to tyranny. And since it is true that guns are used in<br>*orders of magnitude* more cases in self-defense than in offense, it is<br>truly a "cutting off one's nose to spite one's face" move to try to ban<br>them, and it simply won't achieve what you seek to achieve.<br><br>\<br><br>*I'm answering here to try to open* *constructive* *dialogue.<br>Therefore, I'll only be retaining comments which are truly interrogative<br>in nature. Anything harassing or stupid or inane will be immediately<br>deleted. Ain't nobody got time for that.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
