<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Fascinating. Did you know that there is more, and better, documentation<br>regarding the existence of the person known as Jesus of Nazareth than<br>there is regarding the existence of the person called Julius Caesar? Yet<br>no one doubts that Julius Caesar existed.\[1\](#bvLJt){#cite-bvLJt<br>.citation_link}<br><br>I think the source of your data may be misleading you. In 2020, there<br>were 2.38 billion professed Christians, which accounts for 31% of the<br>world's population. So from that, you can extrapolate that nearly 72% of<br>the world's population is not Christian.<br><br>However, being "not Christian" doesn't mean that they don't believe<br>Jesus existed at all. Jesus is mentioned in the<br>Qur'an\[2\](#OruuN){#cite-OruuN .citation_link}, so those who practice<br>Islam believe Jesus existed, and that's the second largest world<br>religion, at nearly 25%.<br><br>That means that nearly 56% of the world's population believe that, at<br>the very least, Jesus existed.<br><br>And I'm certain that a sizeable portion of the secular/agonstic/atheist<br>population believes that Jesus actually lived, even though none of them<br>believe that he rose from the dead. They together account for nearly 16%<br>of the world's population.<br><br>Therefore, it's likely that as many as 72% of the world's population<br>believes that Jesus, at least, did exist. Unless you are willfully<br>ignorant, it's unlikely that anyone truly doubts that the person known<br>as Jesus of Nazareth actually existed.<br><br>Skeptics can doubt that he rose from the dead. There will always be<br>those who doubt that claim. But doubting that he existed at all is<br>illogical and is not supported by documented historical record.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Nearly 72 percent of the world don\'t think Jesus was a real person. Why<br>is Christianity such a lie?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-bvLJt){.citation_index} [[Sources for Caesar and Jesus<br>Compared](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f4390a&url=https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/sources-for-caesar-and-jesus-compared/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="thegospelcoalition.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-OruuN){.citation_index} [[Jesus in Islam -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6789fc&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Islam%23:~:text%3DJesus%2520is%2520more%2520briefly%2520described,and%2520the%2520rest%2520as%2520titles.){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
