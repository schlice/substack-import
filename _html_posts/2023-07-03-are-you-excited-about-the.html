<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's nice that I'll be able to save the hundred dollars or so that it<br>would have cost me to have to get a permit.<br><br>But "exciting?" No, not at all.<br><br>Oh and by the way, you cannot open-carry in Florida unless you are<br>hunting or fishing. Other than that, no one open carries in Florida.<br><br>The effect will be to save me money. The only people who this affects<br>are the people who could have legally gotten a permit in the first<br>place, as they are the only people who are now permitted to carry<br>without a permit.<br><br>If you couldn't get a permit before, you can't conceal under the new<br>legislation. The only people who do not need a permit to carry are<br>people who could have previously qualified to get a permit. If you<br>couldn't get a permit before this legislation, and you carry concealed,<br>it's still illegal. So that hasn't changed.<br><br>It simply moves the onus from the firearms owner to law enforcement. If<br>you are concealing and you are involved in an encounter with law<br>enforcement, and if there is a question whether or not you are a person<br>who is permitted to conceal, now the onus will be on law enforcement to<br>determine whether or not you are legally permitted to conceal a firearm.<br><br>In other words, if you are a person who would otherwise be able to get a<br>permit, you don't have to get permission *before* you conceal *in order<br>to* conceal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
