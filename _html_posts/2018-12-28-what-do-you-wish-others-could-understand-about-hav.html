<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What do you wish others could understand about having multiple<br>sclerosis?**<br><br>***How you look on the outside does not match how you feel on the<br>inside.***<br><br>*"You have MS?* *But you look so good...**"*<br><br>UGH! If I hear that sentence again, I think I'll scream.<br><br>When you get MS, it doesn't matter what your symptoms are or how long<br>you have lived with the disease, it is guaranteed that you will hear<br>that phrase at least once, from some well-meaning person who only knows<br>MS because they know Richard Pryor or someone else who was in a<br>wheelchair or who had to use a cane.<br><br>Or they follow up that sentence with, "All of the guys I know who have<br>MS just look terrible and they never did very well, but not you! *You<br>look so good!*"<br><br>I always want to say, "So what, exactly, is a person with MS *supposed*<br>to look like?"<br><br>And if you are like me and you have issues with fatigue, it may be that<br>the walk through the hot parking lot will be the difference between<br>whether or not you can have dinner with your family that night, or that<br>you'll have to go to bed early because you're just too tired. Hanging a<br>handicapped parking tag and then walking in to the store will elicit<br>more than one dirty look from people who judge you because you don't<br>"look" handicapped.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
