<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I will gladly hand over my gun<br><br>...once you hand over the appropriate amount of money to cover what I<br>paid for it plus reasonable profit. And a \$100 Target gift card won't<br>cover it. My pistol is currently selling for \$639.99 [[at Academy<br>Sports](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=25f662&url=https://www.academy.com/p/smith-wesson-m-p40-m20-40-s-w-full-sized-15-round-pistol){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academy.com"}]{.qlink_container}. So I'd probably need 7 or<br>8 of those Target gift cards before I willingly hand over my property.<br><br>It's called a "purchase." It's an equitable exchange of money for<br>property. We do it all the time in society. No drink necessary.<br><br>And what you do with it after you buy it is totally up to you. Once I<br>sell it, it's your responsibility to handle it in accordance with the<br>law. If you want to give it to the police, feel free. It's your money.<br><br>But if you want my gun, you'll have to buy it from me. Any other<br>"taking" of my property without proper remuneration is *theft.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
