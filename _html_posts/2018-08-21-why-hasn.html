Every word of what you just said...was wrong.*<br><br>\<br><br>Thanks for the A2A. Just to clarify and consolidate what everyone has<br>already said:<br><br>- There was no FOIA violation as the photos were classified.<br>- FOIA does not impose storage or retention requirements for<br>  information; it provides requirements for how to disseminate data upon<br>  formal request, exemptions to the FOIA requirements, and provides for<br>  certain types of information to be automatically released without a<br>  request being issued.<br>- There was no "purge" of OBL's photos. There was only a reminder on how<br>  to handle classified information.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
