<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It is legal to ostracize people who offend you. It may<br>actually be the only way that you can communicate to some people that<br>they are offensive.\<br>\<br>In commerce, it is not legal to refuse service to someone if they are a<br>member of a protected class (race, color, creed, sex, national origin,<br>and in some states, sexual orientation). So it is not legal to say<br>\"Blacks offend me, I will not serve them\" in your restaurant.\<br>\<br>Otherwise, you and your group can absolutely refuse to do business with<br>someone who offends you. There is no requirement that you engage in<br>business with someone. That\'s called a \"boycott\" and it is perfectly<br>legal and an appropriate free-market response to personal<br>offense.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
