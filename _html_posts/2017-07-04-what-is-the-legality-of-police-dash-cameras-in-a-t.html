<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, most laws regarding two-party authorization are related to<br>*audio* recordings, not video-only recordings. These laws stem from the<br>old wiretapping laws from landline phone calls. Most civilian dash cams<br>will generally only record video, so this usually isn't an issue.<br><br>But even if it does record audio, in almost all jurisdictions I know of,<br>and in most cases (even though there are lots of exceptions), if you can<br>see it, you can record it. There is no expectation of privacy in public<br>places, so if you can see it out of your windscreen, you can record it<br>legally. Lots of exceptions here, like recording on private property,<br>recording places where reasonable expectations of privacy exist, etc.<br><br>Finally, being a driver means consenting to law enforcement activity,<br>which includes having your entire encounter recorded. You consented to<br>this when you signed your driver's license. In fact, dashcam recordings<br>(law enforcement and civilian) are almost universally admissible in<br>court, despite the wiretap laws. So thinking that you can get a dashcam<br>video thrown out because you were never informed that you were being<br>recorded and you never consented to it is not going to work.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
