<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**An order from the president through the Sec of Def to shoot down a<br>commercial airliner would next be given to what officer (name, rank,<br>service branch)?**<br><br>Actually, it's anyone in the [[National Command<br>Authority](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b33986&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Command_Authority){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} who can issue that order,<br>and it would not go through the SecDef. The President, the Vice<br>Presient, the SecDef, or any other member of the NCA can issue the<br>order.<br><br>The order goes right back to the person reporting that a commercial<br>airliner needs to be shot down, and that person is **the Command<br>Director of the currently on-staff NORAD crew.** It's not a person we<br>can name; each crew has its own Command Director (the guy in charge),<br>and he or she is always an O-6 or higher (yes, we do have some 1-stars<br>who still sit CD). But since NORAD is a *combined command*, this could<br>be an officer from either the US or Canadian military.<br><br>Ccommercial airliners would only be targeted if<br><br>- They crossed the ADIZ into North America (this has changed somewhat<br>  since 9/11)<br>- They did not have a valid flight plan<br><br>or<br><br>- They deviated significantly from their flight plan<br>- They were acting in a threatening manner, or they were threatening a<br>  civilian population<br>- They refused to respond to radio calls and shots across the bow.<br><br>I've answered a very similar question in the past, but I can't seem to<br>find it at the moment. When I do, I'll link it here. Basically, NORAD<br>would identify the aberrant aircraft (along with assistance from the<br>regional aircraft control authority at the FAA), and if they determined<br>that a threat was a potential, they would scramble alert fighters to<br>intercept the aircraft. If the aircraft refused to respond to radio<br>calls and shots across the bow (fighter aircraft crossing the aircraft's<br>flight path at a visually close range), the NCA would be contacted for<br>direction. The NCA representative would make a command decision on how<br>to treat the aircraft, and NORAD would direct its fighters to respond<br>appropriately.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
