<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It\'s actually quite simple to shoot a gun. Young or old, it\'s a simple<br>mechanical tool.<br><br>I\'m not quite sure what you mean by \"shooting safely.\" Are you asking<br>how do you shoot and only hit your intended target, or how do you shoot<br>without injuring yourself? In order to shoot and only hit your intended<br>target, you need practice. In order to shoot without injuring yourself,<br>follow the true definition of gun control: \"using both hands to hold<br>your gun.\" Remember, it\'s a controlled explosion going off in your<br>hands and is always a little startling, no matter how many times you do<br>it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
