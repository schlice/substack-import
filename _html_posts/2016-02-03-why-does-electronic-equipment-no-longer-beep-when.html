<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The issue was caused by, and is related to, the type of connection<br>between the cell phone and the tower. It was called \"interference.\"<br><br>Previously, cell phones communicated with their cell towers using an<br>*analog* signal. This signal has a much higher amplitude and signal<br>strength. Certain electronic equipment (like radios, especially) was<br>specifically designed to pick up analog signals. In fact, at that time,<br>you could buy a special scanner and actually listen to cell phone calls.<br><br>These days, cell phones communicate with their towers using<br>*digital* signals. The amplitude of the signal is much smaller, and<br>the power required to send the signal is also much less, since the<br>signal only needs to vary between a very small frequency range to<br>distinguish between a 1 and a 0. This also has contributed to making<br>cell phones smaller and lighter. Consequently, radios and TVs no longer<br>can \"hear\" those signals.<br><br>\<br><br>Funny anecdote, my wife took her car in a few years ago to get serviced,<br>she never told me why. She got the car back, and was really frustrated<br>because they couldn\'t reproduce the issue. When I asked her what it<br>was, we were picking it up from the dealership\'s repair shop. She said<br>that the radio would infrequently make a terrible buzzing noise, and<br>while she was describing the issue, it happened. And immediately<br>thereafter, she got a phone call.<br><br>Turns out there was a little \"cubby\" right next to the head unit where<br>she would store her cell phone. The car stereo would pick up the<br>incoming call and make a buzzing noise. When I explained to her that the<br>issue was the placement of her cell phone and the noise was caused by<br>placing her phone there, moving her phone to the cup holder completely<br>solved the issue (and could have saved her a trip to the dealer).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
