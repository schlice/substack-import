<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The same way we know about other ancient events which we claim happened<br>a long time ago.<br><br>Recorded history.<br><br>And these recordings aren't even by Christians! There are ten known<br>non-Christian writers who mention Jesus within 150 years of His life.<br><br>When you add those non-Christian writings to the Christian sources over<br>that same 150 years, there are about as many sources who mention Jesus<br>as mention Tiberius Caesar, the Roman emperor at the time of Jesus.<br><br>So we have as much proof that Jesus was crucified as we have that<br>Tiberius Caesar was the Roman emperor at the same time. Yet we have no<br>trouble believing that Tiberius existed and was actually the emperor of<br>Rome.<br><br>In fact, based on just the information from the ten non-Christian (some<br>might even be considered *anti-Christian*) sources, we know the<br>following about Jesus:<br><br>1.  Jesus lived during time of Tiberius Caesar.<br>2.  He lived a virtuous life.<br>3.  He was a wonder-worker.<br>4.  He had a brother named James.<br>5.  He was acclaimed to be the Messiah.<br>6.  He was crucified under Pontius Pilate.<br>7.  He was crucified on the eve of the Jewish Passover.<br>8.  Darkness and an earthquake occurred when he died.<br>9.  His disciples believed He rose from the dead.<br>10. His disciples were willing to die for their belief.<br>11. Christianity spread rapidly as far as Rome.<br>12. His disciples denied the Roman gods and worshiped Jesus as<br>    God.\[1\](#XRZCY){#cite-XRZCY .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-XRZCY){.citation_index} [[Amazon.com: I Don\'t Have Enough<br>Faith to Be an Atheist (Audible Audio Edition): Norman L.
