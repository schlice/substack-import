<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I don't want to steal [[David Perlmutter,<br>MD](https://www.quora.com/profile/David-Perlmutter-MD)]{.qlink_container}'s<br>thunder, but I was asked to answer, so I will proffer an answer. If Dr.<br>Perlmutter wants to elaborate further during his session, he certainly<br>can.<br><br>There are several questions which are implied in this question, so let<br>me see if I can break them down and answer them in relation to someone<br>with MS:<br><br>- Can a man with MS actually create a child?<br>- Can a man with MS be a good father?<br>- Should a man with MS have children?<br><br>These are all questions I have been asked at one time or another (or<br>have actually asked myself, as I am a father of three). So I'll go<br>through these each:<br><br>Can a man with MS actually create a child?<br><br>The answer is usually yes. MS can cause sexual dysfunction, so it is<br>possible that a man with MS may have some difficulty with intercourse.<br><br>So a brief sex ed lesson: Sexual arousal begins in the brain (your<br>body's largest sex organ). The brain sends signals down the central<br>nervous system to your sexual organs to begin the physical process of<br>sexual intercourse.<br><br>If MS damages the pathways between the brain and the sex organs, sexual<br>responses, which include both arousal and orgasm, can be directly<br>affected.<br><br>Tangentially related, but not directly related to the physical process<br>of intercourse, is the fact that MS also causes fatigue and depression,<br>which may mean that a man is either too tired for, or is not interested<br>in, sex.<br><br>A fascinating little snippet offered by the National MS Society that<br>really makes you pause:<br><br>> In a recent study, 63 percent of people with MS reported that their<br>> sexual activity had declined since their diagnosis. Other surveys of<br>> persons with MS suggest that as many as 91 percent of men and 72<br>> percent of women may be affected by sexual problems. Ignoring these<br>> problems can lead to major losses in quality of life. Yet both<br>> individuals and healthcare professionals are often slow to bring up<br>> the subject.\[1\](#DFauH){#cite-DFauH .citation_link}<br><br>Treatments are available to assist men with sexual dysfunction.<br><br>- Oral meds like Viagra or Cialis<br>- Injectable meds like papaverine and phentolamine which also increase<br>  bloodflow to the penis<br>- The<br>  [MUSE(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d615f0&url=https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-14329/muse-urethral/details){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="webmd.com"}]{.qlink_container} system, which involves a<br>  small suppository in the penis<br>- Implants, most notably inflatable devices.<br><br>Can a man with MS be a good father?<br><br>My first symptom with MS was optic neuritis. The swelling on the optic<br>nerve of my right eye caused a number of symptoms. One of those symptoms<br>was a decrease in speed of signals traveling from my cornea to my brain.<br>This caused a double-image when I looked at things moving quickly. This<br>presents a problem when you're talking about the functioning of stereo<br>images. We use both of our eyes together to determine *distance* from<br>objects. If the signal from one eye is reaching the brain at a different<br>time than the signal from the other eye, you get a double image, and you<br>can't accurately determine the object's distance away from you.<br><br>This becomes critical when someone throws a baseball at you. When I was<br>in full relapse, I couldn't catch a baseball. I couldn't accurately<br>determine where the ball was.<br><br>This was extremely depressing to me, as I had one more son who was just<br>getting interested in baseball. I feared I'd never be able to play catch<br>with him. I can count on one hand the number of times my own father<br>played catch with me, and when I had children, I vowed to not make the<br>same mistake with them. I'd play any time they wanted. I'd make time if<br>I had to. And now, something was preventing me from playing catch. It<br>was devastating and depressing.<br><br>I did get through it. Not only did the optic neuritis remit (allowing me<br>to see well enough out of that eye to catch a ball again), but I was<br>able to play catch with my youngest son while he was in his little<br>league years.<br><br>So back to the question. Yes, a man with MS can be a great father. You<br>must understand that your ability to be a good father is not related to<br>what you can or can't do physically. You can still love your children,<br>and you can still guide your children and be a mentor and role model for<br>your children. Show your children, through your actions, that while you<br>may have MS, your MS does not have you. Show your children what you<br>*can* do, as opposed to what you can't do. Do that, and you'll be an<br>excellent father.<br><br>Should a man with MS have children?<br><br>I struggled with this question myself. The odds in society of someone<br>developing MS are around 1 in 750. Having a first-degree relative with<br>MS (either a parent or sibling) changes those odds to anywhere between 1<br>in 100 and 1 in 40. Of course, it's not all genetic, but we know that<br>there is a genetic component to MS.<br><br>I was already basically done having children by the time I developed MS.<br>My youngest child was 3 when I was diagnosed. Knowing that I was<br>basically done having children by the time I was diagnosed made my own<br>decision a little easier.<br><br>Understanding the risks (which are small), you have to decide for<br>yourself whether or not you want to have children.<br><br>You can still be a good father (as we discussed above). And while we can<br>see that there may be an increased risk of your children developing MS,<br>we still don't know why. It could be that they are growing up exposed to<br>the same environmental triggers as you were, but if you moved away from<br>your childhood home, you may now be exposed to different triggers. There<br>are many factors that play into an individual's risk of developing MS,<br>and your children may be exposed to different ones than you. Also, don't<br>forget that treatments are advancing quickly, and have been since the<br>90s. Being able to live with MS is getting easier every day. Eventually,<br>we will get to a point where we will either have full control over the<br>disease process, or we eliminate the disease entirely. All of these are<br>things to factor in to your decision.<br><br>You and your wife should discuss this together before deciding on<br>whether or not you are going to have children (or continue having<br>children).<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-DFauH){.citation_index} [[Sexual<br>Problems](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=022977&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms/Sexual-Dysfunction){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
