<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The process is the same in nearly every state.<br><br>If you fail to pay your HOA dues, you will still owe them. Every month<br>you fail to pay, you will accrue a balance due. Added to that balance<br>will also be late fees.<br><br>When a sufficient amount of money becomes past due (this is different in<br>every state), the past due account is turned over to the HOA's attorney.<br>The attorney will attempt to collect the balance, through contact and<br>negotiation (possibly negotiating a payment plan if the homeowner is<br>willing). But all the while, missed payments will continue to accrue,<br>along with late fees, *and now attorney fees*, which get wrapped into<br>the balance due.<br><br>When a sufficient amount of time passes, or when a minimum balance due<br>is reached (also varies by state), the association attorney will place a<br>*lien* on the property. In case you are unaware, a lien is a legal<br>obligation placed against property which is used as collateral, in order<br>to repay a debt. Since your property is used as collateral in your<br>agreement with the HOA, the HOA (through its attorney) can place a lien<br>on the property to recover unpaid debt. The lien gives the lienholder<br>the right to sell the property if the property owner fails to repay his<br>debt.<br><br>If enough time goes by with the debt still unpaid, the lien can be<br>*foreclosed* in order to repay the debt. Foreclosure is the process in<br>which a lienholder exercises the right to sell the property in order to<br>repay the debt owed. In other words, this means that your house will be<br>sold out from under you, you will be kicked out of your house, and the<br>proceeds from the sale will first go to repay the debt you owe to the<br>HOA and the attorney, and will then go to repay your mortgage holder.<br>Any remaining proceeds, after the HOA and the mortgage holder's debts<br>are satisfied, will go back to you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
