<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No. Some people have lesions on their spinal cord.<br><br>Lesions will indeed be present somewhere. In about 5 percent of cases, a<br>person may initially develop MS symptoms before lesions are present, but<br>within a short timeframe, those lesions will appear.<br><br>The longer a person goes with *symptoms* but no *lesions* should<br>indicate to the neurologist that they should be looking for other<br>conditions which mimic MS but are not MS. There are, of course, other<br>tests to add to the body of evidence pointing to MS (visual evoked<br>potential, CSF sample, etc). The MRI alone does not determine whether or<br>not a person has MS, but the brain lesions are a hallmark symptom of the<br>disease. While a clear MRI initially does not rule out MS, a clear MRI<br>over time tends to indicate that there may be some other disease at<br>work.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional medical advice.
