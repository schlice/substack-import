<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, in fact, there is a line drawn in the use of the term<br>\"disability.\" The landmark Americans with Disabilities Act<br>actually defines what a disability is. According to the ADA:<br><br>*A disability is defined as:*<br><br>- *a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more<br>  major life activities (sometimes referred to in the regulations as an<br>  "actual disability"), or*<br>- *a record of a physical or mental impairment that substantially<br>  limited a major life activity ("record of"), or*<br>- *when a covered entity takes an action prohibited by the ADA because<br>  of an actual or perceived impairment that is not both transitory and<br>  minor ("regarded as").*<br><br>So you can see, there are three different conditions that can define<br>whether or not someone is \"disabled\": If they have an actual<br>disability, if there is a record of a disability, or if they are<br>regarded as being disabled. It\'s important to note that under the law,<br>someone is considered disabled if they meet one or both of the first two<br>prongs. A person who is merely regarded as disabled, but has no actual<br>or recorded disability, is not entitled to accommodations.<br><br>According to the<br>[EEOC:(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=be20e0&url=http://www.eeoc.gov){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="eeoc.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>> To have an "actual" disability (or to have a "record of" a disability)<br>> an individual must be (or have been) substantially limited in<br>> performing a major life activity as compared to most people in the<br>> general population. Consistent with the ADAAA, the final regulations<br>> adopt "rules of construction" to use when determining if an individual<br>> is substantially limited in performing a major life activity. These<br>> rules of construction include the following:<br>><br>> - An impairment need not prevent or severely or significantly limit a<br>>   major life activity to be considered "substantially limiting."<br>>   Nonetheless, not every impairment will constitute a disability.<br>> - The term "substantially limits" should be construed broadly in favor<br>>   of expansive coverage to the maximum extent permitted by the terms<br>>   of the ADA.<br>> - The determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a<br>>   major life activity requires an individualized assessment.<br>> - In keeping with Congress' direction that the primary focus of the<br>>   ADA is on whether discrimination occurred, the determination of<br>>   disability should not require extensive analysis.<br>> - Although determination of whether an impairment substantially limits<br>>   a major life activity as compared to most people will not usually<br>>   require scientific, medical, or statistical evidence, such evidence<br>>   may be used if appropriate.<br>> - An individual need only be substantially limited, or have a record<br>>   of a substantial limitation, in one major life activity to be<br>>   covered under the first or second prong of the definition of<br>>   "disability."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
