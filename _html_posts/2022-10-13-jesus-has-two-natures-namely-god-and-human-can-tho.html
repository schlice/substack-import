<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No.<br><br>Jesus will forever be the God-man, fully God and fully human. His two<br>natures are inseparable. But His dual natures don't influence each<br>other; He isn't some ultra-human, and He isn't a nerf'd god, either.<br><br>But even though He was fully God, He sometimes operated within the<br>confines of His humanity:<br><br>> Jacob's well was there; so Jesus, wearied as he was from his journey,<br>> was sitting beside the well. It was about the sixth hour. --- John 4:6<br>> ESV<br><br>And even though He was fully human, He sometimes operated with divine<br>power and authority:<br><br>> When he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice,<br>> "Lazarus, come out." --- John 11:43 ESV<br>><br>> "Bring them here to me," he said. And he directed the people to sit<br>> down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking<br>> up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them<br>> to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. They all<br>> ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls<br>> of broken pieces that were left over. The number of those who ate was<br>> about five thousand men, besides women and children. --- Matthew<br>> 14:18--21 NIV<br><br>We understand that this is a discussion about the hypostatic union<br>--- the two natures of Jesus which exist simultaneously in the form of<br>one man, but which do not influence one another. This is really just<br>humans, trying to understand a concept that we simply don't have the<br>capacity to understand. With the limitations of the finite human mind,<br>we should not expect to be able to understand the details and<br>intricacies of an infinite God.<br><br>Jesus was always God. He always existed. He existed as God before He<br>existed as a man. When He was born into this world, he became man, **in<br>addition** to being God.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Jesus has two natures, namely God and human. Can those natures be<br>separated?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
