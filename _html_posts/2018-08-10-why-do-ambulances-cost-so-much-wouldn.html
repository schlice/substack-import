<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **Why do ambulances cost so much? Wouldn\'t it make more sense to<br>> tax-fund them like with police and fire departments?**<br><br>**In most areas in the United States, the cost of an ambulance ride is<br>billed to your health insurance, not to your taxes.**<br><br>We could turn this into a discussion about whether or not the United<br>States *should* (or even *can*) nationalize healthcare, but that's a<br>discussion for another question. I will focus instead on how things<br>*are* instead of how things *could be*.<br><br>Since ambulances are considered mobile *health care* and not government<br>services, and since health care is not provided by the government,<br>ambulances and their costs are billed to the patient's health care<br>insurance. Therefore, their costs are exactly what the insurance market<br>will bear.<br><br>Police and fire are services provided by the government (in fact, they<br>are exactly the type of services we pay government to provide).<br>Therefore, the appropriate method to fund them is taxes.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
