<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There's literally no one on this platform who could conceivably speak<br>for "the vast majority of Trump supporters." I can't speak to what<br>"Trump supporters" think, because I'm really unsure what it means to<br>"support" a former President. Support him in what, exactly?<br><br>No one dismisses philosophy as gibberish. People either understand<br>philosophy and accept it for what it is, or they don't understand<br>philosophy and they ignore it, and people who talk about it. They know<br>their own versions of right and wrong, and they live by that moral<br>standard.<br><br>Most Conservatives dislike Trump as a person, but are grateful for the<br>work he did for the country. I fall squarely into the Conservative camp.<br>And I'm not a fan of Trump the man. I judge how much of a fan I am of a<br>person by whether or not I'd enjoy sitting down and having a beer with<br>him. For example, I'm a fan of Obama. I'd enjoy spending time to sit<br>down and have a beer with the man, even though I am diametrically<br>opposed to his politics. As for Trump, I'm glad for the work he did as<br>president. His list of accomplishments is long and storied, and the<br>country is indeed a better place for them. However, he is a brash,<br>bombastic womanizing New Yorker, and he "broke a lot of eggs" to make<br>the omelette he was trying to make. He broke more eggs than he probably<br>needed to, and that's irritating to me. I would not enjoy sitting down<br>to have a beer with him.<br><br>Conservatives (especially Conservatives like me who understand<br>philosophy) have the ability to separate the *politics* from the<br>*person*.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Do the vast majority of trump supporters dismiss philosophy as<br>gibberish?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
