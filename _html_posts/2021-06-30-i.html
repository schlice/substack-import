<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, this is rape. Rape (in most states these days) is penetration, no<br>matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object,<br>or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the<br>consent of the victim.<br><br>Legally, at your age, you cannot consent to sex or any sexual activity,<br>so consent is not a factor.<br><br>You need to tell an adult you trust. This could be a parent. It could be<br>a school counselor or a nurse. It could be a pastor or a youth leader.<br>But please, find an adult you trust and tell them about it.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I\'m 14 years old. Someone fingered me without my consent while I was<br>half asleep. Is this rape?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
