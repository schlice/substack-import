<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Excellent question! And this question points to the one big elephant in<br>the room:<br><br>***If God didn't want man to be tempted, why create such a tree in the<br>first place?***<br><br>Why did the tree exist at all?<br><br>The answer is really unrelated to the tree, or its name, or its fruit,<br>or what benefits it *could* provide to Adam or Eve, because we are<br>actually unsure about those specifics. We do know that once they ate of<br>the fruit, they realized they were naked. This is an indication that the<br>human condition changed, when sin entered the world. Man now had the<br>ability to know *shame*.<br><br>But the details about what happened when they ate the fruit are mostly<br>unimportant, except for the one where they realized that they were naked<br>(we'll get there in a bit). In order to really answer the question of<br>why the tree existed at all, we have to step back and look at the big<br>picture. And that answer is something we've talked about a lot in this<br>Space, and it's a really confusing but still important concept: ***free<br>will.***<br><br>And it boils down to this: **if we are to truly have free will, we must<br>be able to choose evil.**<br><br>If we are told that we have free will, but there is no evil to choose,<br>do we really have free will? Remember that God is a god of love. He *is*<br>love. God created man with free will because He wants man to choose Him<br>freely, for love can only be freely given and freely chosen, it can<br>never be coerced. So God can never demand love, He can only woo.<br><br>To that end, if we are to be truly free, ***we must be able to choose<br>something over God.*** And that choice must be compelling enough that it<br>could stand up to whatever God was offering. Appealing to the selfish<br>side of man, appealing to man's frailty and ego, the serpent was able to<br>tempt man into committing the first sin and choosing something over God.<br>Ultimately, this was the sin which caused God to have to send Jesus to<br>redeem us.<br><br>So remember when we were talking about Adam and Eve realizing that they<br>were naked? This is where it becomes exceedingly important. Because<br>after they sinned, God shed the first innocent blood to cover their sins<br>in the Garden, when He killed an animal to make clothes to cover their<br>nakedness. The significance of that action should not be lost on us:<br>*God shed innocent blood to cover man's sin.* Man had to continue to<br>offer blood sacrifices and burnt offerings to God to cover their sin,<br>*as a foreshadowing to the shed blood of the sinless Christ*.<br>Essentially, their offerings in obedience to God were a "prepayment," if<br>you will, kinda like putting your expenses on a credit card, to be paid<br>at a later date. When Christ took on the sin of all mankind while He<br>hung on the cross, God turned away from Him, as God cannot even gaze<br>upon sin. It was then that Christ, hearkening back to Psalm 22, called<br>out, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" The mystery of the<br>actual workings of that separation are too deep for the human mind to<br>comprehend, but we've been given the basics. Jesus became sin to be the<br>*propitiation* for our sin. His shed blood washes us clean. He died<br>once, for all.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Doesn't "God not wanting his human creations to eat the fruit from the<br>tree of the knowledge of good & evil" show that "'humans getting<br>knowledge of everything' even if they'll eventually get to directly<br>request it from God" isn't part of God's plan?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
