And we want to keep<br>that.<br><br>President Trump's record on defending religious freedom in America is<br>impressive, and it is growing. There is no sign that it is a shrinking<br>fad. We can expect a White House occupied by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris<br>to not just drop the Trump administration\'s defense of religious<br>freedom, but reverse course to start working aggressively against it.<br><br>History is our teacher. Joe Biden worked in an Obama White House which<br>did just this. His administration *aggressively* argued to the Supreme<br>Court that religious institutions should not have the freedom to<br>determine who teaches their faith. Thankfully, they were rejected by the<br>court, in a stunning 9--0 vote. But that didn't stop the administration<br>from attempting to tear down the First Amendment freedom of expressive<br>association, the doctrine of church autonomy, and the ministerial<br>exception. The latter was decided in the case of *Our Lady of Guadalupe<br>School v. Morrissey-Berru* just a few months prior. In that case, the<br>court held that the "ministerial exception" protects the right of<br>religious institutions to choose who teaches and passes down religious<br>doctrine when the teachers perform religious functions at the school.<br>When the Obama administration argued against that doctrine again in<br>[[*Hosanna Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & School v.<br>EEOC,*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9ce71f&url=https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/hosanna-tabor-evangelical-lutheran-church-and-school-v-eeoc/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="scotusblog.com"}]{.qlink_container} they were halted by the<br>aforementioned 9--0 vote.<br><br>> A litany of statements on the record and positions taken by both Biden<br>> and Harris clearly indicate they will block such religious freedom<br>> efforts if allowed to take office. While California Attorney General,<br>> Kamala Harris filed a brief against Hobby Lobby in the Supreme Court.<br>> As a senator, Harris was an original cosponsor of legislation that<br>> would block religious freedom for adoption providers, and introduced<br>> legislation gutting Religious Freedom Restoration Act claims. Harris<br>> was also an original co-sponsor of the Equality Act, which would be<br>> horrific for religious freedom, but which a [[Biden/Harris<br>> administration has pledged to make a<br>> priority](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3526a1&url=https://joebiden.com/lgbtq-policy/){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="joebiden.com"}]{.qlink_container} in the first 100 days in<br>> office. As a senator, Harris also [[openly<br>> questioned](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=834c96&url=https://downloads.frc.org/EF/EF19B18.pdf){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="frc.org"}]{.qlink_container} judicial nominees about their<br>> religious beliefs \[which is expressly prohibited by the<br>> Constitution\]. Add to this Senator Biden\'s votes against a<br>> constitutional amendment allowing voluntary prayer in school and<br>> barring federal courts from taking cases involving prayer in public<br>> schools, and we have a clear picture of the alternatives this November<br>> when it comes to religious freedom.\[1\](#ToYUK){#cite-ToYUK<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>And this is just one example. There are many examples of how the Trump<br>administration is upholding religious freedom, and it is only one of his<br>many other policy accomplishments.
