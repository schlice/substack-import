<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Sheol* is the Jewish word for "the place of the dead." The same word in<br>Greek is *hades*. It is the place where souls go when they die. Some<br>parts of the New Testament say that sheol/hades is where souls go where<br>they await their final resurrection.<br><br>Revelation says that "the lake of fire" is the final destination for<br>Satan and his demons, and all human unrepentant rebels (Revelation 20:10<br>and others). It is a place of eternal agony for those who have<br>affirmatively rejected Christ. Those people will have a temporary home<br>in sheol/hades, but the lake of fire will be their ultimate destination.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
