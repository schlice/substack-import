<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [The big difference: culture.\<br>\<br>The UK has been used to living under some form of \"rule\" for millenia.<br>Citizens of the Realm are more likely to accede to governmental<br>authority. They are more likely to \"work in partnership\" with the<br>government, which the government also finds (unsurprisingly) expedient<br>and useful in asserting its control over the citizenry.\<br>\<br>The US, which has only been around for a few hundred years, has built<br>its foundation on the likes of Sir William Blackstone\'s Commentaries on<br>the Laws of England. I\'m certain you are aware that while Blackstone<br>was penning his Commentaries, he was actually a member of Parliament,<br>and criticized the colonists for engaging in their treasonous<br>activities, probably one of the greatest ironies in American history.\<br>\<br>Blackstone\'s ideas surrounding the source of law, the morality of<br>insurrection, \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\" and the<br>origin and the nature of rights had such a profound influence on the<br>early colonists, that they became much of the foundation for the United<br>States Declaration of Independence, and eventually, the Constitution. In<br>fact, copies of Blackstone\'s Commentaries were distributed as widely in<br>America as they were in England. The ideas of no taxation without<br>representation, unalienable property rights, and most importantly, the<br>unalienable right to self-defense were a few of the hallmarks of the new<br>Constitution.\<br>\<br>Americans have patterned their lives and their identities around these<br>ideals. And considering that the right to keep and bear arms to ensure<br>that unalienable right to self-defense was penned directly into the Bill<br>of Rights, never to be infringed, means that the American psyche is a<br>decidedly \"anti-government\" one, which says, \"I am supposed to depend<br>on *myself first* for my defense, not government.\" To that end, the<br>right to keep and bear arms is so fundamental, that it was written into<br>the Constitution.\<br>\<br>Can you honestly look at this comparison and still tell me that you can<br>compare the societies in the UK and the US? Besides both having U in<br>their acronyms (and arguably both speaking the Queen\'s English), they<br>couldn\'t be more different.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-gun-control-work/answer/Toby-David-Low<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
