<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why do students at the US Air Force Academy call it \"The Zoo\"?<br><br>I'm going to include an image that is unrelated in event, but is<br>perfectly related in location.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-756ed589f6cd0e0e636e00449346979d){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-756ed589f6cd0e0e636e00449346979d" master_w="800"<br>master_h="446"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>The cadets in the picture are taking part in an unrelated endeavor. I<br>don't want you to focus on them. Take a look between the base of the<br>chapel and the top of the wall, where all the people are looking down on<br>the cadets on the "terazzo."<br><br>This is known as the chapel wall. It is common place for tourists to<br>gather and "look down" on the entire Cadet Area. As a Graduate Docent, I<br>take tour groups to this location to describe the buildings and aircraft<br>displays in the Cadet Area as well as discussing its history and<br>construction. It's as close as the general public is allowed to get to<br>the Cadet Area.<br><br>Watching cadets march in Noon Meal formation is a really cool thing to<br>see, if you're a tourist up on the chapel wall.<br><br>It's less endearing if you're a cadet.<br><br>The whole experience kinda makes you feel like you're a zoo animal,<br>being observed by all the visitors to the zoo.<br><br>So we colloquially call it "the zoo." Please don't feed the cadets.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
