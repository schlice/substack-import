<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Where\'s the best pizza in Colorado Springs?<br><br>You're asking for an opinion. My opinion of what is the best pizza will<br>most certainly differ from yours.<br><br>If you like real New York-style pizza, you can't go wrong with<br>[[Borriello<br>Brothers](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=170bbe&url=http://www.borriellobrothers.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="borriellobrothers.com"}]{.qlink_container}. But understand<br>what New York style pizza is. It started out in New York City in the<br>early 1900s where Italian immigrant *pizzaiolos* (pizza makers) were<br>forced to use lower-temperature coal-fired pizza ovens where hardwoods<br>were scarce. Old Italian pizza ovens burned much hotter and made firm<br>crusts; New York pizza is cooked at a lower temperature, resulting in a<br>softer crust. It's floppy; it generally has to be folded in half so that<br>you can get it into your mouth. And if it's cooked with real cheese<br>(most is), you'll find that the oils from the cheese will drip out into<br>your hand from the fold. Yep, that's New York style pizza.<br><br>If you're more interested in Italian-style pizza (also known as<br>Neapolitan pizza) and a simpler ingredient set, check out [[Duca's<br>Neapolitan<br>Pizza](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=915d22&url=http://ducaspizza.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ducaspizza.com"}]{.qlink_container}. It's cooked in real<br>wood-burning ovens at around 800--900 degrees, fully cooking a pizza in<br>about 90 seconds. It's been certified by the **Associazione Vera Pizza<br>Napoletana** which registers approved suppliers of "Vera Pizza<br>Napoletana" --- the 'true Neapolitan pizza.' The designation is only<br>given to pizzerias that met strict requirements that respect the<br>tradition and the art of Neapolitan pizza making.<br><br>If you're looking for the eclectic in pizza-making and perhaps some<br>tradition in Colorado Springs, you should visit [[Fargo's<br>Pizza.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fff650&url=http://www.fargospizza.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="fargospizza.com"}]{.qlink_container} It's very much an<br>experience as well as relatively decent pizza. Notable is the use of<br>large corn meal on the bottom of their crusts. It's odd, but oddly<br>satisfying. They have a huge pizza menu as well as a very large salad<br>bar, an arcade, and Victorian period costuming and theming. It's<br>definitely something to see.<br><br>Also worth mentioning:<br><br>- [[Marcos<br>  Pizza](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e2da3d&url=https://www.marcos.com){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="marcos.com"}]{.qlink_container} - family owned and<br>  operated here in town, and they make very good pizza<br>- [[Blackjack<br>  Pizza](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3772fb&url=https://blackjackpizza.com/){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="blackjackpizza.com"}]{.qlink_container} - a Colorado<br>  Springs institution<br><br>And some of the smaller, up-and-coming, but no less good, chains:<br><br>- [[Blaze<br>  Pizza](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7ec99e&url=http://blazepizza.com/){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="blazepizza.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br>- [[MOD<br>  Pizza](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f3bf3a&url=https://modpizza.com/){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="modpizza.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
