<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can the Impeachment of Donald Trump be "unconstitutional" as<br>stated repeatedly by Trump & his defenders when the process of<br>Impeachment is literally in The United States Constitution and thusly<br>supports the actions of the Democratic House?**<br><br>The impeachment process itself is Constitutional. The House has followed<br>Constitutional provisions when it conducted its portion of the<br>impeachment (drafting and voting on Articles of Impeachment). It may<br>have erred Constitutionally when it delayed transmitting the Articles to<br>the Senate, because the implication in the Constitution seems to be that<br>the Articles should be transmitted in a timely manner. This is not<br>stated, merely implied by the fact that there are prohibitions in the<br>Constitution against hindering another branch of government, and the<br>delay at least hints at such hindrance.<br><br>The argument that Trump makes has to do with the *basis* upon which the<br>Articles of Impeachment were written. In order to be impeached, there<br>must be a charge of "treason, bribery, or high crimes and misdemeanors."<br>The House's assertion that Trump abused his power was classified under<br>"high crimes and misdemeanors." The House asserts that it can define<br>that term however it likes, which is true. It is clear, even from a<br>casual reading of the Constitution however, that the framers intended it<br>to be far more serious than the charge the House makes, and should be<br>supported by weighty and convincing evidence which cuts across party<br>lines and convinces even the casual observer that a truly egregious act<br>has actually taken place. No such convincing evidence was produced.<br>There are explanations for everything which was presented. Appropriate<br>witnesses were never forced to appear (which should have happened<br>through the courts). If this was the limit of the investigation, it<br>should have led the House to *not* vote on Articles of Impeachment,<br>since weighty and convincing evidence was not produced.<br><br>Only because the phrase "high crimes and misdemeanors" can essentially<br>mean whatever a simple majority of the House chooses it to mean is the<br>reason why the actual impeachment is still, *just barely*,<br>Constitutional.<br><br>The fact that a *supermajority* of Senators is required to remove the<br>President from office **is a check on the possibility that an<br>impeachment might be partisan**. You *must* have bipartisan support in<br>order to act on Articles of Impeachment; otherwise, they are just<br>"sound and fury, signifying nothing." The fact that you were going to be<br>unable to convince a supermajority of the Senate of anything in this<br>impeachment process *should have* informed Representatives that they<br>should not be sending Articles of Impeachment forward. It is a pointless<br>exercise which will not produce a removal from office.<br><br>On a side note, do you think the House is blissfully unaware of the fact<br>that the President will not be removed from office? Of course they're<br>not. They know full well that their Articles of Impeachment will not<br>remove Trump from office. *So why continue this dog-and-pony show?*<br>Remember that everything politicians do is designed and timed<br>specifically to try to affect you, the voter. The entire reason<br>these Articles are moving forward is because they hope to gain some<br>political capital with you. They hope to position themselves as the only<br>thing standing between the sanctity of the government and a corrupt,<br>conniving President who hopes to be a dictator some day. If they can<br>convince you of at least some wrongdoing, you may (if you're an<br>Independent, at least) think twice about re-electing Trump.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
