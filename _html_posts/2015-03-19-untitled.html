<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [*I was under the impression that a lie was a bad thing to<br>do no matter who does it*\<br>\<br>Sadly, the law doesn\'t share your view. Lying, in and of itself, isn\'t<br>illegal. While it can be if you\'re lying about your own identity, in<br>most states, lying to the police is not illegal. It\'s not in your best<br>interest, but it\'s not illegal in and of itself (unless you are<br>deliberately lying to mislead the police and hamper an investigation,<br>which can be a crime). Similarly, the police lying to you is also not<br>illegal. Sometimes, the police have to use deceptive interrogation<br>techniques to get suspects to talk, and as you probably already know,<br>criminals usually aren\'t the sharpest knives in the drawer. A little<br>bit of deception can lead a criminal to divulge information he normally<br>wouldn\'t when directly asked.\<br>\<br>Check Chris\' answer again. He didn\'t actually lie, he said \"Do you<br>think your partner is going to protect you?\" You could expand on that:<br>\"When faced with \<possible sentences\>, do you really think he\'s<br>going to hold to the \'Bro Code\' and not roll on you? I\'ll bet you<br>he\'s doing it right now! You need to do the smart thing and get ahead<br>of this before it gets really bad for you.\" The officer doesn\'t know<br>that things are going to get really bad for the suspect. But the small<br>bit of deception can convince a suspect that it\'s in his best interest<br>to talk, and talk now.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-that-police-can-lie-to-you-but-you-cant-lie-to-them/answer/Christopher-Hawk<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
