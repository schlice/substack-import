<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is absolutely no way to diagnose someone with MS without them<br>knowing. The good news: if you are experiencing symptoms you can't<br>diagnose, you'll be happy to do the testing to find out what it is.<br><br>MS is a diagnosis of *exclusion*, because there is no one marker or sign<br>which conclusively indicates MS. For example, if you have numbness in<br>your extremities, you need to exclude all other causes of numbness (like<br>peripheral neuropathy) before that numbness could be added to the body<br>of evidence indicating MS. If you have Optic Neuritis (ON), you need to<br>exclude all other potential causes of ON before you can conclude that<br>the ON could be a sign of MS.<br><br>Once you've done that, your neurologist will take a detailed history and<br>perform a full neurological exam. It's not going to be easy to explain<br>away a full neuro exam.<br><br>Once you've done *that*, you'll be sent for an MRI (which is also really<br>hard to do on someone without them knowing). If the areas of<br>demyelination which are hallmark markers of MS are seen, you *still*<br>need to rule out all of the known diseases, conditions, or history which<br>can cause little white spots on a MRI (a blood panel colloquially known<br>as the *little white spot panel*).<br><br>And even following all of that, you *still* may need to be sent for<br>other tests if the previous were inconclusive, and those are a bit<br>more...intrusive (i.e. lumbar puncture \spinal tap\, visual evoked<br>potential test, etc).<br><br>When *everything else which causes these signs and symptoms* is<br>ruled out, then you and your neurologist can consider a diagnosis of MS.<br><br>TL;DR: A diagnosis of MS is not as simple as a blood test. The<br>involvement of the patient is 100% required.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
