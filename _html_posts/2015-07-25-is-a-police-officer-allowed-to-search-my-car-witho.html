<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [First of all, the car must be in a public place (garage or<br>driveway doesn\'t count as public place) and it must be an operational<br>vehicle (it must look like an operational vehicle to the average<br>citizen). Finally, one of the following two situations must be present<br>in order for an officer to search your car without a warrant:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>1.  Probable Cause. The officer has to have probable cause that<br>    there is contraband, or evidence of a crime, in a vehicle. A blunt<br>    in the ashtray is probable cause to search the vehicle for drugs.<br>    The strong smell of alcohol or drugs is also enough evidence, in<br>    most jurisdictions, to search the vehicle. If the officer has<br>    reasonable suspicion that there are drugs in the car, independent of<br>    the traffic stop, he can have a K-9 drug dog come and sniff. If he<br>    does not have a reasonable suspicion that there are drugs in the<br>    car, he cannot call a K-9 during a traffic stop, and cannot<br>    unnecessarily delay the traffic stop to have a K-9 do a drug sniff<br>    (Rodriguez v. U.S., 13-9972).<br>2.  Exigent Circumstances. Assuming the vehicle has a trunk, if the<br>    officer heard what amounted to sounds of a person from the trunk, he<br>    could use the exigent circumstances clause to search the vehicle for<br>    a person in distress.<br><br>[Dan Robb(https://www.quora.com/profile/Dan-Robb-2)]{.qlink_container}<br>was right on the money about reduced expectation of privacy in a<br>vehicle: driving a vehicle on a public road is a privilege (a highly<br>regulated one at that) afforded by the state. You do not have a right to<br>drive a car, and you have a very limited right to privacy inside a car.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
