<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**You are the first police officer to arrive at an active shooter<br>scenario at a school. As you get out of your car, a civilian teacher<br>runs up to you and says, "I'm armed, how can I help?" What do you do?**<br><br>You advise the civilian to go about a block away from the school and<br>wait.<br><br>As a law enforcement professional, you generally don't recruit civilians<br>to do your job. Back in the Old West, they used to deputize civilians.<br>Today, slightly more training is required before you can deputize a<br>civilian (note that "slightly" is an exaggeration. It's a lot of<br>training).<br><br>While armed teachers are an idea we're kicking around, they are best<br>served inside the classroom, protecting students or stopping a shooter,<br>if they are going to be anywhere at all.<br><br>If they're already outside, they are to move a safe distance away from<br>the scene and await further instructions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
