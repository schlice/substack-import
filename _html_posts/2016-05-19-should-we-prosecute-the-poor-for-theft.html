<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>According to the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, the law applies<br>equally to everyone. No one is exempt from the law. So to answer the<br>question, yes, every thief should be prosecuted.<br><br>When it comes to the *punishment* for that crime, we might consider<br>a different form of punishment, because perhaps a poor person has a<br>different reason for theft, and some punishments clearly won't work.<br>Perhaps we might consider mandatory education classes instead of jail<br>time.<br><br>Fines clearly won't work , because you need money to pay a fine. Fining<br>the poor is as smart as "debtor's prison" was in England.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
