<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Supreme Court has ruled that there are two portions of the Second<br>Amendment: a prefatory clause and an operative clause.<br><br>The prefatory clause says, *"A well-regulated militia, being<br>essential to the security of a free State"*.<br><br>The operative clause says, *"...the right of the People to keep and<br>bear Arms shall not be infringed."*<br><br>The court also ruled that the prefatory clause does nothing at all to<br>change or alter the meaning or the force of the operative clause.<br><br>The interpretation of the Second Amendment that favors gun control<br>simply forgets that interpretation by the court. It holds that the<br>prefatory clause is actually operative, and in today's day and age, that<br>would mean that guns would only be limited to "a well-regulated<br>militia." Therefore, guns would only be available to members of the<br>militia (i.e. police, National Guard, the military, etc).<br><br>However, there are some problems with this definition.<br><br>The operative clause contains the phrase "the right of the People". This<br>phrase was used three times in the Bill of Rights, and every time it was<br>used, it denotes a right that is possessed by all people simply by being<br>citizens, not by membership in some group or organization.<br><br>Secondly, if we look to US law, the militia was intended to be everyone.<br>In fact, under current US code, the *unorganized militia* consists of<br>*everyone in the country*. So by our own definition of what the militia<br>is (based on what we wrote into our own laws), everyone is in the<br>militia, and therefore everyone has the right to keep and bear arms.<br><br>These are just some of the reasons that the court, in *DC v Heller,*<br>found that the Second Amendment recognizes an *individual right* to keep<br>and bear arms.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
