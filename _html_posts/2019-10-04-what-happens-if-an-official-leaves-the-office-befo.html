<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What happens if an official leaves the office before the end of<br>his/her impeachment process?**<br><br>Ask [[Richard<br>Nixon](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=61db3c&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>He resigned before he could be impeached and removed from office on<br>August 9, 1974. His successor, Gerald Ford, pardoned him on September 8,<br>albeit reluctantly, ending any possibility of indictment over his<br>involvement with the Watergate affair. Nixon made a public statement<br>after the pardon, never admitting any wrongdoing, simply saying:<br><br>> I was wrong in not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in<br>> dealing with Watergate, particularly when it reached the stage of<br>> judicial proceedings and grew from a political scandal into a national<br>> tragedy. No words can describe the depth of my regret and pain at the<br>> anguish my mistakes over Watergate have caused the nation and the<br>> presidency, a nation I so deeply love, and an institution I so greatly<br>> respect.<br><br>So what happens if an official leaves office before they are impeached<br>and removed? They become an ordinary citizen again.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
