<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I certainly hope not, because I take them for my MS.\<br>\<br>I suppose it comes down to how the fatty acids are \"processed.\" If the<br>processing changes the nature of the oils, then their incorporation in<br>the body could create an inflammatory molecule, rather than an<br>anti-inflammatory molecule, which would clearly be counterproductive.\<br>\<br>I would think that most \"cold-pressed\" fish oils are not similarly<br>compromised in terms of molecular structure. Make sure you buy a<br>reputable brand of fish/krill oil. Don\'t buy a generic brand just<br>because it\'s cheaper. The oil is more expensive because they use the<br>right process to extract it, to preserve the oil in its most natural<br>state.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
