<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No one has priority. First off, most agencies say that you can\'t just<br>blow through an intersection at full speed; you must slow down to check<br>for traffic which may not have noticed the big flashing lights or heard<br>the siren. So they both should have stopped and worked it out like big<br>boys and girls. That\'s what grown ups do.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
