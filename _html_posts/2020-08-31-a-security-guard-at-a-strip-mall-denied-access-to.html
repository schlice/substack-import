He said the owners told him they didn't want kids<br>with prosthetics using their stairs. Is this okay in California?**<br><br>In the United States, businesses must provide reasonable accommodations<br>to those with disabilities. So long as there is an alternate method to<br>get upstairs, a business can certainly restrict stairs to those with<br>prosthetics, especially considering the liability involved should that<br>person fall.<br><br>If there is no elevator or other method for the disabled child to get<br>upstairs, the business could get in trouble for the denial.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
