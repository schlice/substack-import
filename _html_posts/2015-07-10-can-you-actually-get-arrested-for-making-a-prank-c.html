<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Question Details:*<br>><br>> *My friend said he was using a soundboard to call up a store, and the<br>> soundboard was saying all of these aggressive insults to the employee<br>> that answered the phone. He said that it sounded like the guy who<br>> answered figured that the call wasn\'t serious and was playing along,<br>> but then when my friend clicked on a phrase that said \"If I knew<br>> where you were I would smoke you\" and then the employee said that he<br>> was calling the police.*<br>><br>> *My friend was using Google Voice to place the call and the employee<br>> got his GV number. Do you think police will bother to trace it back to<br>> him and arrest him?*<br><br>If the called party chooses to press charges, then yes, your friend can<br>be arrested for verbalizing a threat.<br><br>It wouldn't stick, of course, because a crime requires the unlawful act<br>(the *actus reus)* and the state of mind in which you actually wanted to<br>do the crime (the criminal mind, or the *mens rea*). Realistically, I<br>don\'t think he will be arrested. I think it\'s pretty straightforward<br>that this was nothing more than a prank call, and there was no malicious<br>intent on the part of the caller.<br><br>However, if the called party wants to press charges, the caller can be<br>arrested.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
