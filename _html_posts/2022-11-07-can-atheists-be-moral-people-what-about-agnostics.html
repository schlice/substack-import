<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Morality is not *dependent* on religion.<br><br>But one must ask themselves: *from where is the source of that<br>morality?*<br><br>In order to have a common, shared morality, there must be a<br>morals-giver. Remember, even babies have inborn morals.<br><br>> Morality is not just something that people learn, argues Yale<br>> psychologist Paul Bloom: It is something we are all born with. At<br>> birth, babies are endowed with compassion, with empathy, with the<br>> beginnings of a sense of fairness.\[1\](#hjgRv){#cite-hjgRv<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>But it doesn't make sense that this is an *evolved* trait. It is<br>antithetical to "survival of the fittest." Morals don't make me survive<br>better. Morals don't improve my chance for survival.<br><br>And even if you argue that morality is evolved, the Law of Causality<br>says that an effect must resemble its cause. It is therefore illogical<br>that a meaningless, purposeless, amoral universe can imbue us with<br>morals, and a sense of meaning and purpose.<br><br>Therefore, if the universe is not the source of our morality, there must<br>be another cause. And the only other logical choice is that some moral<br>being (you must have morals to give morals) imbued us with morals.<br><br>Atheists can't explain this at all. Agnostics say that they don't know<br>how to explain this. It could be a creator, but they just don't know.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can atheists be moral people? What about agnostics?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-hjgRv){.citation_index} [[The Moral Life of<br>Babies](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1153a5&url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-moral-life-of-babies){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="scientificamerican.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
