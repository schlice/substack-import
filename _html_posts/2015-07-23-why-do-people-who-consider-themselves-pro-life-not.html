<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The sentences aren\'t even vaguely analogous.\<br>\<br>An \"abortion\" is not an object like a \"gun.\" A gun, all by itself,<br>does nothing. An abortion is an activity, it\'s not an object. The two<br>are not even analogous.\<br>\<br>Your logic reads:\<br>\<br>Abortion requires a person to \"pull the trigger.\"\<br>Guns require a person to pull the trigger.\<br>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\<br>Therefore, Abortion is equal to guns.\<br>\<br>This is an example of fallacious logic.\<br>\<br>Additionally, the court has ruled that a fetus is not a person. Until<br>that changes, people aren\'t actually killing people when they have an<br>abortion. They\'re killing a collection of cells that vaguely looks like<br>a very tiny person, but really isn\'t.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
