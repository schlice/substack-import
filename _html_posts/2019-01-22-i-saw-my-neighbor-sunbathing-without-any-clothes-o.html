I<br>have young children in my house. Should I call the police for indecent<br>exposure in public?**<br><br>I see lots of commentary about what the police are "supposed" to do and<br>how you should look away but I don't see any real *answers*.<br><br>The answer is "it depends."<br><br>First off, I'm assuming you're in the United States.<br><br>Secondly, it depends on your state. Some states only classify indecent<br>exposure as nudity with a sexual component (i.e. an aroused male, or a<br>suggestively touching female). In other states, nudity in your own<br>backyard is acceptable. In still others, nudity that is visible from<br>anywhere (i.e. a second story into a neighbor's yard) is illegal.<br><br>You'll have to check the laws in your state as to whether or not it is<br>illegal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
