<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why has the term "nationalist" been redefined, and why is it simply<br>being accepted? It isn't hard to qualify it with "white" if that's what<br>someone is trying to say, without losing the original term & its<br>meaning.**<br><br>This is an excellent question, and one which bears examining.<br><br>The answer to your question is that the term "nationalist," like many<br>other terms, is being redefined for political gain.<br><br>If your opponent declares himself a "nationalist," then it makes sense<br>to confuse your audience by conflating "nationalist" (an arguably<br>neutral term) with "white nationalist" (an arguably racist term). Then<br>you can point to your opponent being a "nationalist" and claim that he's<br>a racist, because you've successfully conflated "nationalist" and "white<br>nationalist."<br><br>This has just recently been done with two other terms: "immigrant" and<br>"illegal immigrant." An "immigrant" is something we like, while an<br>"illegal immigrant" is something we don't like. You can say that you are<br>anti-illegal immigrant until your opponent attempts to redefine<br>"immigrant" to include "illegal immigrant" and now if you oppose<br>illegals entering the country, you're "anti-immigrant."<br><br>See how that works?<br><br>If you can conflate and confuse, you can distract your base from the<br>real issues. When you don't have an actual, articulable platform to run<br>on, confuse your base with terminology.<br><br>Classic political strategy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
