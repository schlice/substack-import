<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First off, you've got a lot of things going on here, and please pass<br>along to your daughter that we're keeping her in our prayers for healing<br>and some respite from the pain.<br><br>So it sounds like there are three unique things going on (at minimum, we<br>don't know if any others are occurring):<br><br>- gallstones<br>- ovarian cysts<br>- MS<br><br>While I can't tell you much about gallstones or ovarian cysts, I can<br>tell you that MS doesn't cause gallstones or ovarian cysts.<br><br>MS is an autoimmune disease which interferes with nerve signals in the<br>CNS, which produce its varied symptoms. These are symptoms like the heat<br>sensation she feels, or numbness or tingling in her hands and feet, or<br>trouble with balance, or with bladder control, or anything related to<br>nerve transmission along the CNS.<br><br>Gallstones and ovarian cysts are conditions which are unrelated to CNS<br>function.<br><br>My wife had both gallstones and ovarian cysts, and they are indeed<br>painful. To experience them both at the same time must be brutal.<br><br>Please let us know how her treatment progresses.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
