<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you think the concerns about police brutality against minorities<br>are a result of a systematic problem in law enforcement, or just the<br>result of individual rogue police persons?**<br><br>You quoted the "Black Lives Matter" homepage in the source for your<br>question, and that triggered me.<br><br>For almost four years now, Black Lives Matter has held the belief that<br>racist police officers are the greatest threat to young black men today.<br>While this campaign has produced some useful outcomes, like a renewed<br>interest in police uses of force and a harsher look at training, it has<br>also resulted in the murder and attempted murder of police officers, and<br>other outcomes like an attempt to get rid of grand juries.<br><br>Even worse, because of the (incorrect) belief that Michael Brown was<br>shot in cold blood while trying to surrender, he's been turned into a<br>martyr. Police agencies are now backing off of proactive policing<br>policies because of the backlash, and violent crime has seen its largest<br>spike in over two decades because of it. All of this (meaning the entire<br>foundation of the Black Lives Matter movement) is based on a *lie*.<br><br>So bearing that in mind, let's answer your questions. *Are there racist<br>cops?* Sure there are. There are racists in society. Police come from<br>society. Therefore, there will be racist cops. It's inevitable. You<br>simply can't weed all of them out. Could that racism drive a police<br>officer to abuse a suspect? Sure it could. But "the system" is<br>transparent. We have cameras. We have FOIA. The renewed look into police<br>use of force has ensured that virtually no incident of use of force goes<br>unscrutinized by the public. It's highly unlikely that any officer would<br>be able to get away with such abuses of blacks for long. "The system"<br>would ensure that at some point, those abuses would be seen and that<br>officer would be fired.<br><br>*Is policing in America fundamentally, systemically flawed, such that<br>abuses against blacks routinely go unchecked*? Not even close. It's a<br>government system so it's going to have some flaws. When you have a<br>system as large and complex as policing, it's going to have some issues.<br>But since it is a government system, it is inbuilt with checks against<br>exactly these kinds of abuses. Additionally, the checks are in layers.<br>For example, every time there is an Officer-Involved Shooting (OIS),<br>there are at least *three* investigations into that action. First, the<br>department investigates the officer's use of force to determine if it<br>was reasonable and did not violate any department policies. And if you<br>think agencies "cover" for officers, you're highly mistaken. If they<br>would ever be found out (which in this "transparent" climate is highly<br>likely), every one of that command staff would lose their jobs and<br>probably be prosecuted. No one wants that kind of scrutiny. Second, the<br>District Attorney investigates the shooting to see if any laws were<br>broken. The District Attorney also answers to the people of that city.<br>Finally (another result of the Black Lives Matter movement), the U. S.<br>Department of Justice may also investigate to see if the suspect's civil<br>rights were violated. If a civilian is involved in a shooting, it's only<br>the DA's office that investigates the civilian. The officer is subjected<br>to *two to three times the amount* of investigations as a civilian in a<br>similar situation, and this is *inbuilt* into the system. So is the<br>system really designed to allow officers to "skate?" Again, not even<br>close.<br><br>The danger of Black Lives Matter is that it institutionalizes hatred and<br>violence against the police. It normalizes "resistance" to police, which<br>actually *increases* uses of force in police interactions. The results<br>of their own actions actually cause *more* use of force rather than<br>*less*. One political party in our country has glommed on to the BLM<br>movement and has made it a jewel in their crown. Each new candidate<br>tries to outdo the other in a twisted race to the bottom to see just how<br>PC they can be by doubling down on the other guy's hatred for the<br>police. If you don't believe me, take a look at the #AbolishICE hashtag<br>sometime. There are several major candidates for Congress (and a few<br>Presidential hopefuls for 2020) who espouse this opinion.<br><br>We are headed down a very dangerous path, and it has nothing to do with<br>racist cops.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
