<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*NOTE: This entire conversation is predicated on the view that the sex<br>(and the family planning) is happening within the bounds of a healthy<br>marriage.*<br><br>So are you saying that if you are trying to have children and you do<br>have sex and you don't get pregnant, was your sex sinful? Or is it only<br>sinful if you have sex and you're not trying to have children? Or you're<br>not even thinking about children?<br><br>Do you believe in contraceptive use? Do you think that Christian<br>families can use contraceptives? Can they use the rhythm method to<br>control when they get pregnant? Do you think it is a sin to try to<br>control when they get pregnant?<br><br>\<br><br>These are all related questions, but the answer is that the Bible is<br>indeed silent about the practices of family planning, in just the same<br>way that the Bible is silent about cell phones. It just didn't exist at<br>the time of the Bible's writing.<br><br>That said, preventing or controlling pregnancy for family planning<br>purposes is netural; it is not considered sinful. However, the married<br>couple must always accept the fact that God's will *will be done*<br>whether they agree that it's the right time or not.<br><br>> In their hearts humans plan their course, but the LORD establishes<br>> their steps. --- Proverbs 16:9 NIV<br><br>Married couples must accept this possibility. If it is God's will that<br>they get pregnant, contraceptives will not stop that from happening.<br><br>Anyone, but especially married couples, who has sex, with or without<br>contraception, must be prepared for the possibility of pregnancy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
