<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Ultimately, it\'s up to the officer to determine a safe<br>place to pull over. When the officer turns his lights on, the law<br>requires you to pull over immediately. The law does not contain<br>provisions for you to determine on your own that it\'s not safe to pull<br>over.\<br>\<br>Continuing to drive when an officer has directed you to stop risks you<br>being charged with evasion. For every second that you do not pull over,<br>you risk being charged, regardless of how many or how few seconds you<br>continue to drive after being directed to pull over. If you pull over<br>and the officer determines the area in which he stopped you is unsafe to<br>remain stopped, he will direct you to move.\<br>\<br>But the bottom line is that if the officer directs you to stop, stop.<br>Thinking you know better will only get you in more<br>trouble.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
