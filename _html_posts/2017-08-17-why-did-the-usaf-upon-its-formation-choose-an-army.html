<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Air Force became its own service in 1947. Before that, it was part<br>of the Army as the Army Air Corps.<br><br>So it was already using Army-style ranks.<br><br>But they did make a few changes; for example, they did not keep the Army<br>enlisted ranks. They changed the color of the uniform, adopting Air<br>Force Blue instead of Army Green, but the styling of the uniform was<br>identical to the original Army Air Corps uniform. They did keep the rank<br>insignia and the rank structure on the officer side.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
