<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'll not try to say that this has never happened in the past, but it<br>rarely happens today. Police do not have the flexibility to work<br>"outside the system" anymore. The advent of cameras everywhere and<br>advanced forensic analysis have made it virtually impossible to get away<br>with such antics today.<br><br>Besides, qualified immunity has gotten so limited that it's better for<br>an officer to just keep his head down and not get himself into stupid<br>situations than to shoot first and ask questions later. Proactive<br>policing has virtually vanished in most major cities today.<br><br>Which is the cause, by the way, of what we are seeing now: the biggest<br>increase in violent crime in over two decades.<br><br>It's nice to put your cops on a short leash, but there is a steep price<br>to pay for that leash, and the bill is coming due today.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
