<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>For completeness, let me discuss how we translate the Bible, and why<br>there are differences in methodology when we do translations.<br><br>For example, Hebrew, as a language, has fewer words than English, so<br>each word has multiple meanings. So a word-for-word translation would<br>actually translate the word, but the sentence may not convey the same<br>meaning, because the author writing in Hebrew may have meant one of the<br>other meanings of the words.<br><br>We have exactly the opposite problem when translating from Greek. For<br>example, our word "love" in English has no fewer than *six* different<br>words in Greek. So when we say "love," which one of the six words in<br>Greek are we referring to?<br><br>Therefore, when doing a Bible translation, there are three different<br>philosophies that the translator can follow:<br><br>- Word-for-word<br>- Thought-for-thought<br>- Paraphrase<br><br>Each philosophy has its own advantages and disadvantages, which we began<br>to look at when we started answering this question. Word-for-word<br>translations translate the words accurately, but sometimes miss the<br>thoughts. When you move up a level to thought-for-thought translations,<br>the translator will read an entire sentence in the source language and<br>then write it in the target language. It may not preserve the original<br>words, but it preserves the original thoughts. A paraphrase translation<br>doesn't worry about retention of words or thoughts, but it intentionally<br>*re-states* the paragraph, often adding many words in order to fully<br>describe what the original author was trying to say.<br><br>Here's a handy chart you can use to see where the various translations<br>land on the scale, from most word-for-word accuracy, to most<br>understandable in terms of what the author was trying to say.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-6318b071f7b5cf5baf42863acee2fb10){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-6318b071f7b5cf5baf42863acee2fb10" master_w="730"<br>master_h="417"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(Source:* [*\[Infographic\: Types of Bible<br>Translations*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=73e41f&url=https://www.ucg.org/vertical-thought/infographic-types-of-bible-translations){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ucg.org"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br>According to this, the most accurate word-for-word translation is the<br>New American Standard Bible (NASB), followed closely by the Amplified<br>Bible (AMP).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
