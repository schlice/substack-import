That would be in violation of the Fair Housing Act.<br><br>However, they can dictate how the ramp looks, what materials it is made<br>out of, and possibly if there is more than one suitable location for the<br>ramp, which location you can use.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
