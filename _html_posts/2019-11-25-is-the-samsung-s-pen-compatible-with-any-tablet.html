<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is the Samsung S Pen compatible with any tablet?<br><br>No.<br><br>The S Pen is an *inductive stylus*, and it works with an active<br>digitizer which induces an electromagnetic field from underneath the<br>screen of a Samsung Note phone (or Ultra series phone, or Samsung<br>tablet). When the S Pen moves close to that active digitizer, the<br>electromagnetic field in the digitizer induces a current in the pen, and<br>they begin communicating with each other, even before the pen touches<br>the display. That's part of the beauty of the system, and how it can<br>work so well.<br><br>Non-S Pen tablets and phones use a *capacitive touch display.* Your<br>finger (and a regular stylus) is an electrostatic conductor. The hard<br>outer glass on your phone is also an electrostatic conductor. When you<br>touch the glass (either with your finger or a normal stylus), the<br>electrostatic field changes, and your phone registers that change as a<br>touch, a tap, or a drag.<br><br>An inductive stylus only marginally change the capacitance of the<br>screen, just enough to register the touch. The magic happens through<br>communications, not capacitance.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
