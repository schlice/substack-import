<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**For any reason at all: if a company that produces bulletproof<br>materials offers to completely bulletproof your truck/car for free,<br>would you accept the offer, even if you don't live in an area that's<br>full of violence and prone to theft and vandalism?**<br><br>No.<br><br>First of all, while it would be *cool* to have a totally bulletproof<br>vehicle, there are a few disadvantages.<br><br>- Bulletproofing, while it would be free, is not *light*. It's heavy. In<br>  fact, it's *really* heavy. Adding an extra half ton to the vehicle in<br>  bulletproofing will mess with lots of things in the vehicle:<br>  performance, acceleration/braking, gas mileage, premature wear on<br>  components of the car, etc.<br>- While it might make a cool novelty car, I don't buy cars that just sit<br>  in my driveway as novelties. I'm not that rich. Every car I own is a<br>  working vehicle, even if it's just a daily driver. I can't afford to<br>  fully bulletproof a car and then have to drive it around every day. It<br>  actually makes the driving experience that much more dangerous. The<br>  President's bulletproof limousine is built on a *truck* frame, not a<br>  stretched car frame. My car, built on a *car* frame, can't handle the<br>  added stresses and will eventually fail, leaving me without a car.<br><br>TL;DR: While it would be cool, and free, it's unnecessary and not<br>good for my car.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
