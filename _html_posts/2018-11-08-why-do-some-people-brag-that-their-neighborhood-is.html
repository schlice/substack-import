<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why do some people brag that their neighborhood is so safe they don't<br>lock their doors? Regardless of the crime rate in a particular area,<br>isn't it foolish not to keep your doors locked at most times?**<br><br>Back in the day, people talked about not ever thinking about locking<br>doors because their neighborhoods were "so safe." So some people today,<br>trying to hearken back to the "good old days when people weren't bad"<br>will still say that they don't lock their doors because their<br>neighborhood is just so safe and just doesn't have crime.<br><br>Meh.<br><br>When it comes to my house, I fastidiously secure it. I want no one in my<br>house, ever, and I'm not going to take the chance, even though I live in<br>a relatively crime-free area of town when it comes to home invasion.<br><br>On my car, though, I actually have the opposite opinion. *I keep my car<br>doors unlocked* ***because there is so much smash-and-grab crime in my<br>neighborhood.***<br><br>I would much prefer that a thief open my car doors and root around in my<br>car for anything they may want to steal, rather than breaking my windows<br>and having me go through the hassle of the insurance claim and getting<br>new windows.<br><br>I can only do this for a few reasons:<br><br>1.  There is literally nothing in my car worth stealing. I removed<br>    anything of value from my car long ago.<br>2.  I don't have a garage door remote in my car, another item of value<br>    that thieves want to steal from cars parked in your driveway. If you<br>    routinely park a car in your driveway, *remove your garage door<br>    remote.* It's like leaving a key to your garage door in plain sight<br>    in your car.<br>3.  My registration doesn't have my address on it. So that's not even<br>    worth stealing.<br>4.  My car has Lo-Jack. Go ahead, steal my car. We'll see just how far<br>    you get with it before we catch you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
