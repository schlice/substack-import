<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can I use Windows to create a striped drive between a 300MB drive and<br>1TB drive and then use the rest of the space on the 1TB to create<br>redundancy? Just so I\'m clear, I have two physical drives.**<br><br>Yes.<br><br>To accomplish this, open Disk Management, right-click on the free space<br>you want to start using, and click "New Striped Volume..." The New<br>Striped Volume Wizard appears. On the Select Disks page, select from the<br>available disks and then click Add to add the disks to the striped<br>volume. Select both disks and choose Next. Then, set the amount of space<br>to use on the disks for the striped volume. You will choose the entire<br>300 MB disk, and 300 MB of space on the 1 TB drive, and click Next. On<br>the Assign Drive Letter Or Path page, the default is to assign the next<br>available drive letter to the new volume. You can also mount the volume<br>on an empty NTFS folder on an existing volume, and click Next. On the<br>Format Volume page, choose the formatting options for the new volume.<br>Windows 7 and later supports only NTFS formatting from the Disk<br>Management snap-in (to format with FAT or FAT32, you need to use the<br>command line). Click Finish on the summary page to create the volume. If<br>the disks are basic disks, you'll be warned that this operation will<br>convert them to dynamic disks (which is why you need to back up the<br>volumes before you do this). Click Yes to convert the disks and create<br>the striped volume.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
