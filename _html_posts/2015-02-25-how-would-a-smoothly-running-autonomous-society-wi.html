<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [(Original question answered here was \"Out of 100 people<br>in a society, how many should be police officers to ensure a peaceful<br>society?\")\<br>\<br>There is no number high enough to force peace on the population. You<br>can\'t \"force peace\" as those two concepts are mutually exclusive.\<br>\<br>The real answer is that you can never \"ensure a peaceful society,\"<br>because society is made up of people, and people don\'t always behave in<br>the way you expect everyone to behave in an ordered society.\<br>\<br>In order to have peaceful society, everyone must agree to live by the<br>rules, which exist to ensure that my peaceful existence is not<br>interrupted by your peaceful existence. It is in the intersection of<br>these two peaceful existences that arguments occur. It will always be<br>this way. Personal interactions are messy and tense and sometimes spill<br>over into anger and violence.\<br>\<br>Unless people change, societies will always be this way.\<br>(Newly re-worded question now reads: \"How would a smoothly running,<br>autonomous society with 1,000 members employ each of its members?\"\<br>\<br>To answer this question, we must add one more piece to the hypothetical:<br>*Will this be a society based on money, and will it be a free-market<br>economy?*\<br>\<br>If the answer is \"no\", then you can lay it out however you like. You<br>can make as many or as few as you like, and there would be no<br>consequences.\<br>\<br>If the answer is \"yes,\" then you don\'t have to do anything. If you<br>leave it alone, the free market economy will automatically determine how<br>many of each specialty is needed. The exception is for the \"essential<br>services personnel\" like police and fire (i.e. provided by government),<br>of whom you have exactly as many as you need to efficiently handle the<br>entire volume of service calls.\<br>\<br>For example, if you have only one piano tuner, but there is enough work<br>for five piano tuners, then four more people will become piano tuners<br>and will start working. But if you have three piano tuners but there is<br>only enough work for two, the worst piano tuner will go out of business<br>and will have to find other gainful employment.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
