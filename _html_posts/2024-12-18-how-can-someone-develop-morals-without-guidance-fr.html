<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Morals are developed throughout your life, and there are many influences<br>which help you develop your morals. Your parents and your community are<br>closely involved. You also develop morals based on your empathy and your<br>sense of fairness. Humans have a desire to do what is right and to avoid<br>what is wrong, and so your personal morals develop throughout your<br>lifetime while you follow your "inner compass" which influences you to<br>do what is right, and avoid what is wrong.<br><br>Does a deity guide your moral development? No. You develop morals on<br>your own, following your inner compass, and your empathy and sense of<br>fairness. The question that atheists cannot answer: ***from where did<br>your inner compass and your inbuilt sense of empathy and fairness<br>derive?***<br><br>There is no evolutionary process which explains why all humans<br>everywhere, regardless of country of origin or family or societal<br>structure, have an inbuilt sense of empathy and strive for fairness and<br>equality. These things are particularly inconsistent with Darwinism.<br>"Survival of the fittest" is specifically inconsistent with empathy or<br>fairness. Evolutionary biologists are coming out and saying that the<br>currently accepted evolutionary model is insufficient to explain how<br>things like fairness and empathy developed. At the Royal Society in<br>2016, they said that they need a "new paradigm" to explain how<br>irreducibly complex biological structures and inbuilt morality could<br>have evolved, because neo-Darwinian models are insufficient to explain<br>them.<br><br>So if the universe didn't evolve your sense of fairness and equity, and<br>if the universe didn't evolve your sense of empathy, where did it come<br>from, and why does every human have it? Because every human has it, it<br>must come from some place which is overarching across all humans, and<br>evolution is insufficient to explain it.<br><br>The existence of this sense of empathy and fairness is what we call the<br>Moral Law, and it is one of the logical proofs which point to the<br>existence of a creator. The logic goes like this:<br><br>1.  Every law has a law giver.<br>2.  The Moral Law exists.<br>3.  Therefore, there exists a Moral Law giver.<br><br>Some call this inbuilt morality "conscience"; others call it "Natural<br>Law"; still others (like our Founding Fathers) refer to it as "Nature's<br>Law." Today, we refer to it as "the Moral Law." But whatever you call<br>it, the fact that a moral standard has been prescribed on the minds of<br>all human beings points to a Moral Law Prescriber. Every prescription<br>has a prescriber. The Moral Law is no different. **Someone must have<br>given us these moral obligations.**<br><br>So you don't need a deity to develop morals. You need a deity to<br>*explain why you develop specific morals*.<br><br>Are there perfect morals? Yes. If the deity is the law giver, morals<br>which develop perfectly in line with the dictates of the deity in<br>question would be "perfect morals." In Christianity, there was one<br>person in history who had "perfect morals" and that was Jesus Christ.<br>Outside of Christ, humans are born into sinful bodies, and will never<br>possess perfect morals. Additionally, people suppress what they know<br>about morals all the time. In other words, even murderers know that<br>murder is wrong, but they have instead found ways to justify it (this of<br>course ignores the fact that some people have brains which do not<br>function properly and cannot even sense their inbuilt moral law).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
