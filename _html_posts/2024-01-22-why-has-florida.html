<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because the measure has inadequately defined what "viability" means.<br><br>Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody had this to say about the proposed<br>state constitutional amendment:<br><br>> As just one example of how misleading this initiative is, the<br>> initiative creates a right to abortion through "viability." \... The<br>> sponsor has gone so far attempting to deceive Floridians as to not<br>> post any information on its website on what it means by viability and<br>> when the right to abortion, which it is attempting to enshrine in our<br>> Constitution, ends. \... While I personally would not vote for this<br>> initiative no matter what definition of \'viability\' it was using, I<br>> know that to some voters, it is material to their vote -- whether you<br>> are talking about an abortion in the first trimester or at the end of<br>> the second trimester.\[1\](#dHECP){#cite-dHECP .citation_link}<br><br>It becomes very difficult to enforce a law for which the definitions of<br>the terms you use are unclear. Without a clear end to when this<br>particular right to abortion would end, there is no way it could be<br>enforced.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-dHECP){.citation_index} [[Ashley Moody: Pro-abortion<br>amendment ballot summary would \'mislead<br>voters\'](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6194c0&url=https://flvoicenews.com/ashley-moody-pro-abortion-amendment-ballot-summary-would-mislead-voters/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="flvoicenews.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
