<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not at all.<br><br>I think we need to ask ourselves why we want the president to release<br>his tax returns. "Because everyone else did" is not a good enough<br>answer. What other reasons could you want to see his returns? Are you<br>trying to catch him in a "lie?" Perhaps he is richer than he says he is.<br>Perhaps he is poorer. Perhaps he has given more money to charity than he<br>said. Perhaps he has given less. It may have helped vet candidate Trump,<br>because you could have seen his true amount of charitable giving, the<br>amount he invests, and his effective tax rate.<br><br>At this point, I don't really care what's on his tax returns. Frankly,<br>that information is between Trump and the IRS. If the IRS doesn't have a<br>problem with his tax returns, then I don't either.<br><br>And, I understand, he was being audited. So the IRS was trying to<br>determine whether or not they had a problem with his tax returns. I<br>haven't even heard whether or not they finished that audit.<br><br>Nevertheless, there is no requirement in the Constitution for a<br>candidate to release their tax returns.<br><br>*But every candidate since the Neanderthals has been releasing their tax<br>returns! Why can't he do it too?*<br><br>It's true, every candidate since Nixon (except for Gerald Ford) has<br>voluntarily released his tax returns.<br><br>*So why did Trump have such a problem with it? Is there something shady<br>in there? Perhaps something the IRS missed?*<br><br>I'm going to let you in on a little "political insider" secret.<br>**Politicians structure their finances so that they can make their tax<br>returns public**.<br><br>Yep, it's all staged.<br><br>They use high-powered CPAs and tax attorneys to help them structure<br>their finances and employ other tax strategery in order to make their<br>taxes appear "acceptable" to Americans. They do this because they know<br>they have to release their returns.<br><br>Trump has never done this. He's been a businessman, working with sums of<br>money that you and I could only dream of. If you compared his taxes to<br>the taxes of a politician, whose do you think would look "worse?"<br><br>At this point in time, you should be asking yourself (much like Hillary<br>asked about Benghazi), "What difference does it make?" The reason it<br>makes no difference is that he was elected without revealing his tax<br>statements. To me, this means that the people who elected him don't<br>really care about the fact that he didn't release his tax statements.<br><br>Very few politicians since Nixon, who was the first to do it, have been<br>elected without doing so. Every Republican since Nixon, with the<br>exception of President Ford, has released his tax statements. But Trump<br>was elected without revealing his tax returns, which leads me to believe<br>that people don't really care about Trump's taxes. We leave that to the<br>IRS, since they've made themselves so self-important when it comes to<br>vetting taxes, and they've repeatedly stated that taxes are between the<br>taxpayer and the IRS.<br><br>So let them handle it.<br><br>*But shouldn't we know?*<br><br>If you really believe we should know, lobby your Congressional<br>representatives. Get them to propose a Constitutional amendment, using<br>this "outrage" over Trump's failure to release his tax returns, and add<br>a requirement to reveal tax returns. Allow the IRS to do it once you<br>submit your statement of intent for candidacy. Then you could go to the<br>IRS website and see the candidate's tax history, if it's so important to<br>you. And if there are so many people who agree with you (well, more than<br>half of the voters numerically voted for Hillary, so maybe there's<br>momentum there), perhaps you can get 38 states to vote for that<br>amendment.<br><br>**And the candidate who gets elected will be the one who has the best<br>CPAs working their taxes to make their returns look the<br>squeaky-cleanest.**<br><br>If Trump knew twenty years ago that he was going to be running for<br>president, he would have structured his finances so that they look good<br>on a 1040. But Trump isn't a politician.<br><br>Until such time as we amend the Constitution to require candidates for<br>president to release their tax returns, that information is between the<br>taxpayer and the IRS. If the IRS doesn't have a problem with the<br>candidate's returns, then neither do I.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
