<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Am I justified to be mad at my parents for lying to me about Santa<br>when I was being bullied for it?**<br><br>There are two parenting topics which need to be addressed, separately.<br><br>1.  Belief in Santa<br>2.  Being bullied<br><br>As you can see by my credential, I have raised three boys. None of them<br>are children any more (but just barely; my youngest is 18). Let's<br>address these one by one.<br><br>1.  I never told my children that Santa does not exist. Ever. I simply<br>    told them that "Santa only brings presents to those who believe."<br>    Ever see *The Polar Express?* Can you still hear the bell ring?<br>    Belief is exactly like that. And if my kids tell me they don't<br>    believe in Santa (one tried it one year), he did not get a present<br>    from Santa. He was not okay with that, until he was reminded just<br>    how vociferously he expressed his disbelief in Santa. Santa only<br>    brings presents to those who believe. I don't care how old you are.<br>2.  It is never okay to be bullied, regardless of the reason. And you<br>    don't blame someone else's bullying behavior on what you choose to<br>    believe. You are free to believe whatever you wish. Bullies are<br>    still bullies even if you choose to believe in Santa. The bully is<br>    the problem, not the parent who shaped your belief.<br><br>You are also free to be mad at your parents if you think they are the<br>reason you are being bullied. You must understand, though, that you are<br>mistaken and your anger is misplaced. Your parents didn't allow the<br>bully to proceed with his or her bullying. They didn't even encourage<br>it. The bullying is never acceptable, whatever the reason.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
