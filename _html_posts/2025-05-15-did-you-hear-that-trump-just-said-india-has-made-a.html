<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(Current as of May 15, 2025)*<br><br>Well, it's slightly more nuanced than that.<br><br>Yes, Trump was discussing some ongoing trade negotiations with Tim Cook,<br>the CEO of Apple, when they discussed relocating iPhone manufacturing<br>from China to India.<br><br>Trump said, \"They \India\ have offered us a deal where basically they<br>have agreed to charge us literally no tariffs. I said \'Tim, we are<br>treating you really good, we put up with all the plants you built in<br>China for years. We are not interested in you building in India. India<br>can take care of themselves\'.\"<br><br>India responded back swiftly, saying that "talks are still going on" and<br>\"nothing is decided till everything is.\"<br><br>In other words, the idea is still on the table, but it's not a "done<br>deal" yet. The talks are still preliminary.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
