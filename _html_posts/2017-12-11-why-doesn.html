<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let me explain how taxes and tax cuts work. I'll do this using a story.<br><br>\<br><br>Ten men go to dinner every night. They all eat together, and their bill<br>is \$100 every night. The men decide that they will split the bill in<br>the same way that taxes work, based on the amount of money each man<br>makes. Therefore, the first four (who earned the least) paid \$0, the<br>fifth paid \$1, the sixth paid \$3, the seventh paid \$7, the eighth<br>paid \$12, the ninth paid \$18, and the tenth (the richest man there)<br>paid \$59. The men all agreed that this would be a fair way to split the<br>bill.<br><br>This arrangement went on for quite some time, until one day the owner of<br>the restaurant approached their table. He said, "You men are great<br>customers; you're in here every night and you never had a problem paying<br>your bill. Because I want to give something back to my most valued<br>customers, I'm going to take \$20 off of your bill. Your new nightly<br>bill will be \$80."<br><br>The men struggled as to how they should divvy up this newfound wealth.<br>Should they just give \$2 to everyone at the table? Well, that wouldn't<br>be fair, they thought, because there are four men at the table who paid<br>nothing to begin with; they'd be *making* money off of the deal. So<br>they decided to divide the \$20 in the same way that they paid the bill,<br>based on how much money they contributed to the bill.<br><br>So under the new arrangement, the first four men (who earned the least)<br>still paid nothing. The fifth man, however, now also paid nothing The<br>sixth man now paid \$2, the seventh man now paid \$5, the eighth man<br>paid \$9, the ninth man paid \$12, and the tenth man now paid \$52.<br><br>As the men left dinner that night, they examined the bills and spoke<br>amongst themselves.<br><br>The first four men said, "Hey, there was a \$20 rebate and we didn't get<br>any of it! The system doesn't help the poor to improve their condition<br>in life!"<br><br>The sixth man said, "Yeah, I only got one dollar back, but the richest<br>guy got \$7! The system unfairly rewards the rich! Let's get 'em!"<br><br>So they all ganged up on the rich guy and beat him up.<br><br>The next night at dinner, guess what? The rich guy was *gone!* He had<br>taken his money and moved out of the United States.<br><br>\<br><br>While this story is slightly simplified, this is basically how taxes and<br>tax rebates work in the United States. It appears terribly unfair<br>initially, but if you give tax rebates in the same way you charge taxes,<br>it's actually quite fair (assuming you consider progressive taxes "fair"<br>to begin with).<br><br>And if you beat up the rich guys just because they're rich and appear to<br>get the biggest benefit from tax cuts and tax rebates, don't be<br>surprised if they take all of their money and leave.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
