<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What will happen? Ultimately, nothing noticeable.<br><br>Statistics are varied and are never correctly reported. For example,<br>some states like New York do not report on the number of CCW holders.<br>Some states like Montana and Arizona do not require permits to carry<br>concealed firearms (i.e. Constitutional Carry states). And in the vast<br>majority of cases, when a firearm is used to stop a crime without a shot<br>being fired, it is not ever reported to anyone. So take any numbers you<br>hear with a grain of salt.<br><br>Concealed carriers do occasionally commit crimes with their firearms.<br>But make sure you define "occasionally." According to a study by the<br>Crime Prevention Research Center, only 0.006% of concealed carry permit<br>holders were involved in gun related crimes. Does that mean that they<br>wantonly shot someone? Not at all, it said "gun-related crimes" which,<br>according to the report, in most cases involved the CCW holder carrying<br>a gun somewhere prohibited by law (i.e. a gun-free zone, a posted zone<br>where concealed carry is prohibited, etc).\[1\](#FsBOt){#cite-FsBOt<br>.citation_link}<br><br>[[What percent of concealed carry permit holders are involved in violent<br>crimes?](https://www.quora.com/What-percent-of-concealed-carry-permit-holders-are-involved-in-violent-crimes)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>In Texas in 2011, .18% of all crimes were committed by CCW holders. That<br>doesn't say that the CCW holder actually used a gun in the commission of<br>the crime, it just says that CCW holders committed .18% of all crimes in<br>the state.<br><br>[[Texas Conviction Rates Report<br>2011](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eb06cc&url=http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/RSD/CHL/Reports/ConvictionRatesReport2011.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="state.tx.us"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-FsBOt){.citation_index}<br>[http://crimeresearch.org/wp-cont\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=15cdbd&url=http://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Concealed-Carry-Permit-Holders-Across-the-United-States.pdf+(http://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Concealed-Carry-Permit-Holders-Across-the-United-States.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="crimeresearch.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
