<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In almost every jurisdiction that I am aware, police K9s are considered<br>sworn peace officers, despite the fact that they could not raise their<br>right hand or salute when their badge was pinned on.<br><br>If you injure a police K9, you would be charged with aggravated assault<br>against a peace officer, and if you killed the K9, you would also be<br>charged with destruction of government property (while states may<br>consider them peace officers, they are still property, not people).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
