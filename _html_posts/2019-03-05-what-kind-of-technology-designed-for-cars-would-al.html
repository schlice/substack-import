It is not intentionally built for<br>cars, but it is adaptable to cars.<br><br>The technology: satellite phones.<br><br>Sat phones work nearly anywhere you have a clear view of the sky,<br>worldwide. Several models of sat phones have car adapter kits which<br>allow you to mount magnetic antennas on the outside of your car to<br>improve reception, along with charging the phone and providing accessory<br>attachment points for things like handsfree speakers and microphones.<br><br>Additionally, you can also use technology which is *not* adapted to<br>cars, from a car. Personal Locator Beacons, or PLBs, are small and<br>portable, and once activated, will transmit an emergency signal which<br>will guide rescuers to your exact location.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
