<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you accidentally call 911 will the police definitely come to your<br>house even if you call and tell them its an accident?**<br><br>No, but the key to whether or not they will come out to your house is<br>whether or not you hang up on them without telling them about your<br>accident.<br><br>Short answer: if you accidentally call 911, *stay on the phone!*<br>Tell the 911 operator that you accidentally dialed. Answer all of their<br>questions, and *wait for them to tell you it's okay to hang up.* If you<br>do this, the police will not be dispatched.<br><br>If you accidentally call 911 and then hang up, there's a chance that<br>something could be wrong where you are, and they may very well send a<br>unit out to confirm you're okay.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
