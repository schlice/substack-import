<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I suppose if you're only worried about "gun violence," then logically if<br>there are fewer guns, there will be less gun violence.<br><br>But as has been clearly shown recently, you don't need a gun to be<br>violent. Criminals have used all sorts of tools to be violent, some of<br>which include box cutters, commercial airliners, trucks (on several<br>different occasions), cars, improvised explosive devices such as<br>pressure cookers, and of course, the oft-ignored knife which, much like<br>the gun, was originally invented as a killing tool.<br><br>The knife is an interesting case. It was originally a piece of sharpened<br>flint or obsidian, or possibly rock or bone. It was either used as a<br>stabbing hand weapon, or attached to the end of a long pike (at which<br>point it would usually be called a spear). However, with the advent of<br>metallurgy, we found that we could sharpen the side of the blade to a<br>much finer aspect, and the utility of the knife grew more as a cutting<br>and slicing tool than a stabbing weapon. However, this doesn't change<br>the fact that the knife is still an excellent stabbing weapon, as<br>evidenced by the number of stabbings worldwide, and also clearly<br>evidenced in places where strict gun laws exist (like in the UK), where<br>the leading weapon used in violent crime is the knife, and "hot<br>burglaries" (where the victim is home when the burglar enters) is **ten<br>times** higher in the UK than in the US. Hmm, I wonder if that has<br>anything to do with the fact that the burglars know that law-abiding<br>Britons won't have guns...<br><br>So if your goal is to make "gun violence" go down, then clearly yes, gun<br>violence would go down.<br><br>**But if you don't address the source of the violence, then other types<br>of violence will rise to take its place.**<br><br>You won't be shot, and I guess that's good. You can console yourself<br>with that knowledge when you get mowed down by a truck.<br><br>*I can remember his last words: "At least I wasn't shot..."*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
