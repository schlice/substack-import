<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does the United States need a new (somewhat green), New Deal after<br>CoVid-19 gets under control?**<br><br>Even if the government plunges us into the next Great Depression, the<br>New Deal (or a program just like it) is not the answer.<br><br>The New Deal was great for enacting a new social agenda, but a new New<br>Deal is not the answer because, for all the good that it did do (and it<br>did do some good), it did not end the Great Depression. In fact, it<br>*extended* it.<br><br>And no, World War II did not end the Great Depression, either. It only<br>provided a short-term fix to the economy, and not without great cost.<br><br>It was the foresight of the Republican-southern Democrat coalition that<br>ended the Great Depression. In 1945 and 1946, with their support,<br>Congress repealed the excess-profits tax, cut the corporate tax to a<br>maximum 38 percent, and cut the top income tax rate to 86 percent. In<br>1948 Congress cut the top marginal rate again, down to 82 percent. While<br>that was still high, it was enough to signal to businesses that they<br>would be able to keep much of their profits, and they could start<br>investing in jobs again. By 1946, the jobless rate fell to 3.9% and<br>stayed that way for much of the next decade.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
