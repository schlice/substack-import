<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What steps would need to be taken by Congress to get this \"policy\"<br>below reversed for possible future trials, so that a U.S. President<br>could be sued while in office?**<br><br>I'm glad you put "policy" in quotes. Because it's not policy. It's the<br>Constitution.<br><br>Quoting from "this policy" as was laid out in the landmark case *Nixon<br>v. Fitzgerald:*<br><br>> 2\. Petitioner, as a former President of the United States, is<br>> entitled to absolute immunity from damages liability predicated on his<br>> official acts. Pp. 744-758\<br>> \...\\<br>> (b) The President\'s absolute immunity is a functionally mandated<br>> incident of his unique office, rooted in the constitutional tradition<br>> of the separation of powers and supported by the Nation\'s history.<br>> Because of the singular importance of the President\'s duties,<br>> diversion of his energies by concern with private lawsuits would raise<br>> unique risks to the effective functioning of government. While the<br>> separation-of-powers doctrine does not bar every exercise of<br>> jurisdiction over the President, a court, before exercising<br>> jurisdiction, must balance the constitutional weight of the interest<br>> to be served against the dangers of intrusion on the authority and<br>> functions of the Executive Branch. The exercise of jurisdiction is not<br>> warranted in the case of merely private suits for damages based on a<br>> President\'s official acts. Pp. 748-754.\[1\](#nVBQd){#cite-nVBQd<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>Basically, having to defend against civil suits causes a president to<br>have to divert his attention away from his official duties, which<br>endangers the effective functioning of government. Remember, this<br>doesn't protect the President against *criminal* liability, but it does<br>provide immunity against *civil* liability.<br><br>This principle was upheld and further defined in *Clinton v. Jones*,<br>which stated that presidents can still be sued for actions they took<br>before becoming president, even if they are immune from suit due to<br>official acts while president.<br><br>If you still believe that a president should be able to face liability<br>for civil damages based on his official acts, then Congress isn't the<br>one to do it. The Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution<br>means that any law making a president so liable would be moot before it<br>was even signed.<br><br>Your only option is a Constitutional amendment.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-nVBQd){.citation_index} [[Richard NIXON, Petitioner v.
