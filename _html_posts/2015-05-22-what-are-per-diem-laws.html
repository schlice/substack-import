<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Per diem is not required by law under the Fair Labor<br>Standards Act (FLSA). Paying your employees per diem for travel-related<br>expenses is a good idea, and is also tax-deductible. [[The US<br>GSA](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cec194&url=http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104877){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gsa.gov"}]{.qlink_container} lists the Per Diem rate<br>schedule by city, state, or ZIP code for employee meals plus lodging,<br>and for incidental expenses. Paying at the approved rate is likely tax<br>deductible.\<br>\<br>Corporations are also not legally required under FLSA to reimburse their<br>employees for out-of-pocket expenses they incur for work purposes.<br>However, if their required out-of-pocket expenses reduces their<br>effective pay rate to below minimum-wage standards, the company could<br>face a minimum wage violation claim. Therefore, it is in the best<br>interest of the company to pay work-related out-of-pocket expenses to<br>employees, and an even better deal for companies to pay per<br>diem.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
