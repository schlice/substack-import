<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If the hot water isn\'t available for a week (in an all utilities paid<br>agreement) and the landlord is responsible for fixing it, what are the<br>tenant rights in such situation?**<br><br>One of the things we like to say on Quora is that in legal situations,<br>it depends.<br><br>However, in this case, this is one of those things that is not dependent<br>on where you live.<br><br>In every jurisdiction, landlords are required to provide a safe,<br>healthy, and livable space. It doesn't have to be in your lease; rental<br>properties are covered under an *implied warranty of habitability.* One<br>of the items which is required in order to make a space safe, healthy<br>and livable is hot water. Because hot water is a requirement, it is<br>usually considered an emergency repair if the hot water is out.<br><br>Depending on where you live, you may have different remedies available<br>to you. In most cases though these are pretty much the same.<br><br>First*, you should file a written request for hot water repair.* If<br>the landlord has not repaired the hot water within 24 hours of notice,<br>you can do one of the following. You should check with your local<br>tenants rights group or an attorney to find out which one of these you<br>can legally do in your jurisdiction:<br><br>1.  Withhold your rent payment and make the repair on your own using the<br>    amount of your monthly rent to pay for the repair. Withhold only<br>    enough rent payments to repay the cost to repair the water. Document<br>    exactly how much rent you need to withhold and send your<br>    documentation instead of your rent payment.<br>2.  Instead of withholding rent, pay for the repair and then charge this<br>    cost to the landlord through an invoice. File a lawsuit if the<br>    landlord refuses to pay the invoice.<br>3.  File a lawsuit against the landlord for not providing conditions as<br>    indicated in the leasing agreement, and for not providing a safe<br>    living condition under the implied contract of habitability.<br><br>In some jurisdictions, you also may be able to break your lease without<br>penalty in such a situation. Again, check with your local tenants rights<br>organization or with a real estate attorney who specializes in<br>landlord/tenant law in your local area before you move out.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.
