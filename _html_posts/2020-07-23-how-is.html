<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How is \"In God We Trust\" on cop cars now (Texas+), and are there<br>others who find this deeply disturbing?**<br><br>In 2019, the Supreme Court upheld a 2018 circuit court decision which<br>stated that "In God We Trust" printed on US currency did not violate the<br>Establishment Clause.<br><br>For reference, the Establishment Clause is in the First Amendment. The<br>Establishment Clause states that "Congress shall make no law respecting<br>an establishment of religion."<br><br>The circuit court (upheld by the Supreme Court) stated that the phrase<br>"does not compel citizens to engage in religion."<br><br>It is a historical phrase, and the 2019 ruling was not the first to<br>address it. The appeals court ruled in a separate case, *Aronow v.<br>United States*, in 1970. Understand that this was about the phrase on US<br>coinage, but printing it on government vehicles will follow the same<br>logic. The court stated:<br><br>> It is quite obvious that the national motto and the slogan on coinage<br>> and currency \'In God We Trust\' has nothing whatsoever to do with the<br>> establishment of religion. Its use is of patriotic or ceremonial<br>> character and bears no true resemblance to a governmental sponsorship<br>> of a religious exercise. \...\ While \'ceremonial\' and<br>> \'patriotic\' may not be particularly apt words to describe the<br>> category of the national motto, it is excluded from First Amendment<br>> significance because the motto has no theological or ritualistic<br>> impact. As stated by the Congressional report, it has \'spiritual and<br>> psychological value\' and \'inspirational<br>> quality.\'\[1\](#ZczbH){#cite-ZczbH .citation_link}<br><br>So no, it doesn't bother me that "In God We Trust" is on a police car.<br>It is a national motto with patriotic, ceremonial character, and has<br>nothing to do with the establishment of religion.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ZczbH){.citation_index} [[432 F2d 242 Aronow v.
