<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Who legally decides whether a federal investigation is legitimate or a<br>\'witch hunt\'?**<br><br>Realize you're attempting to apply legal logic to a judicial proceeding,<br>and you can't do that. But it's an interesting thought experiment, so<br>let's look at it.<br><br>Since a "witch hunt" isn't a legal term, no one legally decides whether<br>or not an investigation is a "witch hunt."<br><br>However, a judge can easily determine if an investigation is legitimate<br>by determining whether or not evidence exists to allow the investigation<br>to move forward.<br><br>To that end, had this case gone before a judge as a legal matter, would<br>it have been deemed "legitimate?"<br><br>Initially, the investigation centered on whether or not the Trump<br>campaign "colluded" with Russia to steal the 2016 campaign. Since<br>"collusion" is not a crime, a judge would have found that there was no<br>prosecutable offense to be investigated, and so the investigation itself<br>would not have been legitimate.<br><br>Again, as I initially stated, this is not a legal matter. These<br>investigations are judicial matters, not legal ones.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
