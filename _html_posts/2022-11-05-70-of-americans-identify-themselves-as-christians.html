<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is because Democrats *still* think abortion is a winning<br>issue.<br><br>They think they have the upper hand on abortion. They think that simply<br>saying, "I want to codify *Roe* into federal law" will induce a massive<br>blue wave, because they've been told that a majority of people supported<br>*Roe*.<br><br>Well, as usual, the pollsters got it wrong.<br><br>A majority of Americans supported not messing around with *Roe*. But<br>that same majority of Americans support *some* restrictions on<br>abortion, because that's actually what *Roe* said. It was<br>the *other case law, Planned Parenthood v. Casey,* which allowed<br>abortion for all nine months.<br><br>Yes, most Americans did support *Roe*, but not *Casey.* More Americans<br>support an abortion ban after 15 weeks than those who do<br>not.\[1\](#qSxuW){#cite-qSxuW .citation_link} And support for<br>abortions *beyond* 15 weeks drops *sharply*, to the point that the<br>vast majority of Americans do not support abortions in the third<br>trimester.\[2\](#WfHYc){#cite-WfHYc .citation_link}<br><br>The "codifying *Roe* into law" that Democrats support is **full<br>legalization of abortion for all nine months of pregnancy**. Literally,<br>under a Democrat *Roe-*like law, the mother could be in active labor and<br>decide to abort her baby, and it would be legal. Again, the vast<br>majority of Americans do not support this; the numbers are sharply<br>against this.<br><br>Republicans decided (a bit late, but decided anyway) to *lean in* to<br>this fact, and it has propelled them to victory in several key races<br>already. When faced with their *radical* stance on abortion, the Dems<br>have nowhere to fall back to. The economy under Biden is a shambles, and<br>it's mostly due to his energy policies, and consequently, prices are<br>going up, and jobs are going down. \$2/gallon gas looks pretty good<br>right about now. The border is wide open; anyone can come in and stay.<br>Our politicians are sending billions and billions of our tax dollars<br>overseas to countries to fight wars that have no effect on us. People<br>are concerned about the economy first, and abortion second. Abortion<br>will not overcome a poor economy.<br><br>But Democrats think it will.<br><br>I suppose we shall see.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-qSxuW){.citation_index} [[WSJ News Exclusive \| Support<br>for 15-Week Abortion Ban Outweighs Opposition, WSJ Poll<br>Finds](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=461d21&url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/support-for-15-week-abortion-ban-outweighs-opposition-wsj-poll-finds-11648821601){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="wsj.com"}<br>]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-WfHYc){.citation_index} [[AP-NORC poll: Most say restrict<br>abortion after 1st<br>trimester](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5da505&url=https://apnews.com/article/only-on-ap-us-supreme-court-abortion-religion-health-2c569aa7934233af8e00bef4520a8fa8){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="apnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
