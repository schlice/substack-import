<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should Trump be held responsible for the white supremacist massacre in<br>El Paso, given that the shooter used Trump\'s xenophobic rhetoric in his<br>online manifesto?**<br><br>It\'s common, within the first few weeks of a mass shooting, to point<br>fingers and try to blame absolutely everyone... except for the shooter<br>themselves.<br><br>And it makes your position even more plausible when you point your<br>finger at somebody who is already a polarizing figure.<br><br>Don\'t fall for it.<br><br>The only person to blame here is the shooter, and his sick, twisted<br>ideology. Any racial ideology which leads to violence is a disease. If<br>you want to blame anything or anybody, blame white nationalism, and<br>anyone who would encourage it.<br><br>The president is guilty of many things, but he is not someone who<br>actively espouses violence against anyone. He certainly doesn\'t carry<br>the blame for any mass shooting, no matter how good it might feel to<br>attack him for such things.<br><br>Focus your anger exactly where it should be focused: on the shooter.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
