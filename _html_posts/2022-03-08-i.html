<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So let's make sure we're not talking about the *religious view* on<br>marriage. We're only talking about the *secular* view of marriage as a<br>legal contract which ensures the generativity of any children you may<br>produce, and provides certain tax and death benefits.<br><br>Sex outside of marriage is not (or more accurately, no longer) a crime.<br>But you should still discuss it with your wife, and find out why she<br>won't have sex with you any more.<br><br>If it's important to you, but it's not important to her, but you don't<br>want to divorce, maybe she'd be comfortable allowing you to "get your<br>needs met" elsewhere. Maybe work out a schedule, or look into paying for<br>an escort on a regular basis.<br><br>Perhaps she could engage in any number of "non-penetrative" sexual<br>activities with you, which might be acceptable to both of you. There are<br>certainly options, but she needs to be open to taking care of your<br>needs.<br><br>The trick is that she needs to understand that she is in the wrong here,<br>because she is the one not fulfilling her obligations under the marriage<br>contract. Depending on the state in which you get a divorce, this could<br>count against her if you file for divorce citing failure to fulfill the<br>marital contract. So it behooves her to work with you.<br><br>So that was a very long way round to say that if she's willing to work<br>with you, you don't need to divorce her. But you would certainly have<br>sufficient grounds to do so.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I\'m 49. My wife won\'t have sex with me anymore. Do you think I should<br>remain faithful to her? We have a great son together, but I would love<br>to have some action. It\'s been 13 years.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
