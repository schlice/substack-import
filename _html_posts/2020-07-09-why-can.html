<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why can\'t some religious people accept other people\'s beliefs?<br><br>I can accept that people have a right to believe what they choose to<br>believe. I don't have to "accept their beliefs."<br><br>Because to accept their beliefs is to acknowledge that they are valid.<br>And every religion believes that theirs is the only religion and that<br>theirs is the only one which can lead to their adherents' salvation. It<br>is the nature of a religion: ours is the only way, the others are<br>misguided/wrong/blasphemous.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
