<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, technically it would not be legal to do this.<br><br>First of all, how does someone "insist" you do something that you don't<br>want to do? Gunpoint?<br><br>Second, what this does is make you "quit" rather than be "fired." There<br>are several differences between quitting and being fired. The biggest<br>difference is unemployment. If you are terminated, and you are not<br>terminated for cause (meaning you aren't terminated because you violated<br>company policy, or did something else wrong), generally in most states<br>you are eligible for unemployment compensation. If they try to terminate<br>you for cause, the burden of proof would be on them to show what you<br>did, that they counseled you on the issue, and they gave you an<br>opportunity to answer for what you did. This means they'd have to<br>fabricate a lot of details (lots of paperwork, lots of forged<br>signatures) to terminate you for cause when there was no cause. If they<br>don't do this, they open themselves up to lawsuit for unlawful<br>termination, even in an "at will" state. Terminating you without cause<br>gives you unemployment benefits.<br><br>There are other benefits to being fired over quitting as well, and they<br>may be related to things like tenure and vacation balances and re-hire<br>credit and insurance coverage, but those differ based on state as well<br>as industry and job title.<br><br>I would tell them that if they wanted me gone so bad, they could fire<br>me, but I'm not quitting, and I'm not signing anything. I suspect<br>they'll try to make my life hell from that point on, but let 'em try. I<br>laugh at their silly attempts to make my life hell.
