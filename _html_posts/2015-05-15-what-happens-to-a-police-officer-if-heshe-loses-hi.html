<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If a police officer misplaces his weapon, he can get<br>another one from police issue, but he will likely have to reimburse the<br>cost of the lost one. There will also likely be a disciplinary action<br>taken.\<br>\<br>If his weapon is stolen, and a police report has been filed along with<br>the burglary, he can get another weapon issued without charge.\<br>\<br>Department policies differ on what to do in that instance, as it is very<br>rare.\<br>\<br>Besides, he\'ll likely face far more ridicule at the hands of his fellow<br>officers than any discipline the department could dish<br>out.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
