<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Put simply, I have a *right*. I don\'t have a *privilege*<br>which can be revoked (like a driver\'s license). I have a *right* to own<br>a gun. Regardless of what you may think of the gun, I have a right to<br>own one. I have an *individual* right to \"keep and bear\" one. A<br>function of living in the United States as a citizen affords me that<br>right.\<br>\<br>To address the horror you feel towards guns, that\'s simply because the<br>gun is a purpose-built tool to kill. It is designed to kill. It does so<br>effectively and efficiently.\<br>\<br>That fact alone does not mean that the gun has no place in a household<br>or in society. That fact alone simply means that it is the best tool<br>available for killing. Because it is. It minimizes collateral damage<br>better than any other tool available; it is very precise. It kills<br>whatever I\'m aiming at. As long as I operate it properly, it is one of<br>the safest (for the operator) methods for killing we have. It\'s an<br>extremely simple machine, as far as machines go. More tongue-in-cheek,<br>it\'s the world\'s first \"point-and-click interface.\"\<br>\<br>But does the fact that it is a tool to kill make it unsuitable for a<br>household?\<br>\<br>The question must follow: is killing ever needed? Or lawful?\<br>\<br>The answer is yes, killing is needed in certain scenarios, and even<br>lawful. Killing is needed, under common law, for the purpose of<br>self-defense, and the protection from tyranny. If you are being<br>threatened with deadly force, you can meet that threat with deadly force<br>as well. The gun is sometimes known as \"the great equalizer\" because<br>it removes size and strength differences between people. A famous<br>advertising campaign from Colt said, \"God made man; Samuel Colt made<br>them equal.\" A small person can easily take down a very large man by<br>using a gun; size and gender no longer factor in issues of<br>self-defense.\<br>\<br>And while it is far less likely today, America was founded on the core<br>belief that the people hold the ultimate power in the government.<br>Government is \"of the people, by the people, and for the people.\" The<br>people are the ultimate authority in the government. The people must<br>also retain the right to overthrow the government should that ever<br>become necessary. Because it\'s hard to do today, should we then say,<br>\"Oh well, the government has grown too big and powerful to overthrow,<br>therefore we should remove all guns from society\"? The logic does not<br>follow, as this is a logically false conclusion to draw from the<br>relevant facts.\<br>\<br>Finally, regulation. With every right comes an associated<br>responsibility, and those responsibilities can, and should, and are,<br>codified in law. We as a society have stated that felons should not have<br>access to guns. We have also stated that people should not have access<br>to automatic weapons. We have also stated that guns cannot be brought<br>into sensitive areas, such as schools (although that\'s up for debate)<br>and government buildings such as courthouses. Any time you buy a gun<br>from a licensed gun dealer, you have to have a criminal background check<br>performed. These laws all exist today. What further regulation would you<br>propose that would substantially reduce crime without being increasingly<br>onerous on the legal gun owner?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
