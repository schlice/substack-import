<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Considering that people still do it, and ultimately money<br>is the only motivator here, then yes, crime does pay.\<br>\<br>The statistic I go back to is that, on average, only 10% of crimes are<br>prosecuted. That means that 90% of the time, criminals are getting away<br>with it. That means that most of the time, criminals are making<br>money.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
