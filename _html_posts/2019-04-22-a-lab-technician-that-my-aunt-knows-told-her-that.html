<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**A lab technician that my aunt knows told her that he had processed her<br>blood when she saw him out in public. Isn\'t that a HIPAA privacy<br>violation?**<br><br>That alone is probably not a HIPAA violation.<br><br>If he revealed the *results* of the lab test, that *might* be a HIPAA<br>violation.<br><br>If he revealed the results of the lab test *to anyone else*, that<br>*definitely* would be a HIPAA violation.<br><br>But the simple fact that a lab tech processed a sample for someone he<br>knew (and subsequently told her that he did) is not a violation. He's<br>not necessarily required to maintain his privacy from her. He's required<br>to maintain his privacy from everyone else.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
