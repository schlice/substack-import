<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Who is responsible if my friend gets into an accident with my<br>uninsured car?**<br><br>You are. All of it. You're responsible for any damage your car caused to<br>anything or anyone else, and you're responsible for paying for your<br>friend's injuries. Of course, your car is damaged, and you'll probably<br>have to get that fixed (which you'll have to pay for as well).<br><br>You are 100% responsible for all of those costs, because you own the<br>car. Oh, and by the way, you'll also be responsible for the fines you'll<br>face for having an uninsured vehicle on the road, which violates state<br>law in nearly every state. At a minimum, you are required to carry<br>liability insurance for injuries and property damage. Insurance which<br>covers the actual car itself is not usually required.<br><br>In some states, you can pay a fee instead of carrying insurance. And in<br>states like Mississippi and New Hampshire, you can put down a cash bond<br>in lieu of carrying liability insurance. In all other states, liability<br>insurance is mandatory.<br><br>If you think your friend should be responsible for some of those costs,<br>you'll have to file a lawsuit to recoup your costs. For example, if your<br>friend was driving recklessly, you'll have to sue him to get your money<br>back, after you pay for all the damage he caused.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
