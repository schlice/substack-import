<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Thanks for the A2A.<br><br>Personhood is a legal term which some states use to determine to what<br>human beings the Constitution is supposed to apply. This is because in<br>some states, the right to life does not apply to unborn human beings,<br>while in other states, the right to life does apply to unborn human<br>beings.<br><br>Some states have established "personhood" in their state Constitutions,<br>implying that the right to life applies to everyone to whom "personhood"<br>has been granted. And yes, "personhood" is a legal definition which is<br>only granted by law, whereas "human being" is not a legal definition but<br>a biological one, determined solely by science and the inclusion of an<br>organism in the species *Homo Sapiens*.<br><br>"Humans" have "human rights" because they are human, but human rights<br>can be violated if doing so is not illegal. "Persons" are protected by<br>the Constitution because it guarantees a right to life. Violating the<br>right to life is unconstitutional, and laws already protect people from<br>having their life unlawfully taken from them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
