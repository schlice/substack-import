<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Of course there is!<br><br>The answer is propose better laws.<br><br>And oh by the way, the laws have nothing to do with guns.<br><br>If all you want to do is limit the guns that law-abiding citizens can<br>buy, yeah you're pretty much not going to get anywhere.<br><br>But if you were to, perchance, start to focus on the *real* issues<br>instead of incessantly focusing on the tool, you'd be much better off.<br><br>If you could magically eliminate all guns right now, people will still<br>kill other people. If you had magically eliminated all guns before<br>Orlando, you'd have a mass *bombing* instead of a mass<br>*shooting*. The tool is not relevant. The issue is the criminal.<br><br>Start proposing some ideas around how to better handle **criminal<br>insanity**, and you might have a better chance at reaching consensus.<br><br>But pulling stupid stunts like sit-ins in Congress (which actually make<br>you look childish and *hurt* your candidate's chance at getting elected)<br>accomplishes less than nothing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
