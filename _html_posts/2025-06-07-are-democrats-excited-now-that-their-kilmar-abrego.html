<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's a Pyrrhic victory for the Democrats.<br><br>Democrats believe they've won some ground against the Trump<br>administration "unlawfully" deporting "illegal immigrants" without "due<br>process."<br><br>But the truth of the matter is much plainer.<br><br>- Congress decided that the courts would be waaaaaay too clogged up with<br>  immigration cases if we allowed them to go through the regular court<br>  system. So instead, Congress gave the power of enforcement of<br>  immigration law to immigration judges in federal immigration<br>  court.<br>- This, in fact, qualifies as "due process," since there is no<br>  Constitutional definition of it, and while we are required to give<br>  everyone due process, it does not have to look the same for citizens<br>  as it does for "illegal immigrants."<br>- So I presume that what's going to happen in this case is that as soon<br>  as Garcia lands in the US, he's going to be arrested and thrown in<br>  jail awaiting Federal charges for human trafficking. He's going to be<br>  tried and convicted, and since he's not a US citizen, he can be<br>  deported as part of his sentence. In fact, since there is no question<br>  that he's not a US citizen, he doesn't even need to see an immigration<br>  judge; he'd qualify for expedited deportation.<br><br>So the way this is going to go is that he's going to be tried and<br>convicted, and then he's going to go right back to that same El<br>Salvadorian prison we sprung him from.<br><br>(EDIT) SCOTUS approved third country deportations, so he's *not* going<br>to go back to El Salvador (we shouldn't have sent him back to El<br>Salvador anyway, that was an administrative error). He's going to go<br>somewhere else.<br><br>The Democrats get US citizen-style due process for an MS-13 gang member<br>(their *favorite people*, apparently), and after he's done wasting US<br>taxpayer money in the court system, we're just going to deport him right<br>back to the place we picked him up.<br><br>What a colossal waste of time and money so that the Democrats can try to<br>win points against Trump. Their TDS is clearly showing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
