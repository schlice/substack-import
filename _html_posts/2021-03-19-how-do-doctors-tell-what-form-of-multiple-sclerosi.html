<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How do doctors tell what form of multiple sclerosis you have?<br><br>Doctors will use a variety of techniques to diagnose a patient.<br>Ultimately, diagnosis of MS is a diagnosis of exclusion --- we exclude<br>everything else that can cause the signs and symptoms reported and<br>discovered. When we've done that, the only thing remaining is MS.<br><br>The [[McDonald<br>Criteria](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9cdf98&url=https://mstrust.org.uk/a-z/mcdonald-criteria){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="mstrust.org.uk"}]{.qlink_container} specifies what signs and<br>symptoms constitute a finding of MS, but much of what constitutes the<br>different forms of MS comes from differing symptoms, and how the patient<br>experiences those symptoms, so a complete medical history will be taken.<br><br>The gold standard of diagnostic tools in multiple sclerosis is the MRI.<br>It can see the lesions caused by MS disease activity. Contrast material<br>can also indicate active disease activity. So the MRI can be used to add<br>to the body of evidence which shows MS.<br><br>But there are lots of diseases and conditions which can cause white<br>spots on an MRI. Doctors will also run a series of blood tests<br>(colloquially called the "little white spot series") to check for all of<br>the diseases and conditions which could cause white spots on an MRI.<br><br>Doctors have more things they can look for:<br><br>- A lumbar puncture (also known as a "spinal tap") can look for<br>  "oligoclonal bands" in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This is another<br>  indication of MS disease activity,<br>- Evoked Potential (EP) tests can show the degradation of nerve signals<br>  between the time they leave the brain and the time they arrive at the<br>  muscle.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
