<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The question was "Does the US Second Ammendment \sic\ permit personal<br>ownership of WMDs?"<br><br>Technically, the answer to that is yes, it does. Remember that letters<br>of marque and reprisal were issued to *privateers* who owned their<br>own *battleships*. I think it would be reasonable to presume that a<br>personally-owned warship (the mightiest thing on the ocean at the time)<br>would be equivalent to a WMD.<br><br>Practically, we realize that for every *right*, there are commensurate<br>*responsibilities*. Therefore, some of our rights have *restrictions* or<br>*limits* on them, because as a practical matter, we are not our own<br>islands. We must live together in communities and cities, and laws don't<br>protect me from me; they protect me from you.<br><br>Specifically, the National Firearms Act has long regulated **destructive<br>devices** which covers nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. It also<br>covers area-effect weapons like grenades or anti-personnel weapons like<br>landmines, tripmines or Bouncing Betties.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
