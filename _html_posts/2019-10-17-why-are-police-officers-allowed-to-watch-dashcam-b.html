Certainly not the article you quoted.<br><br>In fact, the article you mentioned says that Americans are divided on<br>whether or not police *should be* allowed to look at their video before<br>they make an official statement. Unsurprisingly, the division is<br>virtually exactly down political lines.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-e27dfe457da5fc07ff91dd92569f3d19){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-e27dfe457da5fc07ff91dd92569f3d19" master_w="572"<br>master_h="759"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Most departments allow police to review their bodycam footage while they<br>are making their reports for the day, as they will normally attach the<br>relevant footage to their official report. So they need to be able to<br>see it in order to ensure it's the correct footage, especially in<br>departments that require cameras be continuously recording.<br><br>But the policy is controlled at a state/local/department level, not<br>nationwide.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
