<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I realize that wearing your seatbelt is the law, but how many people<br>do you think actually wear it though?**<br><br>It's a stupid law. Government is not my nanny. If I want to kill myself,<br>that's my business. Government should not be passing laws to stop me<br>from killing myself.<br><br>Despite what [[Gregg<br>Gray](https://www.quora.com/profile/Gregg-Gray-1)]{.qlink_container}<br>contends, laws which simply exist "because it's good for you" make bad<br>law. Laws should be in place to protect *me* from *you*. Laws should not<br>be in place to protect *you* from *you*.<br><br>Now, there are some practical reasons why a driver should be required to<br>wear a seatbelt. It holds you in place in the event of an accident so<br>you can continue to control the car and you'll be less of a hazard on<br>the road that way. It's also conceivable that people flying around the<br>interior of the car could be a distraction to the driver during an<br>accident, so they should be belted as well.<br><br>The state does have a vested interest in the well-being of children, so<br>laws requiring anyone under 18 to be buckled, even over the objections<br>of stupid parents, are also good laws.<br><br>But forcing people to wear seatbelts because it's "safer?" Government is<br>not my nanny. If I want to risk my own life by skydiving, drinking a 32<br>oz Coca-Cola, or not wearing a seatbelt as a passenger in a car, that's<br>my business and no one else's, especially not the state. My insurance<br>company may want to know about these things, but the state does not have<br>a vested interest in my personal safety. They may have an interest in<br>the safety of consumers at large, so they may mandate that all cars have<br>required safety equipment available and that roads are constructed<br>safely. But laws which protect me from me are bad laws.<br><br>In practice, most people wear seatbelts all the time. It's an easy habit<br>to get into and it is arguably safer to wear them.<br><br>There shouldn't have to be a law to make me do so, though.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
