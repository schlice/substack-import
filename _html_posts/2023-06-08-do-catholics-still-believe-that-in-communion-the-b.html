<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes they do, and they call the consecrated bread the "Eucharist." It is<br>central to the Catholic faith. From the CCC:<br><br>> 1324 The Eucharist is \"the source and summit of the Christian life.<br>> The other sacraments, and indeed all ecclesiastical ministries and<br>> works of the apostolate, are bound up with the Eucharist and are<br>> oriented toward it. *For in the blessed Eucharist is contained the<br>> whole spiritual good of the Church, namely Christ himself*, our<br>> Pasch.\"<br>><br>> 1325 \"The Eucharist is the efficacious sign and sublime cause of that<br>> communion in the divine life and that unity of the People of God by<br>> which the Church is kept in being. *It is the culmination both of<br>> God\'s action sanctifying the world in Christ and of the worship men<br>> offer to Christ and through him to the Father in the Holy Spirit.*\"<br>><br>> 1326 Finally, by the Eucharistic celebration we already unite<br>> ourselves with the heavenly liturgy and anticipate eternal life, when<br>> God will be all in all.<br>><br>> 1327 In brief, the Eucharist is the sum and summary of our faith:<br>> \"Our way of thinking is attuned to the Eucharist, and the Eucharist<br>> in turn confirms our way of thinking.\"<br><br>The process by which the bread and wine turn into Jesus' body and blood<br>is called transubstantiation. The physical form of bread and wine<br>remain, but the *substance* is Jesus.<br><br>They use a few Biblical references to prove this to themselves, but they<br>use those references *in isolation*. They fail to consider the entirety<br>of the Bible when they cite their sources.<br><br>(Note: This is a rather long exegesis, but understanding where the<br>Catholics went wrong is important for us).<br><br>The seminal passage from the Bible the Catholics use is John 6:52--53:<br><br>> *Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, "How can this<br>> man give us his flesh to eat?" Jesus said to them, "Very truly I tell<br>> you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood,<br>> you have no life in you.*<br><br>Sounds pretty convincing, doesn't it? Why wouldn't you believe the plain<br>words in the Bible?<br><br>Well, context is key. ***Because text, without context, is just<br>pretext.***<br><br>So let's review the context of the passage in John 6. We pick up the<br>story right after Jesus fed the 5000. The crowd follows Jesus to<br>Capernaum and then this conversation takes place: (for ease of following<br>along, I will leave the verse numbers in.<br><br>> *25 "When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked<br>> him, "Rabbi, when did you get here?" 26 Jesus answered, "Very truly I<br>> tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I<br>> performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.*<br><br>The people just said, "Rabbi, when did you get here?" Since they didn't<br>even ask for a repeat of the fish and loaves miracle, it appears to be<br>an odd response from Jesus. Unless of course He knew their hearts, which<br>He does. So, He says to them:<br><br>> *27 Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to<br>> eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the<br>> Father has placed his seal of approval."*<br><br>Their true intentions are identified so they come out with it:<br><br>> *28 Then they asked him, "What must we do to do the works God<br>> requires?"*<br><br>What they are really asking is what must we do to keep our bellies full.<br><br>> *29 Jesus answered, "The work of God is this: to believe in the one he<br>> has sent."*<br><br>Here, Jesus establishes the quintessential "work" that God requires: to<br>believe in the one He has sent -- Jesus Christ. Jesus is standing in<br>front of them having just provided a sign, an affirmation that he is the<br>one God has sent. What does the crowd do?<br><br>> *30 So they asked him, "What sign then will you give that we may see<br>> it and believe you? What will you do? 31 Our ancestors ate the manna<br>> in the wilderness; as it is written: 'He gave them bread from heaven<br>> to eat.'"*<br><br>He literally just fed 5000 people with 2 fish and 5 loaves, all they<br>cared to eat, with several baskets full left over. I think He has<br>already given sufficient signs to validate who He is. But the crowd is<br>playing a game here -- trying to entice Jesus to miraculously feed them<br>again. That is all they are interested in. They are not interested in<br>whom the sign(s) affirm, they just want their bellies filled.<br><br>Because they are ignoring the quintessential point -- since they only<br>care about their physical sustenance (not their spiritual sustenance)<br>Jesus then takes what they are asking for and uses it to point to<br>Himself, metaphorically.<br><br>> *32 Jesus said to them, "Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who<br>> has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you<br>> the true bread from heaven. 33 For the bread of God is the bread that<br>> comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."*<br><br>The "bread that comes down from heaven" here is Christ Himself. But it<br>seems that they don't really care. They just want their bellies filled.<br>They think Jesus is talking about actual physical bread, like the manna<br>for their ancestors..<br><br>> *34 "Sir," they said, "always give us this bread."*<br><br>They seem intent to not acknowledge what Jesus is referring to. Perhaps<br>it's on purpose, or perhaps it's because they just cannot see. Jesus<br>then declares who He is. He is not simply a sign from God, he is both<br>the sign and God.<br><br>> *35 Then Jesus declared, "I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me<br>> will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be<br>> thirsty."*<br><br>Notice the language. Here, there is no correlation with eating or<br>drinking. Simply, "whoever comes to me, whoever believes in me."<br>"Eating" his flesh and drinking his blood is a type and a picture of<br>just that. Eating and drinking is what sustains one physically, like<br>coming to and believing in Christ will sustain one spiritually. One<br>simply reflects or reminds us of the other. *One is not the other.*<br><br>> *36 But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe.*<br><br>Jesus then provides the reason as to why they just can't seem to<br>understand.<br><br>> *37 All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes<br>> to me I will never drive away.*<br><br>Here scripture is clear (it echoes Ephesians 2:8-9) that it is God who<br>does the gifting of faith -- He is the one who gives those who will be<br>saved to Christ.<br><br>> *38 For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the<br>> will of him who sent me. 39 And this is the will of him who sent me,<br>> that I shall lose none of all those he has given me but raise them up<br>> at the last day. 40 For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to<br>> the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise<br>> them up at the last day."*<br><br>The crowd seem to understand what Jesus is saying, just not the<br>significance of it, because they say, "Is this not Jesus, the son of<br>Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, 'I came<br>down from heaven'?"<br><br>It is because they are not given by the Father that they refuse to<br>accept what Jesus is telling them -- he is the Messiah.<br><br>> *43 "Stop grumbling among yourselves," Jesus answered. 44 "No one can<br>> come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them, and I will raise<br>> them up at the last day. 45 It is written in the Prophets: Everyone<br>> who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me. 46 No one<br>> has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen<br>> the Father. 47 Very truly I tell you, the one who believes has eternal<br>> life. 48 I am the bread of life. 49 Your ancestors ate the manna in<br>> the wilderness, yet they died. 50 But HERE is the bread that comes<br>> down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die. 51 I am the living<br>> bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live<br>> forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the<br>> world."*<br><br>Jesus is referring to the work he will complete on the cross. So, Jesus<br>very clearly equates believing in who he is and what he will do, with<br>"feeding" on him.<br><br>Man's flesh is corrupted -- it's sinful. As such man stands in judgment<br>before God. God (the Son) takes on human flesh to deal with that<br>corruption. Christ is sinless (in his human flesh) but He takes on the<br>punishment for all our sins in His flesh on the cross. His body is<br>broken, and His blood is shed as the perfect sacrifice. But because He<br>is pure (humanly speaking) and eternal (divinely speaking) He burns up<br>both our sin and the consequence of our sin -- death. Christ partakes in<br>human nature and redeems it, so we, being enjoined to Him through belief<br>and the power of the Holy Spirit become partakers of His divine nature.<br>As such our sins are dealt with and His righteousness is imputed to us<br>because of that. This is what salvation is all about. And Jesus is<br>categorical about his work on the cross in doing this.<br><br>Given what the crowd asks for, Jesus uses that to point to Himself and<br>prophesy about His future work on the cross. The whole context is belief<br>in Him as the Son of God so that we may have life (which John echoes<br>twice at the end of his gospel without even referring to the Eucharist).<br>What Jesus doesn't do here is specify transubstantiation, because<br>transubstantiation is not in view here, neither is it biblical.<br><br>Again, since the crowd are not "given" to Christ by the Father, this<br>just adds to their confusion.<br><br>> *52 Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, "How can<br>> this man give us his flesh to eat?"*<br><br>Yes, when not understood to be a type and a picture it really doesn't<br>make sense. Jesus here has the perfect opportunity to explain how this<br>will work, but He doesn't. Because they aren't given, He simply<br>emphasizes what He has already claimed.<br><br>> *53 Jesus said to them, "Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the<br>> flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.<br>> 54 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I<br>> will raise them up at the last day. 55 For my flesh is real food and<br>> my blood is real drink. 56 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood<br>> remains in me, and I in them. 57 Just as the living Father sent me and<br>> I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live<br>> because of me. 58 This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your<br>> ancestors ate manna and died, but whoever feeds on this bread will<br>> live forever." 59 He said this while teaching in the synagogue in<br>> Capernaum.*<br><br>His disciples are even confused since they say, "This is a hard<br>teaching. Who can accept it?" It's interesting to see what Jesus says<br>here in response:<br><br>> *61 Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to<br>> them, "Does this offend you? 62 Then what if you see the Son of Man<br>> ascend to where he was before!"*<br><br>He doesn't rephrase the discourse about bread/flesh, wine/blood so the<br>disciples will gain a better understanding. In fact, He doesn't even<br>address that at all. What He does speak to is the claim that He is from<br>the Father. That claim is what offends them, since He then says<br>essentially, "would you believe that I am from the Father if you saw me<br>ascend back to the Father, where I was before, as I have been claiming?"<br>*THAT* is the key point in this passage. And Jesus is obviously<br>talking about His ascension after His COMPLETED work on the cross. He<br>continues:<br><br>> *63 The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I<br>> have spoken to you---they are full of the Spirit and life. 64 Yet<br>> there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus had known from<br>> the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him.<br>> 65 He went on to say, "This is why I told you that no one can come to<br>> me unless the Father has enabled them."*<br><br>If the flesh counts for nothing, then why does eating it give you life?<br>It must not be the flesh that Jesus is talking about eating then, is it.<br><br>And once He says this, how do the "given," "called" disciples respond?<br>Do they say, "Lord, we're still confused, please tell us what it means<br>to eat your flesh and drink your blood." Not at all:<br><br>> *68 \...\ "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal<br>> life. 69 We have come to believe and to know that you are the Holy One<br>> of God."*<br><br>We can talk about the exegesis surrounding the use of the words "eat"<br>and "drink" in reference to learning and understanding in the Bible<br>(examples are many, we can discuss if it is still a question) but<br>"eating" the words is a common understanding of truly, deeply learning<br>in the Bible.<br><br>You can see that Jesus was trying to use the "eating" and "drinking" to<br>teach about belief in Him, not as a directive to eat His flesh and drink<br>His blood.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
