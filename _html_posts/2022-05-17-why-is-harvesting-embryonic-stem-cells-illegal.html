<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's not. Stem cell research is legal in the United States, however,<br>there are restrictions on its funding and which stem cells you can use.<br>And the other problem: in order to harvest embryonic stem cells (ESCs),<br>the fetus must be destroyed. As you may be aware, destruction of a fetus<br>is currently a hot topic in the United States.<br><br>> State laws regarding research on stem cells vary widely, particularly<br>> in regard to use of embryonic stem cells. On one end of the spectrum,<br>> eight states (California, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland,<br>> Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York) encourage embryonic stem cell<br>> research, while on the other end of the spectrum, South Dakota<br>> strictly forbids research on embryos.<br>><br>> A number of states restrict research on aborted fetuses or embryos,<br>> but in some cases, research may be permitted with consent of the<br>> patient.\[1\](#QNAFv){#cite-QNAFv .citation_link}<br><br>The final problem: ESCs have yet to be proven to treat any condition<br>successfully, while adult stem cells (with induced pluripotency) have<br>been used for decades to successfully treat a wide variety of diseases<br>and conditions.<br><br>Therefore, the lack of usability of ESCs coupled with the controversy<br>surrounding destroying a fetus make harvesting ESCs difficult at best.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why is harvesting embryonic stem cells illegal?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-QNAFv){.citation_index} [[Is Stem Cell Research Illegal in<br>The United<br>States?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=998844&url=https://www.emedicinehealth.com/is_stem_cell_research_illegal_in_the_united_states/article_em.htm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="emedicinehealth.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
