As God, Jesus was<br>> able to control the behavior of the wind as well as the biting of fish<br>> (Luke 8:23-25; John 21:5-6). As a man, he could do nothing on his own<br>> (John 5:19). As God, his essence was and is unchangeable (Heb. 13:8;<br>> cf. Ps. 102:26-27; Mal. 3:6; James 1:17). As a man, he had to grow and<br>> be made perfect (Heb. 2:10).\[1\](#tEnkv){#cite-tEnkv<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>Some argue that the hypostatic union is a creation of man, or instituted<br>to resolve the differences between the camps that thought Jesus was<br>either fully human or fully divine, or something in between (like when<br>you mix red and orange you get yellow). While the actual hypostatic<br>union is documented well in the Bible, the most theologically and<br>historically sound definition, however, was created at the Council of<br>Chalcedon in 451 AD. It is also where the term "hypostatic union" was<br>coined.<br><br>> Therefore, following the holy fathers, we all with one accord teach<br>> men to acknowledge one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, at<br>> once complete in Godhead and complete in manhood, truly God and truly<br>> man, consisting also of a reasonable soul and body; of one substance<br>> with the Father as regards his Godhead, and at the same time of one<br>> substance with us as regards his manhood; like us in all respects,<br>> apart from sin; as regards his Godhead, begotten of the Father before<br>> the ages, but yet as regards his manhood begotten, for us men and for<br>> our salvation, of Mary the Virgin, the God-bearer; one and the same<br>> Christ, Son, Lord, Only-begotten, recognized in two natures, without<br>> confusion, without change, without division, without separation; the<br>> distinction of natures being in no way annulled by the union, but<br>> rather the characteristics of each nature being preserved and coming<br>> together to form one person and subsistence, not as parted or<br>> separated into two persons, but one and the same Son and Only-begotten<br>> God the Word, Lord Jesus Christ; even as the prophets from earliest<br>> times spoke of him, and our Lord Jesus Christ himself taught us, and<br>> the creed of the fathers has handed down to<br>> us.\[2\](#zrAZs){#cite-zrAZs .citation_link}<br><br>In short, Christ was both fully human and fully divine at the same time.<br>The human did not constrain the divine, and the divine did not alter the<br>human.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-tEnkv){.citation_index} [[http://Boyd and Eddy, Across<br>the\...](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=27a55e&url=http://Boyd+and+Eddy,+Across+the+Spectrum:+Understanding+Issues+in+Evangelical+Theology,+104.){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="http://Boyd and Eddy, Across the Spectrum: Understanding Issues in Evangelical Theology, 104."}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-zrAZs){.citation_index}<br>[http://www.theopedia.com/Chalced\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8ac4a4&url=http://www.theopedia.com/Chalcedonian_Creed){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="theopedia.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
