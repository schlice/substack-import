It will be a defective product lawsuit.<br>These lawsuits happen at the state level, and depending on the state, a<br>defective product lawsuit may allege negligence, strict liability or a<br>breach of warranty as to the defective product.<br><br>The only way you could claim treason is if we were at war and the<br>company was specifically acting as an agent of the enemy, intending to<br>inject the design flaw to aid the enemy and injure or kill US troops.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
