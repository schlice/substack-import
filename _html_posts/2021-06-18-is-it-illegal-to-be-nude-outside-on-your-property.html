<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Florida Statute ยง 800.03 states that a person commits the crime of<br>"unlawful exposure of sexual organs" by:<br><br>> \(a\) Exposing or exhibiting his or her sexual organs in public or on<br>> the private premises of another, or so near thereto as to be seen from<br>> such private premises, in a vulgar or indecent manner; or<br>><br>> \(b\) Being naked in public in a vulgar or indecent manner.<br><br>The statute goes on to clarify what is not "unlawful exposure of<br>sexual organs:"<br><br>> \(a\) A mother breastfeeding her baby; or<br>><br>> \(b\) An individual who is merely naked at any place provided or set<br>> apart for that purpose.<br><br>The statute says that to be convicted, you must be naked "in public" and<br>you must be naked "in a vulgar or indecent manner."<br><br>Paragraph (a) of the first section applies to someone naked on their own<br>property, so near to someone else's property that they can see you. In<br>order for your nakedness to be infringing, you must be naked in "a<br>vulgar or indecent manner."<br><br>That term has been defined in case law as well as in standardized jury<br>instructions in Florida, and the words "vulgar," "indecent,"<br>"lascivious" and "lewd" all mean the same thing: an unlawful indulgence<br>in lust or a wicked, lustful, unchaste, licentious, or sensual intent on<br>part of the person committing the act. \[1\](#VOiaI){#cite-VOiaI<br>.citation_link}<br><br>Therefore, if there was no "vulgar or indecent" intent on the part of<br>the naked person, Florida does not treat this as a crime.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice. This answer is for GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. If<br>you ignore this warning and convey confidential information in a private<br>message or comment, there is no duty to keep that information<br>confidential or to forego representation adverse to your interests. Seek<br>the advice of a licensed attorney in the appropriate jurisdiction before<br>taking any action that may affect your rights. If you believe you have a<br>claim against someone, consult an attorney immediately, otherwise there<br>is a risk that the time allotted to bring your claim may expire.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to legal questions are intended third<br>party beneficiaries under Quora\'s* [[*Terms of<br>Service.*](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-VOiaI){.citation_index}<br>[https://www.husseinandwebber.com\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4b4ebe&url=https://www.husseinandwebber.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Fla.-Std.-Jury-Instr.-Crim-11.9.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="husseinandwebber.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
