<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It is illegal in California to drive a motor vehicle without a valid<br>drivers license in your possession. This charge is a California<br>infraction under California Vehicle Code Section ยง12951(a), failure to<br>present a driver's license. A photograph of your license is not a valid<br>substitute for your license. It's enough for the officer to look your<br>license up (so that he knows that you actually have a valid license),<br>but the law does not allow for reproductions of your license; you must<br>have it in your physical possession or you can be charged with VC<br>12951(a). Also, if you have it and you fail to present it, that is a<br>misdemeanor under VC 12951(b) (but that's not what this question asked).<br><br>Drivers that are discovered to be driving without a valid drivers<br>license in their possession face a fine of up to \$250.<br><br>However, this is a "dismissible offense" which means that if you can<br>show the court that you had a license at the time of the offense, the<br>court is required to dismiss the charge. If you have been charged three<br>times or more of this infraction, the court is no longer required to<br>dismiss the offense (even though they may).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
