<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How will AT&T change HBO?<br><br>> Five years ago, Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said, \"The<br>> goal is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us.\"<br>> \[1\](#BXkLq){#cite-BXkLq .citation_link}<br><br>While HBO wants to become the next Netflix, can it?<br><br>AT&T is already increasing HBO's original content budget. HBO is trying<br>to develop more content, and offer more on-demand content (which they<br>push through their HBO GO and HBO Now platforms) to try to compete with<br>market leader Netflix.<br><br>HBO currently reaches 88 million households compared to the 68 million<br>Netflix subscribers, but in most cases, those subscribers are not paying<br>a premium like Netflix subscribers are. HBO is, in more cases than not,<br>bundled along with another subscription service (i.e. a cable or<br>satellite package), or has licensed its brand or content to affiliate<br>broadcasters. That makes HBO's 88 million subscribers less valuable than<br>Netflix' 68 million.<br><br>Netflix is planning on spending about \$8 billion on content this year,<br>and it spends far more on producing content in-house instead of<br>licensing. In comparison, HBO spent \$2.5 billion last year on content,<br>but about half of that went to licensing content. They only spent about<br>\$1.3 billion last year on original, in-house content.<br><br>They are seriously going to have to ramp up spending on original content<br>if they want to compete with Netflix. They're hoping that the AT&T<br>buyout will do that, but I am somewhat skeptical. With AT&T spending<br>\$85 billion on the Time-Warner acquisition (and spending \$49 billion<br>on DIRECTV in 2015), they don't have a lot of excess capital to play<br>with, and they picked up an extra \$22 billion in debt from T-W,<br>increasing their debt to \$185 billion. Netflix is carrying about \$20<br>billion in debt and is in a much stronger financial position.<br><br>I don't think that Netflix will be de-throned anytime soon, but I do<br>think that HBO will be seeing some fresh new original content in the<br>coming months.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-BXkLq){.citation_index} [[AT&T Just Bought HBO, and Now It<br>Wants to Spend More<br>Money](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e88e43&url=https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/06/19/att-just-bought-hbo-and-now-it-wants-to-spend-more.aspx){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="fool.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
