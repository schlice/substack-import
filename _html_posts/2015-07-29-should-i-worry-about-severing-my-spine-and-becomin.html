<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Fears are normal. Everyone has them. Don\'t worry about<br>your fear. You don\'t need to decrease your fear; *you need to increase<br>your courage.*\<br>\<br>Mark Twain said, \"Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear, not<br>absence of fear.\" Fear helps to heighten your senses, make you sharper.<br>It increases adrenaline, which also enhances your senses and muscle<br>responses. So fear by itself is not a bad thing.\<br>\<br>Being paralyzed by your fear is an issue. If you simply cannot get past<br>your fear, there may be an underlying issue at play. If you can\'t move<br>past your fear, you should seek the advice of a licensed psychiatrist or<br>psychologist.\<br>\<br>Physiologically, unless you have some sort of disease (such as brittle<br>bone disease), the spine is not that easy to break. The spine is<br>surrounded by vertebrae, which can help to block impacts and prevent the<br>severing of the spinal cord. The human body is very resilient in that<br>way. It has existed for thousands of years in this shape, and has proven<br>to be very reliable. Spines don\'t routinely break for no<br>reason.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
