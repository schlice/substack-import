<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yep, it was about 14 years ago. Seat belt tickets were a secondary<br>infraction; an officer couldn't pull you over just because you weren't<br>wearing your seatbelt. They had to pull you over for something else, and<br>then they could also ticket you for not wearing your seatbelt.<br><br>I was reaching into the back to retrieve a dropped sippy cup and I had<br>to unbuckle to do it. Coincidentally, I was 5 over (40 in a 35).<br><br>The officer politely dropped the speed charge but wrote me for the seat<br>belt. They were in the middle of an enforcement campaign.<br><br>That was the last ticket I have received.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
