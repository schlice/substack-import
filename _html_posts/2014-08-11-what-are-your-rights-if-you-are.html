<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Your rights if you are hit by an emergency vehicle are the<br/>same as if you were hit by any other vehicle. Its emergency designation<br/>allows it to violate *certain* traffic laws. It does not provide<br/>indemnification against damage which it causes to other vehicles.\<br/>\<br/>Your recourse would be to file suit against the ambulance company to be<br/>reimbursed for the damage to the vehicle. Hopefully you filed a police<br/>report; if you did not, your options will definitely be limited. With<br/>the police report, you can prove that the accident happened at the<br/>location you say it did. You can then correlate that to the information<br/>you get during your pretrial discovery, as you will request the<br/>ambulance company give you the listing of all of the calls that were<br/>responded to that day, and you can then find the ambulance and the<br/>driver.\<br/>\<br/>Once you know which ambulance hit you, you can look at the maintenance<br/>records of that ambulance to find whether or not they repaired the<br/>damage to the unit itself.\<br/>\<br/>You could also then requisition the training records of the ambulance<br/>driver. You can determine whether or not the driver received the proper<br/>emergency driving training, as required by California law. The driver<br/>will not likely be individually liable, but the training will weigh<br/>heavily on the court\'s decision.\<br/>\<br/>If you can find the ambulance, find the driver, and find the damage, you<br/>can make a claim.\<br/>\<br/>If you did not file a police report, you are probably out of luck. You<br/>can try to sue the ambulance company, but there really wouldn\'t be much<br/>for you to prove that the ambulance hit you when you say it did. And if<br/>they repaired the damage, there wouldn\'t be any physical evidence<br/>besides some circumstantial evidence that the ambulance was repaired<br/>subsequent to the time you state you had an accident. Probably won\'t be<br/>enough to prove that the ambulance caused the damage to the car.\<br/>\<br/>Emergency organizations carry auto insurance which would cover them in<br/>the event they cause damage during the course of the response to an<br/>emergency. The driver could be reprimanded and could be made to attend<br/>remedial driving training, but your repair bill would be paid by their<br/>insurance.\<br/>\<br/>I do not have specific knowledge of California law in this case. Someone<br/>with specific knowledge of California law when it relates to emergency<br/>vehicles may be able to add more information for you.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
