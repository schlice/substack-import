<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can't remove an HOA from your property. It existed prior to your<br>purchasing the land.<br><br>You can potentially dissolve the HOA itself, and since that process<br>involves attorneys and is quite complex, it is also expensive. You would<br>also have to have the agreement of a large majority of the existing<br>homeowners in the community, and there's a fair chance that at least<br>some of them like what the HOA is doing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
