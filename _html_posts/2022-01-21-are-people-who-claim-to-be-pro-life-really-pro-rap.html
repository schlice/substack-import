<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If the goal of rape was to forcefully produce a child against the<br>mother's will, then I could see how you could conflate pro-life with<br>pro-rape.<br><br>But rape isn't about making babies. Rape is about *power*.<br><br>It's about having complete power over your victim, including their<br>sexual choices. Sure, in some cases, it's some incel who went nutz, but<br>even in that case, it's still an exertion of control over another<br>person. It's never about the baby.<br><br>But here's the thing: **the baby is an innocent victim, too, just as<br>much as the woman is**. Why do we take out our anger on the innocent<br>baby?<br><br>Did you know that a little over half of rape victims *actually keep<br>their babies?* From the way this question is worded, it sounds virtually<br>automatic that if you're a rape victim, you kill your baby, and anyone<br>who is pro-life is therefore pro-rape. Not all rape victims kill their<br>babies.<br><br>As a pro-life person, let me tell you where abortion makes sense:<br>incest. When a power dynamic in a family was abused and there is a<br>father-daughter pregnancy, abortion makes scientific and physiological<br>sense, considering that there is a better than 50% chance that the baby<br>will be born with a debilitating birth defect. Now, that doesn't mean I<br>think families should go hog-wild with their kids and then you should<br>just feel free to abort the trash you create. There are still serious<br>psychological impacts from parents having sex with their children. But<br>when it happens (and that's actually sexual assault as well as incest),<br>that baby shouldn't be forced to suffer just so that I can maintain<br>moral consistency. That makes no logical sense. Sometimes, morals need<br>to bend to common sense and common decency. Sometimes. Not in all cases,<br>but sometimes.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Are people who claim to be pro-life really pro-rape?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
