<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As [Ralph(https://www.quora.com/profile/Ralph-1517)]{.qlink_container}<br>mentioned, anyone who is faced with an attack which could cause<br>grave bodily harm can use any force, up to and including deadly<br>force, to defend themselves from that attack. This includes law<br>enforcement officers and civilians alike. While the person will still<br>face legal scrutiny, the doctrine of self-defense indemnifies the victim<br>against charges.<br><br>So to answer your specific question, yes, a police officer can grab an<br>assailant by the throat, or any other part of the assailant's body, if<br>he is attacked, in order to defend himself.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
