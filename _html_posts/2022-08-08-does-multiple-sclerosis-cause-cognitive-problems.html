<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>"Cognitive changes" refers to changes to many different functions in the<br>brain, including your ability to learn and remember information,<br>organize, plan and problem-solve, focus, maintain and shift attention,<br>understand and use language, accurately perceive the environment, and<br>perform calculations.<br><br>**More than half of MS patients report some change in cognitive<br>function.**<br><br>Some areas of cognition are more likely than others to be affected by<br>MS:<br><br>> - Information processing (dealing with information gathered by the<br>>   five senses)<br>> - Memory (acquiring, retaining and retrieving new information)<br>> - Attention and concentration (particularly divided attention)<br>> - Executive functions (planning and prioritizing)<br>> - Visuospatial functions (visual perception and constructional<br>>   abilities)<br>> - Verbal fluency (word-finding)\[1\](#ezhAT){#cite-ezhAT<br>>   .citation_link}<br><br>Certain functions including general intellect, long-term memory,<br>conversational skill and reading comprehension are not likely to change<br>due to MS.<br><br>For most people, the changes in cognitive function are mild and may<br>involve one or two areas of cognitive functioning. Most cognitive issues<br>can be *compensated* for, using proven coping strategies which have been<br>available for many years. Therapy and assistive devices can absolutely<br>help in this regard. However, cognitive issues are the number one reason<br>that people with MS face early departure from the workforce.<br>Additionally, it is only very rarely in MS that cognitive dysfunction<br>would cause you to be unable to function independently.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ezhAT){.citation_index} [[Cognitive<br>Changes](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=869adf&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms/Cognitive-Changes){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
