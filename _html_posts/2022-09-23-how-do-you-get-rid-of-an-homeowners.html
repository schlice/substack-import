<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you truly want to dissolve your HOA in Florida, you will need to<br>consult with a real estate attorney in your area who specializes in HOA<br>law.<br><br>Dissolving an HOA is possible, but it is not free, and it is not easy.<br><br>For example, the HOA usually owns some property, even if it is just<br>small areas of grass where the monolith (the sign at the entrance)<br>lives. That property will need to be sold or gifted to someone.<br>Utilities for water and electricity in the common areas will need to be<br>terminated. Insurance policies for the common areas and for the<br>Directors will need to be cancelled (and any associated fees paid).<br><br>And that's just the stuff pertaining to the HOA itself. In order to<br>dissolve a mandatory HOA, you will need signatures from 100% of the<br>homeowners in the affected area. If there is just one holdout who likes<br>what the HOA does for him, you can't dissolve it. The homeowners then<br>need to get new deeds filed (which don't have an attached HOA) with<br>their lienholders, assuming they mortgaged their home purchase. Ergo,<br>more lawyers (read: not cheap)<br><br>And even if you do dissolve the HOA, there is usually still a larger<br>property owner's association (POA) which your HOA belonged to, and<br>you'll still belong to that, and you can't dissolve that one. Normally<br>you'd pay those dues once a year (or your HOA would pay that for you),<br>but it still exists.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How do you get rid of an Homeowners\' Association (HOA) in Florida?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
