<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's do a quick and dirty history of the Bible. There are many details<br>which are left out of this brief history, but it is sufficient to<br>understand why some books were left out of the Protestant Bible.<br><br>Starting from thousands of years before Christ was born, the Jewish Holy<br>Scriptures were written in Hebrew. But by about the third century B.C.,<br>the language of the common man was Greek. Hebrew was limited to those<br>who worked routinely with the original Holy Scriptures. It was mostly<br>scholars and Rabbis who read Hebrew. So the people wanted a common<br>translation of the Holy Scriptures into their common language. This<br>Greek translation of the Holy Scriptures is known as the *Septuagint*.<br><br>When the Roman Catholic Church canonized its Bible, it accepted the<br>Septuagint, since that is what the Jews of the day accepted as *their*<br>Holy Scripture. The Septuagint, however, had a few additions made to it<br>during the time of its creation, a few books which were never written in<br>the original Hebrew. Nevertheless, the Catholic Church, in creating<br>their Bible, accepted the Septuagint as it was. They created a Latin<br>translation of the Greek Septuagint, adding the New Testament volumes,<br>and created what they called the *Vulgate*.<br><br>This pretty much stood this way for the first several hundred years of<br>the Catholic Church, until the Protestant Reformation. The reformers<br>rejected everything that was centered on Rome, including their Bible.<br>The Vulgate was therefore summarily rejected by the Protestant<br>reformers, but now they needed a translation of the Jewish Holy<br>Scriptures that they could use.<br><br>Fortunately, the Jews had gone through sort of a "rediscovery" period of<br>their own during this time. Jewish scholars produced a new version of<br>the original Hebrew texts (not translated, also in Hebrew) called the<br>*Masoretic Texts*. Not surprisingly, this re-write did not include any<br>of the books that were *only* written in Koine Greek, because *they*<br>believe that those books were not part of the original Holy Scriptures<br>and were thus summarily rejected.<br><br>The Protestant reformers, like the Catholic Church before them, simply<br>accepted the Masoretic Texts as they stood, and incorporated them into<br>their own Bible translations, without the additional books which could<br>be found in the Septuagint. The Protestant Bible does not include those<br>additional seven books because they do not appear in the Masoretic<br>Texts.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
