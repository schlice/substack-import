<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Burst eardrums usually heal on their own. While it is<br/>healing, keep it dry. Usually a swimmer\'s earplug or a cotton ball<br/>coated with Vaseline (on the outside) will help keep the eardrum<br/>protected. Your doctor can prescribe eardrops to prevent infection, but<br/>don\'t put any drops in your ear if they are not prescribed by your<br/>doctor.\<br/>\<br/>If there are problems healing, it can cause hearing loss as well as<br/>other issues. These should be treated by your doctor. As long as it is<br/>treated promptly and heals correctly, long-term effects should be<br/>minimal.]<br/><br/>*Disclaimer:*<br/><br/>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br/>substitute for professional medical advice.
