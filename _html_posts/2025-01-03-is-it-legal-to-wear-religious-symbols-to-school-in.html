<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is no "separation of church and state" in the Constitution.<br><br>And ironically, the idea about the separation was to *protect religion<br>from government interference*, not to keep religion out of government.<br>Roger Williams, the founder of Rhode Island, was the first to use the<br>phrase, opining that there should be "a wall or hedge of separation"<br>between the "wilderness of the world" and "the garden of the church."<br>Williams believed that any government involvement in the church would<br>corrupt the church.<br><br>Of course, the most famous use of the phrase was by Thomas Jefferson in<br>his 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptist Association. He said that when<br>Americans adopted the establishment clause in the First Amendment, they<br>built a "wall of separation between the church and state." Again, the<br>idea was to keep *government* out of the *church,* not the other way<br>round.<br><br>So yes, wearing religious symbols in school is absolutely legal, and<br>is protected by the First Amendment's freedom of expression, as well as<br>the freedom to practice any religion you choose, or no religion at all.<br><br>That said, state Boards of Education or individual schools are<br>indeed allowed to adopt dress codes which may include disallowing any<br>religious symbology at all, and this doesn't violate the First Amendment<br>*so long as they do it uniformly.* In other words, they can't ban<br>crosses but allow the Star of David. They would have to uniformly ban<br>all religious symbology on student clothing as part of a dress code in<br>order for it to be legal. The ban must be specific to creating an<br>appropriate learning environment and keeping it free from distractions,<br>and must be limited in scope so as to only address the singular area of<br>symbology on clothing.<br><br>Schools often run into trouble in this area not in regards to clothing,<br>but when they permit *some* displays of religion in schools and then<br>deny others. Schools cannot make permanent displays of religious<br>symbols, but they can, in limited circumstances, have holiday displays<br>which include religious symbols. In general, courts have held that<br>holiday displays in public schools may include religious symbols if the<br>displays are *temporary*, require *no active participation* in any<br>religious activity, include *diverse religious, cultural, and ethnic<br>symbols*, and *support valid educational goals*.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
