<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The presence or absence of a camera doesn\'t change the<br>situation being faced by the officer, his/her response to that<br>situation, and more importantly, a camera doesn\'t make anyone any<br>safer.\<br>\<br>The camera\'s only purpose is to document what actually happened to use<br>in legal proceedings later on.\<br>\<br>So in actuality, the camera *shouldn\'t* change behavior. Good<br>officers (which most are) will continue to be good, and bad officers<br>will be weeded out that much faster. Departments will not be able to<br>conceal bad officers for long.\<br>\<br>Which is the way most officers want it.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
