<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There are differences between a tow because of an<br>illegally parked vehicle, and a tow under police direction. ***If the<br>police direct the car to be towed***, there is zero you can do about it,<br>hooked, unhooked, nothing. You can\'t request the car be dropped, you<br>can\'t stop the tow driver from doing his job, you have to take it up<br>with the police. The tow driver is legally obligated to tow the car when<br>directed by police, he can\'t be stopped other than by police.\<br>\<br>*If the car is being towed because it is illegally parked*,<br>generally (varies by state), once the tow hook is on the vehicle, it<br>can\'t be touched; it\'s in the custody of the tow company. You can\'t<br>get into it at that point (and in most states, doing so is a crime). If<br>you\'re willing to leave before the car is hooked, the tow driver should<br>let you leave. If the car is hooked, the tow driver can let you have it<br>for a \"drop fee.\" In some cases in some states, drop fees are<br>dependent on time of day. In others, it\'s a flat fee. In Colorado, the<br>drop fee can be no more than \$70, and drivers must accept credit<br>cards.\<br>\<br>*If you try to drive off while the car is on the tow truck,* not<br>only is that not bright (it risks damages to your car and the tow<br>truck), but it\'s illegal. You have to break the tow cable, and you<br>would then be liable for leaving the scene of an accident. We had a case<br>in 2011 in Colorado Springs where a woman got into her car that was<br>attempting to be towed and drove off. The tow hook was on her car, and<br>the tow cable became ensnared around the ankle of the tow truck driver.<br>The cable snapped, and she dragged him for 1.4 miles before he slipped<br>out of his boot. He was dead at the scene. She claimed she didn\'t see<br>him. She was convicted on several counts, including manslaughter,<br>vehicular homicide, leaving the scene of an accident, and some other<br>lesser charges.\<br>\<br>[[Colorado Springs jury convicts woman in dragging death of tow-truck<br>driver](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ad33ba&url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_20041489){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="denverpost.com"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>\<br>This case prompted the city to toughen the laws on tows. Tow drivers now<br>place a big sticker (8.5 x 11) on the driver window explaining that the<br>vehicle may not be touched because it is legally in the possession of<br>the tow company, and getting in to the vehicle is a crime. Penalties for<br>violating the new laws are now much tougher. The new law was named after<br>the tow truck driver, Allen Lew Rose, and is now known as \"the Rose<br>Law.\"]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
