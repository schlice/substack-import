title: '"Why is there no innovation in one particular aspect of aviation industry?
  When a flight goes through aerodynamic stall and is never able to recover when flying
  over a sea, why is there no design to make it float on the sea or something?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Let\'s look at an example of a flight where this<br>happened.\<br>\<br>Air France flight 447, 1 Jun 2009. The aircraft crashed primarily<br>because of a few factors. The stall was the aerodynamic factor that<br>caused the crash, but it wasn\'t an aerodynamic failure that caused the<br>stall. In other words, the stall happened because the pilots left the<br>aircraft in a stall orientation the whole way down, due to a number of<br>factors:\<br>]<br><br>- The pilot/co-pilots did not have accurate attitudinal information on<br>  the aircraft, as there was a pitot tube failure. They did not have<br>  accurate airspeed information, and they also did not have AOA (angle<br>  of attack) information either. Because of the faulty information, the<br>  aircraft was actually in a climb until it reached a maximum altitude<br>  of 38,000 feet, its AOA was 16 degrees, and its engines were in the<br>  TOGA position (Take Off/Go Around), which is fully forward. The<br>  aircrew was in a sleep rotation, the pilot was in the sleep cabin, and<br>  the two co-pilots were manning the aircraft.<br>- Because the aircraft was not getting valid speed indications, the<br>  autopilot switched from \"normal law\" to \"alternate law 2\". This<br>  means that stall warnings were disabled.\<br>- By the time the captain had returned, the aircraft was in a 40 degree<br>  AOA, engines at TOGA, and descending.<br>- The pilot pushed the nose forward during some points in the 3 minute<br>  descent, but when the airspeed indications were normal again, the<br>  stall horn went off. When he pulled the stick back, the stall horn<br>  stopped because the airspeed indication was abnormal. The stall horn<br>  sounded several times during the descent, but the pitch of the<br>  aircraft stayed between 35 and 40 degrees nose-up, and the engines<br>  stayed at 100% thrust. They were spooled down to 50% twice during the<br>  descent, and they continued to respond normally.<br>- The aircraft impacted the water at 280 kph, killing everyone on board<br>  and disintegrating the aircraft. It never left the stall the entire<br>  time it descended.\<br>- The right-stick control was providing rearward input on the stick,<br>  while the left-stick control was providing other inputs. This lack of<br>  positive switch-over between sticks was a factor. The fact that two<br>  sticks were providing flight input was evidence of a failure to<br>  positively transition flight control between the pilots.\<br><br>This wasn\'t an airframe failure, and while the stall was the proximal<br>cause of the aerodynamic failure, it was the lack of correct attitudinal<br>information that caused the pilots to keep the aircraft in that flight<br>attitude.\<br>\<br>There should be calls to include AOA in the displays available to<br>pilots, and the pitot tube system on that aircraft was replaced several<br>times to improve its anti-icing capability.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
