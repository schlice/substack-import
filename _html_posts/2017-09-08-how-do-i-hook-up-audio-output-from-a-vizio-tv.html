<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are a few ways.<br><br>1.  Depending on your model of Vizio TV, you may have a direct audio<br>    output. It may be a digital audio out (which you can run into an<br>    amplifier), or even a headphone jack (which you can run into the Aux<br>    input on your stereo --- just be very careful of the output volume<br>    on the TV. Adjust them both carefully). But either way, most Vizio<br>    TVs, even if they don't directly have an Audio Out port of some kind<br>    at least usually have a headphone out jack.<br>2.  If there is no audio out at all, you can grab the audio *on the way<br>    to* the TV. Since it's most likely that your audio is being sent to<br>    your TV over HDMI, use something like this: [[Amazon.com: Musou HDMI<br>    Audio Extractor,HDMI to HDMI + Optical Toslink(SPDIF) + RCA(L/R)<br>    Stereo Analog Outputs Video Audio<br>    Splitter](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a66b4f&url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XDNJ6RM){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}<br>    ]{.qlink_container}This device will extract the audio from the HDMI<br>    signal and send it to either S-PDIF (which is optical audio out) or<br>    to L/R RCA jacks, to be sent to an amplifier.<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
