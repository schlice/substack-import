<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What would you do if your child told you he/she was going to buy a gun<br>or other weapon?**<br><br>First of all, *children* can't buy weapons. So if a "child" told me<br>he/she was going to buy a weapon, I'd do everything in my power to<br>prevent it, or if it happened, to bring the "salesperson" to justice for<br>illegal firearms sales.<br><br>My *children* (biologically) bought their own firearms. My son bought a<br>beautiful Savage .30--06 hunting rifle when he turned 18. My oldest son<br>bought a different, but no less beautiful, Springfield XD .45 pistol<br>when he turned 21. Of course, they weren't children when they bought<br>them; they were adults.<br><br>So what did I do? Cleared space in the gun safe for the Savage, and<br>essentially "gave" my oldest son exclusive access to the small pistol<br>safe.<br><br>I also paid for a few visits to the local gun range so we could shoot<br>them all (along with my own metal babies). Fun times at the range.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
