<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Money.\<br>\<br>The price of gas is not low. I\'m old enough to remember paying<br>\$.98/gal for unleaded gas. Yes, I said unleaded, because they were<br>still selling leaded gas at the time. I know I just dated myself and<br>someone else is going to tell me that they remember \$.89/gal or<br>\$.50/gal or something like that. Bottom line is that gas prices are<br>influenced primarily by the cost of buying crude from OPEC.<br>Neighborhoods were built with the understanding that everyone had cheap<br>gas and could drive everywhere they went. Now that people want to<br>commute by bike more on smaller trips, they can\'t because a \"small\"<br>trip isn\'t very small anymore, or safe. Neighborhoods need to be<br>redesigned to allow for this, but that hasn\'t happened yet.\<br>\<br>Houses are built with wood frames because it\'s cheap but still sturdy<br>enough to meet all code requirements. We\'d love to thermally isolate<br>all houses, but it\'s just too expensive to do at<br>scale.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
