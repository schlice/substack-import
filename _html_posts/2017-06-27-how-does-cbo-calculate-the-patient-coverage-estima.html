<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The CBO tries to include as many people into their estimates as they<br>can.<br><br>Their estimate of the Senate version of the bill says that 22 million<br>people will lose insurance if it passes. But the CBO (conveniently)<br>doesn't mention *why* these people won't have insurance. Would it<br>surprise you to find out that they won't have insurance because *they<br>don't want it?* One of the groups they took into account are the people<br>who will *willingly* cancel their plans *because they don't have to own<br>plans anymore.*<br><br>The House and Senate bills don't have any provisions requiring you to<br>purchase insurance, so many people will simply not buy insurance because<br>they don't want it. As a matter of fact, when Obamacare was in full<br>force, estimates are that around 16 million people bought health<br>insurance or got waivers just to avoid the tax penalty. A portion of<br>those simply refused to answer on their tax forms (roughly 4 million)<br>whether or not they had insurance.<br><br>So right away, you will have at least 16 million who won't buy insurance<br>because they are no longer compelled to do so. That's where most of the<br>22 million number comes from, not because plans will disappear, or<br>because people won't be able to afford insurance anymore.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
