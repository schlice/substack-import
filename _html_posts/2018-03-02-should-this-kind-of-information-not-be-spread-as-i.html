From your article:<br><br>> Revealing the tactic to ABC7 News, CHP Golden Gate Division Commander<br>> Ernest Sanchez warned whoever was carrying out the attacks that they<br>> would be caught.<br>><br>> "The message is clear," he said. "If you\'re \a\ shooter out there,<br>> it\'s just a matter of time. We will catch you and prosecute you to<br>> the full extent of the law.\"<br><br>As you can see, the police *want* this information out there. They would<br>much rather have the attacks stop than have to arrest people, but both<br>will accomplish the same goal: keeping riders on the Google Bus safe.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
