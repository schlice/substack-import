<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a president begins to demonstrate that he is incapable of acting in<br>national interests and shows signs of irrational behavior, are there<br>practices as means of controlling or removing him short of impeachment<br>and the 25th amendment?**<br><br>No. The answer is *you don't re-elect him.*<br><br>Impeachment is for *high crimes and misdemeanors.\*<br>The 25th Amendment is used when a President is *unable to carry out the<br>duties of President.*<br><br>**NONE of these remedies are used when a President does something you<br>don't like.**<br><br>You don't impeach or forcibly remove a President when he doesn't act in<br>a way that you think is the "national interest." There are over 300<br>million people in this country; the President is probably acting in<br>*someone*'s interest. And all people act in a way that you don't believe<br>is *rational* sometimes. Who are you to say?<br><br>If you think that the President is not acting in the national interest<br>or is irrational, you simply don't re-elect him. That is the appropriate<br>Constitutional remedy for a President you don't like. We've had peaceful<br>handoff of Presidential authority in this country for almost 250 years.<br>If you vote him out of office, he will peacefully give up that authority<br>and leave.<br><br>\<br><br>Relaxed. Researched. Respectful. - [[**War<br>Elephant**](https://warelephant.quora.com/)]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
