<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>TL;DR: I wouldn't go so far as to say you have a "right" to know exactly<br>what the police are doing exactly when you believe you should know. The<br>information is releasable; the timeframe in which a department releases<br>the information is up to them.<br><br>You can find out what calls the police were responding to at any given<br>time. Most departments make public the "police blotter" which is a<br>record of all of the calls which officers were dispatched to handle. One<br>of our local departments' PIO (Public Information Office) posts blotter<br>entries to their public Twitter feed (ah, technology...), usually within<br>an hour or so of their entry. "Newsworthy" entries (i.e. shooting<br>downtown) or entries which should be disseminated in the interest of<br>public safety (i.e. crash on Main Street, please try to avoid the area)<br>are released very quickly. Another local agency has an interactive<br>online blotter which allows you to input a timeframe and it will show<br>all blotter entries during that period.<br><br>Not all departments do this, nor are they under any legal obligation to<br>do so.<br><br>For departments which do not publicly post their blotter entries, you<br>can always call the dispatcher and ask. You might get an answer. Then<br>again, you might get a generic "we can't disclose information about<br>active incidents" response. In such a case, after the conclusion of the<br>incident, you can file a FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) request since<br>the police department is a government agency. You can request<br>information about calls which were answered in your neighborhood during<br>the timeframe in question. So long as there is not an open active<br>investigation, the department will provide you with that information.<br><br>The upshot of all of this is that the information is available. The<br>timeframe in which you can receive this information is different for<br>each organization.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
