<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Detaining anyone against their will is illegal (unless<br>they are a minor and you are their custodial adult). You can be charged<br>with anything from unlawful detention to (if you relocated them)<br>kidnapping.\<br>\<br>The only way you could detain a person is to effect a ***citizen\'s<br>arrest***. The laws vary widely from state to state on citizen\'s<br>arrest. The amount of force you can use, when you can use that force,<br>and what is required of you in order to effect the arrest are all<br>matters of law, and each state\'s laws are different. If you do<br>something which violates the state law on citizen\'s arrest, you could<br>be held legally liable for that.\<br>\<br>[[How do you perform a citizen\'s arrest? And what are the circumstances<br>in which you can do<br>this?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-perform-a-citizens-arrest-And-what-are-the-circumstances-in-which-you-can-do-this)]{.qlink_container}]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
