<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there an Ethics violation for the President to have the next G7<br>summit at one of his hotels?**<br><br>This is a great question, and it's related to all the questions which<br>talk about the President and the Emoluments clause.<br><br>So let's just clear this up real quick: *The framers never expected<br>there to ever be career politicians.*<br><br>They expected someone to leave their farm, or their business, come to<br>Washington, serve their time, and then return to their farms and their<br>businesses.<br><br>To that end, the Constitution does not forbid a businessman from<br>becoming a politician. It doesn't even forbid that businessman from<br>continuing to make money.<br><br>But if the President is *personally enriching himself* by using his<br>authority to set a conference at a hotel *he owns* and then charging<br>premium prices to all the attendees, while not illegal and not an<br>Emoluments Clause violation, it could be seen as an *abuse of power* or<br>an abuse of the office of the President. Setting policy with the aim of<br>*personally enriching yourself* would definitely be an abuse of office<br>and would result, not in a violation of law, but in *impeachment.*<br><br>Even if the President took due care to charge the attendees the same<br>rates as other hotel guests, or even if he gave the attendees a<br>*discount* on room rates, the simple fact that he had the opportunity to<br>set the conference anywhere, and he chose to use one of his namesake<br>properties, simply looks too suspicious.<br><br>Abusing the office of the President for personal gain is an impeachable<br>offense, not a Constitutional violation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
