<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>God cannot abide sin. This is why sinners go to hell. Plain and simple.<br><br>When Adam and Eve sinned, God removed them from the perfect place He<br>created for them, and sent them out into the world that *their sin<br>created for themselves*: a world where they need to scratch at the hard<br>ground to get it to produce any crops, a world where they experience<br>painful childbirth, and a world where they experience failing bodies,<br>disease, and eventual death.<br><br>So in essence, God didn't banish them. Their own choices caused them to<br>have to leave.<br><br>But all hope was not lost.<br><br>God sent a lifeboat to save us from this sinking ship we created for<br>ourselves. His name is Jesus. His death and resurrection saved us from<br>death, and his shed blood redeems us.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why did God banish Adam and Eve from Eden after they ate from the Tree<br>of Knowledge?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
