<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>HOAs are relatively unconcerned about house flippers. Flippers buy<br>houses as cheaply as they can, come in and fix up the house, and resell<br>it at a profit. This is a big win for the HOA, because it helps the<br>median home prices in the neighborhood, and fixes up any possibly<br>less-than-optimal properties. Flippers are good business for HOAs.<br><br>We are more concerned about selling houses to rental companies, or even<br>worse, companies who buy houses to use as AirBnB rental houses.<br><br>Short term rental customers are, in general, unconcerned about the<br>neighborhoods in which their rental houses exist. Having many different<br>tenants in a single-family housing community increases traffic in the<br>neighborhood, and increases the likelihood of problems and disturbances<br>which could occur at the property. This tends to decrease median home<br>values in the neighborhood, because no one wants to live next to a<br>vacation rental property.<br><br>HOAs solve this problem simply by requiring any lease of your house to<br>be a minimum of a 6-month lease. Our Governing Documents specifically<br>exclude short-term or vacation rentals in our neighborhood, and require<br>all leases to be a minimum of 6 months.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why do most HOAs not allow sales to house flippers?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
