<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Oh, without a doubt, yes.<br><br>Jesus would have easily been maligned because he urged people to not<br>live the way they're living. He would have been labeled as a woman-hater<br>and desiring to turn women into "baby factories" because He would have<br>unequivocally said to not kill babies in the womb.<br><br>This would have offended many people, especially the entire LGBTQ+<br>crowd, the pro-choice crowd, the progressives, you know, the standard<br>faire for the Democratic Party of 2024. They would have said the same<br>thing to Jesus as they say to us: we're homophobic, we're bigoted, we<br>hate women, we want to keep women barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen,<br>etc.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
