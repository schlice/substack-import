Only sellers are regulated, the<br>product itself is not regulated.<br><br>Since only the marijuana retailers are regulated, not the actual product<br>itself, law enforcement's only concern with users is their compliance<br>with consumption laws (i.e. you have to be old enough to use it, you can<br>only use it in your house, you still can't drive under the influence,<br>etc). Once you have it, they don't care where it came from.<br><br>Think about it. You can grow it yourself. How are they ever going to<br>know where you got it from?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
