<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can shooting people in public with a Nerf gun be considered a crime?<br><br>The answer is, of course, it depends.<br><br>This crime is called assault in most locations. Doesn't matter if you're<br>hit with a baseball bat, a fist, an open hand across the face, or a Nerf<br>dart, if it was intentional and not part of a Nerf gun fight, it's an<br>assault.<br><br>Also doesn't matter if you shoot someone in public or in private, but it<br>sounds like when you say "people in public" you mean "random strangers<br>on the street." In this case, it is most definitely assault, it is a<br>crime, you can go to jail for it, and if you injure them further (i.e.<br>you shoot them in the eye and you injure them), the subsequent assault<br>and battery lawsuit will see you paying for their eye care. It doesn't<br>make a lick of difference if you shoot them with a Nerf gun, a feather<br>gun, or a real gun. Assault is assault regardless of what it is touching<br>you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
