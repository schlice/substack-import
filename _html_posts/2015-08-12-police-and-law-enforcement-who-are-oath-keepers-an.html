<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [To answer your second question, in Missouri, anyone who<br>has a concealed carry permit can then open carry any weapon anywhere in<br>the state. Missouri says, \"Yeah, if you want to open carry, you have to<br>concealed carry first.\"\<br>\<br>I get the concept. Concealed carry permits require training and money<br>(meaning that they are inherently unfair and discriminatory; those that<br>have the money and the time to get them will have them), so only those<br>people are trained enough to carry a rifle.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
