<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: yes.<br><br>Longer answer: The Bible tells us that they knew right and wrong before<br>the incident with the apple. They also had *free will*. They had the<br>full ability to make a choice.<br><br>They knew that God had commanded them to not eat the fruit from that<br>tree. They knew that they would be committing a sin by doing so. *But<br>they chose to violate God's command, freely and willingly.*<br><br>Because they thought that what Satan offered was more appealing than<br>what God offered.<br><br>And that's the beauty of free will. If you're not willing to accept<br>God's commands, you're free to reject them. Similarly for us today, if<br>you're not willing to accept Christianity, you're free to reject it. The<br>freedom to make choices --- even the freedom to reject truth --- is what<br>makes us moral creatures and allows us to ultimately choose our own<br>destiny.<br><br>Adam and Eve chose to violate God's law and sin against Him, introducing<br>sin into the world for all of us. But we have the opportunity to choose<br>God, thanks to the sacrifice of Jesus.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it really Eve\'s fault that Satan manipulated her into sinning? She<br>had never been exposed to lying before. Similar to two adults telling a<br>child different stories, you can\'t blame the child for not knowing what<br>to believe?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
