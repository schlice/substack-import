This means it's up to department policy as to<br>whether and when an officer must show ID.<br><br>Most departments do require their officers show some form of ID, but<br>they also have wide latitude to deny the request if it will jeopardize<br>safety or hamper police work (i.e. they are not required to stop what<br>they're doing in order to show you their ID on demand).<br><br>Whether or not the requester is armed makes zero difference in whether<br>or not an officer must identify himself.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
