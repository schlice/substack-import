<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In my last trip to India, I used both a step-down transformer as well as<br>a plug adapter.<br><br>Indian power runs at 220V (as does most of Europe), and India uses<br>EU-style outlet prongs. Charging your phone may be as simple as just<br>using a plug adapter if you don't need to step the voltage down to 110.<br><br>It is up to you to check your charging "brick" to see if it accepts<br>220V.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-4787b4d18bd185f6af4bd9fedb1f37e0){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-4787b4d18bd185f6af4bd9fedb1f37e0"<br>master_w="3024" master_h="4032"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>You'll notice my US Samsung charging adapter accepts "100--240V,<br>50--60Hz", That means I can plug this directly into the wall in India,<br>and the voltage will be accepted. I'll just need a plug adapter to<br>convert my US prongs to fit India's outlet prongs.<br><br>This is my favorite plug adapter:<br><br>[[Amazon.com: Kensington International Grounded 3 Prong Travel Adapter,<br>Black](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d4217f&url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071FYG49B){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Remember though, this is not a transformer. This will simply convert the<br>prongs between devices. It will still deliver 220V to your device, so<br>your device must be able to accept 220V to use this alone. My laptop's<br>power supply also accepted 220, so I was able to plug it directly into<br>the wall as well with the plug adapter. I use a travel power strip when<br>I travel, like this one:<br><br>[[Amazon.com: FosPower 3-Outlet Mini Power<br>Strip](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5abf80&url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XDJHXVB){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>I'll plug this into the plug adapter, and then the devices which accept<br>220 can get plugged into the strip.<br><br>Very few of the devices I bring with me internationally can't accept<br>220, but if your device only accepts 110V, you will have to plug<br>into a step-down transformer in order to convert the voltage to<br>110V. This is the one I use:<br><br>[[Amazon.com: Simran SMF-200 Deluxe 200 Watts Step Down Voltage<br>Converter](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2724e5&url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W9DJ1Q){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>This device will step the voltage down from 220 to 110 if you have<br>devices which do not accept more than 110V. My electric razor and my<br>electric toothbrush did not accept 220, but the hotel I was staying in<br>conveniently had a US 110 plug near the bathroom sink for electric<br>devices like toothbrushes and razors.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
