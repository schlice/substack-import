<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I fear that you, questioner, are under the mistaken impression that<br>vaccine refusal is somehow due to a lack of information. Like somehow<br>the people who aren't getting the vaccine aren't doing so because they<br>are somehow uninformed.<br><br>In most cases, this is usually not the case.<br><br>Proponents of the vaccine seem unwilling to accept the thinking of<br>vaccine skeptics, or even accept the fact that they are thinking at all.<br>But vaccine skepticism [[was studied by<br>MIT](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7c4325&url=https://news.mit.edu/2021/when-more-covid-data-doesnt-equal-more-understanding-0304){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="mit.edu"}]{.qlink_container}, and they found that it is<br>"highly informed, scientifically literate, and sophisticated in the use<br>of data. Skeptics used the same data sets as those with the orthodox<br>views on public health.<br><br>"The researchers combed through hundreds of thousands of social media<br>posts and found that coronavirus skeptics often deploy<br>counter-visualizations alongside the same "follow-the-data" rhetoric as<br>public health experts, yet the skeptics argue for radically different<br>policies. The researchers conclude that data visualizations aren't<br>sufficient to convey the urgency of the Covid-19 pandemic, because even<br>the clearest graphs can be interpreted through a variety of belief<br>systems."<br><br>And they found that vaccine hesitancy is not based on partisanship, or<br>lack of information, or Trump, or DeSantis or Florida or any other<br>excuse the legacy media is telling you.<br><br>"\M\ost vaccine skepticism, if by that we mean reluctance, is not<br>based on conspiracy theorizing --- it's based on risk-benefit<br>calculations. You may think it's an innumerate calculation. But when you<br>look at patterns of uptake in the United States, two factors stand out,<br>factors that are larger in their effect than partisanship: age and<br>density. The older you are and the denser your community, the more<br>likely you are to be vaccinated. The younger you are, and the more rural<br>your community, the less likely you are to have gotten it. This reflects<br>the real facts about the risk of death from COVID. People may be wildly<br>overestimating their risk from the vaccine and underestimating their<br>risks from COVID --- but they have the directional thinking correct.<br>Those who are in less danger, act like it."<br><br>In other words, they may have gotten the risk of catching the virus<br>wrong, and they may have gotten the risk of taking the vaccine wrong,<br>but they have the general idea right. Most people who are not getting<br>the vaccine are younger, or live in areas where they are at less risk of<br>contracting the virus in the first place. In other words, "those who are<br>in less danger, act like it."<br><br>Bottom line: if people have a right to not be vaccinated, then we must<br>allow them to have their own consequences. We don't have a right to tell<br>them that they can't go to the hospital if they get sick; we never say<br>that about anyone ever. Not only is that unethical, it's immoral. Don't<br>think like that. Maybe they won't be able to use their insurance, and<br>maybe they'll have to pay for their own hospitalization. But saying they<br>can't go to the hospital is wrong.<br><br>So just to have a complete answer, let me answer your actual question:<br><br>**The police can do this, but it's not their job, and vaccine skepticism<br>is not due to a lack of information.**<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why can\'t the police knock on every unvaccinated person\'s door and<br>provide each of them with a pamphlet that focuses on getting vaccinated?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
