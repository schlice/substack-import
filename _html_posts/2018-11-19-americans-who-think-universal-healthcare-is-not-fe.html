<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Americans who think universal healthcare is not feasible...Why?<br><br>1.  Healthcare is not a right, nor is it a privilege. Healthcare is a<br>    business transaction. People train to become practitioners of<br>    healthcare so that they can run businesses to make money. Yes, they<br>    are also noble and want to help people, but primarily they are<br>    service providers, providing a service. You simply cannot turn a<br>    service into a right by changing who pays and how. All you're doing<br>    is taking from the people who can pay and paying for the healthcare<br>    of the people who don't. Plus, you're adding additional patients to<br>    the existing healthcare recipients, and demanding the same amount of<br>    money? No, you'll have to demand more money to cover the new people,<br>    which means that overall, it will cost more. Since all you've done<br>    (initially) is to change who pays and how, the cost will necessarily<br>    go up. You can't force doctors to provide their services for free,<br>    since that's slavery (which is pretty much illegal everywhere in the<br>    United States). Therefore, healthcare will never be a right until<br>    you change how you pay doctors for their services and how those<br>    doctors pay for medical school.\<br>    \<br>    [[Why can\'t healthcare be free in<br>    America?](https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-healthcare-be-free-in-America)]{.qlink_container}<br>2.  The government is not the agency to do it. Our federal government<br>    already runs three single-payer healthcare systems: Medicare, the<br>    Veterans Health Administration, and the Indian Health Service. Each<br>    one of these programs is an unmitigated disaster, rife with fraud,<br>    waste, and abuse. Veterans *literally die* waiting for healthcare.<br>    Why would we think that entrusting *more* responsibility to the<br>    government, which has already shown that it can't handle the<br>    responsibilities it has, make anything better?<br>3.  The history of "health insurance" in the United States started off<br>    innocuously enough, but scope creep turned it into an agency which<br>    does all of the payments for all health-related procedures, unlike<br>    insurance at all. It's really nothing more than an overpriced<br>    prepayment plan where no one cares about how much anything costs,<br>    and the people making up the prices know this, and don't mind<br>    tacking on a few hundred dollars here and there since no one cares.<br>    Healthcare consumers not only don't care how much healthcare<br>    procedures cost, but they don't know, since doctors and hospitals<br>    are not required to show you the actual cost of procedures. Changing<br>    who pays and how won't correct this little hiccup in the system. If<br>    you're interested in learning the history of our health insurance<br>    system in the United States, and how we got where we are, [[this<br>    speech](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e120f9&url=https://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/short-history-american-medical-insurance/){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="hillsdale.edu"}]{.qlink_container} by John Steele<br>    Gordon, the author of *An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of<br>    American Economic Power*, among other great reads, illustrates how<br>    we got here and why.<br><br>I think we're just not yet in a place where we can spend 2/3 of our GDP<br>on Medicare for all when we can barely pay for the obligations we<br>currently have. By 2021, the *interest on our national debt* will cost<br>us more than what we spend on the entire military. By 2023, that<br>interest will cost us more than *all Federal spending combined*.<br><br>I think we have bigger problems right now than who pays for whose<br>healthcare.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
