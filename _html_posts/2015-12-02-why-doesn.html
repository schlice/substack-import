<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why are most people against banning guns in US?<br><br>Original question details:<br><br>> How can a person feel safe when he knows that most of the people in a<br>> public place are carrying guns? moreover anyone can flip out any<br>> minute!. You never know what goes in a persons mind? or what if some<br>> accident happens?<br>><br>> Please dont say money or constitution. I am looking for \"moral\"<br>> answer.\<br>> why do people feel safe with guns all around them.<br>><br>> Moreover its not about banning guns its about not using them!<br><br>Let\'s dissect your question.<br><br>***How can a person feel safe when he knows that most of the people in a<br>public place are carrying guns?***\<br>First of all, \"most\" is a pretty broad characterization. For you,<br>I\'ll take \"most\" to mean \"more than half,\" and that is incorrect.<br>The number of people concealing a firearm is much smaller than you<br>imagine. Probably less than 10% of the people you pass on the street are<br>carrying a firearm.<br><br>Additionally, are they carrying guns *legally* or *illegally*? Anyone<br>carrying a gun legally has a permit. To get that permit, presumably the<br>local law enforcement agency which issued the permit has ensured that<br>the individual has gone through (at a minimum) a background check, and<br>basic firearms training. So those are not people to be feared. And if<br>someone is carrying a gun *illegally*, there\'s no ban that will prevent<br>them from carrying a gun. If you ban all guns, they will just buy guns<br>illegally, and when caught, will hopefully face stiff penalties for<br>doing so.<br><br>***\M\oreover anyone can flip out any minute! You never know what goes<br>in a persons mind***\<br>I suppose that\'s true. And I also suppose that someone can \"flip out\"<br>while he/she is carrying a gun. However, let\'s stick with reality. You<br>don\'t see too many people walking down the street suddenly lose their<br>grip on reality. I\'ve actually not ever heard of someone being<br>perfectly sane at one moment, and then suddenly and inexplicably finding<br>themselves in wacko-land. There is generally some indication beforehand<br>that someone is going to lose their grip on reality.<br><br>*\W\hat if some accident happens?*\<br>From \"accident\" I presume you\'re referring to the \"accident\" where<br>someone legally carrying a concealed weapon walking down the street is<br>inexplicably beset by a weapons discharge whereby the weapon in the<br>holster on their belt starts firing madly and killing people all around<br>it.<br><br>This \"accident\" *never* happens.<br><br>Weapons do not \"mysteriously\" discharge in this way. In fact, most<br>semi-auto handguns in circulation have several internal safeties which<br>prevent the weapon from discharging unless the trigger is being pulled.<br>One of my instructors claimed you could hammer a nail with the back of<br>our Beretta 92F handguns and they would not discharge, as there were no<br>fewer than four internal safeties within the weapon that prevent the<br>firing pin from engaging the primer on the bullet unless the trigger is<br>being pulled. If no one is pulling the trigger, the gun will not fire<br>(for the gun enthusiasts, I am not referring to some fully-automatic<br>weapons with free-floating firing pins such as the M-16 which in<br>approximately 1 in 100,000 cases, when chambering a round will fire<br>without the trigger being pulled, but that\'s a different story<br>altogether).<br><br>It appears from the tenor of your question that you don\'t know much<br>about handguns. You should probably learn more. It might help you to<br>feel safer if you understand how they work.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
