<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We've said this about a bzillion times on this platform (yes, that's a<br>real number, Toy Story said so):<br><br>We don't have an *information* problem. We have a<br>*trust* problem.<br><br>The public health apparatus in the United States has decimated itself.<br>it politicized the vaccine. It politicized the virus. It has undermined<br>public trust in it. Rather than doing, oh I don't know, **the right<br>thing and just giving people all** the facts, they instead gave us<br>curated, little-bits-of-fact surrounded by hype and propaganda in order<br>to push an *a priori* objective. Now, they're fully committed to the<br>mandated vaccine, forced vaccination strategy, and that's what the whole<br>dust-up over the Delta variant is all about.<br><br>Forced vaccinations in the context of this vaccine and this pandemic are<br>going to be very, very bad for public health. It's a great way to<br>reinforce the belief that the government may just be lying to you and<br>you should ignore what you know is right and just toe the party line.<br>*If your aim is to drive the United States towards socialism, this is a<br>perfect way to do it.*<br><br>If the public health apparatus would just present us with the actual<br>numbers about for whom the vaccine is beneficial, and for whom it might<br>not make much sense, and then **treat people like adults and let them<br>make their own decisions**, that would be the right way to do public<br>health.<br><br>But instead, they've bought in to the whole forced vaccination plan<br>(wherein even Biden suggested we go door-to-door to "convince" people to<br>get vaccinated), but as I said, we don't have an information problem, we<br>have a trust problem.<br><br>People don't trust that the vaccine is needed for everyone. They don't<br>trust that natural immunity isn't just as good as vaccine-derived<br>immunity. And that's because the public health apparatus has failed in<br>its mission.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>With more outbreaks of Delta continuing, will it be just a hard time for<br>the United States in order to get more people vaccinated?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
