<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(EDIT) As with all things legal, these are state-based provisions. Laws<br>vary from state to state. Check with a lawyer in your area if you need<br>to know the specific laws where you live.*<br><br>In general, checking for feet under a stall should not be illegal. It is<br>not considered an invasion of privacy to see if a stall is occupied by<br>looking through a pre-designed hole at the floor. Most bathroom stalls<br>are designed with walls that do not extend completely to the floor. The<br>user of that stall implicitly agrees to this technical restriction when<br>entering the stall. Looking at feet under the stall door does not<br>constitute an invasion of privacy, because there is no reasonable<br>expectation of privacy where your feet are concerned. Simply bending<br>down to check for feet to see if the stall is occupied should be just<br>fine.<br><br>It becomes an invasion of privacy when the outside looker checks<br>*more* than the feet. For example, if your feet are down, and they<br>are clearly visible to someone looking from floor-level, there is no<br>need for anyone to check occupancy any further. Someone looking in over<br>the top or sides, or intentionally peeking through cracks, is invading<br>privacy where there is an expectation of privacy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
