<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Sure. Law enforcement does this by increasing the amount<br>of paperwork it takes to arrest someone.\<br>\<br>Therefore, there is a threshold at which officers won\'t arrest someone<br>because they\'re not worth the paperwork.\<br>\<br>In all seriousness, if someone broke the law, how exactly is their<br>arrest \"unnecessary?\" And how exactly can you arrest someone if they<br>don\'t break the law? I suppose the officer could fabricate a charge,<br>but you can\'t really prevent that, just like you can\'t prevent<br>citizens from breaking the law. You can only bring them to justice once<br>they do.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
