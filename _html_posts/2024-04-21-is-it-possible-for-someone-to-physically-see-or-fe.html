<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is yes.<br><br>In religion, we call it a<br>[theophany(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4d11b9&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophany){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. A theophany is a<br>physical manifestation of God, and it doesn't have to occur just in<br>prayer.<br><br>Theophanies are documented in the Bible. Some of them are God appearing<br>as:<br><br>- A burning bush<br>- A pillar of smoke<br>- A cloud<br><br>One of the intrinsic characteristics of a theophany is its<br>*temporariness*. It is not a permanent manifestation, but only a<br>temporary one.<br><br>There is a really great story of Jacob in Genesis wrestling with a man<br>who was actually a theophany:<br><br>> *Then Jacob was left alone; and a Man wrestled with him until the<br>> breaking of day. Now when He saw that He did not prevail against him,<br>> He touched the socket of his hip; and the socket of Jacob's hip was<br>> out of joint as He wrestled with him. \...\ And He said, "Your name<br>> shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have struggled<br>> with God and with men, and have prevailed."*<br>><br>> *Then Jacob asked, saying, "Tell me Your name, I pray."*<br>><br>> *And He said, "Why is it that you ask about My name?" And He blessed<br>> him there. So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: "For I have<br>> seen God face to face, and my life is preserved." --- Genesis<br>> 32:24--25, 28--30*<br><br>So is it possible for someone to physically see or feel God when<br>praying? In Christianity at least, the answer is yes, it is possible.<br><br>\<br><br>But what about today? If we're asking about modern-day theophanies, I<br>think we're asking the wrong question, because the fulfilled promise of<br>Jesus changes the game. Our friends at<br>[Christianity.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=dd40fe&url=http://Christianity.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="christianity.com"}]{.qlink_container} summarized it way<br>better than I could:<br><br>> *As Christians, the question we must ask ourselves is not "How can I<br>> experience a theophany?" but rather "How can I* *be* *a<br>> theophany?" After all, if a theophany is a manifestation of God's<br>> presence in the world, then this is precisely the call that Christians<br>> have. Our lives are to herald the presence of Jesus. Jesus calls us to<br>> this very way of life when he says "let your light shine before others<br>> that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven"<br>> (*[[*Matthew<br>> 5:16*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=96cf39&url=http://www.christianity.com/bible/search/?ver%3Dniv%26q%3Dmatthew%2B5:16){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="christianity.com"}]{.qlink_container}*). We are made in<br>> the image of God and empowered by the Holy Spirit for this purpose.<br>> Thus, Christians today are the very places through which Christ is<br>> revealed to the world.*\[1\](#AJeHU){#cite-AJeHU .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-AJeHU){.citation_index} [[What Is a Theophany in the<br>Bible?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2cb017&url=https://www.christianity.com/wiki/christian-terms/what-is-a-theophany-in-the-bible.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="christianity.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
