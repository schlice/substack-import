<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because that's His preferred pronoun.<br><br>Yes, God has no physical form (so He is not a male nor a female), but He<br>chooses to interact with us as a "father."<br><br>When Jesus was walking the earth, He chose to interact with God as a<br>"father." He called God "Abba" which means "father."<br><br>He orders not only His relationship to us that way, but He expects us to<br>order our relationship to our family structures similarly. As God the<br>Father exercises headship over His family (us), so too are we to do the<br>same, which is why there is a patriarchy which exists in the home (when<br>it comes to religious leadership) and in the church (when it comes to<br>preaching the word of God). God's design for kingdom in general is<br>unfolded via the establishment of His own kingdom in Scripture. He is a<br>father-king, and thus the people He requires to represent His rule are<br>men. This is true of the greatest King on his throne over his father's<br>house, to the least working-class man in his beat-up recliner over his<br>own house (see Ephesians 3:14--15).<br><br>TL;DR: *Father* was His choice, not ours. That's how He chooses to<br>present Himself to us, because that's how He expects us to order our own<br>families.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
