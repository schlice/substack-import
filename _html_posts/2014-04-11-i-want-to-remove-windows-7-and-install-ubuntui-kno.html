<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/>(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=282e05&amp;url=http://learn.How){.external_link<br/>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br/>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br/>qt-tooltip="learn.how"}]{.qlink_container} to do?]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [To piggyback on Terence\'s answer, Ubuntu is delivered on<br/>a LiveCD. Just boot your computer from the CD and try Ubuntu for as long<br/>as you like. When you\'re ready, you can install it over top of<br/>Windows, or next to Windows, so that you can boot your computer into<br/>*either* operating system. It\'s called a \"dual-boot\" computer<br/>solution. However, Windows is pretty greedy about booting its own<br/>operating system, so make sure Windows is installed first, then install<br/>Ubuntu next to it. Follow the directions in Terence\'s post for setting<br/>up the dual-boot.\<br/>\<br/>Dual-booting is very safe, and even if you totally hork your bootloader,<br/>it can be fairly easily recovered to get your Windows image back up and<br/>running.\<br/>\<br/>Ultimate in flexibility: get VMware and run Ubuntu, Windows, Fedora,<br/>Mint, etc. on individual virtual machines. I\'ve stopped running<br/>installers now that I have all my VMs up and running.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
