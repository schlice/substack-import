<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because he knows that he can't jail Trump. He's about to be sworn in as<br>the 47th President of the United States, having been elected President<br>by a majority of Americans who knew full well that his court had<br>convicted Trump of 34 felonies.<br><br>But while Merchan said that sending Trump to jail is "impractical" now<br>that he is about to re-enter the office of the President, he doesn't<br>think that vacating the conviction is practical, either.<br><br>So instead, he appears likely to simply sentence Trump (on January 10th,<br>when sentencing is set) to an "unconditional discharge." This means no<br>custody, no fine, and no probation. He's technically "sentenced," but<br>there is no sentence to be carried out.<br><br>So in this way, everyone "wins." New York still gets to call Trump a<br>convicted felon, Trump gets to finally pursue his options for appeal<br>(which he couldn't do without being sentenced), and Merchan gets to say<br>he convicted Trump on 34 felony counts, regardless of what the Court of<br>Appeals does. The Democrats get their label, the one they have been<br>fighting for the past eight years to get: Trump will be, following his<br>sentencing, a "convicted felon." It will be *official*. He will have<br>been tried, found guilty, and sentenced. The Democrats can smugly wag<br>their collective fingers at everyone who voted for Trump and now they<br>can look down on *literally half of the voting population of America*<br>and say that they knowingly elected a convicted felon. **In short,<br>Democrats gain a moral victory**, if only in their own minds.<br><br>But does Merchan really *win* here? Imagine being convicted on 34 felony<br>counts, and no punishment. It's like getting a speeding ticket for doing<br>186 in a 20 mile per hour school zone and being let off with a warning.<br>34 felonies should get you life without parole, not an unconditional<br>discharge.<br><br>Imposing this sentence means Merchan knows he can't win at all, even if<br>he tried. So he's caving. He's caving to the pressure that Trump's legal<br>team was bringing to either shit or get off the pot. Either vacate the<br>conviction, or sentence so that he can begin his appeals.<br><br>But is it possible to appeal an unconditional discharge? Technically yes<br>it is, but what are you appealing? There is no punishment, so there's<br>not quite as much to appeal. Trump's legal team will still likely appeal<br>the procedural errors Merchan made in things like jury instructions, but<br>the unconditional discharge means that there is *less* for Trump to<br>appeal.<br><br>This sentence will be the cop-out of the century on top of the biggest<br>sham trial of the century, but it's the only play Merchan has left.<br>After his absolute kangaroo court, this is the only move he can make.<br>It's the least bad choice from a slate of really bad choices.<br><br>And the incoming administration won't let this type of lawfare go on for<br>any longer. The people who prosecuted these cases will be investigated,<br>and some may be charged criminally as well. Looking at you, Jack Smith<br>and Fani Willis and Alvin Bragg.<br><br>The great rule given to prosecutors is "thou shalt not recognize faces."<br>You don't prosecute someone for *who they are*. You prosecute someone<br>for *what they've done*. These people violated that cardinal rule of<br>prosecutions because they took the last eight years trying to find<br>anything to get Trump. And ultimately, they completely failed, so<br>they had to make up charges and find a willing patsy of a judge to push<br>the conviction through. This sad obsession with "getting Trump" will be<br>their downfall.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
