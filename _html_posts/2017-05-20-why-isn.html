<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Why isn\'t the guillotine method used anymore for capital<br>> punishment?*<br><br>Mostly because people can\'t stomach it anymore.<br><br>It is quick and virtually painless, as the spinal cord is cut first. So<br>it technically meets the criteria established by the courts as not<br>violating the 8th Amendment\'s restriction against cruel and unusual<br>punishment.<br><br>But as society has changed, and people have supposedly become more<br>civilized, the guillotine was deemed too "barbaric" for continued use.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
