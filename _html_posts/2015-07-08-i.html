<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In the UK, \"revenge porn\" is illegal under the Criminal<br>Justice and Courts Act 2015, and this would not only be considered<br>revenge porn, but blackmail. You may consider consulting with a<br>solicitor to determine what rights you may have. Since he is in Belarus,<br>you may not be able to do anything about it, but you can try.\<br>\<br>Additionally, Facebook has very strict rules regarding this sort of<br>thing. I would suggest immediately contacting Facebook should he post<br>something. The photos will be deleted and his account will be removed<br>from Facebook. Facebook can then take the photo evidence and provide it<br>to a solicitor seeking it, in order to prove your legal charges.\<br>\<br>What he\'s doing is a crime. If he tries to press ahead, he should be<br>held to account.\<br>\<br>Let\'s talk briefly though about what he\'s doing and how he\'s going<br>about it. He continues to do this because he knows that **he\'s pushing<br>your buttons.** He\'s getting to you, and you\'re letting it affect you.<br>I know it does; it\'s traumatic. *But he doesn\'t have to know that it<br>does.*\<br>\<br>The next time he says something like \"If I put this on Facebook, I<br>wonder how many likes it will get\", say \"I don\'t care; none of my<br>friends will like it, and you will lose your Facebook account and<br>possibly end up in jail, so I wouldn\'t post that if I were you. Just<br>some friendly advice.\" He may perceive that as a challenge and go ahead<br>with it anyway, in which case he will lose his Facebook account and you<br>will have the evidence you need to press charges. This will be a hard<br>thing to do, but you must not give him the feeling of control over you.<br>He only continues with this because he knows it affects you. You can\'t<br>let him win.\<br>\<br>If he ends up posting the pictures somewhere outside of Facebook (like<br>on a revenge porn website), you may be out of luck. This is why **you<br>have to move past the pictures**. First of all, they\'re just pictures.<br>You may endure some embarrassment. If you haven\'t already told your<br>fiancé, this is the time to do so. He will understand (in fact, I bet he<br>would be able to truly appreciate the same photos!). Talk it out with<br>him, have a good laugh about it, and get past it. If you let it get to<br>you, the ex wins. You can\'t let him win. This is the only control he<br>has over you; the only way you can really stop it is to move past the<br>pictures; don\'t let them affect you.\<br>\<br>If you are considering signing a prenuptial agreement with your fiancé,<br>consider adding a \"social media\" clause to it, with language that says<br>something like you agree not to share posts or photos that are likely to<br>harm the other\'s reputation.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
