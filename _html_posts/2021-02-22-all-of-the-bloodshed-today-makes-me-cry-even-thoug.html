<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**All of the bloodshed today makes me cry, even though the use and<br>permitting of guns allow violence to be at an all-time low in history.<br>When will guns be permanently banned in America?**<br><br>God-willing, guns will never be permanently banned in America.<br><br>There are many reasons for this. Here are just a few:<br><br>1.  People will always be violent with each other, because that is human<br>    nature. The presence or absence of guns does not change this.<br>2.  Criminals, by their very nature, do not follow laws. It is already<br>    illegal to commit crime. The criminal who is breaking the law to<br>    commit a crime is really unconcerned that he breaks a second law by<br>    using a gun to do so. Banning guns does nothing to stop the<br>    criminal, it only affects the citizens who follow the law, leaving<br>    them less able to defend themselves.<br>3.  Criminals will always find a way to get guns. I know that some<br>    people say that if we ban guns from law-abiding citizens' hands,<br>    then criminals won't be able to steal them. That's literally like<br>    telling the Kindergarten class that no one can play with toys<br>    because one bully likes to steal them. We don't prevent the criminal<br>    from committing a criminal act by turning law-abiding citizens into<br>    criminals.<br>4.  Not all gun use is bad. Defensive gun uses far outnumber offensive<br>    ones. Anywhere from 350,000 to 2.5 million times per year,<br>    law-abiding citizens will use firearms to defend themselves, often<br>    without a single shot being fired. The difference in the numbers?<br>    You don't report a crime that never took place to the police.<br>    Therefore, we have little more than survey data to indicate exactly<br>    how much crime is prevented by guns. Using representative sampling,<br>    we can *estimate*, but we know that at a certain level (at least<br>    350,000), these defensive uses did occur. It is likely much more.<br>5.  This nation was founded on freedom and rugged individualism.<br>    These ideals still live on in Americans today. Our laws were<br>    structured around this freedom; namely the fact that **your security<br>    is your responsibility**. In fact, many Supreme Court cases have<br>    found that the police have no responsibility to defend you from<br>    crime. Their responsibility is to find those who break the law and<br>    bring them to justice, hold them accountable for their crimes. While<br>    they do what they can to prevent crime, they cannot be there to<br>    prevent all crime.<br><br>There are more reasons than this, but these are just the basics. We<br>could go into resistance to tyranny and the unalienable right to<br>self-defense, but this is enough for now.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
