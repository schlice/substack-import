<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You literally cannot re-make the United States into something else<br>without the Constitution. The Constitution is what makes the US. The US<br>is nothing without the Constitution. Therefore, you are advocating for<br>the destruction of the US.<br><br>You have only one of two options:<br><br>1.  Emigrate to a country that more closely matches your ideas of<br>    democracy<br>2.  Overthrow the US government, throw out the founding documents, and<br>    install your own.<br><br>There are no third options. There is nothing simpler. You cannot<br>"restructure society." It simply does not exist.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>The constitution of the United States has proven time and again to be an<br>obstacle to democracy and much needed change. It's obvious that is has<br>outlived its usefulness. How should Americans restructure its society to<br>fit this new norm?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
