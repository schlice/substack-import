<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What\'s more important is that regardless of jurisdiction (some<br>jurisdictions like Nevada, as [[Tim<br>Dees](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tim-Dees)]{.qlink_container}<br>mentioned, exempt private property from DUI enforcement while others,<br>like Illinois, as [[Christopher<br>Hawk](https://www.quora.com/profile/Christopher-Hawk)]{.qlink_container}<br>mentioned, do not), the *hot pursuit rule* applies. If an officer<br>observes your behavior on a public street, he can then chase you<br>anywhere to catch you: inside a home, inside a building, onto private<br>property (even without the owner\'s permission), across state lines,<br>etc. Some rules do apply depending on jurisdiction, such as when the<br>officer actually began the pursuit. And there are inter-agency<br>considerations when traversing agency borders, but in most cases, an<br>officer can pursue you almost anywhere to stop you.<br><br>Note that this law also notably applies to military police; if they<br>begin a pursuit on a military facility, they can continue that pursuit<br>off the base/post. Note that they will normally hand off primary control<br>of the pursuit to a local law enforcement agency once they engage, but<br>fleeing off the base is no guarantee of freedom from pursuit<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
