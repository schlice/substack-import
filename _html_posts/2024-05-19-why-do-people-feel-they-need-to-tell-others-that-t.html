<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you found out about a gift that was being offered to anyone, free of<br>charge, which improved the quality of your life dramatically, would you<br>not want to tell others about it? Wouldn't you want as many people as<br>possible to know about this free gift?<br><br>I know, nothing in life is free, but this gift is. Truly free. You don't<br>owe anyone anything for accepting this gift.<br><br>Would you *not* tell everyone you met about it? Isn't that just a wee<br>bit *selfish?*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
