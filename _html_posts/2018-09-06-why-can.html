<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why can't you donate blood if you have multiple sclerosis?<br><br>In the past, you could not donate blood if you had MS. Up until<br>recently, American Red Cross guidelines excluded people with MS from<br>donating blood.<br><br>However, as of May, 2007, those guidelines were updated, since no<br>scientific evidence exists to show that MS is contagious or can be<br>transmitted by blood. So long as other qualifications are met, and there<br>are no local or FDA restrictions, an otherwise healthy person with MS is<br>permitted to donate blood.<br><br>For more details about other eligibility requirements, see the [[Red<br>Cross<br>website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2bc608&url=https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/how-to-donate/eligibility-requirements.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="redcrossblood.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
