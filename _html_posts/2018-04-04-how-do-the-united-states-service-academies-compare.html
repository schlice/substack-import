<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do the United States service academies compare to Ivy League<br>schools academically?**<br><br>Interestingly, US News and World Reports does an annual assessment and<br>ranking of public undergraduate liberal arts colleges. The *Military<br>Times* newspaper discussed this year's rankings with an emphasis on our<br>military service academies:<br><br>> The Naval Academy maintained service-school bragging rights in the<br>> annual U.S. News [[Best<br>> Colleges](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a932a9&url=http://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/us-news-ranks-best-colleges?int%3Da14709%26int%3Da14709){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="usnews.com"}]{.qlink_container} rankings released Tuesday,<br>> taking top honors among public national liberal arts colleges.<br>><br>> The U.S. Military Academy finished second and the Air Force Academy<br>> completed the podium sweep for the 2017 edition. The schools ranked<br>> tied for 12th, tied for 19th and tied for 32nd, respectively, among<br>> all national liberal arts colleges \-- a category that rules out<br>> larger, research-oriented schools like most public universities and<br>> Ivy League stalwarts.<br>><br>> The 1-2-3 order of finish was the [[same as last<br>> year](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f666a1&url=https://www.armytimes.com/story/military/2015/09/09/navy-beats-army-us-news-college-rankings/71951714/){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="armytimes.com"}]{.qlink_container}, when Navy ranked ninth<br>> overall, Army took 22nd and Air Force was<br>> 29th.\[1\](#ykpru){#cite-ykpru .citation_link}<br><br>So compared to the Ivy Leagues, military academies simply don't compare,<br>because they don't offer higher degrees than Bachelor's degrees.<br><br>But considering the magnitude of the additional training received at a<br>military academy, and the fact that besides the military academies, no<br>school ranked ahead of USAFA in the list has an annual tuition under<br>\$47,900 (service academy cadets are paid for by US tax dollars), I<br>think the ranking is not only respectable, but actually quite good for<br>what we pay.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ykpru){.citation_index} [[Naval Academy edges West Point,<br>USAFA in annual U.S. News<br>rankings](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=27b9a1&url=https://www.militarytimes.com/education-transition/education/2016/09/13/naval-academy-edges-west-point-usafa-in-annual-u-s-news-rankings/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="militarytimes.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
