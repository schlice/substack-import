<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not at all.<br><br>What it *will* do is to signal to the Democrats that they can stop<br>playing this silly game of pretending that Republicans are actually<br>*relevant.* Democrats consider Republicans to be the "Washington<br>Generals." Remember them? They're the team that plays the Harlem<br>Globetrotters, always destined to lose, just there to be the<br>straight-man to the Globetrotters' antics, but they still get to "play"<br>and they still get a paycheck. If Hillary wins, it will be confirmation<br>that they are the only party that matters, and it's time to quit<br>pretending we have a two-party system.<br><br>America's Anchorman, Rush Limbaugh, was discussing this very thing on<br>his program on September 7th. He was reading from an article over on the<br>Claremont Institute website titled "[[The Flight 93<br>Election](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6e2441&url=http://www.claremont.org/crb/basicpage/the-flight-93-election/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="claremont.org"}]{.qlink_container}." It's an absolutely<br>brilliant piece, but very long. It is critical of conservative "Never<br>Trump"ers. Nevertheless, this is an excerpt from Rush's show where he is<br>reading a section of the article discussing what a Hillary election will<br>signal to the Democrat Party. The quote within the quote is from the<br>article Rush is reading (which I linked above):<br><br>> \"A Hillary presidency will be pedal-to-the-metal on the entire<br>> Progressive-left agenda, plus items few of us have yet imagined in our<br>> darkest moments. Nor is even that the worst. It will be coupled with a<br>> level of vindictive persecution against resistance and dissent<br>> hitherto seen in the supposedly liberal West.\"<br>><br>> What he\'s saying is, with this, is that, look, it\'s not bad enough<br>> that they\'re advancing their leftist progressive agenda unstoppably.<br>> What they\'re gonna do if she wins, they\'re gonna get into vindictive<br>> persecution, and they\'re gonna take out, they\'re gonna do everything<br>> they can to destroy any and all opposition. And he cites evidence like<br>> Obama and the IRS and a couple of other examples.<br>><br>> He\'s basically saying, you think that you\'re gonna continue to have<br>> your platform if Hillary Clinton gets elected, you think you\'re gonna<br>> continue to have your platform to continue to criticize Hillary,<br>> don\'t count on it. They\'re gonna come for you. They\'re gonna come<br>> for all of us. They don\'t want any opposition. They\'re tired of<br>> playing the game that they have a legitimate opponent. They don\'t<br>> think they do, the left, this guy\'s opinion.<br>><br>> They think they\'re on the cusp of getting rid of all opposition and<br>> the election of Hillary Clinton will tell them that they have gotten<br>> rid of all opposition, and they\'re gonna make it official by getting<br>> rid of any dissent. That\'s what this guy\'s theory is. And it\'s time<br>> people woke up and realized what\'s at stake, is what he\'s trying to<br>> do with \-- my interpretation, but I think I\'m fairly close.<br>><br>> \"We see this already in the censorship practiced by the Davoisie's<br>> social media enablers.\" We see it the way Google manipulates<br>> searches. We see it the way Facebook manipulates their trending news<br>> items. \"We see it in the shameless propaganda tidal wave of the<br>> mainstream media; and in the personal destruction campaigns \--<br>> operated through the former and aided by the latter \-- of the Social<br>> Justice Warriors. We see it in Obama's flagrant use of the IRS to<br>> torment political opponents, the gaslighting denial by the media, and<br>> the collective shrug by everyone else.\[1\](#eIufE){#cite-eIufE<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>More about the article:<br><br>> And his point is, conservatism\'s about to be erased. Opposition to<br>> the Democrats and to Hillary and Obama\'s about to be erased if they<br>> keep winning. There isn\'t gonna be any opposition, principled or<br>> otherwise! That\'s his belief. Ten pages of it. \"So what do we have<br>> to lose by fighting back? Only our Washington Generals jerseys \-- and<br>> paychecks.\" That\'s a dynamite sentence. He\'s basically calling<br>> these people out: What do you have to lose by fighting back?<br>><br>> He\'s chastising people who are afraid to oppose Hillary or Obama or<br>> the Democrats for fear they\'re gonna \be\ kicked out of the<br>> establishment, for fear they\'re not gonna get their paychecks, for<br>> fear they\'re not gonna be able to maintain their donations and their<br>> fundraising. But then he says. \"But those are going away anyway.\"<br>> Don\'t you understand? All of that\'s going away anyway! There isn\'t<br>> gonna be a Washington Generals; there isn\'t gonna need to be a<br>> Washington Generals. There isn\'t gonna need to be a foil anymore,<br>> \'cause there isn\'t gonna be any serious opposition to worry about.<br>><br>> \"Among the many things the \'Right\' still doesn\'t understand is<br>> that the Left \the Democrats\ has concluded that this particular<br>> show need no longer go on.\" His point here is that the Democrats and<br>> the media and so forth, they\'re just going through the motions of<br>> acting like there\'s a serious opposition and they\'re tolerating it<br>> for the sake of how it looks. But they have concluded that it doesn\'t<br>> need to go on like this anymore, that we really don\'t need to<br>> legitimize the Republican Party as an opposition. We don\'t need to<br>> legitimize conservatism, anymore. So we can just erase \'em.<br><br>If this article is even partly true, then this election is far more<br>important than Trump or Hillary.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-eIufE){.citation_index} [[The Shaming of the Never<br>Trumpers - The Rush Limbaugh<br>Show](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3414ee&url=http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2016/09/07/the_shaming_of_the_never_trumpers){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="rushlimbaugh.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
