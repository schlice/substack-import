<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You *can*, but it's just not as easy to game on a Linux system as it is<br>to game on a Windows system.<br><br>Steam works, and any game that is Linux compatible in Steam will work on<br>a Linux system.\*<br><br>\* with effort. They don't always work right out of the box. They often<br>take a little bit of effort, and sometimes quite a lot of effort, to<br>work.<br><br>Take a look at Linus Sebastian trying to master gaming on Linux.<br>Admittedly, he's a bit of a Linux n00b, and he makes some really<br>predictably bad Linux mistakes, but even he is able to get a system<br>together and make it playable.<br><br>It's a three-part series. Enjoy it.<br><br>[https://youtu.be/0506yDSgU7M(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5ff1f6&url=https://youtu.be/0506yDSgU7M){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>[https://youtu.be/3E8IGy6I9Wo(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8a23e6&url=https://youtu.be/3E8IGy6I9Wo){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>[https://youtu.be/Rlg4K16ujFw(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c848f4&url=https://youtu.be/Rlg4K16ujFw){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Should I install Linux my gaming laptop?
