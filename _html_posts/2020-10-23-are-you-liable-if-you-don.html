<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Are you liable if you don't lock your car?<br><br>Depends on what you mean by liability.<br><br>Insurance may not reimburse you for your stolen items because you didn't<br>take proper care to lock your car. In that respect, you would be liable<br>for the cost of those items.<br><br>But you would not be liable for the theft; that's totally on the thief.<br>The presence or absence of a locked door does not alleviate the thief of<br>responsibility for his crime. That's all on him.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
