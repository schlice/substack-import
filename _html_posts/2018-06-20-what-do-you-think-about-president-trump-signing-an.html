<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What do you think about President Trump, signing an executive order,<br>to end family separations? \"We\'re going to be signing an executive<br>order in a little while... We\'ve got to be keeping families<br>together.\"**<br><br>Trump's in a tough spot. He won't refuse to enforce the law like<br>previous administrations did. He can't make Congress change the law (and<br>all indications are that Congress won't be able to do it because they're<br>too deadlocked).<br><br>So the best he can do is to get illegals with children out of the<br>country before the 20 days is up.<br><br>The current US law says that children cannot be detained for more than<br>20 days. So if an illegal who snuck across the border towing a kid<br>claims asylum (as the activists have coached them to do), they get<br>arrested pending a hearing by an immigration judge. If that delay takes<br>more than 20 days, the child must be moved to foster care, out of<br>detention. That's the law.<br><br>So either we release the illegal into the country and make them<br>pinky-swear to come back for their illegal immigration hearing (which is<br>what previous administrations did, allowing illegals of questionable<br>background into the country unfettered), or we relocate the child into<br>temporary care while the parent waits in a federal prison.<br><br>There is a third option: deport them faster.<br><br>This is the option Trump will be going for. He will find a way to make<br>deportations happen within 20 days to stay compliant with the law and to<br>keep families together. I suspect that he will make it policy that<br>illegals who claim asylum will simply be deported and told to come in<br>the front door not-illegally so that their family is never separated.<br>It's been a challenge when someone sneaks into the country illegally but<br>then claims asylum. That's the problem we need to fix quickly.<br><br>(EDIT) My prediction did not come true. Instead, Trump, unsurprisingly,<br>did exactly what he said he'd do, and signed an illegal Executive Order<br>actively defying the law and the court, allowing children to stay in<br>incarceration with their parents for more than 20 days. This is<br>definitely not the road I would have gone down, but someone is going to<br>have to challenge the Executive Order in order to change it. In today's<br>political climate, no one is going to challenge the Executive Order,<br>despite its illegality, because the optics of doing so are terrible.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
