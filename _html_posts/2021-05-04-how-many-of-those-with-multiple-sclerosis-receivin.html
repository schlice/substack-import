<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How many of those with Multiple sclerosis receiving disease modifying<br>meds have had their ordering physician also order a Covid test to clear<br>them before being given the meds that will drastically reduce their<br>immunity?**<br><br>I've never heard of this, but it makes sense. Before you start any new<br>MS medication, you receive a battery of tests to ensure you are not<br>infected with any specific diseases, and that certain other things<br>specific to that medication are not out of whack. For instance, liver<br>function tests are common when starting a new MS medication. White blood<br>cell count is closely monitored for some meds, so getting a baseline<br>before starting the medication is important.<br><br>In order for COVID-19 vaccines to work, you have to allow your immune<br>system to respond to the vaccine. Immunosuppressant medications, often<br>used to treat MS, may interfere with that process, and may make the<br>vaccine less efficacious for you. This is why MS patients may have to<br>stop their medications before they get the vaccine, and then re-start<br>their medication after their immunity builds up. Of course, this is<br>highly dependent on your specific MS medication, and your doctor would<br>advise you whether or not you should do this. I REPEAT: **DO NOT STOP<br>YOUR MS MEDICATION UNLESS YOUR DOCTOR TELLS YOU TO DO SO.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
