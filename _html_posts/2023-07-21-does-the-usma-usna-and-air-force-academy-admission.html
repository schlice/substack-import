<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not to a military academy. Perhaps to an Ivy League school, but not to<br>the military academies.<br><br>The nominating officials you cited have specific numbers of cadets that<br>they are legally authorized to have present in the Academy at any one<br>time. For example, a Representative or Senator is authorized to have<br>five (5) nominated cadets at each Academy at a time. On average,<br>this amounts to about one cadet to each Academy per year. If that<br>Representative has five cadets at that Academy, he or she can no longer<br>nominate any further cadets until one leaves through graduation or<br>otherwise.<br><br>Representatives use the "whole person" standard to nominate individuals<br>to attend a service academy. The selection process for nomination<br>mirrors the selection process for acceptance into the Academy itself.<br>You will have to put together a nomination package that looks somewhat<br>similar to the acceptance package you will assemble for the selected<br>Academy. A complete nomination package will have the following elements<br>in it:<br><br>- High school transcript<br>- ACT or SAT scores<br>- Resume of extracurricular activities<br>- An essay stating why you want to attend a Service Academy (500 words<br>  or less)<br>- Minimum of three letters of recommendation<br><br>Letters of recommendation come from people like<br><br>- Teachers<br>- Counselors<br>- Employers<br>- Coaches<br>- Faith-based leaders<br>- Scout Leaders<br><br>Your nomination package goes before a nomination board assembled by the<br>Representative or Senator. They pick a slate of candidates to present to<br>the Representative or Senator to choose. That Representative will choose<br>(usually) the number of applicants which corresponds to the number of<br>slots he has available, so either one or two cadets. There's normally<br>about 100 applicants for nomination per academic year.<br><br>\<br><br>Now, all that said, when the Representative or Senator receives the list<br>of candidates from the Board, does he or she ever look at the list of<br>donors to their campaign and see if the parents are listed? I can't say.<br>But I can tell you that my parents did donate to the campaign of the<br>Representative who nominated me.<br><br>But I was selected by the Board, so I was one of five who was put<br>forward to the Representative out of roughly 100 applicants, and the<br>Representative selected two. Out of the two nominations, only I received<br>an appointment.<br><br>\<br><br>TL;DR: It *might* be a factor in who the Representative or Senator<br>ultimately selects, but you have to get 90% of the way there on your<br>merits. I will never say that political connectedness or money has<br>nothing at all to do with it, but you still have to be a fully qualified<br>candidate before you get to the point where such considerations could<br>ever be made.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
