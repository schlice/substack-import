<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**This is not a troll question. I read a lot of complaints and mockery<br>about Donald Trump, yet the opposition is offering nothing credible in<br>his place. Why is this?**<br><br>When you cannot compete in the arena of ideas, your only attack left is<br>an *ad hominem* (to the man) attack. Basically, they have nothing<br>quantitatively better to offer, so they attack Trump as a person.<br><br>Plus, since he literally is a caricature, it\'s really easy, so they<br>don\'t have to debate him on the ideas. Anything he says, and they\'re<br>just like, "But he\'s Trump!". He\'s not a politician. He has not spent<br>his life concerned with his public image or what people will think or<br>how his actions will play in the media. He doesn\'t care. Frankly, it\'s<br>refreshing, to see what a non-politician can accomplish.<br><br>And that *infuriates* the left. They hate that Trump can roll out of<br>bed, make a decision, and be right most of the time. They hate that he<br>doesn\'t have to have focus groups to decide what exactly he\'s going to<br>say. so they *have* to destroy him. They have to prove that you have to<br>be a politician in order to work in Washington. If Trump succeeds, it<br>will show everyone that you don\'t have to be a lifelong politician in<br>order to do well in government. They simply can\'t allow that, or it<br>spells the end of their breed: the career politician.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
