<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How well do deadbolt metal screen doors protect from home invasions?<br><br>Deadbolt security screen doors provide an extra layer of security in<br>front of your entry door. They are usually made with 18 or 22 gauge<br>steel, so they are relatively strong. The deadbolt is "keyed" on both<br>sides, which means you need a key to open it from either side. In this<br>way, a thief can't simply cut the insect screen and reach in and unlock<br>the door. In order to be secure, the deadbolt must be locked with a key<br>from the inside. The key should still be accessible somewhere inside the<br>house near the door, so you can get out if you need to.<br><br>But let's not forget: locked doors are designed to keep honest people<br>out. Criminals will always find a way in to your house; with enough time<br>and privacy, you can get into any door. Adding layers of security just<br>makes it that much more difficult for even the most determined criminal<br>to enter the house there.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
