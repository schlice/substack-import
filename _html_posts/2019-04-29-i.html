<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I\'ve seen videos of unsuspecting people being pranked by having<br>someone jump out in front of them with knives or axes. If someone shoots<br>them because they feel threatened, can they be charged with murder?**<br><br>*Can* they be charged with murder? Of course they *can*. It's unlikely<br>that they *would*, however.<br><br>With any case in which force is used in self-defense, there must be a<br>reasonable fear of death or grave bodily harm.<br><br>So let's check the elements required for a self-defense claim:<br><br>1.  Is the fear reasonable? To answer this, we use the "reasonable<br>    person test." Would a reasonable person possess the same fear if<br>    they were in the same situation? If someone jumped out in front of<br>    you with a knife or an axe, would you reasonably experience fear?<br>    The answer is yes, the reasonable person would be in fear at<br>    that point.<br>2.  Is there a reasonable fear of death or grave bodily harm? The<br>    "attacker" was wielding a knife, or in some cases an ax. Since these<br>    items can indeed cause death or grave bodily harm, yes, the fear<br>    from bullet 1 is one of death or grave bodily harm.<br><br>Therefore, the person firing in self-defense has a reasonable.<br>supportable claim, and it's likely that the DA wouldn't even pursue<br>murder charges, or if he did, it's likely the person would be found not<br>guilty because he acted in self defense.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
