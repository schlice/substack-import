<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What is the likelihood of active combat for graduates of USAFA?<br><br>It depends entirely on the AFSC into which the grad is placed. Not all<br>AFSCs deploy regularly, and even for those that don't regularly deploy,<br>there are groups within those AFSCs that are worldwide deployable and do<br>regularly deploy. For example, I was a 33S (Logistics and<br>Communications) on the comm side. There is comm at every base of every<br>size worldwide, but we didn't deploy routinely. However, a group within<br>the 33S career field (combat comm) *did* deploy routinely, but only if<br>you were a part of combat comm.<br><br>Pilots and cops, across the entire AFSC, are likely to be sent to active<br>war zones pretty quickly.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
