<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When you prayed for forgiveness, did you just beg God to forgive you, or<br>did you commit to turn away from sin and put your life in God's hands?<br>Did you ask God to make you a new person in Christ?<br><br>Those are two different postures to approach God with. One says, "I did<br>bad things, I'm sorry" and the other says "I did bad things, I'm sorry,<br>and furthermore, I pledge to turn away from the bad things and to listen<br>to Christ as my savior."<br><br>Your anxiety is likely justified, since you probably live like I used<br>to. I spent many, many years simply praying for forgiveness. Asking God<br>to have mercy on me. But it didn't change *me*. I was still the same,<br>sinful person I was before, spinning my wheels, asking God to forgive me<br>while I didn't make any substantive changes to my life. Also, God<br>doesn't give us *mercy*, he gives us *grace*, and that's all we need.<br><br>In order to be saved, it's simple. You just have to *repent* and<br>*believe*. But what does "repent" mean? Yes, it means to say you're<br>sorry, but "repent" actually means "turn away." You have to **turn<br>away** from your sin. Commit to not sinning like that again. And commit<br>to living your life the way God wants you to live. You must truly,<br>honestly, confess your sins to God and *repent* of sin, and commit<br>your life to Christ.<br><br>You will start to see, and feel, a change.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I have said some awful things to God directly. I have already prayed for<br>forgiveness, but I'm anxious that I was not being genuine and that he<br>will punish me. What should I do?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
