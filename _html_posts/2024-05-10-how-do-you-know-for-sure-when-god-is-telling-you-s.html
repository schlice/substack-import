<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You know for sure that what you are being led to do is actually the<br>voice of the Spirit *when it aligns with the truth.* The truth is found<br>in the Bible.<br><br>If you're being told to blow up an airplane, it's probably not the<br>truth, as murder is specifically called out as sinful. But if you're<br>being told to open up a food distribution program for the hungry in your<br>neighborhood after you discover that your neighborhood doesn't have one,<br>there's a good chance you're being led by the Spirit into that action.<br><br>If you are still having difficulty discerning God's voice among all the<br>other voices we are bombarded with (including the voice of Satan lying<br>to you), *talk to someone about it*. Talk to a trusted pastor or a<br>Christian friend. Heck, post it here in Christians and Christianity.<br>We have some amazing Christians here who can help you work through what<br>you're being led to do.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
