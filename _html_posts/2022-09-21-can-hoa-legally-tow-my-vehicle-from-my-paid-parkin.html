You should have received those rules when you<br>moved in to your house. If you don't have them, get them from your HOA.<br>They explain what cars can park where, and whether or not you are<br>permitted to park vehicles in those spaces which are not registered to<br>you, and what the procedure is should you choose to do so.<br><br>The HOA is responsible for making sure that only vehicles registered to<br>the owner of the space are parked in those spaces. They can tow vehicles<br>registered to others when parked in paid spaces. As long as this is<br>their job in the Governing Documents, it is perfectly legal.<br><br>If you parked a car registered to someone else in that space and you<br>didn't notify the HOA, or follow their procedure for what to do when you<br>want to park a car in your space that's not registered to you, that's on<br>you.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can HOA legally tow my vehicle from my paid parking space due to not<br>being registered in my name?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
