<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm going to repeat what others have said, and add a little more.<br><br>- Get the best grades you can get. Work hard at school. If you can take<br>  AP or college-level classes, do that. It shows your ability to handle<br>  the academic rigor of college.<br>- Get into an ACT or SAT prep class. I know it's a little early to be<br>  thinking about those classes, but they help. Anything to help boost<br>  your test score is helpful, and those prep classes do help.<br>- Make sure you are participating in team-level sports at your high<br>  school. If you're not, start. About 95% of applicants who were<br>  accepted into the Academy have participated in team sports. About 80%<br>  of those had earned varsity letters in their sport. Those numbers tell<br>  you that team sports are very important in the selection process.<br>- Make sure you are participating in volunteer activities outside of<br>  your school. Volunteering with your church or in your community is<br>  another important aspect of your portfolio.<br>- Use the [[Air Force Academy<br>  Admissions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60e33c&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} website. Get to<br>  know that site. Read all sections of the site, even if you don't think<br>  they pertain to you. Use the Admissions Tracker on the site to track<br>  the things you need to do. Use the Admissions Liaison Officer (ALO)<br>  Locator to find your ALO and reach out to him/her. It's never too<br>  early to start that conversation.<br>- Research commissioning sources. Your local Congressman is usually the<br>  place to go with the best chance of success. Research what your<br>  Congressman requires for a commission. You can discuss that with your<br>  ALO as well.<br>- Ask questions! If something is unclear, ask about it before it becomes<br>  an issue.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
