<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**As a Christian, I am against abortion. Recently, though, I\'ve been<br>hearing a lot of pro-choice people making the argument that it\'s \"my<br>body\" or \"my choice\", and I\'m not sure how to respond. What can I<br>say to debate against that as a Christian?**<br><br>To answer this question from the Christian point of view is to<br>understand the Christian's objection to abortion.<br><br>**Christians believe that life begins at conception, and God creates all<br>life. Abortion destroys that life, and Christians consider that<br>murder.**<br><br>These arguments are, again, specifically related to the Christian's<br>point of view. These are not legal arguments, and there are quite a few<br>valid concerns that people may have regarding the Christian's view.<br>We're not addressing those in this answer. There are also other,<br>non-Christian objections to abortion, but we're not discussing those<br>here either.<br><br>The basic argument says that nothing gives a mother the right to kill<br>her child, whether it's in the mother's body or not.<br><br>As for the argument about "my body," the fact that the baby grows inside<br>a mother is natural and expected. This fact does not give a person the<br>right to take a life. No person has the ability to murder anyone else.<br>And before you ask, there is a difference between homicide (taking a<br>life) and murder (the unlawful or unjustified taking of a life<br>with malice aforethought). To that end, just because the baby begins its<br>life growing inside of a mother doesn't give the mother the unilateral<br>right to kill that baby.<br><br>There is no such thing as an "unexpected pregnancy."<br><br>There is "choice," and in most cases (considering the comparatively<br>small numbers of abortions which occur due to rape or incest), that<br>choice is voluntarily engaging in a behavior which is designed to create<br>a baby. But this isn't about "punishing" a woman for having premarital<br>sex. It's about understanding that decisions have consequences, and<br>there are many choices available. Destroying a life that God created is<br>not a choice in which we believe.<br><br>The choice we endorse is bringing that baby to term and giving it up for<br>adoption.<br><br>We do know that there are significant barriers to adoption, and<br>pregnancy does change a woman's physiology, and these are indeed<br>concerns that need to be addressed.<br><br>But from the Christian's perspective, none of those concerns validate<br>the choice to kill a baby.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
