<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Hi<br>[Rebecca(https://www.quora.com/profile/Rebecca-Felipe-Silva)]{.qlink_container},<br>thanks for asking!<br><br>Yes, there are indeed exchange programs. Under Title 10 of the United<br>States Code, USAFA can have 60 international students enrolled at any<br>one time. To that end, USAFA admits 15 international students every<br>year.<br><br>International students must meet the same standards as American<br>students, but the admissions process is a little different. For example:<br><br>- You will have to take the SAT or ACT and score acceptably well on it.<br>- You will need a nomination from your country. Nominations are<br>  processed through the Defense Attach√© Office (DAO) at the American<br>  Embassy in your country. Contact that office in order to get more<br>  details about processing a nomination in your country.<br><br>Working with the DAO at your country's US Embassy will be critical. And<br>the sooner, the better: your completed application must be received by<br>December 14th the year before you plan on entering USAFA. The process<br>should commence at least one year before you plan on entering. That<br>means if you want to enter in the class of 2024, you will need to start<br>planning now.<br><br>You should reference the [[USAFA Admissions website for international<br>students](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f1f440&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/advice-to-applicants/international-students/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} for more<br>information.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
