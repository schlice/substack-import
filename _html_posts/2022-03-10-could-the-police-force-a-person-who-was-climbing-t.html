<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, she absolutely would not be shot. If they could reach her, they<br>could pull her down. But if she's beyond reach, she would need to either<br>go up or go down. One way or another (assuming she survives her climb),<br>she'll be arrested, either when she reaches the bottom, or when she<br>reaches the top.<br><br>This happened in 2016 in New York City. A man scaled Trump Tower using<br>suction cups. He was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment and<br>disorderly conduct.<br><br>[https://www.reuters.com/article/\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=462050&url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-climber-idUSKBN1662CW){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="reuters.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Could the police force a person who was climbing the outside of a<br>skyscraper with suction cups to stop the climb if she didn\'t want to?
