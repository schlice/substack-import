<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do you think Trump is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust?<br><br>Maybe.<br><br>But even if that were true, this literally begs the next question:<br><br>*Is "abuse of the public trust" an impeachable offense?*<br><br>The answer to that question is definitely not. That's why we<br>have elections. Period. If you think the President is abusing the public<br>trust, don't re-elect him. Simple as that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
