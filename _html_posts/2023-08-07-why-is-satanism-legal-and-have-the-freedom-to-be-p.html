<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's break this down, because there's a lot here.<br><br>> Why is Satanism legal and have the freedom to be practiced<br><br>For the same reason that Christianity, Judaism, Mormonism, and<br>Scientology are also all legal. The First Amendment says that government<br>"shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or<br>prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Pretty straightforward. Satanism<br>is a religion; Congress cannot make a law making Satanism illegal.<br><br>> while its beliefs provide hatred and murders?<br><br>I think you meant to say that these beliefs *promote* hatred and<br>murder.<br><br>I remember not too long ago when the radical arm of a particular<br>religion murdered over 3000 innocent citizens on US soil, and yet that<br>religion is still legal to practice.<br><br>Promoting hatred is not illegal. Even promoting murder is not illegal,<br>because along with freedom of religion, we have freedom of speech.<br><br>But there are limits. While I can say "All cops should die," and that's<br>legal, I can't then say, "So you all should go kill that cop right<br>there" because if they do it, I would be inciting violence.<br><br>Religion is not unique in spurring adherents to hate and murder.<br><br>> Wouldn\'t it be better if these religious groups stop existing for the<br>> protection of society?<br><br>In the short term, sure. Eliminating these religions would protect<br>society. But there's a few problems:<br><br>1.  Who gets to decide which religions are unsafe? Who gets to decide<br>    which religions are allowed to exist and which ones are not? Do you<br>    trust the government to make that decision? And before you answer<br>    that question, remember that your political opponents may be in<br>    office next term.<br>2.  History has shown us that despite government oppression, believers<br>    will still believe. When Christianity was banned in France during<br>    the French Revolution, it went underground, led by the likes of the<br>    [[Blessed William Joseph<br>    Chaminade](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0e8441&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Joseph_Chaminade){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. Government<br>    suppression of religion does not stop religion.<br>3.  What happens when we move beyond religion? What happens when we<br>    decide that some words are too unsafe for society? What happens when<br>    we decide that some lifestyles are too unsafe for society? What<br>    happens when we decide that some ethnicities are too unsafe for<br>    society? The answer: genocide. It's been tried before (see:<br>    Hitler, Mussolini, Idi Amin, Saddam Hussein, Ho Chi Minh, etc). It<br>    has always failed.<br><br>Knowing this history about attempting to suppress religion, our Founders<br>decided that this country would be one where anyone would be free to<br>practice any religion they choose, or none at all. This includes<br>Satanism. But this in no way is an excuse for murder. Murderers can use<br>as their justification whatever they choose. The law does not care why<br>you killed someone, unless you are mounting a defense and you wish to<br>use self-defense as your justification.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
