<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Like [[Rick<br>Bruno](https://www.quora.com/profile/Rick-Bruno-1)]{.qlink_container}<br>mentioned in his answer, I saw my dad as invincible. He was a hero to<br>me. Also, he was never involved much in my life. I was raised basically<br>by my mom. She was the boss in our house. And when dad stepped in, it<br>was usually with a heavy hand. Don\'t get me wrong, I wasn\'t abused as<br>a child, but corporal punishment dealt by dad was of the harsher<br>variety.\<br>\<br>I learned to be comfortable around police officers. I got to see a side<br>of them that few get to see: a *human* side. I learned that they are<br>real people, and they also tend to socialize best with each other.\<br>\<br>His selflessness fostered in me what my wife calls a \"servant\'s<br>heart\" which has guided my chosen career paths to this day.\<br>\<br>Also, being the child of a cop gives you some great war stories, but I<br>will save those for another question.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
