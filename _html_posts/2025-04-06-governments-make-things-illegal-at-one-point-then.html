  many of us think there should be some retroactivity, and re-imbursement, for making
  someone out to be a criminal, when later they say its not a crime?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Constitution has, as one of its core principles, a prohibition<br>against *ex post facto* laws. This means that a law cannot be passed<br>which makes a *past action* illegal. So let's say, for example, that I<br>buy a gun. Then, next month, the government passes a law which says that<br>all people with brown hair cannot buy guns (just gloss over the<br>Constitutionality of that law for the moment). My purchase of a gun<br>before the law went into effect would not be illegal, because it<br>happened before the law was implemented.<br><br>The same is exactly true in the other direction. If something is<br>illegal, and then the law is changed making that thing legal, but you<br>did that thing while it was illegal, you're still guilty of doing the<br>thing while it was illegal.<br><br>That said, while what was done was illegal when it was done, the change<br>making it legal opens the door for people to challenge their convictions<br>in court, claiming that the change in law makes their conviction<br>invalid.<br><br>Additionally, some states (and in some cases, the Federal government)<br>have victim's restitutions funds which people convicted of crimes which<br>are no longer crimes then have access to. They may be able to receive<br>compensation for time served and for other negative consequences of<br>being convicted for a crime which is no longer a crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
