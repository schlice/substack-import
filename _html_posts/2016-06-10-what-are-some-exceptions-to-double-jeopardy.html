<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>One exception to the Double Jeopardy clause that I know of is the<br>concurrent jurisdiction of the military and civilian authorities.<br><br>In such a case (where a military member commits a crime recognized in<br>both jurisdictions), one jurisdiction will try the individual first<br>(usually the military is given preference). That jurisdiction can try,<br>convict, and sentence the individual to prison (and in military prison,<br>they still do hard labor, turning big rocks into little rocks). At the<br>conclusion of the sentence, when the person is released from military<br>prison, civilian authorities can arrest the individual and try him again<br>*for the exact same crime*. He can be tried, convicted, and<br>sentenced to civilian prison and serve a second sentence in a civilian<br>prison for the exact same crime for which he was just released from a<br>military prison.<br><br>In this instance, double jeopardy does not apply.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
