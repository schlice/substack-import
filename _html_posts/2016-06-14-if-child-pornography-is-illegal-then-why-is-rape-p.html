<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Morally, is it wrong to write a book which details how to assassinate<br>the president? Is it wrong to write a book which details how to make a<br>pipe bomb? And is it wrong to film a movie which details a rape?<br><br>Morally, it's dependent on your particular set of morals. For some<br>people, that may be completely acceptable. For others, it is abhorrent.<br><br>Legally, while you can film a sexual activity and market it as a rape<br>but have statements showing the actors are all over 18 and consent to<br>filming the scene, you cannot film sex with a child and claim that the<br>sex is consensual. Sex with a child is illegal (it is real rape, not<br>pretend-movie rape), so recording sex with a child is, in and of itself,<br>a crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
