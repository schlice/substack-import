<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Candidate endorsements - not condemnations but endorsements - are<br>simply at odds with the tax code under which your pastors willingly<br>signed themselves.*<br><br>Pastors did not "sign the tax code." The government has *never*<br>collected taxes from churches. Ever. As I mentioned, the money belongs<br>to the people, and it is up to the government to show why they need it.<br>And since churches are validly tax-exempt non-profits that have been<br>outside of the government's legitimate tax base since the founding of<br>the nation, the government has no automatic right to the church's money<br>just because its pastor won't give up his constitutionally protected<br>right to free speech.<br><br>*But that's not endorsement. None of the hypotheticals which you<br>mentioned are endorsements for candidates.*<br><br>Of course it is! If I say that a candidate's actions are in violation of<br>our religion, that's a denouncement of that candidate! If I sing the<br>praises of a candidate's ethics and say that it is in line with our<br>church's beliefs, that's an endorsement! I don't have to say "Go vote<br>for candidate X" in order to endorse him. For the guy who tried to tell<br>me the difference between a "wedding" and a "marriage," I'm surprised<br>you have a hard time seeing what an "endorsement" actually looks like.<br><br>And you're wrong that pastors are allowed to speak about candidates. The<br>Johnson Amendment is very clear about this: pastors cannot "participate<br>in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of<br>statements), any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any<br>candidate for public office." Don't you think that singing the praises<br>of a candidate is "intervening?" Actually, it doesn't matter whether or<br>not you think it's intervening. If the IRS thinks it's intervening, that<br>church risks losing their tax-exempt status. Since the amendment passed,<br>the IRS has steadfastly maintained that any speech by churches that<br>*could* be construed as supporting or opposing candidates for<br>government office, including sermons from the pulpit, can result in loss<br>of tax exemption.<br><br>Churches have done this for DECADES before the Johnson Amendment.<br>Churches had been some of the biggest participants in the voice of the<br>people speaking out against injustice. Child labor rights, civil rights,<br>ending segregation, churches were right out there, at the forefront of<br>most of the significant societal and governmental changes in history.<br><br>Oddly though, despite thousands of sermons every year directly or<br>indirectly endorsing candidates, the IRS has never once withdrew<br>tax-exempt status from a church. Why do you think that is?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Trump-vows-to-end-prohibition-on-church-political-activity-will-this-decision-change-the-United-States-forever/answer/Cathi-Brunacini<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
