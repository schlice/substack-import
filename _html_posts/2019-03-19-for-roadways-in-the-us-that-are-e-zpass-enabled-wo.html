Why or why not?**<br><br>Our EZPass enabled roadways already have the capability to do this. In<br>fact, by simply timing how long it took you to get from one toll plaza<br>to the next, the system can quite easily calculate your speed.<br><br>However, most states have some pretty serious regulations on who is<br>allowed to issue speeding tickets, and that's usually somebody who wears<br>a badge, not a toll road administrator. The toll road administrator is<br>indeed free to fine people for speeding on their roads (billable to<br>their toll accounts), but they can't issue speeding tickets that would<br>go on their license. This is similar to red light camera violations,<br>which are not moving violations against your license either.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
