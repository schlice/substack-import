<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Your CAC can be used by you to enter any military base<br>which has open facilities for military personnel.\<br>\<br>Some military facilities are Restricted Areas in their entirety. They<br>are generally mission-specific facilities, not full-service military<br>bases. They specifically require that you be stationed there before you<br>may enter. In such a scenario, you must go to Pass & Registration<br>*before* you enter the base and receive your Restricted Area access<br>badge.\<br>\<br>Note that many facilities are now being upgraded to DBIDS (Defense<br>Biometric ID System) which will also use the CAC card for ID. However,<br>at any facility protected by DBIDS, you must first still pre-register<br>before you can enter.\<br>\<br>That said, if the facility is not a Restricted Area in its entirety,<br>your CAC card will allow you entrance.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
