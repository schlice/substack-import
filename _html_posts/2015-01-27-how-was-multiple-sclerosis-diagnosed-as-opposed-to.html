<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [MS was, and still is, a diagnosis of \"exclusion.\" You<br>have to \"exclude\" all known causes of the symptoms being experienced<br>before you can conclude that the patient has MS. In the early days, this<br>diagnosis of exclusion was paramount in diagnosing MS.\<br>\<br>The diagnostic criteria formerly included two episodes in different<br>functional systems disseminated by space and time. This means that you<br>could not make a positive diagnosis of MS based on one symptom. You had<br>to have multiple symptoms over time to positively diagnose MS. This<br>meant that the disease had to progress before you could begin to<br>effectively treat it.\<br>\<br>Diagnostic testing pre-MRI was used in addition to excluding other known<br>conditions. One of the methods that was used was called the \"tub<br>test.\" As you may know, heat exacerbates MS symptoms. Removal of the<br>heat causes the symptoms to decline again. Doctors would put suspected<br>MS patients in a hot tub and see if their symptoms got worse, and then<br>see if they subsided once they were removed from the tub. If their<br>symptoms exhibited this property, doctors suspected MS.\<br>\<br>The LP (lumbar puncture or \"spinal tap\") was also used, looking for<br>the protein remnants from demyelination. LPs are still used today to add<br>to the \"body of evidence\" that suggests a person has a demyelinating<br>condition like MS. Today, however, the MRI is the primary visual<br>diagnostic test; so much so, that in 2010, the McDonald criteria for<br>diagnosis of MS were updated to include one positive symptom and a<br>positive MRI.]<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
