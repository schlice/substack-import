<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there any realistic possibility that Roe v Wade will be overturned<br>after Trump picks the next Supreme Court nominee?**<br><br>Thanks for asking this question. It is certainly a valid question, and<br>one that opponents will definitely try to use to hamstring the<br>nomination process.<br><br>Let's talk about *Roe* for a second. When Blackmun penned his decision,<br>he admitted that science, religion and philosophy could not agree when<br>life began, and if they could not agree, then the judiciary would<br>certainly not make such a statement.<br><br>The corollary is also true: *If science, theology and philosophy*<br>*can* *agree on when life begins, the foundation for Roe crumbles.*<br><br>However, this means that the turning point in the abortion debate is not<br>dependent on the makeup of the court. It is dependent on whether or not<br>science, religion, and philosophy can agree on when life begins.<br><br>To that end:<br><br>1.  It is not the next SCOTUS nominee which will determine the fate of<br>    *Roe*. It is science, theology and philosophy coming together to<br>    determine when life begins which will determine when *Roe*<br>    collapses.<br>2.  Even if *Roe* is overturned, this simply returns the control of<br>    abortion to the states. Some states will support unfettered abortion<br>    up through 40 weeks. Some states will use the<br>    science/theology/philosophy approved definition of the beginning of<br>    life to limit elective abortions (not abortions required by medical<br>    necessity; i.e. health of mother, rape/incest, etc). Some states<br>    will ban abortions altogether. It will become a patchwork of<br>    abortion laws, but states' rights advocates would like to see it<br>    that way: allow the state representatives to determine for those<br>    state residents how they would like their state dollars spent.\<br>    \<br>    So even if *Roe* is overturned, full access to elective abortions<br>    throughout pregnancy may still be available in some states.<br>3.  A decision somewhere in between could also happen: if a<br>    scientifically provable definition of life becomes acceptable,<br>    abortion after that point would be considered murder without<br>    compelling medical necessity. The court could limit abortions after<br>    the fetus gains "life."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
