<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You realize that forgiveness isn't about you forgiving them. **It's<br>about you forgiving *yourself*.**<br><br>Let me explain with an analogy.<br><br>Let's assume you are out fishing with your family member. Let's also<br>assume that while they are casting their line, they get the hook stuck<br>in your cheek.<br><br>What can you do about this grave injustice?<br><br>You could ignore it. You go home and go to bed, but when you wake up the<br>next morning, *the pain is worse*.<br><br>You could complain about it. "Look at me! Look how much my family member<br>has hurt me!" But that doesn't reduce the pain, either, because the hook<br>is still in your cheek, and it still hurts.<br><br>What is the clear, obvious choice? *Remove the hook!*<br><br>When you refuse to forgive, you leave the hook in your cheek. Deep down,<br>you might be thinking that if you forgive them, you're letting them off<br>the hook. But the truth is that while you don't forgive them (while you<br>leave the hook in your cheek), *they're still hurting you*. If you<br>*don't* forgive them, you are the one with the hook still in you.<br><br>Forgiveness is for your sake, not theirs. You need to forgive them so<br>that you can move on. You are not hurting them by staying hooked to the<br>pain. That's like drinking poison and hoping the other person dies. You<br>must forgive them so that you can move on without pain.<br><br>\<br><br>But by the same token, part of forgiving is *agreeing to live with the<br>consequences of someone else's mistakes*. You might say, "But that's not<br>fair!" No, it is not. But you'll have to do it anyway. The only choice<br>we do have is whether we do it in the bondage of bitterness, or in the<br>freedom of forgiveness.<br><br>You must choose to forgive. And in making that choice, you must<br>agree to live with their mistakes and the consequences of those<br>mistakes.<br><br>**Forgiveness is to set a captive free, and then to realize that you<br>were the captive.**<br><br>Forgiveness is a crisis of the will. If you wait until you feel like<br>doing it, you never will. The reality is that you have a choice to make.<br>You must face the hurt. You must face the hate. You must choose to not<br>hold their mistakes against them for the rest of your life. And that's<br>hard. But you must do it. Say it out loud. Declare to yourself that you<br>know they hurt you, but you are going to forgive them and not hold it<br>against them.<br><br>Are you going to remain in bitterness, hooked to the past, or are you<br>going to get rid of the pain once and for all? Are you going to do<br>what's necessary to remove that hook from your cheek?<br><br>\<br><br>*By the way, I kept this answer entirely secular. But there is a<br>spiritual aspect to this. I can expound on that if you'd like, just let<br>me know. But I wanted to present it in an entirely secular way if you<br>are not spiritual.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
