Being able to perform the job safely is part of the<br>essential functions of a job: not just doing it, but doing it safely.<br><br>If a disability prevents a person from doing the job safely, and no<br>amount of reasonable accommodations will help, then the employer can<br>pass on hiring that person and can cite the inability to overcome the<br>disability with reasonable accommodations.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.
