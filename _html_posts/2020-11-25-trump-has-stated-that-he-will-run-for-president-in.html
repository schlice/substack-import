<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Trump has stated that he will run for President in 2024. Do you think<br>his cult will stand behind him for 4 years and then rise to the occasion<br>again?**<br><br>There is a small cohort of people who love Trump for Trump. They will<br>support him in 2024, regardless of who else runs alongside him.<br><br>Those people are the minority of Republicans.<br><br>If the Republican Party puts up a strong candidate alongside him (and<br>there are a few who have a shot --- Tom Cotton, Mike Pompeo, Nikki<br>Haley, etc), he won't have a snowball's chance.<br><br>Trump was a reaction to 8 years of Obama, and putting him up against<br>someone who was as unlikable a candidate as Hillary Clinton ensured his<br>victory. After experiencing the left's constant anti-Trump campaign for<br>four years, and then putting him up against someone who is just likable<br>enough, even if not energetic or enthusiastic (like Biden), and he<br>loses. That should tell you something. With any luck, it tells the GOP<br>something.<br><br>But don't misinterpret. Simply because there is a cohort of<br>"all-Trump-all-the-time" Republicans does not mean that all Republicans<br>think this way. Far from it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
