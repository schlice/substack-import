<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No. Not because he shouldn't be tortured to death, because he absolutely<br>should. But we, *as a nation*, should not endorse torture. We believe<br>that the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution is still the best way to<br>go forward as a nation:<br><br>> ***Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed,<br>> nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.***<br><br>So the "cruel and unusual punishment" section has undergone some changes<br>over its existence. In the context of punishment in sentencing, the<br>Court has generally viewed the Eighth Amendment to prohibit punishments<br>that "involve the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain."<br><br>Historically, this has been considered as part of the death penalty, and<br>that standard has been used to uphold the firing squad, and<br>electrocution. In other cases, the Supreme Court held that various<br>lethal injection protocols withstood scrutiny under the Eighth<br>Amendment, finding that none of the challenged protocols presented a<br>"substantial risk of serious harm" or an "objectively intolerable risk<br>of harm."<br><br>However, "torturing someone to death" is not only "unusual" meaning that<br>it is not something we do frequently, or even sparingly, but it is<br>"cruel" which has come to mean "unnecessary and wanton infliction of<br>pain."<br><br>So torture is off the table.<br><br>Either it's life in prison, or it's the death penalty.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
