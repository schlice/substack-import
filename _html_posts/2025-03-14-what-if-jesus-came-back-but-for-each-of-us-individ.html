  and it is up to us to decide to follow him."'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is indeed a fascinating thought. But it's not biblical.<br><br>When Jesus was assumed into Heaven following the month of His presence<br>after His resurrection, there were two angels who told the disciples<br>that Jesus would return *in the same way they saw him depart:*<br><br>> And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was<br>> lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. And while they<br>> were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in<br>> white robes, and said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into<br>> heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come<br>> in the same way as you saw him go into heaven." \-- Acts 1:9--11 ESV<br><br>So Jesus is clearly coming back, but the way He will come back was<br>exactly the same way He went up. And how did He go up? He was *assumed*<br>into Heaven. "He was lifted up, and a cloud took Him out of sight."<br><br>So we can assume that He will return on a cloud, in the same way the<br>disciples saw Him depart.<br><br>Not to mention, Jesus is still fully human as well as fully God.<br>So if He were to return as "one man or woman in each of our lives," He<br>wouldn't be human anymore, since humans can only exist in one place at<br>one time.<br><br>Finally, the time to "decide to follow Him" is now, because if you<br>haven't given your life to Him before He returns, by the time He does,<br>it will be too late. You don't want to be the one who waits until the<br>last second to believe in Him. Believe in Him *now*. Trust Him<br>*today.*<br><br>Have you heard of Pascal's Wager?<br><br>*If I'm wrong, and there is no God, I've lost nothing. But if*<br>*you're* *wrong, and there is a God, you've lost everything.*<br><br>Don't risk losing everything.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
