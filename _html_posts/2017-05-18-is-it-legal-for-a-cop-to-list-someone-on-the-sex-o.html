<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It sounds as if the DA and the cops are performing a little bit of<br>"scared straight" tactics.<br><br>As far as I know, there is no such thing anywhere, let alone Oklahoma,<br>as a "non-registered sex offender" list. That is simply a fiction<br>created by the DA. You're either a registered sex offender, or you are<br>not. There is no legal "in-between."<br><br>Perhaps what the DA meant was that he would consider the person a<br>sex offender *even though he wasn't on the list.*<br><br>And the other respondents explained how you get on the real list. Since<br>none of that happened here, this person is not a registered sex<br>offender, period.<br><br>You also stated that "according to a police department in Oklahoma, he<br>is a sex offender." I would get that in writing and then take it to a<br>criminal defense attorney specializing in sex crimes. We would write an<br>official letter to the DA demanding that they correct that police<br>department or face a libel lawsuit.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
