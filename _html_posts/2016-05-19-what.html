<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I just want to point out that the issue some states have with the<br>transgender policy has absolutely positively zero to do with<br>transgender people. No one is saying that transgender people are<br>predators. No one.<br><br>The issue that it raises, however, has everything to do with the OP's<br>point.<br><br>**What\'s to stop a man from saying \"I identify as a woman today\" and<br>using a women\'s bathroom?**<br><br>*Nothing.*<br><br>Additionally, the problem is not really about bathrooms. It's more about<br>other gender-separated facilities, like *locker rooms* and<br>*showers*.<br><br>The problem is that a blanket policy applies to everyone, not just<br>transgender individuals. And with no way to determine whether or not<br>someone is truly transgender, the policy opens the door for countless<br>sexual predators to have free access to the very people upon whom they<br>prefer to prey, in the very places they prefer to do it.<br><br>You're probably not a parent. You probably don't have daughters. But try<br>to imagine you did. Would you want your daughter exposed to the naked<br>male form when they chose to be exposed to it, or when it was forced on<br>them? Yes, in most cases (and in the case of transgender individuals),<br>it will be the unaroused male form. But for the predator, it may not be.<br>This could be a very traumatic experience for a girl, and under this<br>policy, the predator has been given the all-access pass to the<br>all-you-can-abuse buffet. This doesn't make the behavior any more legal<br>or illegal than it already is. It simply makes it easier for the<br>predator to do his thing. I would think we would want to reduce the<br>ability of predators to access their targets, not make it easier and<br>accepted for them to do so. Opening up shower and locker room facilities<br>to all genders is what I like to call *inviting trouble.*<br><br>And women already know the struggle of being viewed as sex objects<br>instead of as people. Allowing men into womens' showers can only make<br>such objectification worse. What's to say that the male in your shower<br>or locker room isn't a straight male who has just been given the keys to<br>the kingdom? I'm not so sure women would have no issues showering with<br>men, considering how they are looked at when they are *not* naked.<br><br>I can understand that the transgender person may experience hurt<br>feelings by only being provided individual showers/locker rooms when a<br>facility provides gender-separated facilities. But I would rather hurt<br>the feelings of the small minority than to endanger the health and<br>safety of the vast majority to spare those feelings.<br><br>I'm sorry if this comes off as callous or uncaring to the transgender<br>individual. I do not mean it to be so. But I feel very strongly that<br>Spock was right: "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."<br>We have an *obligation* to protect our women and daughters (and I<br>use women and daughters because overwhelmingly they are the population<br>which are the victims of sex assaults). Until we can come up with a way<br>to objectively determine whether or not someone is transgender, policies<br>which would throw away that safety to satisfy the feelings of a very<br>small few are reckless and dangerous.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
