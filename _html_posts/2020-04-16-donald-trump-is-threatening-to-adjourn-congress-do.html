<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can Trump adjourn Congress?<br><br>Yes, although the President is assuming that the Constitutional<br>authority applies in this circumstance when it may not.<br><br>The Constitution says the President \"may, on extraordinary Occasions,<br>convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement<br>between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn<br>them to such Time as he shall think proper\" (Article II, Section 3).<br><br>However, SCOTUS has never ruled on that clause, since it has never been<br>invoked before. There is some disagreement as to what constitutes<br>"disagreement" with respect to the time of adjournment and whether or<br>not he can only adjourn sessions which he has convened because of<br>"extraordinary Occasions."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
