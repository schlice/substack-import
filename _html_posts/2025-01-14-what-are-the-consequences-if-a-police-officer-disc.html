<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This kind of thing happens all the time. You had insurance when you<br>registered your car, but for some reason, your car no longer appears on<br>your insurance. Maybe it's because you changed insurance carriers. Maybe<br>it's because you updated your policy and the car fell off for some<br>reason. It happens.<br><br>In most states, if you're caught without insurance on your car, you can<br>expect some or all of the following consequences:<br><br>Penalties<br><br>- Fines: You may face a fine of up to \$5,000, depending on the<br>  state and how many times you\'ve been caught.<br>- License suspension: Your driver\'s license may be suspended.<br>- Vehicle impoundment: Your vehicle may be impounded.<br>- Jail time: Driving without insurance can be a misdemeanor or<br>  felony (depending on your state), and you may face jail time.<br>- SR-22: Your insurance company may require you to file an SR-22,<br>  which can make it harder to get car insurance in the future.<br><br>Liability<br><br>- If you\'re at fault in an accident, you may be required to pay for the<br>  other party\'s medical expenses and vehicle damage.<br>- If your car is totaled, you may be responsible for the remaining<br>  balance on the loan.<br><br>Future insurance rates<br><br>- Your future car insurance rates may be higher if you\'ve been caught<br>  driving without insurance.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
