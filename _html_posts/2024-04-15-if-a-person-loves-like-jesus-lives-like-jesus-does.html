<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What is a religion? A religion, at its core, is a specific set of<br>beliefs and practices. But here's the secret: **just being a part of a<br>religion is not what saves you.**<br><br>You may consider yourself Christian. You may believe you are a<br>Christian. But does that fact save you?<br><br>NO!<br><br>Salvation is through belief in Christ and acceptance of His gift of<br>salvation through His substitutionary death on the cross.<br><br>> Jesus said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one<br>> comes to the Father except through me. --- John 14:6 ESV<br><br>It's funny, because Jesus actually talked about this very question while<br>He was alive:<br><br>> "Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep\'s clothing but<br>> inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will recognize them by their fruits.<br>> Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? So, every<br>> healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit.<br>> A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear<br>> good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and<br>> thrown into the fire. Thus you will recognize them by their fruits.<br>><br>> "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of<br>> heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.<br>> On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in<br>> your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works<br>> in your name?' And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you;<br>> depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'" --- Matthew 7:15--23 ESV<br><br>Notice that Jesus contrasts *doing good things* with *having faith in<br>Christ.* Just doing all the things you mentioned by themselves:<br><br>- loves like Jesus<br>- lives like Jesus<br>- does works in Jesus' name<br>- sacrifices in Jesus' name<br>- adorates Jesus<br><br>are not what saves you. ***DOING ALL THOSE THINGS ARE A RESULT OF<br>RECEIVING GOD'S SALVATION, NOT THE CAUSE OF SALVATION.***<br><br>Once you are saved, you will *naturally* do those things, as you will be<br>a changed person and this is what saved people do. This is why you<br>recognize the *changed person* from the *fruit*. The fruit, without the<br>changed person, is useless. Similarly, if you don't see the fruit, you<br>can doubt whether or not the person is changed. But as Jesus said, a<br>good tree will not bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good<br>fruit. So you will know them by their fruit, but at the same time, just<br>doing the good things is not what saves you.<br><br>TL;DR: Someone who does all these things but who has failed to<br>accept Christ as his savior will hear Him tell them on the last day,<br>"Depart from me, I never knew you."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
