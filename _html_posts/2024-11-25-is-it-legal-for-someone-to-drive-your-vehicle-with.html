<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the US, there is no paperwork required for someone to be able to<br>drive your car. If you give them permission, they can do so, and so long<br>as they hold a valid driver's license for that type of vehicle, they are<br>even covered by your car insurance¹.<br><br>However, if the driver does not have a valid driver's license, or if the<br>driver does not have permission to drive your car, your car insurance<br>will likely not cover any accidents or damage.<br><br>\<br><br>¹ Your mileage may vary (no pun intended). Most insurance companies do<br>cover drivers who you have authorized and who have valid licenses. But<br>there are some exceptions: for example, if the vehicle is being used for<br>business, your personal auto policy won't cover accidents.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
