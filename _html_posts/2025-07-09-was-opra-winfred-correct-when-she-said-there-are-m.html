<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not only was Oprah's statement wrong, but it's unloving to even<br>suggest such a thing.<br><br>Here's an example to underscore what I'm saying.<br><br>Let's say I just flew in to a massive international airport. It's huge,<br>there's gates everywhere, and I don't read the local language. I just<br>want to find the gate that's going to take me home.<br><br>I ask someone like Oprah, and she says "Sure, you can take any gate!<br>They'll all get you home!" So I take a gate, and I end up someplace even<br>farther away from home.<br><br>Whereas if I asked a Christian, they'd say "D14 is your gate. That's the<br>gate you need to get home." But then I say, "But what about all these<br>other gates? Won't they get me home too? It's not very inclusive of you<br>to disregard all these other gates. Can't I get home through one of<br>these gates?"<br><br>In that situation, is it more loving for the person to present the truth<br>about which gate will get me home, or is it more loving to try to be<br>inclusive of all of the gates, even if they don't get me home?<br><br>\<br><br>There aren't a million ways to get to heaven. Jesus said so very<br>clearly.<br><br>> *Jesus said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one<br>> comes to the Father except through me. \-- John 14:6 ESV*<br><br>If Jesus is *credible*, then what He says is true. Unless you believe<br>Jesus is a liar. To date, there is no proof that Jesus is a liar. So the<br>question is: *is Jesus credible?*<br><br>Well, ask yourself this:<br><br>- Has anyone else's life been prophesied so heavily, and had all of<br>  those prophecies come true in His life?<br>- Has anyone else performed miracles to prove He is God?<br>- Has anyone else predicted and then accomplished His own resurrection?<br><br>Jesus appeared to hundreds of people after He was raised from the dead.<br>Those hundreds of people were willing to suffer and die for that belief,<br>when all they would have had to do to save themselves would have been to<br>recant their stories, yet they didn't. They were willing to die for<br>their belief, which means that, at the very least, they all actually<br>believed it. They didn't think it was a lie, because while people may be<br>willing to die for a belief they think is true, no one is willing to die<br>for a lie they know is a lie.<br><br>The fulfilled prophecies, the miracles, the resurrection, and the<br>eyewitness accounts of His appearance after He was resurrected make His<br>story *credible.*<br><br>Because Jesus is *credible*, what He says is true.<br><br>Jesus says that there is only one way to heaven. Therefore, it would be<br>*unloving* to tell anyone any different.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
