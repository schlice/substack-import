<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Thanks for the A2A, but I don't have anything to add to<br>[Me(https://www.quora.com/profile/Me-9043)]{.qlink_container}'s<br>answer.<br><br>It is well known that pregnancy will suspend MS symptoms. There are a<br>number of theories around why this happens, but we know it's most likely<br>hormonal. We know that prolactin has a property which causes<br>regeneration of myelin (but it's unsuitable as a treatment for men, as<br>it also causes male lactation, so there's that). Anyway, we know that<br>pregnancy will temporarily suspend MS symptoms.<br><br>But as Dion mentioned, you're probably going to be off of your MS meds<br>during your pregnancy, and you should be prepared to experience a<br>relapse shortly after childbirth. Prepare for it, and you'll be fine.<br><br>Pregnancy and childbirth does not *exacerbate* MS. It doesn't make your<br>disease worse, so far as we can tell. There will be a noticeable pause<br>during pregnancy, followed by a pretty likely relapse after childbirth.<br>But that's about it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
