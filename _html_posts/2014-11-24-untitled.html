<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Two valid points. I guess I\'ll dive into it then.\<br>\<br>1. You are correct that atheists do not make a positive claim; they make<br>a negative claim. Making a negative claim is a claim in and of itself:<br>there is no god. In order for that claim to be believable, you can\'t<br>just say \"it\'s believable because you haven\'t proven that your theory<br>is believable.\" Belief in God is not innocent until proven guilty. If<br>you are going to be a student of any theistic philosophy (atheism<br>included), you have to be able to prove your own belief, or you\'re just<br>fooling yourself by saying, \"you haven\'t convinced me, therefore I\'m<br>right.\" Proving your belief by saying you haven\'t proven yours is no<br>proof whatsoever. You have to offer empirical evidence that god does not<br>exist.\<br>\<br>2. Pascal\'s Wager is an interesting philosophical thought exercise, but<br>isn\'t a way to explain religion. It treats religion as nothing more<br>than a cost/benefit analysis instead of a way to pattern your life. In<br>other words, you\'re missing the point if the only reason you believe in<br>a god or not believe in a god is to achieve heaven, or not achieve<br>heaven.\<br>\<br>It seems, however, when trying to find credible reasons to believe in<br>god, atheists like to reduce the argument to this sort of cost/benefit<br>analysis. Logic alone can bring you closer to the truth, but only faith<br>can lead you to accept the truth in God\'s word.\<br>\<br>I can present many logical arguments as to the fact that there is a<br>creator using logic, science and philosophy. But even that won\'t bring<br>a person to faith.\<br>\<br>For example, the story in the Bible of Thomas (the doubter) who did not<br>believe that Jesus rose from the dead until he touched the nail holes in<br>His hands. Jesus said, in essence, \"Good on you for believing after you<br>touched, but blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe.\" That<br>is the essence of faith. Faith is belief without empirical evidence. The<br>evidence I do have backs up what I already believe by faith.\<br>\<br>I re-word Pascal\'s Wager in this way: if I am wrong, and there is no<br>god, I\'ve lost nothing. But if you are wrong, and there is a god,<br>you\'ve lost everything. And eternity is an awfully long time to be<br>wrong.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-is-one-serious-credible-reason-why-I-should-consider-a-belief-in-your-god-s/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
