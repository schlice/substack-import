If Trump wanted to stop the investigation, as the person in<br>charge of the Executive Branch, *he could have directed the FBI to stop<br>the investigation.* But he did not do this. If he did, it would have<br>been seen as highly suspect, and perhaps then, he could have been<br>impeached on an abuse of power charge.
