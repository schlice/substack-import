The specifics of the response protocol that police use<br>can\'t be released.\<br>\<br>Rest assured, however, that ever since Columbine, police across the<br>United States have been working very hard to build and implement a<br>protocol for dealing with active shooters. The protocol in use today is<br>very well thought out, and very succinctly deals with these types of<br>situations.
