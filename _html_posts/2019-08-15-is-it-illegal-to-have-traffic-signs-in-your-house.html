<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it illegal to have traffic signs in your house?<br><br>No. But what *may* be illegal is how you came to acquire the signs. If<br>you took the signs off of the road, that's theft of government property.<br>Regardless of where you have it (in your house, on your house, in your<br>car, etc), the theft is still the issue.<br><br>I used to have a street sign from New York that read 94th Avenue (in<br>celebration of my graduation year from USAFA, 1994). I actually got it<br>from the county, but I didn't steal it off the road. My dad knew a guy<br>in the County signage shop and he made it for me.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
