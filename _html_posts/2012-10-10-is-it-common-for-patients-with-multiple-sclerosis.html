<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [A low-grade fever is definitely an uncommon symptom. Most<br/>people taking beta-blockers (Avonex, Betaseron, Rebif, etc) will feel<br/>flu-like symptoms after injecting their medication, but a low-grade<br/>fever during periods of fatigue is a new one on me. I am certain it\'s<br/>related, but exactly how, I can\'t say.]<br/><br/>*Disclaimer:*<br/><br/>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br/>substitute for professional medical advice.
