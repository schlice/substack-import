<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [A low-grade fever is definitely an uncommon symptom. Most<br>people taking beta-blockers (Avonex, Betaseron, Rebif, etc) will feel<br>flu-like symptoms after injecting their medication, but a low-grade<br>fever during periods of fatigue is a new one on me. I am certain it\'s<br>related, but exactly how, I can\'t say.]<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
