<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [So, alien-looking meaning \"looking like they are from<br>Mars\"? ;-)\<br>\<br>I would ask you to consider this scenario:\<br>\<br>I\'m a police officer patrolling a predominantly black neighborhood. I<br>see a rather nice-looking sedan with four white boys (late teens-early<br>20s) driving around the neighborhood.\<br>\<br>Does that tell me anything? Should it? Well, if it does (and by the way,<br>it does), I have just profiled the presumed activities of those boys<br>based on their race.\<br>\<br>Can I do that? Yep, I sure can. It\'s human nature to do that.\<br>\<br>Can I stop the vehicle because there is a car full of four white boys in<br>a predominantly black neighborhood? Nope. That\'s racial profiling, and<br>I can\'t use that as justification to stop the car.\<br>\<br>But if I\'m following the car and they run a stop sign, I can stop the<br>car because they ran a stop sign and I can then ask them what they\'re<br>doing in this neighborhood.\<br>\<br>I also suspect that the woman who was being \"pulled away\" was being<br>pulled away for another reason. The fact that she didn\'t show them any<br>ID is suspicious in and of itself, but if she was being asked questions<br>which she couldn\'t answer, whether or not she looks \"alien\" is not<br>relevant.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
