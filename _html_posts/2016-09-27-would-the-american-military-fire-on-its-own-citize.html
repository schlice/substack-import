<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Martial law is a unique situation. It usually occurs when law and order<br>has broken down to such a degree that the military needs to take control<br>of the government. Many rights we enjoy as Americans would be suspended,<br>such as *habeas corpus.* Usually, most civil rights and civil laws are<br>suspended and are replaced with military law, in this case the UCMJ, and<br>all citizens become subject to it, not just the military. When military<br>members find civilians in violation of UCMJ, they are arrested and<br>brought before a military tribunal.<br><br>So the reason behind the declaration of martial law will really<br>determine how the military responds. For example, let's say Trump wins<br>the election, and the Democrats get together and stage a *coup d'etat*<br>and attempt to take over Washington. Occupy Democrats get together with<br>Black Lives Matter (not too much of a stretch there) and do the same in<br>state government. The government could declare martial law and allow the<br>military to take over. Theoretically, they could detain anyone who was<br>found to be a Democrat and put them in internment camps so that we could<br>restore law and order. Military members would likely follow those<br>orders.<br><br>Martial law usually isn't declared for natural disasters; that's usually<br>a state of emergency. Let's say we had a state of emergency and military<br>members were told to round up all Democrats, I think you'd find whole<br>battalions of soldiers refusing those orders *en masse.*<br><br>So whether or not military members would consciously object to the<br>orders would depend on the reason that martial law was imposed in the<br>first place.<br><br>[[Here's the<br>history](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=be99dc&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law%23United_States){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} of the imposition of<br>martial law in the United States.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
