<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I would venture to say that many theists haven't really thought about it<br>all that much. But if they had, they would agree with you: the Bible<br>doesn't prove the existence of God.<br><br>But that's because, primarily, it was never designed to do that. You can<br>prove God's existence without ever referencing the Bible or any religion<br>at all.<br><br>The purpose of the Bible is to tell a story. It's a story in three main<br>acts:<br><br>1.  Paradise<br>2.  Paradise Lost<br>3.  Paradise Regained<br><br>The bulk of the Bible centers around explaining #2, whereas #1 takes up<br>only two chapters of the book of Genesis, and #3 takes up the last two<br>chapters of Revelation.<br><br>TL;DR: The Bible was never designed to prove God's existence. You do<br>that *first*, and *then* you read the Bible.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
