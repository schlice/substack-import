<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Is there a country that uses a mainstream Bible<br><br>No "country" uses one Bible translation. There are hundreds of<br>translations of the Bible<br><br>> that\'s translated unquestionably<br><br>If a translation of the Bible changes facts, then that's not a<br>translation. That's a modification.<br><br>No translation is "unquestionable." Some languages have more words than<br>others. For example, translation from Greek is sometimes difficult as<br>they have multiple words for "love" where we only have one.<br><br>> **so that the verses about same-sex relations are confirming and not<br>> damming?**<br><br>So this one is easy to answer:<br><br>*The Bible unquestionably says that homosexuality is a sin.*<br><br>That said, love the sinner, hate the sin. In other words, your sin<br>is between you and God. It is not my place to judge you. That is God's<br>job. It's also not my place to translate the Bible in an acceptable way.<br>It's also not my place to help you find a modified Bible that makes a<br>homosexual feel better about their sin.<br><br>It is only my place to tell you what the Bible says, and to tell you<br>that we love you and we are all sinners. We have all fallen short of<br>God's expectations for us. But God loves you, and we want you to know<br>that if you have accepted Christ as your savior, then your sins are<br>forgiven, *but you must go and sin no more* as Jesus commanded.<br><br>The Bible is very clear, in multiple books across multiple centuries,<br>that homosexuality is a sin. No translation of the Bible will change<br>that. Living as if it is not is living outside of God's commands. The<br>answer is not to change the Bible to suit you. The answer is to change<br>you to suit the Bible.<br><br>I'm not suggesting conversion therapy. What you do and how you do it are<br>not up to me. I'm not even advising you do or not do anything. I'm<br>simply here to love you as a brother or a sister, and to bring you to<br>Christ. The rest is up to him.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
