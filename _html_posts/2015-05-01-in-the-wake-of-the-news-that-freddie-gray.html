<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Standby.\<br>\<br>The ruling was that there is sufficient evidence to go to trial charging<br>the police with manslaughter.\<br>\<br>This makes sense, because the *only* time the police are responsible<br>for protecting one person is when they are in custody. The police failed<br>to do this, so they should rightly be charged. Whether or not they will<br>be *convicted* is a whole other story.\<br>\<br>PLEASE do not equate this with \"a problem with police violence against<br>people of color.\" If the police are convicted of murder, that would be<br>one thing. But these police officers are charged with manslaughter<br>because they allowed a suspect to die while in custody.\<br>\<br>There is no charge levied that the officers{.underline}<br>*killed{.underline}* the suspect{.underline}. That would be<br>murder. The charge is that the officers allowed a suspect to die while<br>in custody, and if that was preventable by the officers, then they can<br>be charged with manslaughter. Voluntary or involuntary will be<br>determined by the DA.\<br>\<br>(EDIT) So the charges were released and two officers were charged with<br>murder. I think that this DA has an uphill battle to fight here. I<br>don\'t see this jury (wherever the trial is, because it certainly won\'t<br>be in Baltimore) returning guilty convictions for murder. That\'s way<br>too high a standard to meet and these charges are political, not<br>judicial; I\'m seeing possible manslaughter charges for one or two of<br>them, the rest will be acquitted. I\'m also seeing this Baltimore DA<br>losing her job over this.\<br>\<br>(EDIT2) It also appears that I never answered the second part of the<br>question:\<br>\<br>*What are some thoughtful solutions to the problem of police violence<br>against people of color?*\<br>\<br>I\'m not sure you have adequately identified such a problem. And the<br>answer to that question is not \"but I see it all the time on TV.\" In<br>such a case, the correct question would be \"*What are some thoughtful<br>solutions to the problem of television hyping up incidents between white<br>officers and black suspects?\"*\<br>\<br>When you identify that such a problem exists, please let us know how you<br>know there is a problem. Usually this involves statistics.\<br>\<br>Here\'s a few to get you started.\<br>]<br><br>- Police officers are *six times more likely* to be shot by young black<br>  men than the other way around.<br>- The leading cause of death for young black men is homicide, and in 90%<br>  of cases, the shooter is another young black man.<br>- The police aren\'t even involved in 96% of black homicides.<br>- The black population is about 14% of the country, but they commit more<br>  than half of the nation\'s violent crimes. They also make up 39% of<br>  the prison population.<br>- That\'s not a problem of \"over-policing:\" black men are arrested at<br>  nearly the exact rate that victims identify black men as their<br>  assailants. Police are in those areas because that\'s where the 911<br>  calls are coming from.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
