<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>An unfortunate mistranslation in the King James Bible translated the<br>word *ratsatch* as "kill." The Hebrew word *ratsatch* however actually<br>means "murder."<br><br>There are plenty of examples of killing in the Bible. God even does it.<br>Heck, he killed the whole world once, except for some people and animals<br>in a big boat.<br><br>God commands us not to murder, which means killing without<br>justification.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>God commands us not to kill, does that include insects and animals? Or<br>just people?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
