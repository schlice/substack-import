You can<br>even tell other people to go break the law. You can tell people to steal<br>and take bribes. That's all protected First Amendment speech.<br><br>Specifically, answering your question, saying corruption is fine and<br>calling upon public officials to steal and take bribes is not criminal<br><br>What you *cannot* do is incite violence, which is speech which is<br>reasonably expected to produce imminent, lawless action.<br>Criminal incitement refers to conduct, words, or other means that **urge<br>or naturally lead others to riot, violence, or insurrection**.<br><br>The law draws a clear distinction between *advocacy* and *incitement*.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer**:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
