<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The problem we face here is that regardless of your gender identity,<br>*your genes don\'t lie*.<br><br>Therefore, while *gender identity* is a construct of a conscious mind, a<br>*gender* is a physiological construct that no surgery can ever alter. If<br>you were born a woman, you will always have two X chromosomes.<br><br>Gender, therefore, is not something you can \"abolish,\" legal or<br>otherwise. It will always exist. And regardless of your gender identity,<br>the male and female of the species are required to procreate. Therefore,<br>at some level, we *must* maintain gender if we are to survive as a<br>species.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
