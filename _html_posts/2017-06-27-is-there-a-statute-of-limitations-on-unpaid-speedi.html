<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Your use of the term "statute of limitations" is incorrect. A statute of<br>limitations limits the amount of time an agency has to charge you with<br>an offense.<br><br>There is no "statute of limitations" on unpaid speeding tickets. There<br>is a point (again, varies by state) at which if you fail to pay, you can<br>no longer pay and you are required to go to court. If you fail to go to<br>court, a bench warrant is issued for your arrest.<br><br>In Colorado, the bench warrant is also delivered to the DMV, who sends<br>you a nastygram telling you you have an Outstanding Judgement Warrant<br>(OJW) open against you and how to address it. If you fail to do so,<br>usually within 30 days, your license is automatically suspended.<br><br>If you are subsequently stopped, you can be arrested for driving on a<br>suspended license, have to pay fines, and probably have your license<br>suspended further (usually an additional year).<br><br>Also, license suspensions are communicated between states using the<br>National Driver Registry, but whether or not the particular department<br>that stops you has instant access to that data depends on how connected<br>their systems are. Most large cities and state agencies will have that<br>information available in-car to the officer when he scans your license.<br>Smaller jurisdictions may only have that lookup capability with the<br>dispatcher, or not have instant access to it at all.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
