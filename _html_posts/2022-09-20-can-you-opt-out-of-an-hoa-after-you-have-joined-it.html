<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Depends on the type of HOA.<br><br>If it came with the house (i.e. it's tied to the deed), then it's a<br>*mandatory* HOA. You can't leave it by any means, other than:<br><br>- selling your house, or<br>- dissolving the HOA (which is difficult, time-consuming, and not-free)<br><br>If you joined it after you moved in, it's a *voluntary* HOA, and you can<br>leave following whatever procedure the HOA has established for people to<br>cancel their membership.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can you ever leave an HOA once you\'re in?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
