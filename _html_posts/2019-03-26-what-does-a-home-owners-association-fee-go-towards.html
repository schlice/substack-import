<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What does a home owners association fee go towards?<br><br>It is different in every association.<br><br>For example, in our neighborhood, the HOA does not own the roads, so we<br>don't pay for road repair. We do pay for common area maintenance<br>(mowing, re-planting, snow removal, etc). We pay to water our common<br>areas (one of our largest expenses). We pay for general liability<br>insurance on those common areas.<br><br>We also negotiated trash service in our neighborhood. This allows the<br>trash trucks to come on only one day, keeping the streets freer from<br>truck traffic, and making the neighborhood neater. We rolled those fees<br>into our HOA dues.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
