<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Several things will happen:<br><br>1.  Nothing of any importance will pass Congress. The House will send<br>    bills to the Senate, and the Senate will ignore them.<br>    1.  In concert, the President will have a great deal of cause to<br>        harangle Congress for not "getting anything done."<br>2.  The House will, most likely, impeach the President. The Senate won't<br>    remove him from office. If Clinton can lie to Congress and not be<br>    removed from office, Trump won't be removed from office for<br>    "obstruction of justice" which legally can't be a crime that he can<br>    commit.\*<br><br>These two are pretty solid predictions. Remember that the House only<br>needs a simple majority to impeach, but the Senate needs 2/3 to remove<br>from office.<br><br>\* Obstruction of justice is a crime. The President is in charge of the<br>Executive branch, and is therefore responsible for personnel actions.<br>Therefore, even if he maliciously fired Comey with the specific<br>intent to stop the investigation into himself (which it can be argued<br>that he did not), he cannot be convicted of obstruction of justice for<br>performing a Constitutionally-authorized job function. That said, he can<br>still be impeached for obstruction of justice, since impeachment is a<br>political function, not a legal one.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
