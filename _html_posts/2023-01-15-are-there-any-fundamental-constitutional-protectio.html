<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Of course! It's the same Constitutional protection that protects anyone<br>from double jeopardy:<br><br>> No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous<br>> crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except<br>> in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when<br>> in actual service in time of War or public danger; **nor shall any<br>> person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of<br>> life or limb**; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a<br>> witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or<br>> property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be<br>> taken for public use, without just compensation. --- 5th Amendment, US<br>> Constitution<br><br>The bolded section in the 5th Amendment is the protection against double<br>jeopardy. In a criminal trial, jeopardy attaches when the jury is<br>impaneled. In a civil trial, jeopardy attaches once the first witness is<br>called.<br><br>Once jeopardy attaches, unless the case does not conclude, the<br>government cannot appeal or re-try the defendant.<br><br>Conditions which constitute "concluding" the case:<br><br>- After the entry of an acquittal, whether:<br>  - a directed verdict before the case is submitted to the jury,<br>  - a directed verdict after a deadlocked jury,<br>  - an appellate reversal for sufficiency (except by direct appeal to a<br>    higher appellate court), or<br>  - an \"implied acquittal\" via conviction of a lesser included offence<br>- re-litigating against the same defence a fact necessarily found by the<br>  jury in a prior acquittal, even if the jury hung on other counts. In<br>  such a situation, the government is barred by collateral<br>  estoppel.\[1\](#YLspn){#cite-YLspn .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-YLspn){.citation_index} [[Double jeopardy -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0775c4&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_jeopardy%23United_States){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
