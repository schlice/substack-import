<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is a disabled person required to disclose their disability in public<br>or place of business to be exempt from mask mandates?**<br><br>Short answer: yes, in limited circumstances.<br><br>Longer answer: For businesses and government agencies dealing with<br>disabled persons who cannot wear masks, this means allowing for a<br>*modification* to the mask policy to accommodate the disabled<br>person. Depending on the specific disability, this might mean:<br><br>- allowing a person to wear a scarf, loose face covering, or full face<br>  shield instead of a face mask<br>- allowing customers to order online with curbside pick-up or no contact<br>  delivery<br>- allowing customers to order by phone with curb-side pick-up or no<br>  contact delivery<br>- allowing a person to wait in a car for an appointment and enter the<br>  building when called or texted, or<br>- offering appointments by telephone or video calls.<br><br>There are also reasons why a business would not be able to modify their<br>policies:<br><br>- If the modification fundamentally altered the original service. In<br>  other words, if the change to accommodate the disabled individual is<br>  so severe that the original program, service, or activity is no longer<br>  the same<br>- If the modification would pose an undue financial or administrative<br>  burden on the business or agency<br>- If the modification posed a direct threat to the health or safety of<br>  others. Note that this must be a direct threat, not the potential of a<br>  threat. In other words, if the person who could not wear a mask was<br>  confirmed to be COVID-19 positive, this would be a direct threat,<br>  whereas the simple fact that they could not wear a mask without the<br>  positive COVID-19 diagnosis would not be a direct threat.<br><br>The DOJ says that there are three possible ways for a business to<br>address an identified disability which requires the business to change<br>its policy:<br><br>> 1.  Agree to the request.<br>> 2.  Ask for medical documentation about the person's disability that<br>>     is necessary to:<br>>     1.  Verify that the individual meets the ADA definition of<br>>         disability (i.e., has a physical or mental impairment that<br>>         substantially limits one or more major life activities); or<br>>     2.  Describe the needed modification; or<br>>     3.  Show the relationship between the individual\'s disability and<br>>         the need for the requested modification.\<br>>         \<br>>         It is important to remember that **if a person's disability is<br>>         obvious, information about the disability should not be<br>>         requested** unless it is necessary to evaluate the<br>>         disability-related need for the modification. In most cases,<br>>         an individual\'s medical records or detailed information about<br>>         the nature of an individual\'s disability are not necessary<br>>         for this inquiry.<br>> 3.  Deny the request. If a request for modification is denied, a state<br>>     or local government agency must provide a written statement as to<br>>     why the request was denied. Private businesses are also encouraged<br>>     to document the reason for denying a request for reasonable<br>>     modification, provide a copy to the person with a disability, and<br>>     keep a copy on file.\[1\](#aTeaG){#cite-aTeaG .citation_link}<br><br>So as you can see, only if a business needs to understand the disability<br>better so that they can show the relationship between the individual's<br>disability and the need for the requested modification will they<br>actually ask for information about the disability, and only while<br>attempting to provide an accommodation for that disability.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-aTeaG){.citation_index} [[The ADA and Face Mask<br>Policies](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6d8e21&url=https://www.adasoutheast.org/ada/publications/legal/ada-and-face-mask-policies.php){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="adasoutheast.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
