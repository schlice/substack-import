<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>"Bible literalists" (by whom I assume you mean Christians) believe that<br>the Bible never contradicts itself. So by the very nature of your<br>question, the answer must be no, Bible literalists do not believe<br>that there are any contradictions between the stories in Genesis 1 and<br>Genesis 2. They simply believe that the two chapters do not disagree as<br>to the order in which things were created and therefore do not<br>contradict one another. Genesis 1 describes the "six days of creation"<br>(and a seventh day of rest); Genesis 2 covers only one day of that<br>creation week---the sixth day---and so there is no contradiction.<br><br>People who believe that the Bible is telling two different creation<br>stories are, by definition, not Bible literalists, and also, by<br>definition, are not Christian. So all the people who told you "yes,<br>there are contradictions" believe the following:<br><br>- The Bible can contain contradictions, which Christians do not believe,<br>  and<br>- Genesis tells the story of two different creation events, which<br>  Christians also do not believe.<br><br>Cue the non-Christians to be very un-Christianlike in the comments and<br>mansplain (womansplain? personsplain?) why they're actually Christian<br>and why Genesis actually tells two different stories and complain that<br>I'm calling them names and hurting their feelings.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
