I believe my service animal was illegally evicted from my<br>home. What can I do to get him back home? Can I appeal their vote?**<br><br>Most of the answers have touched on the first part of your question:<br>since Board members are residents too, they can indeed vote on matters<br>that they are personally involved in.<br><br>The second part of your question pertains to service animals. While most<br>answerers are discussing ADA, it doesn't really apply when it comes to<br>housing.<br><br>The actual authority is in the Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA). It<br>carries roughly the same weight as ADA, but some different<br>responsibilities.<br><br>- Landlords can ask to see proof that a service animal is trained before<br>  providing protected benefits.<br>- Landlords can ask to see proof of a qualifying disability and proof<br>  that a service animal is warranted before allowing a service animal in<br>  a unit or neighborhood which has animal or breed restrictions.<br>- Reasonable accommodations to a tenant could not impose an undue<br>  financial burden or require a fundamental alteration to underlying<br>  function.<br><br>Notify your HOA that your service animal was unfairly denied under Fair<br>Housing Act laws, and that you will be pursuing legal action if they do<br>not immediately reverse course and allow your animal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
