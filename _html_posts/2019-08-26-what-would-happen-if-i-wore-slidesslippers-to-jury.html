Would I be fined?**<br><br>As with all legal questions (including the ones about jury duty), the<br>answer is "it depends."<br><br>If your goal in wearing slides or slippers to jury duty was simply to be<br>comfortable, and your court does not have a dress code which requires a<br>certain category of footwear, the judge will probably allow you to stay<br>in the jury pool with your slides on.<br><br>If your court does have a dress code and you violated it, you would be<br>subject to whatever penalty the dress code has attached to it.<br><br>If your goal in wearing slides is to get yourself out of jury duty, it<br>won't work. Because you're not the first rocket scientist to have<br>thought of such a ploy. In other words, judges have seen worse. And the<br>judge will impose a penalty on you for thinking you can inappropriately<br>dress your way out of jury duty. And those penalties can be many,<br>varied, and usually worse than actually attending jury duty like you<br>were ordered to.<br><br>[[Paul Dezso deHolczer\'s answer to Could I get out of jury duty by<br>wearing a clown suit to the jury<br>selection?](https://www.quora.com/Could-I-get-out-of-jury-duty-by-wearing-a-clown-suit-to-the-jury-selection/answer/Paul-Dezso-deHolczer)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Pro Tip: If you're called to jury duty, just go. Yes, it sucks. No<br>one likes it. But if you want to have twelve of your peers judging you<br>fairly if you ever find yourself at the defendant's table, then you have<br>to step up to the plate and be that peer judging someone else fairly<br>when you are called.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
