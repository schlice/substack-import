<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Zero.<br><br>No one who actually has MS has been cured of their MS.<br><br>This shouldn't be a controversial position. We don't know what causes<br>MS, so we don't have a cure for MS.<br><br>Some people *claim* that they have a cure for MS. But to date, every<br>cure someone believes they have has been shown to not work for everyone<br>with MS.<br><br>Therefore, *it's not a cure.*<br><br>There isn't a diet that cures MS yet. There isn't a treatment that cures<br>MS yet. There isn't a drug that cures MS yet.<br><br>Said another way, if you "had MS," and you did something (a drug, a<br>supplement, a treatment, a diet, etc) and it "cured your MS," you didn't<br>have MS. Period, full stop. You may have had a disease that mimicked MS<br>(lesions on an MRI and all), but it wasn't MS.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional medical advice.
