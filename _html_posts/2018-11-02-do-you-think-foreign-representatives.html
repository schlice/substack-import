<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you think foreign representatives\' spending money at the Trump<br>International Hotel is a violation of the U.S. Constitution\'s<br>emoluments clause?**<br><br>The Emoluments Clause, from Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution:<br><br>> No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no<br>> Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall,<br>> without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument,<br>> Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or<br>> foreign State.<br><br>The idea was that the Clause was to be a very broad catch-all to prevent<br>the government from being influenced by foreign powers.<br><br>Trump has often been criticized because he did not place his assets,<br>like Trump Tower and Mar-a-Lago, into a "blind trust," but instead<br>placed them into a "revocable trust."<br><br>The problem with Trump is that his assets are tied to his name. Even in<br>a blind trust, he can't "unknow" the fact that his blind trust contains<br>Trump Tower. His properties have value because of the Trump name.<br>Granted, they still have value on their own, but a significant portion<br>of the value rests on the Trump name.<br><br>This presents a problem. Regardless of the type of trust, Trump can't<br>"unknow" the fact that Trump Tower is in a trust, and he could<br>potentially make public policy decisions based on the fact that someone<br>spent money at Trump Tower.<br><br>But you asked very specifically if foreign representatives, spending<br>money at Trump Hotel, is a violation of the clause. The specific answer<br>is no, this alone does not constitute a violation. Now, if Trump<br>changed foreign policy *specifically because* a foreign representative<br>spent money at Trump Hotel, that would be a clear violation of the<br>Clause. But simply because a foreign representative spends money at a<br>business with your name on it does not, by itself, constitute a<br>violation of Emoluments.<br><br>One potential source of a conflict: one of Trump's properties has<br>outstanding loans from the Bank of China, which is majority owned by the<br>State. If the Bank of China were to ever change the conditions on any of<br>Trump's outstanding loans, the White House ethics lawyers and others<br>would scrutinize the deal closely, to make sure that the change wasn't a<br>"gift." Trump has been notoriously hard on China, especially regarding<br>their theft of intellectual property. Even this action might look like<br>he was trying to exert pressure on China in an effort to get a better<br>deal on his loans. This isn't a problem that you solve simply by turning<br>over control of your businesses to someone else.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
