<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it illegal for two minors to be nude over FaceTime?<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>The short answer is that yes, the act is illegal. However, while<br>illegal, whether or not the state will prosecute the two juveniles<br>varies greatly.<br><br>The question of whether or not two nude minors on FaceTime is legal<br>comes down to several legal definitions, but one of which is the<br>definition of "possession of child pornography," and nude images of<br>underage people is considered child pornography. Since you said that<br>both people are minors and you're on FaceTime, that means you're both<br>sending and receiving pictures at the same time, which means that<br>technically, you are both in possession of child pornography, and<br>distributing child pornography.<br><br>The question remains, "Will the state prosecute two consenting minors?"<br>From an optics perspective, most states simply will not prosecute two<br>minors as adults and won't charge them with any of those child<br>pornography statutes which would normally be charged if one of the<br>participants was an adult. In most states, both children would be<br>Youthful Offenders and would be disciplined under the juvenile justice<br>system. Punishments under the juvenile justice system include probation,<br>community service, youth court, youth incarceration and alternative<br>schooling.<br><br>Some states are not so lenient. Recent court cases in Utah have shown<br>that youth are charged as adults in sex cases, so it is not unheard of<br>that states will prosecute youth as adults, and will seek to prosecute<br>both participants in some cases.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
