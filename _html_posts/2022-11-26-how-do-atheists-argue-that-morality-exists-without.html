<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Oh, that's easy. They're simply on the other side of the *nature vs.<br>nurture* argument.<br><br>Christians argue that morality is programmed in to our DNA by God,<br>because the Moral Law is one of the proofs of God's existence (along<br>with the Cosmological and the Teleological Arguments). It goes like<br>this:<br><br>1.  Every law has a law giver.<br>2.  Moral Law exists.<br>3.  Therefore, there is a Moral Law Giver.<br><br>Atheists believe that there is a moral law. There is really no denying<br>the fact that a moral law exists, and there are many ways to prove it.<br>They simply claim, in a variety of ways, that the "Moral Law Giver" is<br>the universe, and the moral law "evolved because morality is good for<br>community" or is simply something we learn as youth in our homes.<br><br>Their arguments, as usual, confuse the *knowledge* of the moral law and<br>how we gain that knowledge, to the *existence* of an absolute Moral Law.<br>Just because we may gain knowledge of the moral law through social norms<br>and upbringing does not mean that there is no objective Moral Law<br>outside of ourselves.<br><br>They claim that these "cooperative" moral laws helped us to survive. But<br>this claim makes some basic assumptions, such as the fact that<br>"survival" is an end of evolution, which by their own definition, is<br>incorrect because evolution has no end because it is a non-intelligent<br>process. And even if we grant that survival is the end goal of<br>evolution, atheists still can't explain why people willingly engage in<br>self-destructive behavior (smoking, drinking, drugs, suicide, etc). Nor<br>can they explain why people sometimes override their own survival<br>instincts to save others, even to the point of their own deaths. We all<br>know that there are nobler ends than mere survival. Parents sacrifice<br>for their children. Soldiers sacrifice for the nation. And if<br>Christianity is true, Christ sacrificed His life for us; God sacrificed<br>His son for us.<br><br>The big problem the atheists have in explaining this: they can't explain<br>why people *should* follow some biologically-derived "morality." If<br>humans sometimes override their "survival instinct" and place themselves<br>in harms way to save others, why shouldn't they override their<br>"cooperative" instinct to benefit themselves or elongate their life? If<br>there is nothing beyond this world, why *shouldn't* I murder, rape, rob<br>and steal to get what I want to benefit my own survival? If I can<br>survive longer without "cooperating," then why wouldn't I? Why would I<br>harm the means to my own survival by helping others, when the powerful<br>survive longer by exploiting the weaker? History is littered with<br>examples of people who have done just this, and have survived longer. In<br>fact, it's the very definition of "survival of the fittest."<br><br>But the biggest problem for the atheists is that if morality is evolved,<br>then there is no higher standard beyond ourselves. We are<br>self-referential, because there is nothing beyond us to instill us with<br>objective morality. By the way, Hitler used this justification for the<br>Holocaust. From his book, *Mein Kampf*:<br><br>> If Nature does not wish that weaker individuals should mate with the<br>> stronger, she wishes even less that a superior race should intermingle<br>> with an inferior one; because in such a case all her efforts,<br>> throughout hundreds of thousands of years, to establish an<br>> evolutionary higher stage of being, may thus be rendered futile.<br>><br>> But such a preservation goes hand in hand with the inexorable law that<br>> it is the strongest and the best who must triumph and that they have<br>> the right to endure. He who would live must fight. He who does not<br>> wish to fight in this world, where permanent struggle is the law of<br>> life, has not the right to exist.<br><br>Ideas have consequences.<br><br>So if there truly is a higher moral law that is imprinted on our very<br>being, it must have been given by a higher authority than ourselves.<br>Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that there exists a Moral Law<br>Giver.<br><br>I don't have enough faith to believe that somehow morals evolved, and we<br>are somehow bound to moral law that is somehow higher than ourselves.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How do atheists argue that morality exists without the existence of a<br>higher being?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
