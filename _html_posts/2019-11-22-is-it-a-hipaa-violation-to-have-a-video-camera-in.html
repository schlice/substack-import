<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it a HIPAA violation to have a video camera in a private treatment<br>room? There are video cameras in every private room and the main gyms.<br>This is a physical, speech, & occupational therapist office.**<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>First of all, there are certain areas known as "common sense private<br>areas" where cameras can never be installed. These include areas like<br>locker rooms, bathrooms, changing rooms, and any other area where people<br>have a reasonable expectation of privacy.<br><br>Medical facilities need to understand that video cameras *may* be<br>permitted, so long as doctors get permission to record their patients,<br>patients have the option to "opt-out" of recording, and any recording is<br>treated exactly as any other protected health information (PHI) that the<br>doctor's office maintains. Basically, any video/audio recordings inside<br>private rooms must be disclosed, the patient must "opt-in" to such<br>recordings, and if they do, the recordings must be treated like any<br>other PHI that the doctor's office maintains. The patient must be given<br>the opportunity to review any recordings and request corrections. All<br>HIPAA rules must be followed when dealing with video, just like with<br>other protected medical records.<br><br>There may also be state law which governs whether or not cameras can be<br>installed in private offices, and those vary by state.<br><br>Even the cameras in the main gyms may record PHI, so the recordings must<br>be treated similarly regardless of where they are. If there is a chance<br>that they could record PHI, HIPAA rules apply to the recordings.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
