<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, that's logic.<br><br>- You do have the right to travel freely and unencumbered.<br>- You must have a driver's license to drive a car.<br><br>Those two statements do not contradict each other.<br><br>Why not? If I have the right to travel freely and unencumbered, then no<br>one can tell me whether or not I can drive a car, right?<br><br>Not exactly. You indeed can travel freely and unencumbered. You can move<br>freely from state to state, and no one will ever ask for a travel visa.<br>No one will demand to see your "papers" when you leave one state and<br>enter another. You never need an appointment to leave a state and enter<br>another state.<br><br>But how, pray tell, do you get to this new state? Any way you choose!<br>You can walk. You can ride in a bus. You can ride in a car. You can ride<br>in a plane. You can ride a bicycle.<br><br>But while you can *ride* in a car, being the operator of a motor vehicle<br>on a state-owned road requires that you have training and insurance. The<br>Supreme Court has said many times that the state has the right to<br>require you to have a driver's license, as part of its police powers and<br>its ability to make law and enforce them. Laws which require you to have<br>a license in no way limit your ability to travel freely and<br>unencumbered. They only limit your ability to operate a motor<br>vehicle, not to be a passenger in one. Again, *this does not limit<br>your rights in any way,* and it permits the state to maintain a safe<br>environment for all of its residents, which is a compelling state<br>interest.<br><br>And by the way, spouting off sovereign citizen crap to cops is the<br>easiest way to get them to completely shut down and treat you by the<br>book.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I got stopped by a cop who asked me why I was driving on a suspended<br>license and I told him because I had the right to travel freely and<br>unencumbered and he replied, \"that\'s nonsense\". Is that treason?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
