<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sure it is! Of course, it's only more plausible if you're trying to find<br>a *natural* explanation for a *supernatural* event.<br><br>Nevertheless, the truth is that Jesus was born of a virgin through a<br>*supernatural* event. "Supernatural" literally means "beyond the<br>natural." That means that it is something which *cannot* be<br>explained using natural means.<br><br>So if you're trying to explain a *supernatural* event using<br>*natural* means, you might end up missing the significance of what<br>happened.<br><br>So why is being born of a virgin important?<br><br>Because sin is passed down from generation to generation through the<br>*male.*<br><br>> Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death<br>> through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned ---<br>> Romans 5:12 ESV<br><br>But when Jesus was conceived, it was without a man. Therefore, Jesus<br>was born without original sin. He lived His entire life without sin.<br>Thus, he was able to take on the sin of the world and redeem humanity.<br>He was able to do this *because* He was sinless. He is the only person<br>who could do it.<br><br>Thus, Jesus *not* being conceived by a man was the linchpin in His<br>ability to take on the sins of the world.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
