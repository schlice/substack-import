<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the likelihood that Rove \sic\ v. Wade will be overturned by<br>the US Supreme Court once Brett Kavanaugh becomes the newest Justice?**<br><br>Extremely unlikely.<br><br>Two things to remember:<br><br>1.  Remember, the Supreme Court has to have a case to hear before a<br>    precedent can be changed. And this court does not like to change<br>    precedents. Kavanaugh can't decide, on his own, to simply overturn a<br>    previous decision. The Supreme Court doesn't work that way.<br>2.  *Even if* the court overturned *Roe v. Wade* (which I already<br>    said is extremely unlikely), **that does not make abortion<br>    illegal.** That would simply mean that abortion is not a<br>    Constitutionally-protected right. The issue would revert to state<br>    control, because if it's not a Constitutionally-protected right,<br>    states can decide for themselves whether or not they want to make<br>    abortion illegal in their state. And at that point, some states<br>    (maybe like Texas or North Carolina) would outlaw elective<br>    abortions, while other states (like New York or California) would<br>    keep everything as it is. The voters in each state would get to<br>    decide whether or not they would have elective abortions in their<br>    state, and how that would work.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
