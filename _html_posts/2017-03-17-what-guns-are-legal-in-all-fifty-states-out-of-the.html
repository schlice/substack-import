<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's not so much the gun as it is the state that you're in which<br>matters. There is no gun that is simply universally accepted in every<br>state without any hassle.<br><br>It's up to the gun owner to know the laws of the state into which they<br>are entering and to be prepared to have their weapons confiscated until<br>such time as they get themselves properly registered in that state. In<br>many states, only state residents may register weapons. Guests are often<br>not allowed to register weapons (where weapon registry is mandated by<br>the state), and the process to get registered (if you're even allowed to<br>do it as a non-resident) may take longer than the amount of time you're<br>going to be in the state.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
