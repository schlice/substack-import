<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The short answer is no, not any girl will marry you.\<br>\<br>The longer answer is what everyone has said so far: only the *right*<br>girl will marry you.\<br>\<br>She has to be ready to be a caregiver as well as a wife. She<br>will have to understand that down the road you may need a wheelchair or<br>a cane. While it\'s not likely, the possibility exists that you could<br>end up bedridden. It is a very low likelihood, but it is a likelihood<br>nonetheless. She has to fully understand that.\<br>\<br>And her love for you has to overcome that.\<br>\<br>When you marry, the minister usually says something along the lines that<br>you marry \"for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health.\" That<br>means she loves you for *you*, and not because you have a disease or<br>because you don\'t.\<br>\<br>Does that mean you\'ll never be married? Not at all. It means that the<br>girl who marries you does so because she truly loves you, disease and<br>all.\<br>\<br>I think, in truth, this puts you in a *better* position than anyone<br>else who gets married today. Girls may not fully understand this vow<br>before they take it, and then when something catastrophic happens down<br>the road, she ends up leaving because she never thought she\'d be poor,<br>or be a caregiver. But that vow says \"for richer or poorer, in sickness<br>and in health\" so how didn\'t she know that? But who can truly know the<br>heart of a person, for the heart is concealed by the mouth and the<br>brain. She may never fully disclose what she truly feels until it\'s far<br>too late. We do marriage counseling before marriages so we can try to<br>get that point across: your love must overcome any obstacle.\<br>\<br>The woman (I want to get away from the term girl because woman implies a<br>level of maturity) who marries you will do so *knowing* that you have a<br>lifelong disease, and *knowing* that you may end up in a wheelchair (or<br>worse) some day. Knowing all of these things beforehand, she marries you<br>anyway. *That\'s* a woman who deserves you, and who will love you no<br>matter what may happen to you down the road, because she *chooses*<br>to take that journey with you, regardless of what it ends up looking<br>like.\<br>\<br>I am reminded of the Bible, when Jesus appeared to the apostles after<br>his death and resurrection. Thomas heard the apostles talking about<br>Jesus\' appearance (he wasn\'t there initially), and he did not believe<br>that Jesus actually rose from the dead. He said, "Unless I see the nail<br>marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my<br>hand into his side, I will not believe" (John 20:25, NIV). \"A week<br>later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them.<br>Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said,<br>"Peace be with you!" Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here; see<br>my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and<br>believe." Thomas said to him, "My Lord and my God!" Then Jesus told him,<br>"Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have<br>not seen and yet have believed." (John 20:26-29 NIV) This reminds me of<br>women who have married and have encountered hardships like MS in their<br>spouses and have stayed married because they understand why they<br>married: they married because they loved their spouse, and a disease<br>does not change that love. I know one; I\'ve been married to her for 20<br>years, and I\'ve only had MS for 8. She\'s the best thing that ever<br>happened to me, and I know she has a true heart, because any other woman<br>in her right mind would have left me long ago, but she didn\'t. Some<br>people go a whole lifetime and never find that love. That\'s not my<br>case, and I will spend the rest of my days thanking her and loving her<br>for that.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
