<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why aren\'t guns banned in the US?<br><br>Lawmakers are not allowed to ban guns in the US. The Second Amendment<br>prevents them from doing so. In a nutshell, it says that "the right of<br>the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." This means<br>that lawmakers cannot pass laws making guns illegal.<br><br>That said, they can pass laws that require background checks and permits<br>if you want to conceal a firearm. They can restrict guns in certain<br>locations, like within government buildings.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
