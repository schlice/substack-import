<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you are unable to get someone to testify, you can make a request to<br>the Clerk of the Court to issue a subpoena for that person to appear and<br>to testify.<br><br>A subpoena is a court order to testify. How the subpoena is served<br>is determined by whether the case is a Federal or State case, and also<br>whether it is a judicial or administrative subpoena.<br><br>Regardless, the subpoena is served, and the person serving the subpoena<br>files an Affidavit of Service with the court. You'll have to pay<br>administrative fees as well as travel reimbursement (where applicable).<br>The Affidavit of Service proves that, to the extent required by law, the<br>person was notified that they have been subpoenaed and must appear in<br>court to testify.<br><br>If the summoned person fails to appear, the judge can issue a bench<br>warrant for their arrest.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
