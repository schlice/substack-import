<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My husband keeps recording me with his cell phone at home. The police<br>told him that is harassment and he has to stop. How do I make him<br>stop?**<br><br>This is a tough situation to advise on, because this is your husband.<br>Granted, he has no right to harass you just because he is married, but<br>COVID-19 has really shined a light on this problem. People are forced to<br>be home with each other more than ever, people are losing jobs, and<br>parents get no breaks from their children. These factors have caused a<br>spike in violence against women and children since the pandemic started.<br><br>All hope is not lost, however.<br><br>The first thing we *must* say is that if the harassment ever seems<br>like it is going to escalate into imminent violence, *call 911<br>immediately* (or your local emergency number outside the US). Do not<br>wait, call.<br><br>If the harassment continues, the Family Law divisions of your county<br>court will typically be staffed with people who specifically deal with<br>domestic violence matters. These people can help you file a domestic<br>violence complaint (if it is warranted) and explain the legal<br>protections available to you. Check your local government listings to<br>find the number of your Family Law division of your county court.<br><br>If the court is closed, if COVID is preventing the court from<br>responding, or if the issue may devolve into imminent violence, ***call<br>911***. Police are also trained with assisting in potential domestic<br>violence situations.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
