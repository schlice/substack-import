<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What do people use to deter burglars?<br><br>Defense in depth.<br><br>There's an old story about two hunters in Africa accidentally stumbling<br>into a den of lions. As the lionesses started stirring to go collect<br>their newly-presented dinner, one of the hunters knelt down, took off<br>his backpack, and retrieved a pair of running shoes.<br><br>The other hunter said, "What are you doing? You can't outrun a *lion*!"<br><br>The first hunter replied, "I don't need to outrun a lion. I only need to<br>outrun you."<br><br>Home security is much the same. You don't have to make your home a<br>fortress against burglars. You just have to make it less attractive than<br>your neighbor's house.<br><br>So how do you do that? Defense in depth. Starting from the outside and<br>moving in:<br><br>- Lights. Burglars love dark areas where they can take their time to<br>  work on the outside of your house without being seen. LED light bulbs<br>  use very little electricity, and put them on a dusk-to-dawn timer and<br>  you'll never have to worry about the exterior of your house being dark<br>  again.<br>- Shrubs underneath windows. Shrubs should never obstruct windows, for<br>  the same reason as lights: burglars could break in without being<br>  easily seen. Clear those away.<br>- Have good locks on your doors.<br>- Get a dog. Burglars are less likely to break in to your house if they<br>  hear a dog barking.<br>- Get an alarm system.
