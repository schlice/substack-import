<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Aircraft APUs use a bypass air intake to get their inlet air. Since the<br>APU is usually located in the tail, the intake is going to be ahead of<br>that somewhere. It is different for each model of aircraft. For example,<br>on the Boeing 777, the air intake uses a scoop which opens upwards, on<br>top of the tail. On the Airbus A330, it is a scoop on the underside of<br>the tail. On the old Boeing 727, the intake was actually inside the<br>wheel well.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
