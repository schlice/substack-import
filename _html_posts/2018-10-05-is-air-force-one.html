<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is Air Force One's cockpit door locked during flight?<br><br>Unless something has changed significantly, Air Force One's cockpit door<br>is locked just the same as every other cockpit door on every other Air<br>Force transport aircraft. The door remains closed and locked in flight,<br>unless the flight crew is entering or exiting the cockpit. While the<br>flight crew can come out of the cockpit, they can only go so far as the<br>forward galley or the lav. Secret Service makes sure of that.<br><br>Primarily this is because, as a general practice, the flight crew does<br>not have the requisite clearance to interact directly with the<br>President.<br><br>If the President chooses to poke his head into the cockpit, that's his<br>choice, and Secret Service must adapt accordingly. But the flight crew<br>may not enter any of the areas where the President or his staff are<br>located.<br><br>To be fair, I flew on Air Force Two in the 90s, so like I said,<br>something may have changed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
