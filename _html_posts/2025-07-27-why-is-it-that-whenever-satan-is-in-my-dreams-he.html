<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think the answer to your dream question is pretty obvious. I\'ll leave<br>it at that.<br><br>But as for following a *religion*? Don\'t do that. Don\'t follow a<br>religion. Religions were responsible for the Inquisition and the<br>Crusades. Religions have been responsible for death and destruction.<br>Don\'t follow a religion.<br><br>Follow Jesus.<br><br>Jesus said, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to<br>the Father except through me." I\'m going to follow that.<br><br>Jesus is the one who had over 300 prophesies fulfilled in his lifetime,<br>things that were written hundreds of years before His birth. How did<br>they know he was going to die by crucifixion when that form of torture<br>wasn\'t even invented then? That guy must be the Son of God. I\'m going<br>to follow that.<br><br>Jesus predicted, *and then accomplished,* His own resurrection. And He<br>claimed to be God. After His resurrection, hundreds of people saw him<br>alive and testified to seeing Him. The Romans captured them and tortured<br>them, some to death, for maintaining that belief, when all they would<br>have had to do was to recant their stories and they could have spared<br>themselves the torture, but they did not. That\'s how much faith they<br>put in Jesus.<br><br>With bona fides like that, oh you bet I\'m going to follow that.<br><br>Do not follow religion. Religions were made by men. Do not put your<br>faith in religion. It cannot save you.<br><br>Follow Jesus. Jesus is God. Faith in Jesus will save you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
