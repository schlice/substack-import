<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How can I hide my device information on a public WiFi?<br><br>I'm going to assume by "device information" you mean your hardware specs<br>and your MAC address.<br><br>In most standard Android and iOS builds, you can't change your hardware<br>identifiers, and you can't spoof your MAC address. Under normal<br>circumstances, you must "jailbreak" or "root" your device and install<br>special software that allows you to "tweak" these values so that the<br>network sees them differently.<br><br>As for hiding your actual data traffic, use a VPN. VPN software is built<br>in to most devices these days, and Samsung actually has a VPN service<br>that it offers for a monthly subscription. It automatically engages when<br>you are on a public unsecured Wi-Fi.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
