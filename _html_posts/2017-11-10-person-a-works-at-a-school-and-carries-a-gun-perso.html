<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The short answer is it depends. It would have to be determined if<br>Person A was lawfully carrying a gun on school property.<br><br>Most school districts only allow armed people who are not the police in<br>the school if they are registered security guards with the district.<br><br>Some school districts allow *teachers* to volunteer to take the training<br>and become registered security guards. This allows them to legally carry<br>a gun on school property. These same teachers also have to apply and be<br>granted a concealed carry permit from the local police department. This<br>is all on their own time, with their own funds. They are not paid to<br>carry a firearm, nor are they paid to be a security guard.<br><br>Assuming this is the case (or assuming this particular school district<br>allows properly registered and armed teachers on school property),<br>Person A (who works at a school and carries a gun lawfully) would not<br>likely be charged with any crime.<br><br>In any other case, Person A would not likely be permitted to carry a<br>gun onto school grounds, *even if they have a concealed carry permit<br>from the local police or Sheriff*. If Person A shoots Person B in self<br>defense, they will probably not face any criminal charges, but they may<br>face charges for unlawfully concealing a firearm on school property.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
