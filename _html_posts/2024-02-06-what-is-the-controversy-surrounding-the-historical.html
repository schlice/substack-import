<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Old Testament stories which came from Judaism were written thousands<br>of years before Jesus was born. People argue about whether or not the<br>things in the Old Testament actually happened, like a worldwide flood.<br>But there is plenty of evidence that a worldwide flood did occur.<br>Skeptics like to poo poo on the evidence, but it is there.<br><br>The problem is that the people who poo poo all over the evidence don't<br>believe in the existence of miracles. We know miracles are real because<br>the most miraculous event of all time, the creation of the universe and<br>everything in it out of nothing, has already taken place. If you believe<br>in that miracle (and your existence should easily allow you to believe<br>it), then believing the rest of the miraculous claims of the Bible<br>should be easy.<br><br>We know that the New Testament speaks the truth because we have accurate<br>copies of the original documents that were written down in the first<br>century, and those documents speak the truth. How do we know they speak<br>the truth? We test the New Testament documents against criteria<br>historians often use to determine whether or not to believe a given<br>historical document. We'll refer to these criteria as "historical<br>tests." They include:<br><br>1.  Do we have early testimony? Generally, the earlier the sources, the<br>    more accurate is the testimony.<br>2.  Do we have eyewitness testimony? Eyewitness testimony is usually the<br>    best means of establishing what really happened.<br>3.  Do we have testimony from multiple, independent, eyewitness sources?<br>    Multiple, independent eyewitnesses confirm that the events really<br>    occurred (they are not fiction), and provide additional details that<br>    a single source might miss. (True independent sources normally tell<br>    the same basic story but with differing details. Historians<br>    sometimes call this "coherence with dissimilarity.")<br>4.  Are the eyewitnesses trustworthy? Should you believe them? Character<br>    matters.<br>5.  Do we have corroborating evidence from archaeology or other writers?<br>    This adds further confirmation.<br>6.  Do we have any enemy attestation? If opponents of the eyewitnesses<br>    admit certain facts the eyewitnesses say are true, then those facts<br>    probably are true (for example, if your mother says you are brave,<br>    that might be true; but it's probably more credible if your<br>    archenemy says the same thing).<br>7.  Does the testimony contain events or details that are embarrassing<br>    to the authors? Since most people do not like to record negative<br>    information about themselves, any testimony that makes the author<br>    look bad is probably true.<br><br>In most cases, documents that meet most or all of these historical tests<br>are considered trustworthy beyond a reasonable doubt. Unsurprisingly,<br>the New Testament passes all of these historical tests with flying<br>colors, so we know the New Testament speaks the truth.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
