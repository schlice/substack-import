<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What do you think of the judges ruling on 11/16, allowing Jim Acosta<br>to have his White House pass back, saying it was wrong for the White<br>House to revoke it?**<br><br>While I'm certain that's what you wanted the ruling to say, that's not<br>exactly what happened.<br><br>First of all, it's a temporary restraining order. That means that the<br>case has not yet been heard, so there are no "rulings" yet.<br><br>Second, it was on *5th Amendment* grounds, not 1st Amendment. The<br>judge basically agreed with CNN that Acosta was not afforded due process<br>in having his hard pass revoked, and that this was a violation of<br>Acosta's 5th Amendment right to due process. It says nothing about<br>whether or not Acosta has a 1st Amendment right to a hard pass.<br><br>Finally, he may have his hard pass back, but Sanders is under no legal<br>obligation to call on him. I hope she simply bypasses him and calls on<br>other, more mature CNN reporters until his case can be heard.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
