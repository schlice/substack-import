<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [*To start with, abortion is a highly-emotionally charged<br>issue and I don\'t want to get into my personal views about abortion.*<br>***My answer here is not an indication of my personal views about<br>abortion.*** *If you want to know my personal views about abortion (and<br>then take days to rip them apart and call me all kinds of names), ask<br>that question and then A2A me.*\<br>\<br>Anti-abortionists think it\'s wrong to terminate a pregancy caused by<br>rape because they believe that the source of the pregnancy is<br>irrelevant. They believe:\<br>]<br><br>- Life begins at conception<br>- Terminating a pregnancy is tantamount to murder<br>- No one has the right to murder an unborn baby.<br><br>They also believe that the agony of nine months of pregnancy pale in<br>comparison to the years of emotional trauma that can be inflicted on a<br>woman by an abortion. They can cite numerous studies that show that<br>abortion psychologically harms the mother, and the abortionists who<br>profit from abortions willfully cover up that fact. They believe that<br>profit is the goal over the health of the mother (to include emotional<br>and psychological health) and the government and the abortion lobby are<br>complicit in that profit goal.\<br>\<br>*In case you didn\'t read this at the beginning, this is not my personal<br>view on abortion. If you want to know my personal views about abortion<br>(and then take days to rip them apart and call me all kinds of names),<br>ask that question and then A2A me.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
