<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It is well known that around 10% of people who buy tickets to a flight<br>do not show up. Rather than flying the plane partially empty, the<br>airline oversells flights. It's also well known that profit margins are<br>thinner in the airline industry than in any other industry in America,<br>so anything that increases cost or decreases revenue is a Bad Thingâ„¢.<br><br>If you sell \*exactly\* the right number of tickets to exactly match the<br>number of seats in the plane, and 10% of the people don't show, you're<br>flying empty seats. Flying empty seats means less revenue, and when<br>revenue is tight already, anything that loses money causes trickle-down<br>decisions to be made.<br><br>For example, if a particular route costs you \$10/seat to run, but you<br>only make \$4/seat, you're losing money on that route. What can you do?<br>You can increase ticket prices (which nobody wants), you can cut out<br>some less-popular routes (which nobody wants either), or you can<br>oversell the flight and potentially inconvenience some passengers who<br>bought tickets.<br><br>The most cost-effective option is to oversell the flight.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
