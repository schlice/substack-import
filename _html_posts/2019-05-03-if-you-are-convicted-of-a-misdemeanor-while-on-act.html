<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you are convicted of a misdemeanor while on active duty how long<br>will it be before the air force will find out?**<br><br>Under normal circumstances, the Department of Justice and the Department<br>of Defense will work together on federal crimes and work out who will<br>prosecute, so when it comes to federal matters, they probably already<br>know.<br><br>If a situation arises where the military does not know about a civilian<br>conviction, it behooves the military member to get out in front of it.<br>Reporting immediately to the JAG and to the unit commander and advising<br>them of what happened is the best way to *not* have the military take<br>any adverse action. Explaining that the civilian authority handled the<br>situation and no further adverse action is needed may allow them to "let<br>it go."<br><br>Failing to report it will present an image of guilt and a perception of<br>someone who wants to "cover up" his crimes, not "own up" to them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
