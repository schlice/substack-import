<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does Donald Trump\'s interpretation of his limitless authority and<br>ability to remain outside the rule of law that apply to all of us, but<br>not to him, serve as a model for all to follow?**<br><br>As long as you follow the model precisely:<br><br>Tweet whatever the hell you want, make wild claims, etc, but once you're<br>ready to do something, listen to your advisers and don't do it.<br><br>Trump likes to talk big. He likes to tweet big. But you haven't seen him<br>deploy the military to take over the states yet and implement Trumpland<br>yet, have you? That's because when he's done bloviating all over<br>Twitter, he talks to people and listens to them, and then does the right<br>thing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
