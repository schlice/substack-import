<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the action that can be taken, if police misuse their powers to<br>get things for their use from street vendors, without paying any<br>money?**<br><br>There are only two ways in the United States that police officers in<br>uniform can get something without paying:<br><br>1.  They steal it<br>2.  The vendor gives it to them for free.<br><br>For #1, the vendor should call *other* police officers and report the<br>theft. The vendor should be careful not to identify the thief as a<br>police officer until *after* they arrive and begin their investigation.<br><br>For #2, if the vendor chooses to give the item to the police officer at<br>no charge, this is not a violation of law. The vendor is free to do as<br>he pleases with his business. However, it may be a violation of<br>department policy. For example, our department strictly forbids<br>uniformed officers from accepting anything for free. Even if it's as<br>simple and cheap (for the vendor) as a cup of coffee, the officer must<br>pay for it. That said, the vendor is free to charge any amount he<br>chooses to that officer. So if he wanted to give me a \$1 cup of coffee<br>for \$0.01, that's his choice, and as long as I pay the penny out of my<br>own pocket (and paying out of the "Have a penny, take a penny" plate<br>doesn't count), I have met the department's requirement of paying for<br>anything and everything I get.<br><br>If the vendor in this case believes that an officer coerced or<br>threatened him into giving away an item for free, the vendor should file<br>a complaint with the officer's department.<br><br>(EDIT) [[Mark<br>Hamric](https://www.quora.com/profile/Mark-Hamric)]{.qlink_container}<br>brought up another scenario (and this is actually the one I had to<br>discuss during oral boards), so we'll call it #3:<br><br>3\. Someone else pays for the item anonymously.<br><br>In this case, in my department, we would still pay the vendor and tell<br>him to pay for someone else's item with the money, or pay it forward,<br>etc. But even having someone else voluntarily and without our knowledge<br>pay for our item does not alleviate us of the responsibility for paying<br>for everything we get while in uniform.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
