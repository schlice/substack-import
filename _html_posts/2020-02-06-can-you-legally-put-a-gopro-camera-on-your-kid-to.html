<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you legally put a GoPro camera on your kid to keep track of them<br>at school and during the day?**<br><br>*Inside* of the school, you will likely run into the same issues with<br>putting a GoPro on your kid as you would with anyone taking a GoPro into<br>many areas in the school, such as locker rooms and bathrooms.<br><br>Additionally, the school has the right to control students' use of<br>electronics, as teachers legally act *in loco parentis* in most cases.<br>The school can simply claim that the camera interrupts the basic<br>operation of the school, and they can ban it or turn it off. If the<br>child refuses, they can send him home.<br><br>*Outside* of school, your kid can do whatever he likes when he's out in<br>public, including recording anything he sees. Clearly, he is bound by<br>any other recording device restriction (such as the aforementioned<br>bathrooms and locker rooms).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
