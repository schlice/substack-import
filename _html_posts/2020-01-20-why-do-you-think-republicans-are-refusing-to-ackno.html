<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why do you think Republicans are refusing to acknowledge that Trump is<br>hiding impeachment information by not letting key witnesses testify?**<br><br>Because if this were really the case, and Republicans were certain that<br>"impeachment information" was being deliberately restricted by the<br>President's invocation of executive privilege, they would have pushed<br>their Democrat counterparts in the House to take their subpoenas to the<br>courts to determine whose privilege wins: the House's impeachment<br>investigation power, or the White House's executive privilege.<br><br>The House failed to do this.<br><br>This indicates that the House Democrats did not think that the testimony<br>contained any critical "impeachment information." Clearly, they had<br>enough information from the "witnesses" they did have to proceed with<br>Articles of Impeachment, so clearly, there was nothing that the "key<br>witnesses" could have said which would have strengthened their position<br>that impeachable offenses occurred.<br><br>And to forestall the next question, the only authority under which the<br>President can restrict a government employee from testifying in front of<br>another branch of government is executive privilege. So if Trump in any<br>way convinced someone to not testify in front of Congress, the authority<br>to do so is contained in the executive privilege doctrine.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
