<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can we ban semi-automatic weapons?<br><br>It would be very challenging.<br><br>We've banned "assault weapons," which is a made-up class of weapons<br>categorized by cosmetic features. It ran for ten years (1994--2004). It<br>did nothing. It did not reduce crime. It did not reduce shootings.<br>It did not reduce mass murder. Because it was 100% ineffective at<br>doing what it aimed to do, it was allowed to expire.<br><br>I struggle to figure out (again) how banning any class of weapons (even<br>one so broad as semi-automatic weapons) will deter those who choose to<br>not follow the law.<br><br>Indeed, we've already tried to ban things in society before. Remember<br>Prohibition from your history classes? Ask yourself: did Prohibition<br>stop alcohol use? Drugs are currently banned. Do those bans stop drug<br>use?<br><br>Why should we believe that another ban will somehow work *this time*?<br><br>Finally, how do you classify a semi-automatic weapon? Semi-automatics<br>can basically be classified as a weapon which fires one shot with every<br>trigger pull and automatically reloads itself without having to move an<br>action to load the next round. This encompasses about 95% of all<br>firearms in the United States, as it encompasses almost all pistols and<br>rifles available today. Most hunting rifles have to have a bolt cycled<br>before they can shoot again, and some pistols are classified as<br>single-action only (SAO), which means that you must cock the hammer in<br>between each shot (but you can still fire rapidly if you "fan the<br>hammer" --- it's no less accurate than bump firing, since bump stocks<br>are on their way out). Nevertheless, "semi-automatic weapons"<br>encompasses a very broad range of firearms.<br><br>Additionally, what do you do about the 200+ million semi-autos out there<br>now? You can't make their ownership illegal. The Constitution forbids<br>*ex post facto* laws. You can't seize them from private homes. You can<br>do a voluntary buy-back, but even the government with its massive<br>money-printing machines doesn't have enough money to buy all those guns<br>at fair market value (also required under the Constitution). And since<br>there is no record of where these guns are, it would be really<br>challenging to get rid of them all.<br><br>I think you would have a very hard time passing a ban on all semi-autos,<br>and you'd have an even harder time enforcing it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
