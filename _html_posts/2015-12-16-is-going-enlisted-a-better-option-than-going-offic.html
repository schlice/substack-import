<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Question details:*<br>><br>> *I\'m currently a college student going for a degree in computer<br>> science. I\'ve done some research and have read that enlisted members<br>> have a better chance of getting the job they actually want and the<br>> jobs are more technical. While as officer you\'re just a \"manager\".<br>> Is this true?*<br><br>This is an interesting topic. It seems as if you break down your<br>military options based on what job you\'re going to be doing.<br><br>If that\'s the case, I\'m sorry to report that *you\'re looking at the<br>military all wrong.*<br><br>First and foremost, you are a member of the United States Armed Forces.<br>Secondary to that, you have a specialty (i.e. a job). Your job comes<br>second to the fact that you\'re wearing a uniform. And all things being<br>equal, I\'d rather be wearing officer\'s insignia than enlisted<br>insignia. And it has nothing at all to do with how I feel about officers<br>or enlisteds.<br><br>I was an officer in the Air Force. Before I got out to my first duty<br>assignment, one of the most important lessons I learned was once I got<br>to my first duty station, I should find a good, sharp senior NCO and<br>glom on to him/her. Learn everything you can from that person. At my<br>first duty station, I had several senior NCOs that I spent many hours<br>working with and learning from. They are absolutely the best people in<br>the world, and I have nothing but respect for the time and effort they<br>put into their work. But ultimately, even as a 22 year old shiny new<br>Second Lieutenant, I still outrank them. All of them. My pay scale<br>advances faster and farther than theirs ever can (just check out<br>military pay scales online; it\'s all public knowledge).<br><br>And probably one of the most important things to remember: you\'re not a<br>manager. That\'s a civilian thing. As an officer, you are much more than<br>a manager: you\'re a *commander*. That means a whole lot more than just<br>being a manager. Commanders are totally responsible for their people, on<br>duty and off. A manager ensures you get your job done; when you go home,<br>your manager has nothing to do with anything you do once you leave the<br>workplace. A commander is fully responsible for everything that his<br>people do, both on-duty and off-duty. If one of your young two-stripers<br>gets drunk downtown and arrested, you are going to go get them. You are<br>responsible to ensure that their families are taken care of, that they<br>have adequate housing, that their kids are properly enrolled in school,<br>etc. No civilian manager position can ever rise to the level of<br>responsibility you incur when you are a commander. Only a military<br>officer can be a commander.<br><br>Now that we\'ve gotten that out of the way, there\'s more opportunities<br>for enlisted people to do different jobs because *there\'s more enlisted<br>people.* Think of the military as a pyramid. The lowest ranks are at the<br>bottom, but the largest number of people are there. As you advance in<br>rank, there are fewer and fewer people in those ranks. About halfway up,<br>the officers start. Same thing, but there\'s even fewer officers. So<br>there are more \"jobs\" available to enlisteds because there are just<br>more of them. Officers still accomplish highly technical work, and some<br>scientific career fields are only open to officers. As a Crew Commander<br>in NORAD, I had to be certified on the system just as my enlisted System<br>Controllers had to be certified. I did exactly the same work they did,<br>but I was the crew commander. I was responsible for my crew. I was<br>responsible for them when they were assigned to my crew, making sure<br>they were properly settled in housing, that their families were cared<br>for, and if I made a decision that the Flight or Squadron Commander did<br>not agree with, I was responsible for that decision (by the way, as a<br>young officer, I certainly did that). I advocated on behalf of my crew<br>to senior staff. I took those experiences with me when I worked on the<br>senior staff, and used them to make life better for them in whatever<br>ways I could. Only officers can do that.<br><br>Bottom line, if you have the opportunity to become an officer, you would<br>be absolutely crazy not to take it. Finish your degree and once you have<br>your diploma in hand, head down to the military recruiter. While Officer<br>Candidate School (OCS) opportunities have been dwindling over the years,<br>they are still there. Take the opportunity.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
