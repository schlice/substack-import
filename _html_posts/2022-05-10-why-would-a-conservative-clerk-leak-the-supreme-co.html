<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, it's very very unlikely that any clerk leaked the<br>decision. Clerkships in the Supreme Court are the "feather in your cap"<br>that essentially allows you to write your own ticket. If you clerk for a<br>SCOTUS Justice, you are the best of the best. A breach of trust like<br>this will *instantly sink your career*. You will be disbarred, and<br>you'll never work in law again. Clerking at SCOTUS is a privilege that<br>the 36 people who have that job do not take lightly.<br><br>But if we were to entertain the hypothetical that a clerk leaked the<br>decision, then it is even more highly unlikely that a conservative clerk<br>did it. Chief Justice Roberts hit the nail on the head when he said that<br>the leak was most likely an attempt to increase public pressure to try<br>to get the Justices to change their votes, and that ain't happening. The<br>Court is not affected by public pressure. That's why Justices are<br>appointed for life. So if a clerk leaked it *at all*, it was most likely<br>one of the progressive clerks.<br><br>But if it was a conservative clerk, the reasoning (which is strained to<br>begin with) might be to trigger the states to enact legislation banning<br>abortion now that it will no longer be recognized as a Constitutional<br>right. This was largely unnecessary, as at least 13 states have "trigger<br>laws" which automatically go into effect should *Roe* be overturned. 10<br>other states have abortion bans already in their laws, even though those<br>laws were unenforceable. So if *Roe* is overturned, abortion will<br>automatically be illegal or restricted in 23 states.<br><br>**TL;DR: It's already highly unlikely that any of the 36 clerks leaked<br>the draft. It's even less likely that it was a conservative clerk.**<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why would a conservative clerk leak the Supreme Court decision?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
