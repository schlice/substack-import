<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there a law in your state that makes it illegal to \"threaten\" to<br>file a complaint against law enforcement?**<br><br>There is no law in my state that makes it illegal to threaten to file a<br>complaint against a law enforcement officer. There's not one in yours,<br>either.<br><br>As with all things, the devil is in the details.<br><br>The charge is not "threatening to file a complaint against law<br>enforcement." No such statute exists in any state. However, there is<br>indeed a statute in my state (and probably in yours) making<br>*intimidation of a public official* a crime. Intimidating a federal<br>official is (obviously) a Federal offense as well (Threatening a<br>government official of the United States, 18 USC ยง 871).<br><br>However, the intimidation statutes are overly broad. The statute should<br>contain an intent clause. While basically any threats made against a<br>public official in order to gain something that they could not<br>ordinarily get would meet the plain letter of the statute, threats to<br>take lawful action (i.e. filing a police report) are not "true threats."<br>In fact, the filing of the police report is a right which the public<br>has, and therefore cannot be illegal. So unless the intent was to gain a<br>result to which you would normally not be entitled to, there is no "true<br>threat."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
