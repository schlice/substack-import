<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You can refuse, but not without consequence.\<br>\<br>In some states, refusal is probable cause to detain you and force you to<br>take a blood test, or to force you to drive to the station to get a test<br>on an admissible breathalyzer. These cannot be refused.\<br>\<br>In some states, you can lose your license if you refuse.\<br>\<br>In some states, police have to get a warrant before they can take your<br>blood, but they\'re fully prepared to do that too.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
