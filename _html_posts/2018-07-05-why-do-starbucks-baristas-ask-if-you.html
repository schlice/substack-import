<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why do Starbucks baristas ask if you "want room" when I order "black<br>coffee"? Are they not taught that "black coffee" literally means, "I<br>don't need any room for cream"?**<br><br>It could be as simple as the fact that you order black coffee because<br>*you want to do your fixings yourself at the little fixing station*<br>instead of letting them do your fixings.<br><br>Additionally, when people don't ask for room and then take their black<br>coffee to the fixing bar, they will *dump coffee into the trash to make<br>room for their cream.* This makes a mess for employees to clean up, and<br>if the bag happens to have a hole, it leaks out onto the floor. You can<br>imagine what kind of mess that makes.<br><br>Isn't it better that someone ask to clarify rather than assume and get<br>it wrong?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
