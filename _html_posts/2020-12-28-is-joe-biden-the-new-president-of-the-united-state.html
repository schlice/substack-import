<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is Joe Biden the legal President or not?<br><br>Not yet. That won't happen until January 20th, when he will be sworn in<br>as President.<br><br>Today, he is what we call "President-elect." This is not an office or an<br>actual title, it's just the way we refer to him since he isn't President<br>yet, but he has been elected President. Trump continues to serve as<br>President until the swearing-in ceremony, at which time Biden becomes<br>President.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
