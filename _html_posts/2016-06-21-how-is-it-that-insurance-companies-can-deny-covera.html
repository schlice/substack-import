<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>As sad as it is, I have to agree with [[Jenny<br>Hall](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jenny-Hall-3)]{.qlink_container} on<br>this one.<br><br>When you purchase prescription drug insurance (or your company does, on<br>your behalf), the insurance company publishes a "formulary" which<br>details what drugs they cover, and what drugs perform the same function<br>or similar function but at a higher price. Drugs listed on the formulary<br>are known as "preferred" drugs. Drugs not listed on the formulary are<br>known as "non-preferred" drugs.<br><br>Additionally, insurance companies charge different amounts for generic<br>drugs vs brand-name drugs, since brand-name drugs are more expensive.<br><br>Finally, most large pharmaceutical companies also have mail order<br>divisions, and will only cover a certain number of retail pharmacy<br>prescription fills. If you have medications for chronic diseases, they<br>will usually only cover a few retail fills before they will no longer<br>cover the medication (known as a "retail refill allotment"). The good<br>news is that you can usually get a 90-day supply through the mail, and<br>you'll pay less than three 30-day supplies at your local pharmacy.<br><br>My insurance company has six different pricing models, three for mail<br>order and three for retail fills. Our retail refill allotment is 3. For<br>each, we have a price for generics, preferred brand names, and<br>non-preferred brand names.<br><br>Not all insurance companies operate like this. Many will simply not pay<br>anything for non-preferred brand name medication. The bottom line is<br>that *when you purchase the insurance, you agree to these terms.* You<br>agree to let the drug company tell your doctor that he is not being<br>fiscally responsible and trying the generic alternatives to the brand<br>name drugs first, before jumping directly to the brand name drugs.<br><br>The problem is that insurance companies are staffed by doctors who truly<br>believe that generic drugs work exactly like their brand-name<br>counterparts. Unfortunately, we who are consumers of many different<br>pharmaceuticals (brand name and generic) know that this is not always<br>the case. That never stopped the drug insurance company from following<br>that guidance anyway.<br><br>As has been noted, you can appeal the decision. Your doctor has to prove<br>that the "approved" drugs that they recommend (generally, generic<br>versions of the brand-name drugs they denied) have already been tried<br>and have been found to be ineffective for your condition. The doctor<br>will have to provide the treatment records that show you tried the<br>generics and they didn't work.<br><br>If your doctor is willing to go to bat for you, you can file an appeal<br>and in some cases the insurance company will reverse its decision.<br><br>If they do not, sometimes the drug manufacturer itself has a discount<br>plan you can use. Check their website for more information.<br>Additionally, don't forget to contact your local chapter of the [[MS<br>Society](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=207640&url=http://www.nmss.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nmss.org"}]{.qlink_container}, which has links and resources<br>for you to use to get assistance with drugs and their cost if your<br>insurance company refuses to pay. You may have state assistance programs<br>you can tap into; your local MS Society chapter can help.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
