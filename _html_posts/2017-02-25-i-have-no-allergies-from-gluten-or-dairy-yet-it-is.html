<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The three biggest irritants to the gut are wheat, eggs, and dairy.<br>Removing them removes a major source of gut irritation.<br><br>As it stands, there is a correlation (however weak) between the gut and<br>the brain. Take a look at [[this<br>paper](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f2bc9d&url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/healthy_aging/healthy_body/the-brain-gut-connection){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="hopkinsmedicine.org"}]{.qlink_container} from Johns Hopkins<br>regarding the gut brain connection. Your gut actually has a<br>"mini-brain." Scientists call this mini-brain the *enteric nervous<br>system* (ENS). But "mini" doesn't refer to its size. The ENS is two thin<br>layers of more than 100 million nerve cells lining your gastrointestinal<br>tract from esophagus to rectum.<br><br>The connection between your ENS and the CNS (your brain and spinal cord)<br>is more than skin-deep. They are made from exactly the same "germ<br>layer," which means that the stem cells which form your brain and spinal<br>cord also form the tissues in your ENS and gut.<br><br>It's also known that mood and anxiety can affect your gut, perhaps<br>playing a part in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). They also believe that<br>it works the other way round as well. Irritations in the gut can have an<br>affect on your mood.<br><br>Knowing that the two are cousins, and knowing that irritations in the<br>gut can affect the brain, it's plausible to eliminate irritations from<br>the gut in order to "soothe" the brain as well. Whether or not there is<br>a connection between the gut and dysfunction of the immune system within<br>the CNS is unknown. But reducing inflammation is a key goal of any diet<br>targeted at disease, and removing gut irritants is a great way to start<br>reducing systemic inflammation. We also know that the symptoms of MS are<br>caused by systemic inflammation. Any effort to reduce that inflammation<br>points us in the right direction to start healing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
