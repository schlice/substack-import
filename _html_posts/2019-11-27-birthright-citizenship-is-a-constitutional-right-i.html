<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Birthright citizenship is a constitutional right in the USA, what are<br>your thoughts on amending the constitution and removing birthright<br>citizenship?**<br><br>I think we should *clarify* birthright citizenship, and return it to<br>what the Framers intended it to be.<br><br>The people who wrote the 14th Amendment intended it to apply to recently<br>freed slaves, and used it as part of the way to reverse some of the<br>injustices of the *Dred Scot* ruling.<br><br>The relevant section of the 14th Amendment:<br><br>> All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to<br>> the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the<br>> State wherein they reside<br><br>The part of that phrase causing controversy is **and subject to the<br>jurisdiction thereof**.<br><br>The original authors recognized that citizens of foreign governments<br>*were not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States*, or at least<br>in the way that mattered to them. This is evident in the fact that they<br>presumed the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment was similar to<br>what we had in the Civil Rights Act of 1866, that it excludes American<br>Indians who maintain their tribal ties and \"persons born in the United<br>States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of<br>ambassadors or foreign ministers\". They all agreed that children of<br>ambassadors were not citizens, but children who were born in the United<br>States to *legal* immigrants (even if they were not citizens) were also<br>citizens.<br><br>However, the same concurrence in opinion does not address the children<br>of *illegal* immigrants. Indeed, the *Wong Kim Ark* case only addressed<br>the birth of children to people lawfully present in the United States.<br>Edward Erler argued that since the *Wong Kim Ark* case dealt with<br>someone whose parents were in the United States legally, there is no<br>valid basis under the 14th Amendment for the practice of granting<br>citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. He writes,<br>\"Even if the logic is that Wong Kim Ark became a citizen by birth with<br>the permission of the United States when it admitted his parents to the<br>country, no such permission has been given to those who enter<br>illegally.\"<br><br>Therefore, the question of whether or not legal citizenship is granted<br>to children of illegal immigrants has been handled by Immigration<br>policy. In the near term, it can be overridden with a simple Executive<br>Order. However, the broader Constitutional question of whether or not<br>the 14th Amendment conveys birthright citizenship to the children of<br>illegal immigrants has never been decided.<br><br>To that end, we should pass an Amendment which *clarifies* the<br>Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment. A brief, no-preparation draft:<br><br>> The 14th Amendment is hereby clarified to define persons "subject to<br>> the jurisdiction of the United States" as persons who have been<br>> granted permission to enter the country legally.<br><br>From here, we can debate on who among that group gets birthright<br>citizenship.<br><br>But saying that every illegal who sneaks across the border and drops a<br>kid on US soil creates a new citizen is problematic for many reasons.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
