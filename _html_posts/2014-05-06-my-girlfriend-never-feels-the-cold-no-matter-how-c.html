<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [There are lots of things that could contribute to the fact<br/>that she doesn\'t feel cold. Some of these are neurological disorders,<br/>like MS or Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome. In these cases, she may not feel<br/>the cold but she still may be cold, which could be dangerous. The<br/>feeling of cold and the physical reaction to that feeling is a defensive<br/>mechanism employed by the body to protect us against the damaging<br/>effects of cold on our extremities.\<br/>\<br/>Some of these are things to be worried about. There are others that are<br/>very very worrying, but she probably would know about that by now. For<br/>example, there is a very rare group of diseases called **hereditary<br/>sensory and autonomic neuropathy** which is a series of conditions which<br/>inhibit nerve sensations. Usually though, when one cannot feel cold<br/>because of this disease, they also can\'t feel hot, or pain.\<br/>\<br/>So usually, the causes are anything from annoying to worrying to very<br/>worrying. It will take more investigation to determine what the cause<br/>is, but she should definitely schedule a visit to the doctor to discuss<br/>it.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
