<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It is well-known that several of the recent high school and college<br>shooters idolized and tried to emulate the Columbine shooters Dylan<br>Klebold and Eric Harris. Their memoirs, Facebook posts and other social<br>media indicated their admiration for the pair\'s bravery and their<br>desire to go out just as big.<br><br>Indeed, limiting \"air time\" for the shooters, large-scale demonization<br>of actual shooters, and reduction of other mass media coverage of<br>shootings, could go a long way to showing these shooters that their \"15<br>minutes of fame\" will actually be closer to \"15 seconds.\"<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
