  of God need to be reevaluated? Are religious beliefs inherently geocentric, and

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The short answer is no, there is nothing in the Christian worldview<br>that would explicitly contradict the possibility that God created life<br>somewhere else in the universe that He created.<br><br>First, we need to keep in mind that despite decades of searching and<br>listening and examining and probing, we have found no evidence of life<br>anywhere else in the universe. Physicists call this the *Fermi Paradox*:<br>the apparent discrepancy between the lack of conclusive evidence of<br>advanced extraterrestrial life and the apparently high likelihood of its<br>existence.<br><br>In other words, if it's so easy for life to form from non-life, *where<br>is everybody?*<br><br>The truth is that it is *not* highly likely that life would form<br>anywhere. There are more than a dozen special circumstances which make<br>life on Earth (and apparently, *only* Earth) possible: our distance from<br>the sun, the existence of water and heavy metals, a moon, a magnetic<br>field, gravity (but not too much), and even the sun itself is unique.<br><br>Second, it's important to note that the Bible nowhere says that the<br>universe was created only for humans. If God had created another<br>intelligent species who loves Him, there would be nothing in the Bible<br>which would contradict that understanding. The Bible is intended to lead<br>believers into salvation through the death and resurrection of Christ,<br>not to answer the question about what God has done with the rest of the<br>universe.<br><br>Finally, the Bible *does* tell us that there are other beings in the<br>universe. And they don't always come in peace. God created angels (who,<br>like God, we also cannot see), and some of the angels fell and became<br>demons. As some Biblical scholars have posited, some "alien encounters"<br>may have actually been demonic possessions. Now, that's not to say that<br>every UFO story is a demon. But by the same token, if demons exist, then<br>it's possible that at least some of those "close encounters" stories may<br>be linked to demonic activity.<br><br>TL;DR: The Bible does not tell us specifically about aliens. But the<br>Christian worldview at least allows for the possibility of alien life.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
