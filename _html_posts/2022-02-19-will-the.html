<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First off, the Right to Treat Act was introduced by Sen. Ron Johnson<br>(R-Wis.), along with Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), and Sen. Mike Lee<br>(R-Utah). And to understand why it was introduced, you need to<br>understand how these Senators view the government\'s handling of the<br>pandemic.<br><br>Their belief was spelled out by Senator Johnson: "Because federal health<br>agencies sabotaged the early treatment of COVID-19 using widely<br>available and safe generic drugs, an untold number of people needlessly<br>died from COVID-19. Americans and doctors should have the freedom to use<br>fully approved drugs without fear of reprisal."<br><br>To that end, the Right to Treat Act would "ensure that federal health<br>agencies return to their proper functions of gathering and providing<br>public health data and regulating drug safety -- not telling doctors how<br>to practice medicine."<br><br>In practice, the Act would "reaffirm that no federal agency has the<br>authority to regulate the practice of medicine and that no federal law,<br>rule, or regulation of policy will prohibit or restrict the lawful<br>prescribing or disbursing of any FDA approved drug or Right to Try<br>drug\[1\](#DJzjK){#cite-DJzjK .citation_link}."<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-DJzjK){.citation_index} [[Sen.
