<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Well, as even you just acknowledged, we don't know exactly when Christ<br>was born, so it's really difficult to have a birthday celebration *on<br>His exact birthday* if we don't know it, and it wasn't revealed to us by<br>God.<br><br>So I suppose it's a good question: *can you still celebrate someone's<br>birthday if you don't know the exact date?*<br><br>Sure you can. But what are you celebrating? Are you celebrating the<br>exact date He was born, or are you celebrating the fact that He was<br>born? When we celebrate the birth of Jesus, we celebrate the fact that<br>God humbled Himself to step down out of Heaven, "from a throne of<br>endless glory, to a cradle in the dirt," as the song goes.<br><br>But wasn't December 25th a *pagan festival?* Well, that too isn't<br>certain. The winter solstice never falls on December 25. Likewise,<br>Saturnalia was never celebrated on December 25. Other Christmas symbols,<br>such as trees and candles, may have had some pagan connotations, but<br>those symbols are so commonly used in human history that it doesn't make<br>any sense to declare that they are exclusively pagan in origin, or that<br>they were adopted into Christmas as some twisted homage to the pagan.<br><br>Also, the meaning of a current thing is determined by its current use,<br>not its origin. For example, if I were to ask you about the original<br>meaning of the swastika, you'd undoubtedly tell me all about the Nazis.<br>But the swastika was the universal symbol for good fortune for thousands<br>of years. You frequently see swastikas as part of the religious<br>decorations of Hindu temples from thousands of years prior. It's no<br>wonder the Nazis adopted the swastika as their symbol. But ask anyone<br>today about the swastika, and you will only hear about its current use,<br>not its history. Similarly, if I were to ask you about Nike, you'd tell<br>me all about an athletic shoe company, not the Greek goddess of victory<br>upon whom the company's name is based. So too, the meaning of Christmas<br>comes from our current usage in celebrating the birth of Christ, not the<br>origins of any celebration around that time in history.<br><br>Therefore, to evaluate Christmas, we have to look at what we do<br>currently, not the history of any celebrations on that day. In fact, if<br>you were to show a pagan what we do on Christmas day, they would tell<br>you that it would have no relation to anything that pagans do, and any<br>self-respecting pagan would be upset by what Christians have done to any<br>celebrations on that day (if there was a link at all). The modern-day<br>celebration of Christmas is so far removed from whatever they did<br>centuries ago, that any relation to paganism can be summarily ignored.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
