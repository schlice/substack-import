<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>In this case, it depends on whether or not the movie is going to *make<br>money.*<br><br>For example, if the movie in question is a public service announcement,<br>or a news story, you may not need to get permission, even though it is<br>highly recommended.<br><br>The question turns on whether or not the movie is using someone else\'s<br>name, likeness, or other personal attributes without permission *for an<br>exploitative purpose.*<br><br>Don\'t get hung up on terminology here, "exploitative purpose\"<br>essentially just means where somebody makes profit from the movie. This<br>doesn\'t mean that if a nonprofit corporation makes money at all, the<br>movie "made money." A non-profit corporation can make a movie that<br>doesn\'t sell tickets. The non-profit corporation can still make money<br>from their advertised nonprofit endeavors without making money from the<br>movie.<br><br>Nevertheless, as a general rule, if you use anyone\'s name or likeness<br>in any sort of media production, it is always best practice to get their<br>permission.<br><br>If you have experienced a situation in which someone has used your name<br>or likeness in a movie without your permission, and you think you may<br>have a claim, it is imperative that you contact a licensed attorney in<br>your area who specializes in copyright law, to assist you with<br>determining whether or not you have a claim for invasion of privacy<br>through misappropriation of name or likeness (\"misappropriation\"), or<br>violation of the right of publicity.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can someone use your likeness in a movie without your permission?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
