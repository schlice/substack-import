My understanding is that a<br>pardon involves a full allocution and there is no recourse to invoking<br>the Fifth?**<br><br>Once a person is pardoned, the penalty for the crime is vacated. A<br>pardon does not invoke full allocution. Whether or not accepting a<br>pardon is an admission of guilt is still a topic being debated by legal<br>analysts. Presidents sometimes grant pardons to people who are innocent.<br>If the President thinks someone is innocent and grants a pardon, the<br>person accepting that pardon wouldn't be declaring their guilt.<br><br>**Regardless of allocution, the original conviction, and the record of<br>it, still remains after a pardon.**\[1\](#prNHa){#cite-prNHa<br>.citation_link} Any declaration required on official forms of whether or<br>not the person has been convicted remain true. Also, any state actions<br>against persons convicted remain (such as losing the right to vote or<br>hold public office). Therefore, we presume that the person is still a<br>*convicted felon*, still having been convicted of that crime, even<br>though they have been pardoned. To that end, the person who has been<br>pardoned cannot be prosecuted for the same crime again, because he<br>is protected under the Double Jeopardy clause.<br><br>Therefore, it follows that the person cannot invoke the 5th Amendment<br>when testifying about that crime (if someone else is indicted), because<br>he cannot incriminate himself because he cannot be prosecuted for his<br>testimony. He may not voluntarily testify, but if someone is indeed<br>indicted for that same crime, the person pardoned can be subpoenaed to<br>testify, and cannot invoke the 5th Amendment to avoid testimony.<br><br>What this effectively means is that if the President pardons someone for<br>a crime, that person could then be called to testify against someone<br>else, and could not refuse to answer under the 5th Amendment.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-prNHa){.citation_index} [[Pardon Information and<br>Instructions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=69555a&url=https://www.justice.gov/pardon/pardon-information-and-instructions){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="justice.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
