<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it legal for a mother to shower with her 14 year old son?<br><br>Not sure why I'm seeing an A2A on a question with over 100 answers, but<br>since I was asked, I'll answer.<br><br>I'll provide the simple answer, since it seems that much of the morality<br>of such a scenario has already been discussed. I will not discuss the<br>morality of such behavior.<br><br>The specific question asked was "is it legal."<br><br>In most states, a mother and her son showering together (i.e. using the<br>shower at the same time) is not illegal. There are specific behaviors<br>while in the shower which *could* be illegal (if they stray into sexual<br>territory), but the simple act of a mother and son sharing a shower at<br>the same time is, by itself, generally not illegal.<br><br>Whether or not this behavior *should* be illegal is a matter for much<br>debate, as you can see by the wealth of varied opinions in this thread.<br><br>But it's not, at its most simple activity, illegal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
