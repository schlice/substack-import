<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can a president be impeached for acts that are not criminal?<br><br>Yes. Remember that impeachment is a *political* remedy, while indictment<br>for crimes is a *judicial* remedy.<br><br>When President Gerald Ford was in Congress, he uttered these famous<br>words: "\A<br> impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House<br>of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history."<br><br>That said, most Congresses have defined impeachable offenses as anything<br>which could be prosecuted as a crime. That's not to say that this is a<br>rule, but it is precedent.<br><br>However, to answer the question, the House can impeach a president for<br>any reason they deem is impeachable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
