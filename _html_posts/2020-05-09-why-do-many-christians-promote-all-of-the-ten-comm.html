<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why do many Christians promote all of the Ten Commandments except the<br>4th?**<br><br>So the 4th Commandment is to "keep holy the Sabbath day."<br><br>*But what exactly does that mean?*<br><br>In the Bible, a synagogue leader tried to trip Jesus up for supposedly<br>violating the Sabbath because he healed a woman on the Sabbath. The<br>exchange went like this:<br><br>> On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues, and a woman<br>> was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She<br>> was bent over and could not straighten up at all. When Jesus saw her,<br>> he called her forward and said to her, "Woman, you are set free from<br>> your infirmity." Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she<br>> straightened up and praised God.<br>><br>> Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue<br>> leader said to the people, "There are six days for work. So come and<br>> be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath."<br>><br>> The Lord answered him, "You hypocrites! Doesn't each of you on the<br>> Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give<br>> it water? Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom<br>> Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the<br>> Sabbath day from what bound her?"<br>><br>> ---Luke 13:10--16 NIV<br><br>The Sabbath day is to be kept because when God created the world, he<br>rested on the Sabbath. We too are commanded to rest. Take a break from<br>our work, and exist in the peace of Christ.<br><br>What specifically that looks like is different for everyone, and the<br>Bible does not prescribe a formula for "resting."<br><br>Jesus, in Luke's passage, was teaching on the Sabbath, and that was his<br>life's work. So was he keeping holy the Sabbath? Since worship and rest<br>look different for everyone, he probably was.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
