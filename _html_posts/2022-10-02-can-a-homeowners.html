<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The short answer is no, but it's a qualified no. What they *can* do is<br>sell your house out from under you, remove the panels themselves, and<br>then resell the house to someone else. So if that counts as no, then so<br>be it.<br><br>The rules about solar panels vary by state. Some states have no laws at<br>all regarding HOAs and solar panels, and the HOA can flat-out restrict<br>all solar panels if they choose. Some states tell HOAs that they must<br>allow solar panels, but they can regulate where on the property they can<br>be installed (so if you wanted to install a separate solar array instead<br>of a rooftop array, they could restrict that). Finally, some states<br>allow for agreements between homeowners guaranteeing a minimum amount of<br>sunlight for any one property, thus preserving the right to solar for<br>the future.<br><br>Regardless of the state rules, if your HOA can restrict either the<br>complete installation or the location of the panels, the way an HOA<br>enforces its covenants is through fines. So if you break the rules (like<br>by installing solar panels in a place they tell you not to), the HOA can<br>fine you. If you refuse to pay the fines, the HOA can place a lien on<br>your house for the amount owed, and when that amount exceeds certain<br>state-defined levels, the HOA can foreclose on that lien, sell your<br>house out from under you, remove the panels themselves, and then resell<br>the house.<br><br>TL;DR: In most cases, the HOA cannot directly force you to remove<br>the panels. But they can take your house and then take the panels off<br>themselves.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can a Homeowners\' Association (HOA) make you remove solar panels?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
