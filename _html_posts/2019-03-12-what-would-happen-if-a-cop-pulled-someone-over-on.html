<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What would happen if a cop pulled someone over on private property<br>(personal or business), and the property owner came out and asked the<br>cop to leave immediately?**<br><br>The police do not enforce any private rules on private property; they<br>only enforce state/city laws at the behest of the business owner.<br><br>However, they can follow someone from a public place to private property<br>(for example, from a city street into a parking lot for a private<br>business) in order to safely perform their duties. Unfortunately in that<br>case, the business does not have the right to tell the police to not<br>conduct police business, regardless of where it happens. The police will<br>try to not disturb the business as much as possible, but the police can<br>conduct police business anywhere they need to.<br><br>If a business owner told a police officer to leave the property, the<br>officer would respond that he is conducting police business and he will<br>leave just as soon as he can, and he will try to not disturb the<br>business, but he is conducting police business and he can do that<br>anywhere he has jurisdiction. Any attempt by the business owner to stop<br>the officer could be met with an arrest for obstruction of justice,<br>interfering with a police officer, or whatever the charge is in your<br>jurisdiction.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
