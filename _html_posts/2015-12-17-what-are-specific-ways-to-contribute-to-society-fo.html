<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Richard, thanks very much for all the clarification. I will tell you<br>that I was Air Force Reserve at the time I was diagnosed. MS is not<br>\"commission-waiverable,\" so out the door I go. I\'m a disabled veteran<br>now. Who knew.<br><br>Anyway, I will have to take issue with the statement that<br>\"\u<br>predictable problems with endurance, short term memory and<br>stress tolerance prohibit a 9-5, 40 hour job\" because that is simply<br>not true, and it is faulty thinking which may be causing some of your<br>angst.<br><br>Firstly, only you can tell you what you can and cannot do. Your employer<br>cannot tell you, \"you have MS so you can\'t do this job.\" That would<br>be a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Of course, that<br>doesn\'t apply to commissioned or non-commissioned military members, but<br>it does apply to DoD civilians.<br><br>It\'s up to you to say what you can and cannot do, and it seems like you<br>might be able to overcome some of your issues with a combination of<br>assistive aids that you provide, and accommodations that your employer<br>provides.<br><br>Before we get into your specific issues, you also have to understand<br>what type of MS you have. If you have a progressive form of the disease,<br>you will have to continually work at overcoming these issues. If you<br>have a relapsing form of the disease, these won\'t be an issue all the<br>time, just on occasion.<br><br>Let\'s see if we can muddle through some of these:<br><br>*My short-term memory is not good; I may make an appointment over the<br>phone and forget about it unless reminded within seconds after getting<br>off the phone. If I get stimuli from multiple things at one time, the<br>ability to process the information stops\-\-- driving in heavy traffic<br>is probably not a good idea.*<br><br>Cognitive dysfunction is a common symptom of MS, but it may not be a<br>symptom of its own; cognitive dysfunction can also be a secondary<br>symptom of other things such as aging, medications, depression, anxiety,<br>stress and fatigue. Ideally, you and your neurologist should talk about<br>your cognitive issues. You may need to consult with a specialists, such<br>as a neuropsychologist, a SLP (speech language pathologist), or<br>occupational therapist to diagnose the extent of the issues and to help<br>formulate some compensatory strategies and also some therapy to improve<br>congitive function (with practice, it can improve somewhat).<br><br>*General physical weakness and becoming tired too quickly is a problem.*<br><br>This is, by far, the most common symptom of MS. Almost everyone with MS<br>experiences fatigue in one form or another. This isn\'t just your<br>garden-variety tired; it has its own name: MS Lassitude. Have you ever<br>woken up tired? That\'s a rough way to start your day. But because it is<br>so common, there has been a great deal of focus on it, and lots of ways<br>to combat it. The MS Society talks about the following interventions for<br>MS-related fatigue:<br><br>- Occupational therapy to simplify tasks at work and home.<br>- Physical therapy to learn energy-saving ways of walking (with or<br>  without assistive devices) and performing other daily tasks, and to<br>  develop a regular exercise program.<br>- Sleep regulation, which might involve treating other MS symptoms that<br>  interfere with sleep (e.g., spasticity, urinary problems) and using<br>  sleep medications on a short-term basis.<br>- Psychological interventions, such as stress management, relaxation<br>  training, membership in a support group, or psychotherapy.<br>- Heat management --- strategies to avoid overheating and to cool down.<br>- Medications --- [[amantadine hydrochloride<br>  (Symmetrel®)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e69066&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Medications/Amantadine){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} and [[modafinil<br>  (Provigil®)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e437cd&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Medications/Provigil){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container} --- are the<br>  most commonly prescribed. While neither is approved specifically by<br>  the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of<br>  MS-related fatigue, each has demonstrated some benefit in clinical<br>  trials. The most recent trial of modafinil, however, reported no<br>  difference between modafinil and placebo in relieving fatigue.<br><br>*Different physical symptoms come and go without warning, usually<br>exacerbated by heat or stress. Some days there are significant specific<br>physical problems, particularly in the summer.*<br><br>You may not be aware of this, but before the MRI became the go-to tool<br>to diagnose MS, the previous go-to tool was the *hot tub*. Dunk the<br>patient in the hot tub for 15-20 minutes and their symptoms should get<br>worse. Remove the patient from the tub and cool them down, and the<br>symptoms should subside. This, at the time, was a fair indication that<br>the patient had MS.<br><br>It is well known that heat exacerbates MS symptoms. Management of heat<br>is a big issue, then, with MS patients. There are a variety of cooling<br>devices which exist on the market which employ ice packs in<br>specially-designed clothing (vests, wrist and neck bands, etc) which can<br>help to keep the body cool and combat heat-related symptoms.<br>Additionally, there are organizations that can help defray some of the<br>costs of these devices; check with your local MS organization (the local<br>chapter of the National MS Society or the MS Association of America) to<br>find their cooling vest program information.<br><br>It is also well known that stress can exacerbate MS symptoms. As we<br>discussed with fatigue, these are all interconnected: heat and stress<br>can cause fatigue and other physical symptoms to appear. Therefore, some<br>of the things we already discussed (occupational and physical therapy,<br>exercise, sleep regulation, stress management, etc) are extremely<br>important in not only controlling the disease symptoms, but also in<br>living healthy with a lifelong medical condition.<br><br>I think it\'s important to stress that MS is *life-changing*, not<br>*life-ending*. You can continue to do the things you love when you have<br>MS. You simply must be careful to control the triggers that cause MS<br>flare-ups and exacerbations.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
