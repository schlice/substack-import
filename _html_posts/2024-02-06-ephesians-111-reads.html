<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>An inheritance was something which was very important during Biblical<br>times. With few or no opportunities for career advancement, the majority<br>of people worked in the same trade as their parents. A great desire of<br>people was to inherit a large sum of money.<br><br>What was the "inheritance" that Paul was thinking of? There are two<br>inheritances for believers. First, we are adopted into God\'s family,<br>which grants us the right to look forward to an inheritance. Second, we<br>are granted eternal life with God, "inheriting" all of eternity in His<br>righteousness.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
