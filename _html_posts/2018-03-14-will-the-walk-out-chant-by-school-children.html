<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will the walk-out chant by school children, "hey, hey NRA" embolden<br>Congress to reconsider restrictions on guns?**<br><br>No, and I would hope that it does not.<br><br>We don't take the advice of children on 401(k) investing, and we don't<br>take the advice of children on repairing small engines. We certainly<br>don't allow children to give us advice on enacting nationwide<br>legislation, either.<br><br>Guns are a very regionalized issue.

The passage of the STOP School<br>Violence Act is a good start. Speaker Ryan said the following of the<br>bill:<br><br>> *If there is any place our children can feel safe, it should be our<br>> schools.

It gives<br>> law enforcement, school officials, and students the training,<br>> technology, and resources they need to identify and prevent threats.<br>> This is a common-sense approach to combatting senseless violence.*<br>> \[1\](#wlpeg){#cite-wlpeg .citation_link}<br><br>This is the right start to make students in schools safe. But it is not<br>enough. We need to go further. We need to mandate school safety. If the<br>TSA can make airports safe, the Department of Education can similarly<br>make schools safe.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-wlpeg){.citation_index} [[Statement on the STOP School<br>Violence<br>Act](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d98263&url=https://www.speaker.gov/press-release/statement-stop-school-violence-act){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="speaker.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
