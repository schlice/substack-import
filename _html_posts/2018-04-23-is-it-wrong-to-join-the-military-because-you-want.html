<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Now I want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by dying<br>> for his country. You won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die<br>> for his country.*<br>><br>> *---Gen. George S. Patton, Jr, in a speech delivered to the 3rd Army's<br>> 6th Armored Division, May 31, 1944*<br><br>It's not wrong to want your life to have meaning. It's also not wrong to<br>want your death to be meaningful as well. It means that you have<br>purpose, and even in death, your purpose will be served. For anyone who<br>signs on the dotted line and says that they're willing to give their<br>life for their country, having a clear sense of purpose is critical. It<br>allows you to do your duty without hesitation.<br><br>Just make sure you have those priorities in the right order. Do your<br>utmost to come home safely. But know that your sacrifice will be honored<br>if you don't make it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
