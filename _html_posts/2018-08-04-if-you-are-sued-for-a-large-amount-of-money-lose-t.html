In most states, it's up to you to liquidate<br>whatever assets you need to in order to satisfy the court order. In some<br>states, they can dispossess you of your property in order to liquidate<br>it themselves.<br><br>In most cases, someone who has been "bankrupted" by a court decision has<br>literally filed for bankruptcy before the house and the cars are gone.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
