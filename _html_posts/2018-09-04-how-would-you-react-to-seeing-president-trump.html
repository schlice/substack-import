Indifference. Those things are a relic. They're on their way out<br>anyway.<br><br>Coins? Not sure I'd agree with that decision. Look at the people who are<br>on our currency. Washington. Jefferson. Lincoln. Trump? Nah, doesn't fit<br>with that crew. I think deep down he's a good man, but is he a<br>Washington, or a Lincoln? I don't think so.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
