<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If God is a God, then why does he let people suffer, and if he's<br>really true, why is he just watching people suffer?**<br><br>Let me relay a story I heard. It's about a boy named Chris whose face<br>had been burned in a fire. He sent this note to his psychotherapist:<br><br>> Dear Dr. Gardner,<br>><br>> Some big person, it was a boy about 13, he called me a turtle. And I<br>> know he said this because of my plastic surgery. And I think God hates<br>> me because of my lip. And when I die, he'll probably send me to hell.<br>><br>> Love,<br>><br>> Chris<br><br>Chris figured that if God was so powerful and all-knowing, then God must<br>hate him if he allowed such a terrible thing to happen to him.<br><br>You're not alone if you feel this way. Many people have felt this way.<br>Even the greats of the Bible had this happen to them. Look at Joseph. He<br>was hated by his own brothers, sold into slavery, imprisoned, falsely<br>accused of attempted rape, and threatened with execution. There was no<br>indication that God had explained to Joseph all of the reasons why he<br>had to go through all of that, or what would eventually be done with his<br>life. **He was expected, as you and I are, to live out his life one day<br>at a time in something less than complete understanding.**<br><br>What pleased God was Joseph\'s faithfulness when nothing made sense.<br><br>But I must ask you: *where did you get the idea that God would not allow<br>you to suffer?*<br><br>It certainly wasn't the Bible, because there it says that we should<br>expect trouble. Jesus told His followers to anticipate suffering. \"I<br>have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this<br>world, you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the<br>world.\" (John 16:33). Paul wrote, \"In all our troubles my joy knows no<br>bounds. For when we came into Macedonia, this body of ours had no rest,<br>but we were harassed at every turn\--conflicts on the outside, fears<br>within\" (2 Cor 7:4-5). Peter said, \"Dear friends, do not be surprised<br>at the painful trial you are suffering, as though something strange were<br>happening to you. But rejoice that you participate in the suffering of<br>Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when His glory is revealed\" (1<br>Peter 4:12-13).<br><br>Does this mean we\'re always going to suffer? Paul said we are \"more<br>than conquerors.\" He wrote in Philippians 4:4-7, \"Rejoice in the Lord<br>always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Let your gentleness be evident to<br>all. The Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything, but in every<br>situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your<br>requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all<br>understanding,will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.\"<br><br>There appears to exist this great paradox where we are told to expect<br>suffering and hardship, but we are encouraged to be joyful, thankful,<br>and \"of good cheer.\" But how can we be joyful in the face of hardship?<br>How can we be secure when we are surrounded by insecurity?<br><br>Trust God.<br><br>The BIble tells us to \"\t\rust in the Lord; lean not on your own<br>understanding\" (Proverbs 3:5). \"Leaning\" is that demand for answers<br>\-- \"throwing faith to the wind if a satisfactory response cannot be<br>produced. It is pressing God to explain Himself \-- or else! That is<br>where everything starts to unravel.<br><br>\"If we can comprehend even a tiny portion of the Lord\'s majesty and<br>the depth of His love for us, we can deal with those times when He<br>defies human logic and sensibilities. Indeed, that is what we must do.<br>Expect confusing experiences to occur along the way, and don\'t be<br>dismayed when they arrive. Welcome them as friends\--as opportunities<br>for your faith to grow. Hold fast to your faith, without which it is<br>impossible to please Him. \'Lean into the pain\' when your time to<br>suffer comes around. Never yield to feelings of self-pity of<br>victimization, which are Satan\'s most effective tools against us.<br>Instead, store away your questions for a lengthy conversation in<br>eternity, and then press toward the mark.\"\[1\](#azsOB){#cite-azsOB<br>.citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-azsOB){.citation_index} [[God Makes Sense Even When He<br>Doesn't Make Sense, Part<br>4](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e5dafd&url=https://drjamesdobson.org/blogs/dr-dobson-blog/dr-dobson-blog/2018/03/09/god-makes-sense-even-when-he-doesn-t-make-sense-part-4){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="drjamesdobson.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
