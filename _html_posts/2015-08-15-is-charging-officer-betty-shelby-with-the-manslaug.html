<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Police are not above the law. If a police officer kills<br>someone by mistake it can be considered manslaughter. Murder requires<br>intent, so killing someone accidentally is never murder. Manslaughter<br>charges can definitely result from unlawful use of force, even for a<br>police officer. This is why Darren Wilson was investigated by the grand<br>jury to see if murder charges were warranted when he shot and killed<br>Michael Brown. If the grand jury had decided that Wilson acted by<br>mistake, or acted intentionally and incorrectly, charges could have been<br>brought. As it was, the grand jury (and a subsequent DOJ investigation)<br>found that Wilson\'s actions were justified.\<br>\<br>Search Google, there are plenty of police officers who (even recently)<br>have been convicted of murder when they have unlawfully killed someone.<br>Wikipedia has [[a whole<br>category](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a638eb&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Police_officers_convicted_of_murder){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} devoted to only police<br>officers convicted of murder.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
