<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Dan, more than CNN, more than Fox News, more than any other news source,<br>I can count on you to provide an answer that is reasoned, thoughtful,<br>and more likely than not, much closer to the actual answer. You know<br>that there's always three sides to every argument: his side, your side,<br>and the truth, which is usually somewhere in between. No one gets the<br>truth exactly right, because our perception is colored by the life<br>experiences we carry with us. In other words, we all see life through<br>our own glasses, colored by our life experiences. I have found that your<br>answers seem to land closer to the truth than anyone else's. Thanks<br>again for that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/If-the-Orlando-shooter-was-gay-does-that-change-the-perception-of-his-motives/answer/Dan-B-1472<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
