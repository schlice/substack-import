<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Was Trump's decision to do an airstrike in Syria illegal according to<br>the US Constitution since he did not get approval from Congress?**<br><br>Quick Constitution lesson.<br><br>Military action has two competing clauses in the Constitution. First,<br>the President is declared in Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 as "the<br>Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the<br>Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of<br>the United States." Congress, in Article I, Section 8, Clause 11, has<br>"the power to declare war."<br><br>To this day, there is a continual tug of war between the Executive and<br>the Legislative branches regarding the use of military force and which<br>branch has what power, and to what extent they can exercise that power.<br>For a more detailed reading about the legislative history of those<br>struggles, the Legal Information Institute has a really nice write-up on<br>the history of [[War<br>Powers](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=dc6313&url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/war_powers){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cornell.edu"}]{.qlink_container} in the United States, and<br>the legal cases which follow. That article shows that the courts have<br>fallen on both sides (legislative and executive) depending on the case.<br><br>This leads one to believe that war powers *should* be split between the<br>two branches, and backs the assertion that the Framers *intended* the<br>power to declare war be split between the two branches so that one<br>branch does not have exclusive control over the ability to wage a full<br>scale war counter to the interests of the nation.<br><br>Now, back to the question.<br><br>The issue about procedures for the President and Congress related to war<br>was *largely* (not completely) settled when Congress passed the [[War<br>Powers<br>Resolution](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e5a346&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_powers_act){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. It states that the<br>President must report to Congress within 48 hours of committing armed<br>forces to military action. It forbids armed forces from remaining for<br>more than 60 days (with a further 30-day withdrawal period) without a<br>Congressional authorization for use of military force (AUMF) or a<br>[[declaration of<br>war](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3a5b23&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war_by_the_United_States){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>Thus, the President can act to *commit* troops, but Congress must act in<br>order to *maintain* troops in place.<br><br>**TL;DR: Therefore, based on current interpretations of the separation<br>of war powers, the President can initiate military action unilaterally,<br>without Congressional approval, but Congress would be required to<br>authorize any ongoing military operations.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
