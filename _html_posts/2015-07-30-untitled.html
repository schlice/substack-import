<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Mass shootings do not occur daily. I suppose it depends on<br>your definition of \"mass shooting\" since there isn\'t a true<br>definition of it yet. We had a few, but I certainly don\'t agree with<br>206 so far in 2015.\<br>\<br>In the US, self defense DOES entail gun ownership. And until the Second<br>Amendment is repealed, it always will. That\'s how the US was designed.<br>The country was designed around the freedom to own guns. You would have<br>to completely dismantle the Constitution and start over again if you<br>want to eliminate public ownership of guns.\<br>\<br>So anything you want to do to limit civilian ownership of guns has to be<br>done within the framework that US citizens will always be afforded the<br>right to own and use guns.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-are-Republicans-against-gun-control/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
