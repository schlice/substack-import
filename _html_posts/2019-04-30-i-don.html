<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I don't have health insurance... I was diagnosed with M.S in 2008.<br>What are the best home remedies for the M.S hug? I've been getting it<br>more and more.**<br><br>The "MS hug" is a symptom of "neuropathic pain." It's a common pain<br>among MS patients where the nerves essentially "misfire" due to nerve<br>damage. There are two types: acute neuropathic pain, such as trigeminal<br>neualgia, Lhermette's sign, and the MS hug, and chronic neuropathic<br>pain, such as dysesthesia.<br><br>First and foremost, I want to suggest you contact your local chapter of<br>the National MS Society, because they can help you with treatment<br>options if you don't have insurance. MS Navigators are standing by to<br>help you find treatment. Please call them at 1--800--344--4867, or<br>[[contact them<br>online](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2137d9&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Helpful-Links/Contact-Us){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>The reason I want you to contact the Society for help is that<br>neuropathic pain is very difficult to treat on your own. It's not like<br>physical pain, which you can treat with analgesics or home remedies.<br>Neuropathic pain is pain which does not originate in the painful area,<br>but in the nerves which are supposed to just transmit the information<br>about the pain from the painful area to the brain. Treating the area<br>doesn't help as much. It can provide some relief, but treating the<br>misfiring nerves is more beneficial. For example, using a warm water<br>bottle pressed against your chest will change the feeling from one of<br>squeezing to one of warmth, but it will still be there.<br><br>While I hesitate to offer this as a potential help to you, partially<br>because it is still illegal at the federal level and only some states<br>allow its use for medical conditions, cannabis is an alternative to<br>expensive pain medicines. Cannabis is said to help relieve neuropathic<br>pain, but studies are limited, long-term effects are not well known, and<br>it's not approved by the FDA to treat anything. I only provide this<br>information because you said you don't have insurance, so expensive<br>narcotic pain medications will likely be out of reach for you, and<br>require the oversight of a doctor while using them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
