<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is an involved answer, so let me take it a piece at a time.<br><br>Who are the voting members in a Lake Association?<br><br>That depends on the particular association. A Lake Association is simply<br>a group of people who work together for a common goal, in this case, the<br>preservation and enjoyment of a lake. There are various types of lake<br>associations:<br><br>- *HOAs*. Some lake associations are centered around the homeowners who<br>  surround the lake. These groups tend to be focused on property value<br>  more than preservation of the lake.<br>- *Watershed Groups.* These groups usually include governmental<br>  agencies, along with private industries, drinking water agencies, and<br>  wastewater facilities. These types of groups tend to focus on<br>  governmental compliance.<br>- *"Friends" Groups.* These groups tend to be fairly diverse,<br>  grassroots, and smaller than the other types of lake associations.<br>  They usually focus on education and conservation.<br><br>As you can see, the membership in lake associations tends to be all over<br>the map, depending on the type of lake association you have.<br><br>How the association conducts voting, and who is eligible to vote, is a<br>matter of public record, and can be found in the association's Bylaws.<br><br>**Are all the households entitled to be in the lake association eligible<br>or only the paid, currently participating members?**<br><br>How any one type of lake association is organized, and what benefits<br>each entity gets, is all dependent on the association itself. You will<br>have to refer back to the Governing Documents of the association to get<br>specific answers as to how your particular lake association is run.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
