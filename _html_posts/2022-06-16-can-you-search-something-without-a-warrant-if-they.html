<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(US answer)*<br><br>Yes, a car. A police officer can search a car with probable cause and no<br>warrant. The automobile exception allows cars to be searched with<br>probable cause only because there is a lower expectation of privacy in a<br>car, given the regulatory environment in which it operates.<br>Additionally, because it is mobile, evidence can quickly be moved and<br>destroyed, so time is of the essence.<br><br>In nearly every other circumstance, the probable cause must be used as<br>the basis to obtain a search warrant. These days, that can be done<br>fairly quickly with handheld electronic devices.<br><br>There are other times when police do not need a warrant to search:<br><br>- Plain sight. If illegal items (drugs, etc) are in plain sight (and the<br>  "plain smell" test has been extended to this exception as well), they<br>  can be seized and used as evidence, and the surrounding area can also<br>  be searched.<br>- Search incident to an arrest. If you are being arrested, the police<br>  can search you and your vicinity (your home or car). They can also<br>  perform a "protective sweep" if they believe you may have accomplices<br>  in the area, and they can seize any evidence they find in plain sight.<br>- Consent. If they ask, and you agree, the police can search without a<br>  warrant. In this case, they don't even need probable cause. They also<br>  are not required to tell you that you have the right to refuse<br>  consent.<br>- Exigent circumstances. If the police feel that the amount of time<br>  needed to get a warrant is too long to prevent the loss or destruction<br>  of evidence, or if someone's life is in peril (or would otherwise<br>  jeopardize public safety), or if a suspect may escape, the police can<br>  proceed without a warrant. Preserving evidence, apprehending suspects,<br>  and saving lives take precedence over obtaining warrants.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
