<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Your first step would be to convince everyone that prison<br>is not rehabilitative but punitive. In the United States, we have always<br>held the belief that prison is supposed to be rehabilitative. Whether or<br>not it is effective at being rehabilitative is not the question. The<br>point is prison in the United States is supposed to be rehabilitative.<br>Sending prisoners outside of the United States would not be considered<br>rehabilitative, it would be considered punitive.\<br>\<br>Once you have completely changed the structure of the penal system in<br>the United States to a punitive one instead of rehabilitative, then you<br>can address the cost-benefits and the other benefits of sending<br>prisoners outside of the United States.\<br>\<br>Though, if we change the entire prison system to a punitive one instead<br>of a rehabilitative one, we could probably achieve greater cost savings<br>by keeping our prisoners in the United States, but placing them all on a<br>fenced in island in the middle of the ocean instead of shipping them by<br>aircraft to a Third World country. Drop them all onto a prison island<br>and let them fend for themselves. I can\'t remember off the top of my<br>head what movie that\'s from, but if we\'re making our prison system<br>punitive (in other words, our prison system is punishment instead of<br>rehabilitative) then dropping them all onto a deserted island surrounded<br>by 50 foot walls would be punishment enough. Hey, maybe we could get<br>Trump to build the walls.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
