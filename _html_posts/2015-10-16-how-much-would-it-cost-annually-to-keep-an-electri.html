<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I don\'t agree that we should build a wall. Or a fence. I<br>don\'t really care how you made it here, or why. We need to do a better<br>job of enforcing the laws we already have. That money could be better<br>spent fixing immigration.\<br>\<br>Once you make it more attractive to come here legally than you do to<br>come here illegally, the problem fixes itself.\<br>\<br>The immigration system needs a complete overhaul. It needs to work much<br>faster and it needs to allow more people who wish to emigrate to this<br>country.\<br>\<br>Once we do that, we need to step up the laws against employing someone<br>who is illegally present in this country.\<br>\<br>Next, we stop giving handouts (free education, driver\'s licenses, etc)<br>to people in this country illegally.\<br>\<br>Finally, once those are in place, we need to start funneling illegals<br>who refuse to become citizens and refuse to leave swiftly out the door.<br>It shouldn\'t be too difficult to come back as legal citizens once we<br>overhaul immigration.\<br>\<br>From then on, no one will want to come into the country illegally.\<br>\<br>Yes, it\'s a long, hard road. But so is building a<br>wall.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
