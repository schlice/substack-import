<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are the risks of carrying only personal liability car insurance<br>in the USA?**<br><br>If you don't carry collision coverage, any repairs which are not paid<br>for by someone else (in most states) are your responsibility. Simply<br>replacing a bumper costs several thousand dollars out of pocket. A<br>full-on collision could cost you the actual price of the car, meaning it<br>would cost you more to fix it than to just junk it and buy a new car.<br>This means that the entire investment in your vehicle is gone, and<br>anything you owe on it is still owed, and you're still out a car.<br><br>Additionally, in your state, you may not be allowed to carry only<br>personal liability insurance (also called Personal Injury Protection, or<br>PIP). Nearly all states require you to carry bodily injury coverage<br>(i.e. to cover injuries you cause). A handful of states allow you to put<br>up a bond in lieu of insurance (to prove you can pay for any injuries<br>you may cause). Also, you are required in nearly all states to have some<br>form of property damage liability insurance (to cover damage you cause<br>to the property of others).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
