<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you think kids can return to school in 2 months without the fear of<br>a shooting accident?**<br><br>Of course they can! There are *50 million students* in schools. The<br>number of students who died in school shootings in the 2017--2018 school<br>year was around 50 (that's September, 2017 through June, 2018). This<br>means any one individual student, even in an aberrant school year like<br>2017--2018, still has a one in one million chance of dying in a<br>school shooting, and that's the high risk. The risk in a normal<br>(non-aberrant) school year is even lower than that. I think those are<br>pretty safe odds.<br><br>And with school security becoming more of an issue in places where it is<br>not (and some high profile shootings detailing both what good and bad<br>security can do), schools will only become safer over the next few<br>school years as security is given a much more serious look in schools<br>that don't yet have it.<br><br>It is up to parents to review your childrens' school security plans, and<br>if you find it lacking, maybe you should either consider moving,<br>changing schools, or homeschooling until the district can get its act<br>together. Don't leave your children's safety in the hands of those who<br>do not believe it precious enough to protect it!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
