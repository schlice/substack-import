<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The general answer to \"If X happens to someone else at a restaurant,<br>can I leave without paying\" is no. There are very, very few<br>circumstances that will directly exonerate you of *your* responsibility<br>to pay for *your* food at *your* table.<br><br>If I had to guess, you are probably assuming that the food is somehow<br>tainted, and if you eat your food, you too will become sick.<br><br>If this ever happens to you (someone puking at another table), **contact<br>the manager immediately** and express your concern. It is highly likely<br>that the manager will \"comp\" your meal (i.e. the restaurant will eat<br>the cost).<br><br>That said, you are never \"allowed\" (as a matter of policy) to<br>simply get up and leave without paying your bill. In most jurisdictions,<br>this is considered \"theft of service.\" You have an arrangement<br>directly with the restaurant, as does every other customer. Nowhere in<br>that arrangement is a clause that allows you to unilaterally break that<br>arrangement. You have to negotiate a new arrangement, which involves<br>talking to the manager. The manager is the only person who can \"comp\"<br>your bill, as it amounts to a loss for the restaurant. If the manager<br>deems that it is important enough for customer retention to do that, he<br>will, but it is entirely up to the manager, not you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
