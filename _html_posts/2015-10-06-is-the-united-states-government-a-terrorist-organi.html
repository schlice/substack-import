<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [A terrorist organization uses fear to meet political ends.<br>Terrorists will usually use illegal, sensational acts of violence to<br>frighten (terror) people into making political change. They will almost<br>always take responsibility for their crimes, and indicate that such<br>crimes will continue until their demands are met.\<br>\<br>The United States is engaged in a legal conflict known as the Global War<br>on Terror (the GWOT). As the article rightly states, the US military<br>uses every possible shred of evidence it can find, as is gathered by the<br>CIA, the NSA, and other intelligence-gathering organizations. Most of<br>the people killed in drone strikes are indeed militants.\<br>\<br>But on occasion, even the best intelligence can be wrong. The hospital<br>in Kunduz was one such accident. Sometimes these things can be<br>attributed to the \"fog of war.\" The US was responding to an Afghan<br>call for an airstrike, and it\'s still unsure whether or not we targeted<br>the facility that the Afghanis requested we target. If militants had<br>taken up position within the hospital, the hospital becomes a valid<br>target under the Geneva Convention. We don\'t know whether or not this<br>is completely true. Doctors Without Borders claims that all people who<br>were killed were either hospital workers or patients. But this claim has<br>not yet been fully substantiated. The Afghanis have not stated yet which<br>building they indicated for strike and whether or not there was a reason<br>to target a hospital if they did, in fact, request an airstrike on the<br>hospital. This is still subject to investigation.\<br>\<br>You do have to rely on your intelligence to execute an operation, and it<br>is true that sometimes, there are mistakes made. The White House has<br>said, through its spokesman, Josh Earnest, \"There is no country in the<br>world and no military in the world that goes to greater lengths and<br>places a higher premium on avoiding civilian casualties than the United<br>States Department of Defense.\"\<br>\<br>Calling the United States a \"terrorist organization\" would mean that<br>we routinely and knowingly engage in illegal acts of violence for<br>the sole reason of enacting political ends. You would have to have<br>information stating that the US *knew* that the hospital did not<br>contain any militants, that it was not a valid target under the Geneva<br>Convention, and the military commanders made a decision to destroy that<br>hospital anyway, in order to effect political change. Then, you will<br>have to show that the US *admitted* to killing all of the civilians,<br>and then that the US *demanded* a particular political end or more<br>civilians in non-combat areas would be intentionally targeted.\<br>\<br>Since this is not happening and is not likely to ever happen, you cannot<br>call the United States a terrorist organization and be speaking from any<br>platform of fact.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
