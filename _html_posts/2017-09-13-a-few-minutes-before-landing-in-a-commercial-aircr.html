  the air conditioning unit suddenly decrease in power? Is this to maximise available
  energy for a go-around?"'

When the aircraft<br>is coming in for landing, the engines are running at their slowest,<br>until just before touchdown, when they are literally running at idle<br>speed. The decrease in available engine bleed air which runs the<br>pneumatic systems which drives the air handlers causes the entire system<br>to slow down. You'll notice they ramp back up right at the time the<br>thrust reversers are engaged and the engines spool back up, right after<br>landing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
