<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why has Biden changed his mind about border security. He has only been<br>in office around 60 days. He told the world on Jan 20 come in and we<br>will take care of you, now today he told everyone do not come until.we<br>get set up?**<br><br>Campaign promises have consequences. Biden was campaigning to the United<br>States voter. Except his words were reaching the global migrants.<br><br>Biden campaigned on the fact that he would be kinder and gentler than<br>Trump at the border, and voters responded. Clearly, voters wanted a<br>different approach than what Trump offered. Biden said he'd halt<br>deportations, stop building the border wall, and end the "wait in<br>Mexico" policy for asylum-seekers. After winning the White House, he<br>proposed an immigration policy which includes a path to citizenship for<br>illegal immigrants.<br><br>Predictably, this caused a *massive* flood of immigrants to hit the<br>southern border crossing. It caused a similar spike in illegal border<br>crossings, including very dangerous desert and water crossings. It was<br>predictable, because the administration predicted it. Ambassador Roberta<br>Jacobson, Biden's southern border coordinator, said of the migrant<br>surge, "Surges tend to respond to hope, and there was a significant hope<br>for a more humane policy after four years of, you know, pent-up<br>demand."\[1\](#RPetk){#cite-RPetk .citation_link}<br><br>But while their prediction skills seem to be on pointe, their<br>preparation skills seem to be sorely lacking. While they knew the surge<br>was coming, they did nothing to prepare for it. The need for increased<br>enforcement at the border plays very poorly to Biden's base, so instead<br>of implementing the unpopular but needed changes, he ignored it in favor<br>of pandering to his base.<br><br>Now the southern border is in crisis. Biden's words spurred on massive<br>migrant activity, and with no end in sight, Biden was forced to temper<br>his rhetoric. "Please let us get set up for you before you come" is the<br>tenor of his message, but that offers little condolence to migrants who<br>have been chomping at the bit for immigration policies to loosen. And<br>with all the hope he gave them, how can he deny them now?<br><br>It will be interesting to see how he handles it. Open borders is a<br>deeply unpopular concept. And short of open borders, it is exceedingly<br>difficult to loosen restrictions on immigration without increasing<br>enforcement activities.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-RPetk){.citation_index} [[Press Briefing by Press<br>Secretary Jen Psaki and Special Assistant to the President and<br>Coordinator for the Southern Border Ambassador Roberta Jacobson, March<br>10, 2021 \| The White<br>House](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a80fd2&url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/03/10/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-and-special-assistant-to-the-president-and-coordinator-for-the-southern-border-ambassador-roberta-jacobson-march-10-2021/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="whitehouse.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
