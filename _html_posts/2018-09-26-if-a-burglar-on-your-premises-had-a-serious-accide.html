<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a burglar on your premises had a serious accident, are you<br>obligated to help him?**<br><br>Legally, the answer in the United States is no. And it doesn't even have<br>to be a burglar. Unless you're a doctor, you don't have any obligation<br>to render first aid to anyone, their legal presence on your premises<br>notwithstanding. We've created Good Samaritan laws to try to encourage<br>people to render first aid without worrying that they'll be sued if they<br>inadvertently make it worse. But you are under no legal obligation to<br>render aid.<br><br>Since you said he's a burglar, you're probably calling police anyway, so<br>you should probably also inform them of his condition so they can send<br>medical personnel.<br><br>You should note that there are a few exceptions to this rule. For<br>example, if you created the peril which was encountered by the burglar,<br>you have a duty to assist. And once you start trying to assist, you have<br>a duty to continue. Finally, if you have a special relationship with the<br>burglar (like he's your family), you may have a duty to assist.<br><br>Also, some states have a duty to report crimes against children, or<br>sexually-based offenses. And in the states which have an actual duty to<br>assist, calling 911 is considered "assisting." You don't actually have<br>to render first aid.<br><br>If a duty exists and you failed to help, you could open yourself up to a<br>negligence lawsuit.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
