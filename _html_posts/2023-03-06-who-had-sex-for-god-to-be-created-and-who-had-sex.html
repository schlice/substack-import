<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>God was not created. God is *eternal*, which means He has no<br>beginning, and no end. He just *is*. He is the eternal First Cause.<br><br>It is necessary that He be eternal, because if He is not (i.e. He was<br>created), then your question would be logical, as something or someone<br>would have needed to create Him.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
