<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>SCOTUS did not "block" the state of Oklahoma from funding a Catholic<br>charter school. The Supreme Court left a lower court ruling in place<br>which did so, because the SCOTUS deadlocked.<br><br>First off, the school is not private. It is a charter school.<br>Charter schools, which are privately-run but publicly funded, serve<br>about 3.8 million students in the US. They offer an alternative to<br>traditional public schools, offering an educational model intended to be<br>more innovative and less bound by state regulations. The concept took<br>off in the 1990s and, by the 2023 school year, there were some<br>8,000â€¯charter schools operating nationwide. The law in Oklahoma, as in<br>most states, says that charter schools are public, not private. States<br>have been split on whether they excluded charter schools (even religious<br>ones) from public funding.<br><br>Nevertheless, in this case, the Justices issued a brief, **unsigned<br>order** noting only that it had split 4-4. The votes are not recorded in<br>an unsigned order, so we don't know how the Justices voted, but the<br>split means that the lower court decisions stand.<br><br>Unsigned decisions do not set precedent, so the religious groups<br>involved in the case will be able to bring another case in the future if<br>they choose.<br><br>\<br><br>(EDIT) Adding just a little more detail about the case itself, with the<br>understanding that this case does not set nationwide precedent; it only<br>applies to Oklahoma and this particular charter school.<br><br>BACKGROUND:<br><br>The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa applied to<br>establish St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School ("St. Isidore")<br>as an online charter school. St. Isidore is a religious institution and<br>planned to structure its activities as a "genuine instrument of the<br>\Catholic C\hurch." **In essence, St. Isidore's purpose was to operate<br>as a public Catholic school, supported by state funding.** In 2023, the<br>Oklahoma Charter School Board (the "Board"), in a three-to-two vote,<br>chartered St. Isidore.<br><br>After the Board approved St. Isidore's application to become a charter<br>school, but before the contract's execution, the Republican Oklahoma<br>Attorney General, Genter Drummond, filed suit against it and the Board.<br>Drummond filed a mandamus action in the Oklahoma Supreme Court seeking<br>an order directing the Board to rescind St. Isidore's charter school<br>contract. Drummond alleged that the contract violated both the Oklahoma<br>and U.S. Constitutions.<br><br>In the case *Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board v. Drummond,* the<br>Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled in favor of Drummond and directed the Board<br>to rescind the charter school's contract, finding that it violated two<br>state constitutional provisions, the Charter Act, and the federal<br>Establishment Clause.<br><br>- OK Constitution. The Court found the contract violative of<br>  Oklahoma's constitutional prohibition on appropriating public money to<br>  religious organizations. Accordingly, the Court rejected St. Isidore's<br>  argument against state action; instead, it determined that St. Isidore<br>  was a public school by way of the state charter, and thus a state<br>  actor.<br>- The Charter Act. The Court found St. Isidore's charter violative<br>  of both the state constitutional mandate to establish public schools<br>  "free from sectarian control," and the Charter Act's related<br>  nonsectarian requirement.<br>- The Establishment Clause. The Court held that the First<br>  Amendment's Establishment Clause prohibits the charter because it uses<br>  public money for the establishment of a religious institution. St.<br>  Isidore, which fully integrates Catholic teachings in its curriculum<br>  and co-curricular activities, was ruled by the Court as a "religious<br>  institution."<br>- The Free Exercise Clause. The Court rejected St. Isidore's Free<br>  Exercise claim: it held that even if denying St. Isidore's charter on<br>  the basis of its religious status implicated free exercise rights, it<br>  is nevertheless permissible because the charter itself violates the<br>  Establishment Clause.<br><br>\<br><br>So the issue in this case is specifically related to Oklahoma and its<br>Constitutional prohibitions against appropriating public money to<br>religious organizations.<br><br>This case does not set national precedent. The SCOTUS was divided, so<br>the OK SC ruling stands, and they submitted an unsigned opinion, which<br>does not set precedent.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
