<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If your goal is to stop mass shootings like what happened in Orlando,<br>and the method by which you intend on going about this is to implement<br>"sensible change," you can just stop right now.<br><br>*But there has to be a way to stop these people from doing mass<br>shootings!*<br><br>The short answer is, there is none. Because you're focusing on the wrong<br>problem.<br><br>You are looking at the incident in Orlando and, like the political left<br>in the United States, are focused on the gun. *If we could just get rid<br>of the gun,* they think, *we will stop mass shootings*.<br><br>This line of logic is wrong for many reasons, but primarily this:<br>*making something illegal doesn't make it go away*. We have spent<br>decades making things illegal in the United States and they are a bigger<br>problem now than when we enacted the laws in the first place. See [[War<br>on<br>Drugs](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c9df4b&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Drugs){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} and<br>[Prohibition(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=21a286&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} for starters. Making<br>these things illegal didn't make people stop doing them or using them,<br>and it certainly didn't make them go away. What makes you think that<br>prohibiting guns in the same way will somehow be different?<br><br>The problem is that *laws can't change human behavior*. Laws only<br>influence people who *choose to be bound by law.* For example, if I'm an<br>upstanding, law-abiding person, I will probably stop doing something if<br>the government makes it illegal. If they outlawed right turns on red<br>tomorrow because people were getting killed, I would stop turning right<br>on red. I *chose* to follow the law; many people choose, intentionally,<br>to not follow the law. The law itself does not change human behavior. It<br>oftentimes influences behavior, but you cannot legislate morality. If<br>someone chooses to violate the law, they are going to continue to<br>violate the law. You can write as many laws as you choose, and they will<br>continue to violate the law.<br><br>If you repeal the Second Amendment and make guns illegal, millions of<br>legal gun owners in the United States will have a choice: will I follow<br>the law, or will I consciously become a criminal, simply by possessing a<br>firearm? I suspect you will find many people able to justify that<br>position as a criminal because that's how they were raised, and that's<br>what they know. In the future, you'll find fewer people who will<br>consciously violate the law, but they will exist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
