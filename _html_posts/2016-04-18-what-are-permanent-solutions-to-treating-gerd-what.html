<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, there are other prescription medications that can be tried. But<br>if you\'re tired of popping pills, or if you have GERD caused by a<br>hiatal hernia, you are a potential candidate for laparoscopic<br>anti-reflux surgery. This surgery is very non-invasive and has an<br>excellent success rate. The actual surgery is called **fundoplication<br>surgery** for Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).<br><br>During fundoplication surgery, the upper curve of the stomach (the<br>fundus) is wrapped around the esophagus and sewn into place so that the<br>lower portion of the esophagus passes through a small tunnel of stomach<br>muscle. This prevents that \"straight-line\" from the stomach up the<br>esophagus. Yes, we know it\'s not a straight line, but you get the<br>point. Also, if your GERD is caused by a hiatal hernia, that will be<br>repaired during the same surgery.<br><br>There are risks. One of the biggest risks is bloating and gas buildup<br>because the person cannot burp. The gas buildup may become more of a<br>nuisance than the GERD was. Fundoplication surgery is not reversible, so<br>the new symptoms would become permanent. So you may end up replacing a<br>toothache with a headache, so to speak. There are, of course, the normal<br>risks to surgery, related to infection, surgical complications, and<br>anesthesia use.<br><br>But that risk needs to be weighed against continuing to have to take<br>medication for the rest of your life. Because when anti-reflux surgery<br>is successful, it means a near-permanent cessation to GERD without<br>medication.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
