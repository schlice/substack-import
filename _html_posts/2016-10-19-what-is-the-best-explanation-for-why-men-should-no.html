<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I disagree with the sentiment that "men should not hit women." This<br>sentiment implies that simply because women are the "fairer sex,"<br>meaning they are, on average, physically weaker than men, that men<br>should never hit women.<br><br>This is not a valid reason to not hit a woman.<br><br>I would modify the topic and make two separate topics:<br><br>- Why a man does not need to resort to violence to solve problems<br>- Chivalry is not dead; what does chivalry mean<br><br>You should note that none of this discussion has anything to do with<br>defending yourself. If someone is attacking you, defend yourself.<br>Doesn't matter if it's a man, a woman, or a mountain lion, if you're<br>being attacked, you defend yourself, period. No one of any sex has the<br>right to physically assault you, and you always have the right to defend<br>yourself against any attack.<br><br>That said, and outside of those circumstances, a true, strong man (in<br>both physique and character) should not need to use violence to solve<br>any problem. You should know and practice de-escalation techniques<br>to make a violent confrontation, less so. Learning how to listen is a<br>lifelong skill that will serve you well in both conflict resolution and<br>interpersonal communications.<br><br>I took a course in school called *Aikido and the Art of Conflict<br>Resolution*. It talked about the similarities between the martial art of<br>Aikido and the techniques used in conflict resolution. Aikido has at its<br>core the ability to "embrace" your attacker's energy, and instead of<br>using that energy *against* the attacker, you *redirect* your attacker's<br>energy away harmlessly. In conflict resolution, we do the same thing: we<br>"embrace" the issues of our opponent by active listening and<br>understanding their position, and then we "redirect" their energy into<br>something positive to help them with their issues. The class was very<br>enlightening, and I'm happy to report that some things you learn in<br>school actually do stick with you.<br><br>You should also teach your boys what it means to be chivalrous, and how<br>a man should treat a woman. You should teach your boys why we respect<br>women, and show them through practice what that means. It's never enough<br>to tell them how to do it. It's far more valuable to model that behavior<br>in your own life. In fact, you could get away with never telling them<br>how to do it or what it means, if you actually model it for them in your<br>own interactions with women, you will teach them far more than your<br>words will ever accomplish.<br><br>I raised three boys, and they are all young adults now. I can't say I<br>was perfect, but this was the template I used when teaching them how to<br>interact with the world, and with women.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
