<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because the terror watchlist is a *political* tool, not a *law<br>enforcement* tool.<br><br>Why? Because:<br><br>- You cannot know if you are actually on the terror watchlist until you<br>  try to board an airplane.<br>- There is no judicial oversight of your placement on the terror<br>  watchlist.<br>- There is no mechanism to determine *why* you were placed on the terror<br>  watchlist.<br>- There is no mechanism to *appeal* your placement on the terror<br>  watchlist.<br>- There is no mechanism to get yourself *removed* from the terror<br>  watchlist.<br><br>Senators are placed on the terror watchlist all the time, and even with<br>their power, it takes them *months* to have their placement reviewed and<br>to get themselves removed. If *you* were placed on the terror watchlist?<br>Forget about being able to get yourself off. You don't have enough money<br>to pay enough lawyers for enough time to actually get you off.<br><br>A secret government list which really has no teeth, no controls, and no<br>oversight? That's a political tool, used to bash your political enemies,<br>not to actually effect some safety protocol.<br><br>It's also a funny list, because it's only supposed to be a *no fly*<br>list, so the only thing you can't do if you're on the list is fly on a<br>commercial airplane. And airlines only *voluntarily* follow the list.<br>"Voluntarily." Like when someone from the FBI says here's a list of<br>people who shouldn't fly, but don't worry, you don't have to deny<br>them boarding, but you know, if they do board, and they do something<br>that a terrorist would do, and then we are questioned, we're going to<br>have to say that we already told you they were dangerous. Sure, it's<br>"voluntary."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
