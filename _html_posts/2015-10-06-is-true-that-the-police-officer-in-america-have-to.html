<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [A2A\<br>\<br>The media hype definitely makes it seem like there is a shooting around<br>every corner. There are two different questions here: gunshots and<br>violent people.\<br>\<br>Gunshots. In actuality, the vast majority of police officers have<br>only ever discharged their firearms in the firing range. Most officers<br>have never discharged their weapons outside of the range. They may draw<br>them on occasion (probably more often than they\'d like), but rarely<br>does an officer ever fire shots.\<br>\<br>Violent people. Officers have to deal with violent people all the<br>time. Sadly, combative people are more and more common. Rarely do they<br>have to resort to using their firearm to handle those violent people.<br>Officers have a \"force continuum\" of increasingly more powerful force<br>which culminates with the officer\'s sidearm. The officer has most (if<br>not all) of the following tools in that continuum of force:\<br>]<br><br>- His hands<br>- A baton<br>- Pepper spray<br>- a Taser<br>- a sidearm<br><br>He can employ any of these methods of force depending on the level of<br>violence with which he is confronted. Officers are generally allowed to<br>use one level of force greater than the threat being proffered. So if a<br>subject is combative but empty-handed, an officer can use his own empty<br>hands, or his baton, or pepper spray, or his Taser. A combative subject<br>wielding a stabbing weapon (i.e. knife or screwdriver) will be facing<br>the barrel of a gun. For offenders not wielding a weapon, the Taser is<br>becoming the go-to control method.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
