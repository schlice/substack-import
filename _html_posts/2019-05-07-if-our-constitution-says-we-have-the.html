<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If our constitution says we have the \"right\" to travel, then why do<br>we have to have a driver\'s license?**<br><br>Oh boy, more [[sovereign<br>citizen](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c31cde&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} questions.<br><br>Since you mentioned the Constitution, let's discuss what it actually<br>says, and what it does not. The Constitution doesn't say anything about<br>the "right to travel." What it *does* say is that you have *freedom of<br>movement*, that you have the right to move between states at will. You<br>don't have to have "papers" in order to enter a state. You don't need a<br>visa from your home state to travel to another state, and states can't<br>set up situations where US citizens are subject to such provisions.<br><br>The Constitution also doesn't say anything about motor vehicle<br>regulation, and under the 10th Amendment, regulation of motor vehicles<br>(and anything else not explicitly mentioned by the Constitution) is left<br>to the states. States can enact whatever driver licensing provisions and<br>traffic codes they choose, and use their police powers to enforce them.<br>All 50 states have done so.<br><br>SCOTUS has also ruled<br>[on(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e53f35&url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/235/610/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="justia.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br>[several(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2460a3&url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/274/352/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="justia.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br>[occasions(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f4e8e4&url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/314/33/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="justia.com"}]{.qlink_container} that registering vehicles<br>and licensing drivers falls under the state's power to create laws and<br>police them, which falls under the state's compelling interest to create<br>a safe environment for its citizens.<br><br>Therefore, states are free to create traffic laws and to regulate<br>drivers, and doing so has been declared to be Constitutional on numerous<br>occasions.<br><br>So, to answer your question: **you have to have a driver's license<br>because all 50 states have laws requiring the operator of a motor<br>vehicle to be licensed in at least one state.**<br><br>\<br><br>*Note: I am not going to engage in any sovereign citizen discussions.<br>At. All. And I'm not allowing any of that drivel into my comments.*<br><br>*Feel free to post your sovereign citizen tripe, but don't be surprised<br>when you refresh your page and find that your entire comment went into<br>the bit bucket.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
