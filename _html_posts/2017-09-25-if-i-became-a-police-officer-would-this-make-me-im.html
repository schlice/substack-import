<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not only does this not make you immune to obeying traffic laws, but<br>in our department, every contact with local law enforcement, both on and<br>off duty, must be documented and delivered to the chain of command. Too<br>many of those (even those where you did not get a ticket) will force an<br>internal review of your training and perhaps a closer look at whether or<br>not you should remain employed at that agency.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
