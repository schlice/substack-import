Okay, let's say<br>this savior saves you from torture. You live a nice, comfortable life.<br>*But what happens when you die?*<br><br>Jesus saves us from eternal torment, not earthly torment. Jesus<br>saves and redeems your *soul*, not your *body.*<br><br>He even tells us that we will have trouble in this life.<br><br>> I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the<br>> world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the<br>> world. --- John 16:33 ESV<br><br>There will be tough times in this world. *But Jesus overcame this<br>world.*<br><br>> So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. \-- John 8:36<br>> ESV<br><br>Jesus doesn't promise you an easy life. Jesus promises you a ***glorious<br>eternity.***<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
