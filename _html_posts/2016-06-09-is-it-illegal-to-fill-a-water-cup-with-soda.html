<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, it is technically a crime. Albeit a small one, petty theft is still<br>theft.<br><br>In Colorado, theft of anything under \$500 is considered a class 2<br>misdemeanor, the lowest level of theft which can be committed, and is<br>classified as "petty theft." Punishment for a class 2 misdemeanor in<br>Colorado is a minimum sentence of three months and a \$250 fine, and a<br>maximum sentence of 12 months and a \$1,000 fine. (ยง 18-1.3-501(1)(a).)<br><br>Pretty amazing that you can be sentenced to three months in jail and<br>have to pay a \$250 fine for not paying \$1 for a drink cup to use in<br>the soda machine.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
