<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Babies, as well as those who cannot comprehend right and wrong (such as<br>mentally disabled people), are not held accountable for their sin.<br><br>Jesus lays down this principle in John 9. In essence, God does not<br>condemn people for things they are unable to do. So babies, and people<br>who cannot comprehend right from wrong, are not held accountable for<br>their original sin. It is only after a person is able to recognize right<br>from wrong (sometimes called the age of accountability) that they are<br>held accountable for unbelief.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
