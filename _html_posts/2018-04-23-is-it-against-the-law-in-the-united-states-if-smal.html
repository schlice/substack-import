<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it against the law in the United States if small kids pee in public<br>or in open areas?**<br><br>There are technically no age limits when it comes to public indecency or<br>indecent exposure laws, so *technically* it is illegal.<br><br>But kids are kids. I have, on more than one occasion, pulled over so<br>that one of my boys could run into the tall grass and pee because he<br>just couldn't hold it any longer. I think you'd be hard pressed to find<br>a cop that would ticket the parent of a small child who had to pee,<br>unless there were extenuating circumstances (i.e. in the middle of a big<br>city instead of out in the suburbs, on someone's lawn instead of in an<br>open field, etc). Remember, sanitation is also a concern, not just<br>indecent exposure.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
