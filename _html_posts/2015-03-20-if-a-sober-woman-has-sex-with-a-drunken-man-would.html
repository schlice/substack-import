<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If the man was too drunk to consent to sex, he could<br>charge the sober woman with rape. And no, physical arousal does not<br>constitute consent.\<br>\<br>Best advice I can offer: try to avoid having sex with drunk guys. If<br>they\'ll have sex with you only when they\'re drunk, move on. They\'re<br>not worth it and you\'re better than that.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
