<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I can\'t answer for RCAF, but in the USAF, if you\'re a<br>pilot, there\'s a virtual 100% chance that you\'re going to deploy at<br>one time or another.\<br>\<br>The only difference may have to do with the airframe. Long-haul aircraft<br>can do a three day mission overseas and return without requiring<br>deployments. But even they will deploy when resources need to be staged<br>closer to a particular theater. With global reach being the norm,<br>shorter deployments are becoming more frequent.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
