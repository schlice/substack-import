<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How many taxpayers' dollars has President Trump spent traveling on the<br>Air Force One while campaigning for his 2020 bid, his rallies, and his<br>appearances to support other Republicans\' campaigns?**<br><br>Specifically for AF1, zero. Any campaigning trips are paid for by the<br>Republican National Committee, even if the President is flying on<br>military aircraft.<br><br>That said, the President is always protected by Secret Service, and the<br>President has other staff that travels with him wherever he goes. He<br>sends an Advance Team ahead of him to prep the location for his arrival.<br>All of this is due to the fact that he is the President of the United<br>States and is irrespective of the purpose of the travel. Those costs are<br>indeed paid by taxpayer dollars.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
