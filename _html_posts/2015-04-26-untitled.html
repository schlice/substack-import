<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [The fuel also burns under high pressure, which is why it<br>needed an accelerant on the ground or in order to start the engine. The<br>stuff just does not burn otherwise. There was one incident while I was<br>Active Duty where a KC-135 had both JP-4 and JP-7 in its wing tanks, and<br>it hit a ground obstruction. The JP-4 caught on fire, and the JP-7 put<br>it out.\<br>\<br>They only gave the plane enough fuel to get off the ground and get up to<br>the fueling orbit. It would tank, then go on its way. Starting the<br>engines was a hazardous job.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-interesting-vehicle-land-sea-or-air-you-know-about/answer/Waleed-Kadous<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
