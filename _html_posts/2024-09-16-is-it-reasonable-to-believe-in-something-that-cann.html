<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **Is it reasonable to believe in something that cannot be seen or<br>> felt?**<br><br>Certainly! You believe in many things which cannot be seen or felt, and<br>you probably don't even realize it. By "seen or felt," we're talking<br>about things which can be interpreted by the senses, and proven by<br>science. Here's an example of just five things that can't be<br>scientifically proven but that we're all rational to accept:<br><br>- Math and logic. Science can't prove them because science presupposes<br>  them, so to prove them by science would be circular reasoning.<br>- Metaphysical truths, such as there are minds that exist outside of my<br>  own, or that the external world is real, or that the past was not<br>  created five minutes ago but has the appearance of age.<br>- Ethical beliefs about statements of value (i.e. you can't show by<br>  science whether the Nazis were evil)<br>- Aesthetic judgments. The beautiful, like the good, cannot be proven<br>  through science.<br><br>And most surprisingly:<br><br>- Science itself. Science cannot be justified by the scientific method.<br>  For example, in the special theory of relativity, there is an<br>  assumption that the speed of light is constant between two points in a<br>  single direction, but that cannot be proven. You have to assume that<br>  to be true in order to do your experiment. Also, the belief that the<br>  scientific method discovers truth itself cannot be proven by the<br>  scientific method. You also have to assume that to be true in order to<br>  do your experiment.<br><br>> **Why do people believe in things like God, even though they cannot be<br>> perceived by the senses?**<br><br>Let me ask you a question: *why do you think that the senses are the<br>only way to discover truth?* In other words, do you believe that the<br>scientific method is the only way to discover truth? As we have already<br>discovered, the belief that the scientific method produces truth cannot<br>be proven through the scientific method, and clearly, to try to do so<br>would be circular logic anyway, so it is a self-defeating statement.<br><br>The truth is that the senses are just *one way* to discover truth, but<br>they are not the *only* way. We need a different toolset to discover<br>truths about things which cannot be perceived with the senses, because<br>clearly science is not the right method.<br><br>It is through the realm of philosophy and logic that we probe truths<br>which cannot be proven using science. Philosophy helps us to discover<br>truths about things which cannot be determined using the senses. In this<br>way, we can come to a belief about the existence of God beyond a<br>reasonable doubt (but not beyond all doubt).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
