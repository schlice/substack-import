Make sure you hire a real estate attorney and that they specialize<br>in HOA litigation in your area, as laws surrounding HOA authority vary<br>wildly. While the legislature in most places gives broad authority to<br>HOAs, the judiciary in most places applies the most narrow construction<br>to HOA rulings that they can possibly get away with, so it's definitely<br>not a futile act.<br><br>As was already pointed out, it may actually end up being cheaper to sell<br>your existing home and to buy a home in an area not so tightly<br>controlled.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
