<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We need to dissect your question because it's actually two questions.<br><br>1.  Can the military disobey the president's orders? As most folks<br>    have already answered here, the military can, and is taught how to,<br>    disobey direct orders which violate the Constitution or the law in<br>    general.<br>2.  Can they refuse to go to war if they know it is wrong? You<br>    didn't clarify what "wrong" means. Do you mean "illegal?" Or do you<br>    mean "morally incongruent with their beliefs?"<br><br>The military can only disobey *illegal* orders. If you receive a<br>*legal* order that you don't like because you don't think the US<br>should be involved in a war there, or you think war is bad, or you think<br>the president is an immoral buffoon and so shouldn't be allowed to wage<br>war anywhere, you cannot disobey that order. You do not get paid<br>enough to make those kinds of decisions. Those are someone else's job to<br>make, not you. If you do decide that you don't want to go to war because<br>you believe that the US should not be involved in that war, or you think<br>that war, in general, is morally wrong, you are called a *conscientious<br>objector.* There is [[a very long<br>process](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=424726&url=http://girightshotline.org/en/military-knowledge-base/topic/conscientious-objection-discharge%23topic-if-you-are-facing-deployment){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="girightshotline.org"}]{.qlink_container} that you go through<br>when you wish to claim conscientious objector status, or a conscientious<br>objector discharge, and it involves counseling, forms, questionnaires,<br>and letters from friends and family describing how you live your beliefs<br>in the rest of your life outside of military service. It's not just as<br>easy as saying, "I don't wanna go." But it can be done.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
