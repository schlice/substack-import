<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you saw my [[pinned<br>post](https://multiplesclerosisforum.quora.com/MS-and-COVID-19)]{.qlink_container}<br>in the space, you'd know that MS doesn't mean anything when it comes to<br>COVID-19. People with MS aren't more or less likely to contract<br>COVID-19.<br><br>Where MS patients *can* run into difficulty with COVID is the particular<br>disease-modifying drug (DMD) we are taking. The vaccine may be hindered<br>by our particular DMD and may not be effective. Or there could be other<br>negative interactions between the vaccine and our particular DMD. So<br>whether or not it is safe to get vaccinated is dependent on the<br>particular DMD you are on.<br><br>MS patients in particular should work directly with their neurologists<br>to discuss the benefits and possible side effects of getting the<br>COVID-19 vaccine.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
