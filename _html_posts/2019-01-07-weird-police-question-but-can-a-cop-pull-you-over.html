Can a cop demand that you break<br>the law to pull you over or would that be considered entrapment?**<br><br>*Can* a police officer do this? Yes, they can. Is it entrapment? No, it<br>is not. You were following a lawful directive by a police officer.<br>Entrapment is when a government agent entices you to break a law that<br>you would not normally break. When an officer gives you a directive, you<br>are bound by law to follow it, or you could be charged with failing to<br>follow a lawful order. The order is lawful because a police officer gave<br>you the order while performing his official duty under color of law, not<br>because what he's asking you to do would be otherwise illegal. If it<br>were entrapment, then it would be a natural catch-22. You either follow<br>the directive and you are guilty of breaking the law, or you fail to<br>follow the directive and you are guilty of breaking the law.<br><br>In practice, the officer will simply wait behind you until the light<br>turns green and you are safely through the intersection before he<br>activates his lights. Or he'll activate his lights behind you at the red<br>light and he'll use the PA system to advise you that once the light<br>turns green you are to proceed through the intersection and then pull<br>over.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
