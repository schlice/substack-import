<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are three things you can do to get out of having to pay a fine<br>from a red light camera?**<br><br>Hi<br>[Ryan(https://www.quora.com/profile/Ryan-Patton-34)]{.qlink_container},<br>thanks for the A2A. Please note that I am not a lawyer and this is not<br>legal advice.<br><br>A lot of people here are telling you "don't run red lights." While an<br>obvious answer, it doesn't help you if you've already gotten a ticket in<br>the mail.<br><br>Legally speaking, there are lots of things you can do, but the problem<br>is that laws for red light cameras and how they are implemented vary by<br>state. You're going to have to research your local laws and see what you<br>can do.<br><br>For example, here in Colorado, we have a number of cities with red light<br>cameras. Here, you can choose to simply not pay the ticket. State<br>law says that the city has 90 days to serve you with the ticket, or it<br>is invalid. And any city process server can serve you with the ticket;<br>it does not have to be a police officer. And they don't have to serve<br>the driver; any adult at the driver's home can be served with the ticket<br>and it is valid. Here, you would have to try to avoid the process server<br>for three months, and they work odd hours so they can catch an adult at<br>home. Don't be surprised if someone rings your doorbell at 6:00 AM. They<br>may also try to send the ticket via certified mail. If you don't sign<br>for it within the 90 day window, the ticket is similarly invalid.<br><br>*Once they know someone has received the ticket,* and you don't pay, the<br>fine goes up. And while it doesn't add points to your license, if you<br>fail to pay and they send it to collections, it can negatively impact<br>your credit score.<br><br>If you can prove that it was not you driving the car, you can also<br>get out of the ticket, but you will have to prove it. For example, if a<br>male owns the car and a female was driving it at the time, it may be as<br>simple as sending them a copy of your driver's license so they can see<br>that you were not the driver.<br><br>Also law on the books here in Colorado: **red light cameras and speed<br>vans must have posted signs warning drivers**. This is why you need to<br>research your local laws. If you saw the camera flash but you didn't see<br>a sign, you should drive around the block and check for signage. Take<br>pictures of the intersection and take note of any signage that is<br>missing. You could then use that information to dispute the ticket in<br>court. You should ideally do that on the same day you see the camera<br>flash so that you can say, "I saw the flash and drove around the block<br>and took these pictures" so that you can show the lack of signage on the<br>day of the incident.<br><br>That's just an example of three things you can do in Colorado to get out<br>of a red light camera violation, but again, these are highly dependent<br>on Colorado law. There are others depending on the type of violation you<br>receive (for example, if you didn't run the light but you are blocking<br>the crosswalk, it will send you a smaller fine for that).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
