<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [For most factory alarm systems which include starter<br>disablers, the key fob is important as this is how the alarm system is<br>disabled and the starter interlock is released.\<br>\<br>There are thoughts that thieves will use rolling-code broadcasters to<br>\"brute-force\" attack a vehicle. The idea behind this is that the thief<br>will approach the vehicle with a laptop and a broadcast module and will<br>try every code that the manufacturer uses to remotely unlock the doors.<br>Since the passive key fob is the more attractive option (as opposed to<br>the active key fob, which can be equipped with rolling-code technology<br>like your garage door), it is the more attractive target. Find the right<br>frequency and code, and you can unlock the door. Understand though that<br>this attack can take several minutes of a thief sitting within 30<br>centimeters of your car door with a laptop.\<br>\<br>Other ideas which have been floated:\<br>]<br><br>- The thieves are using active jamming, so you think you locked your<br>  doors but the signal never made it to your car. The thief then enters<br>  your unlocked car.<br>- The thieves are using amplification and rebroadcast (again, only<br>  useful for passive fobs) whereby in a multi-phase attack, they record<br>  the signal being broadcast by your car, then use a power booster to<br>  broadcast that signal at your house and listen for a return code from<br>  your passive key fob), then broadcast that passive code at your car<br>  and *voila*, it\'s open.<br><br>None of these attacks are sophisticated enough to fit into a little<br>black box that a thief can waltz up to your car and touch the door<br>handle and the car will magically open. So there\'s really little to<br>worry about as far as your true safety is concerned. Thieves will use<br>traditional theft methods (smash-and-grab, slim jims, etc) to get into<br>your car.\<br>\<br>If you\'re concerned about someone blasting your car\'s frequency into<br>your house and listening for a return signal from your passive key fob,<br>you can place your keys in the microwave or the freezer. These both act<br>as Faraday cages and will effectively prevent them from responding to<br>any signal, as they won\'t get a signal in or out of those boxes. There<br>are also small bags that block all RF frequencies, normally used for<br>cell phones when you want to be sure that they are not broadcasting.<br>Placing your fob in one of these bags will prevent it from broadcasting<br>when you\'re not using it.\<br>\<br>Otherwise, you\'re pretty safe as long as you protect your vehicle<br>against traditional attacks.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
