<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*TRIGGER WARNING:* *Truth Bombs Inbound! If you subscribe to this<br>glorified notion of concealed carriers saving the day for you, this<br>answer will likely trigger you:*<br><br>Gun owners who are also concealed carriers carry weapons for **their own<br>protection and the protection of their families.**<br><br>Gun owners who are also concealed carriers DO NOT carry weapons **to<br>protect other people.**<br><br>Concealed carriers are not self-appointed public servants who shoot at<br>others when they are not threatened. That's called *assault* and if they<br>kill that person, that's called *murder.*<br><br>Granted, their criminal sentence might be reduced (or possibly<br>eliminated) if they saved the lives of others, if public opinion is<br>clearly in favor of the concealed carrier, and if the District Attorney<br>is feeling especially generous, but they are certainly not outside the<br>fiscal reach of the alleged criminal's family, and they would most<br>certainly be sued for wrongful death. Police officers are protected by<br>*qualified immunity* from such lawsuits, but citizen concealed carriers<br>are not. And I don't have the money to pay millions in a wrongful death<br>suit to the estate of the alleged criminal.<br><br>And don't think for one second that the family of the alleged criminal<br>(note he's only an alleged criminal because he is dead and never had the<br>opportunity to be adjudicated a criminal) won't breathlessly portray him<br>as a saint who would never hurt a fly and there must be some reason he<br>was there with a gun, and blah blah blah. It happened in the case of<br>Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO. Michael used his size to intimidate a<br>shopkeeper, but after he was shot by police (when he tried to do the<br>same to the officer), his family painted him as "the gentle giant" who<br>would never hurt a soul. One of these descriptions is accurate, and one<br>is an embellishment. They can't both be accurate.<br><br>When you take a concealed carry class, you are taught one very important<br>phrase which should stick with you when you carry: "Every bullet you<br>fire has a lawyer attached to it." In other words, you had better be<br>*ultra sure* you are only employing your firearm **because you are in<br>fear for your own life**, or you are in fear for your family's life.<br>Because if you fire a gun at a person in any other situation, while you<br>may not ultimately go to jail, you will be sued. And you may lose.<br><br>Otherwise, the other victims should probably have bought their own guns,<br>gone through the process to get their own CC permits, and should have<br>been protecting themselves, not relying on the kindness of strangers or<br>the timely response of the police.<br><br>I will say this: Yes, defense of others is a valid form of self defense<br>in most states, but I am not ready to become the legal guinea pig in<br>this story.<br><br>That said: IF circumstances are absolutely perfect, and IF a<br>mass shooter is simply walking around the vicinity mindlessly gunning<br>people down, and IF I have excellent cover, and IF my family is<br>safe, and IF have the perfect shot, I would *consider* taking it.<br>But no guarantees. It would have to be the ideal situation before I<br>stepped in with my personal carry gun to intervene. And even then, I<br>do so at great risk to myself. There's a good chance I'll be arrested,<br>and probably just as fair a chance that I'll be released later, but I'd<br>have to be willing to take that risk.<br><br>Most of the time, I wouldn't.<br><br>TL;DR: *My priority as a concealed carrier is to protect myself and<br>my family.*<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If a gun owner who is well trained in the use of firearms happen to be<br>in the vicinity of a mass shooting, should the gun owner attempt to be a<br>hero and try to shoot the shooter or should he let the police deal with<br>the situation?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
