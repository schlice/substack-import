The phrase "the right of the people" is<br>used three times in the Bill of Rights, and each time it is used, it<br>denotes "the whole of the people," not a separate group segregated by<br>membership in an organization.<br><br>So even if the first part was meant to limit the Second Amendment to<br>militia membership, why state "the right of the people"? Why not state<br>"the right of the militia"?<br><br>Because the first statement was not meant to limit the second.<br><br>The Supreme Court has ruled exactly this way.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
