<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There have been over one million cases of American<br>citizens using guns to stop or prevent crime, many of these without a<br>single shot being fired. So even if he is a bad shot, he can do some<br>good. Still, I\'d be less worried about him than the criminal, in terms<br>of mindset and who is more willing to kill people abjectly.\<br>\<br>Citizens who get involved prevent crime. On average, fewer deaths occur<br>when citizens intervene, and there doesn\'t even have to be guns<br>involved. I think that also speaks to his willingness to<br>help.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
