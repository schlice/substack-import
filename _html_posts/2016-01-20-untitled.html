<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*I was under the impression that automatic weapons and assault rifles<br>were used in mass shootings.*<br><br>Nope. Very few people have actual automatic weapons. They are very rare<br>and difficult to come by. I can\'t remember a mass shooting that used an<br>automatic weapon. \"Assault weapons\" are a category of gun identified<br>by scary-looking attachments like pistol grips, Change the grip and the<br>stock and the weapon suddenly becomes not an assault weapon. It<br>fires the same round, at the same velocity, with the same accuracy, and<br>the same capacity. But because it has a wooden stock and foregrip, it\'s<br>suddenly no longer an assault weapon? Ridiculous term invented by the<br>media and the anti-gun lobby.<br><br>*Gun control in Australia has led to a 100% decrease in mass shootings.*<br><br>Don\'t let the facts get in the way of your rhetoric, though. While some<br>of the mass murders since the gun ban have used the new favorite murder<br>method in Australia (arson), there have been no fewer than TEN mass<br>murders in Australia since the gun ban, most committed with \...wait for<br>it\... guns.<br><br>[[List of massacres in<br>Australia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8a5d70&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_Australia){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>*The constitution is there to serve the people, not the other way round.<br>It can be, and has been, amended. It is not some piece of holy writ<br>handed by God.*<br><br>Very true. However, our rights did, in fact, come from God. It\'s in<br>the Declaration of Independence<br><br>\"\...they have been endowed by their Creator \that\'s God\ with<br>certain inalienable rights, among these are the right to life, liberty,<br>and the pursuit of happiness.\"<br><br>The Constitution actually just prevents government from infringing my<br>rights, which I already had. Government can\'t ever really take my<br>rights away. The Constitution, therefore, is the barrier that prevents<br>government from infringing on my rights.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Are-the-NRA-and-gun-advocates-aiding-and-abetting-mass-shootings/answer/Dan-B-1472<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
