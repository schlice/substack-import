<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It is not illegal to send naked photos of yourself in the United States<br>unless you are under 18 in most states. If you are under 18, this is<br>considered *distribution of child pornography* and the recipient can be<br>guilty of *receiving* or being in *possession of child pornography*.<br><br>If you are over 18, you can still get into trouble for sending naked<br>photos of yourself to someone under 18. This would be considered<br>*contributing to the delinquincy of a minor* and if you are a person in<br>a position of authority, you could be charged with *abuse or<br>contributing to the delinquency of a minor by a person in a position of<br>trust.*<br><br>If the sender and receiver are both over 18, the distribution of naked<br>pictures is not a violation of law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
