<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What is a "right against searches?" Where is this right recorded?<br><br>Last I checked, the Constitution had a similar right listed. It was in<br>the 4th Amendment, and it said that you have a right against<br>*unreasonable* search without first obtaining a warrant.<br><br>See, details matter.<br><br>So what's an "unreasonable" search? Is a search before voluntarily<br>entering a protected building reasonable? Is a search for guns prior to<br>entering a "gun-free zone" reasonable?<br><br>The courts have indeed ruled that such searches are considered<br>reasonable. So no warrant is required.<br><br>The Constitution says nothing about not being subjected to searches<br>before entering sterile areas, like airport terminals.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If courthouses require compulsory searches for entry and jury duty<br>requires a person to enter the courthouse, how is a jury member's right<br>against searches maintained?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
