<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>1.  I don't understand what "can't be rebuilt" means. You can always<br>    raze the rubble and build a totally new building where the old one<br>    stood. Thankfully, HOAs have insurance on their buildings, just like<br>    you do on your house. If the property is destroyed, insurance will<br>    pay most of the cost to rebuild it. Your HOA may need to do a<br>    special assessment to raise money to furnish it again, but insurance<br>    will cover most of the cost.<br>2.  What happens to the HOA? Nothing. The HOA still exists even if the<br>    clubhouse gets destroyed. The bylaws don't burn; they're on file<br>    with the county government.<br><br>Don't worry, your HOA will be fine. They will survive a fire.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What happens to a homeowners\' association (HOA) if the building is<br>destroyed by a fire and can\'t be rebuilt?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
