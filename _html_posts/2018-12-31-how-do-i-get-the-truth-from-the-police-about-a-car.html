They say I was the only driver involved & at fault but this<br>is completely false.**<br><br>The short answer: you don't.<br><br>If the police report says you were the only driver involved and at<br>fault, then that's the end of it. Unless you have a witness to refute<br>the police report (such as the other driver), then you're outta luck.<br>The police report isn't the last word because it's always right; the<br>police report is always right because it's the last word.<br><br>Secondly, what do you hope to gain by "getting the truth?" A moral<br>victory? Generally, the statute of limitations is less than five years,<br>so it's unlikely you'd be able to actually make a claim even after your<br>report was corrected.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
