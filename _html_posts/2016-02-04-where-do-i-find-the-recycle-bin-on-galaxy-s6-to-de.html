<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The S6 (as with any Android phone) does not have a \"recycle bin.\" If<br>you delete a video file and your free space was not reduced, then your<br>used space isn\'t being taken up by videos (not appreciably anyway).<br><br>I would highly suggest downloading DU Speed Booster from the Google<br>Play store. It will do a thorough analysis of your phone and help you to<br>remove any junk you have out there that is unnecessary. Best of all,<br>it\'s free.<br><br>From the app\'s main menu, choose \"Trash Cleaner\" and let it do its<br>bit.<br><br>While the speed booster and trash cleaner functions are still relevant<br>today, I'd try to steer clear of the "battery saver" functions. If<br>you're on a modern Android version (i.e. 7.0 or higher), the operating<br>system does a fine job of managing processes which might be draining<br>your battery. You do have to give it a little time to figure it out, but<br>it will.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
