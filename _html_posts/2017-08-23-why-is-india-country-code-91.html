<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The +91 is called the country code.<br><br>As the phone system was expanded outside of the United States, we<br>realized that we needed to either expand the number of digits for<br>everyone, or to add a prefix to identify the country to which the<br>call should be routed.<br><br>If you are in the United States, the country code is 1. To tell the<br>switching system you want to make an international call, you first dial<br>011, then add the country code (i.e. 44 for the UK or 91 for India), and<br>then add the remainder of the phone number.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
