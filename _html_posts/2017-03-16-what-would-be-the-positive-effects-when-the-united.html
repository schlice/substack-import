<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I added "hypothetical scenarios" to your list of topics for this<br>question, because clearly, it's a hypothetical. You do know in reality<br>that this will never happen, right? You would need a Constitutional<br>amendment and the will of a clear majority of America. You don't have<br>either.<br><br>The only "net positive" that would come from the US removing firearms<br>\implied: from people who follow the law\ is that there might be fewer<br>accidental shootings in homes where firearms are left unsecured. You<br>might prevent a few accidental deaths.<br><br>There would be vast and far-reaching net negatives from removing<br>firearms from law-abiding citizens.<br><br>You can't remove firearms from those who choose not to follow the law.<br>Simply won't happen. So you can never remove all firearms. You would<br>only be removing firearms from people who follow the law (we call them<br>"law-abiding citizens").<br><br>Some gun owners may choose to retain their guns and become criminals.<br><br>I could go on and on with the negatives. But unless you find a way to<br>magically make all guns disappear, along with the knowledge about how to<br>build one, you can never get rid of all firearms.
