<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Hmm.<br><br>14th Amendment, Section 3:<br><br>> *No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or<br>> elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or<br>> military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having<br>> previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of<br>> the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an<br>> executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the<br>> Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection<br>> or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies<br>> thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of each House,<br>> remove such disability.*<br><br>So let's take a look at how we got here (the point where we needed a<br>14th Amendment).<br><br>First, we need to understand that the 13th, the 14th, and the 15th<br>Amendments are what we call the *Reconstruction Amendments*. They<br>were passed after the Civil War to "reconstruct" the United States and<br>to right some of the wrongs perpetrated by the Confederate states.<br><br>> Soon after losing the Civil War in 1865, those states began to send<br>> unrepentant former Confederates (such as the Confederacy\'s former<br>> vice president, Alexander H. Stephens) to Washington as senators and<br>> representatives. Congress refused to seat them and drafted Section 3<br>> (sometimes called the Insurrection Clause or Disqualification Clause)<br>> to constitutionally bar from federal or state office anyone who,<br>> having taken an oath as a public official to support the Constitution,<br>> \"engaged in insurrection or rebellion\" against that document or lent<br>> \"aid or comfort\" to its enemies. Congress can later remove a<br>> disqualification by a two-thirds majority of each house. Southerners<br>> strongly opposed the clause, arguing that it would hurt national<br>> reunification.<br>><br>> Section 3 does not specify how it is to be invoked, but Section 5 says<br>> Congress has enforcement power. Accordingly, Congress enforced Section<br>> 3 by enacting Sections 14 and 15 of the Enforcement Act of 1870, the<br>> pertinent portion of which was repealed in 1948; there is still a<br>> current federal statute (18 U.S.C. ยง 2383) that was initially part of<br>> the Confiscation Act of 1862 (and revised in 1948), disqualifying<br>> insurrectionists from any federal office. Based on precedent, Congress<br>> would need only a simple majority from both houses to impose a<br>> disqualification. Additionally, Congress can impeach a federal<br>> officeholder, as it did to disqualify federal judge West Humphreys for<br>> insurrection before the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. In Trump<br>> v. Anderson (2024), the Supreme Court held that Congress determines<br>> eligibility under Section 3 for federal officeholders and states may<br>> only bar candidates from state office.\[1\](#qAdrW){#cite-qAdrW<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>So as you can see, it is Congress which determines whether or not<br>someone is to be disqualified under Section 3, and a simple majority<br>from both houses would be all you would need to disqualify a President<br>as ineligible to serve.<br><br>And the case has already been to the Supreme Court in *Trump v.<br>Anderson* (2024), and it was specifically about Trump being removed from<br>state ballots because he was being labeled as someone who was not<br>qualified under Section 3. SCOTUS said that Congress determines<br>eligibility for federal officeholders, and states may only bar<br>candidates from state office.<br><br>So therefore, if Congress moves to disqualify the President, then he is<br>disqualified. If they do not, then he is not.<br><br>It's really that simple.<br><br>You are certainly free to hold the *opinion* that he is ineligible under<br>Section 3, but until Congress disqualifies him, then he remains<br>qualified. Your opinion does not make him ineligible or an<br>"unconstitutional President." Your opinion is your own. Congress is the<br>only authorized body which is able to make that determination, and since<br>everyone (including the President) is innocent until proven guilty,<br>he will have to actually be disqualified by Congress before he is<br>actually ineligible to serve.<br><br>\<br><br>But let's say you get your wish and Trump is disqualified under Section<br>3 of the 14th Amendment. What then what would happen? You'd have<br>President JD Vance for the next four years, and he will be able to<br>appoint his own Vice President. Is that the configuration you're<br>hoping for? Because that's what you'll get.<br><br>Be careful what you wish for.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-qAdrW){.citation_index} [[Fourteenth Amendment to the<br>United States Constitution -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fdf681&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution%23Section_3:_Disqualification_from_office_for_insurrection_or_rebellion){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
