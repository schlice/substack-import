<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>He is still a sitting Supreme Court Justice because he has not been<br>impeached.<br><br>The Constitution is abundantly clear on this point. Supreme Court<br>Justices are subject to impeachment. If there was proof, as you claim,<br>that he "sold his vote for gifts," then that evidence should be<br>presented to Congress so that they can begin Articles of Impeachment<br>against him.<br><br>To date, no such evidence has been presented to Congress, and Congress<br>has not begun impeachment procedures against him.<br><br>If you are aware of such evidence, you need to get it to your<br>Congressional Representative so that they can begin impeachment<br>proceedings.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
