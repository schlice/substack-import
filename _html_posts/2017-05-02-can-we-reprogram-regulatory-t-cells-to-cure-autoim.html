<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm going to take issue with your terminology. You said that the<br>reprogramming of T cells constitutes a cure. I believe it does not.<br><br>A *cure* would be something that was changed in the body that prevented<br>cancer cells from forming. This, instead, is a *lifelong treatment*, not<br>a *cure*. This is essentially a constant fight between the cancer cells<br>and the T cells that your body will now have to endure, no doubt enabled<br>by some new drug to keep the T cells behaving in the way we want them<br>to. You have to take this medicine for the rest of your life. Does that<br>sound like a "cure" to you? Not to me. To me, that sounds like an<br>eternal workaround.<br><br>A cure would prevent the cancer from appearing in the first place.<br><br>So can we cure MS by reprogramming T cells? No, we cannot. We may be<br>able to eliminate MS symptoms and prevent MS attacks by making the<br>immune system work more efficiently, but have we really addressed the<br>cause of the immune system's improper attacking of healthy body tissues?<br>Until we do that, we don't really have a cure, but a lifelong treatment.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
