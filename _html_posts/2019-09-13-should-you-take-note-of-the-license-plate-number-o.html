You can take that license plate to the police agency which<br>covers that stretch of road and file a citizen's complaint. Yes, you<br>will have to do it in person. But if the passing was egregious enough to<br>you, then you can go and file.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
