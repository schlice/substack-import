<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(US-based answer. Outside the US, your mileage may vary.)*<br><br>> *Who owns the parking space in front of shops and houses legally?*<br><br>Whoever owns the street or the parking lot.<br><br>If the spaces are on a city owned and managed street, the city owns the<br>spaces. If a business association owns and maintains the street, the<br>spaces are owned and managed by the business association. If the spaces<br>are in a parking lot, it is the owner of the parking lot who owns the<br>spaces.<br><br>The picture you posted does not make clear who owns the "street"<br>pictured. It could either belong to the city, or it could belong to the<br>business association which owns the buildings.<br><br>Regardless, the owner of the land under the car also owns the spaces.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
