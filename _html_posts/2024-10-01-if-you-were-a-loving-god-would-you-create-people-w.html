<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you were a loving God, would you create people who had no free will<br>and who could do nothing but love you? Would you create meat-robots<br>who could not make choices of their own?<br><br>> The beauty of God's creation is that if you're not willing to accept<br>> Christianity, then you're free to reject it. This freedom to make<br>> choices---even the freedom to reject truth---is what makes us moral<br>> creatures and enables each of us to choose our ultimate destiny.<br>><br>> This really hits at the heart of why we exist at all, and why God<br>> might not be as overt in revealing Himself to us as you would like.<br>><br>> For if the Bible is true, then God has provided each of us with the<br>> opportunity to make an eternal choice to either accept Him or reject<br>> Him. And in order to ensure that our choice is truly free, He puts us<br>> in an environment that is filled with evidence of His existence, but<br>> without his *direct* presence---a presence so powerful that it could<br>> overwhelm our freedom and thus negate our ability to reject Him.<br>><br>> In other words, God has provided enough evidence in this life to<br>> convince anyone *willing to believe*, yet He has also left some<br>> ambiguity so as not to compel the *unwilling*.<br>><br>> In this way, God gives us the opportunity either to love Him or to<br>> reject Him without violating our freedom. In fact, the purpose of this<br>> life is to make that choice freely and without coercion. For love, by<br>> definition, must be freely given. It cannot be<br>> coerced.\[1\](#gUpnv){#cite-gUpnv .citation_link}<br><br>Do you think God is *happy* about people rejecting Him? Of course not.<br>He wants everyone to be saved. But by the same token, He is willing to<br>let people decide for themselves whether they will love Him or reject<br>Him, and thus make their own choices about their own eternal destinies.<br><br>C.S. Lewis quipped that hell has a door which is locked from the inside.<br>In other words, people with free will have chosen their eternal destiny<br>willingly.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-gUpnv){.citation_index} [[I Don\'t Have Enough Faith to Be<br>an<br>Atheist](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a7ef26&url=https://a.co/d/3B7lDsD){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="a.co"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
