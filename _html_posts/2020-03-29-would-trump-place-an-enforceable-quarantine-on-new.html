<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would Trump place an enforceable quarantine on New York simply because<br>he doesn\'t want them to flee to Florida?**<br><br>The more important question: *why should he have to?*<br><br>New York did not go as far as California, which issued a<br>shelter-in-place order. New York simply said stay inside as much as<br>possible, but they're not preventing people from traveling. They didn't<br>close the airports to non-essential travel. New York's rules are<br>targeted at businesses, gatherings, and people over 70. Other than that,<br>the governor told people to stay inside as much as possible.<br><br>Since New York is a "hotbed" of disease, or a "focal point" for<br>outbreak, they become a target for review. If New York is not doing<br>enough to curb non-essential travel, then the Federal government may be<br>forced to step in.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
