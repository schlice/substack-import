<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First, you have to have *standing*. You either need to be the police<br>department, or you need to be the towing company. You can't file a<br>lawsuit to uphold the provisions of a contract on someone else's behalf.<br>If the parties to the contract won't uphold the contract, you can't<br>legally *make* them.<br><br>If you *are* the police department or the towing company, great! Get a<br>lawyer.<br><br>If you are *not* the police department or the towing company, you could<br>perhaps talk to one of those parties and have them enforce their<br>contract, but unless you're a party to the contract, you can't legally<br>force them to uphold their contractual obligations.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
