<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not at all.<br><br>You can believe that vaccination is the right choice for most people,<br>but still believe that people have the right to choose for themselves<br>what is best.<br><br>The big kicker: **simply believing that vaccination is the right choice<br>for most people does not mean that you can force people to get<br>vaccinated.**<br><br>**It also does not mean that you have the right to exclude those people<br>from society, or deny them essential services.**<br><br>This is where the majority of people fall down when they are comparing<br>the ability of a person to decide for themselves whether or not<br>vaccination is appropriate.<br><br>*If you truly believe that people have the right to choose for<br>themselves, then you have no right to exclude them from any facet of<br>society because of their choice.*<br><br>Don\'t get me wrong, businesses still have the right to determine which<br>patrons come into their establishment. And if the business (except in<br>Florida) wants to restrict patrons in their business to people who are<br>vaccinated, they can do that.<br><br>But you can\'t deny hospital beds to the unvaccinated. You can\'t deny<br>ambulance service to the unvaccinated. You can\'t deny any<br>taxpayer-funded service from the unvaccinated.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
