<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The first thing the government would have to do would be to repeal the<br>2nd, 4th, 5th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution, as well as<br>Article 1, Paragraphs 9 and 10 (they could accomplish such a major<br>re-write during a Constitutional Convention, but because it would be so<br>easy to make wholesale changes to large swaths of the Constitution,<br>states will never authorize such a measure). Specifically, problematic<br>areas of each of those Amendments:<br><br>- 2nd Amendment: Right to Keep and Bear Arms<br>- 4th Amendment: Right to be Free from Unreasonable Search and Seizure<br>- 5th Amendment: Due Process clause<br>- 14th Amendment: Applied Due Process to states<br>- Article 1 Paragraphs 9 and 10: Prevent *ex post facto* laws<br><br>So assuming that they could pass a Constitutional amendment that would<br>repeal the above-listed Amendments and repeal Paragraphs 9 and 10 from<br>Article 1, they could then pass a law making all guns currently owned by<br>citizens illegal. Since you are criminalizing behavior that was<br>previously illegal, you would have to repeal Article 1 Paragraphs 9 and<br>10 to allow you write such an *ex post facto* law. Once you have made<br>gun ownership illegal, you can force citizens to turn in their guns and<br>you wouldn\'t have to reimburse them for the guns, since you repealed<br>the 5th and 14th Amendments. That will save you tons of cash. Which is<br>good, because you\'ll need it for the next phase.<br><br>If there were still guns in circulation (you might, on a good day, get<br>5% of guns turned in voluntarily), you could then authorize the police<br>to go door-to-door to search every house for weapons, and confiscate all<br>the ones you find (your repeal of the 4th Amendment would make this<br>legal). The military is specifically prevented from enforcing any<br>civilian laws under the Posse Comitatus Act, so only local police can<br>accomplish this task. The National Guard can only enforce state laws, so<br>unless a state repealed its own gun protections and outlawed guns (also<br>no guarantees there), the National Guard could also not enforce such a<br>law.<br><br>The police would be heavily stretched as they would have to employ<br>off-duty officers, working overtime, to perform all the confiscations,<br>and that funding would need to come from the Federal government. The<br>cost for the overtime alone would be in the hundreds of millions of<br>dollars. Then the weapons would have to be shipped somewhere and<br>destroyed, another cost in the tens of millions of dollars.<br><br>This wouldn\'t stop the illegal flow of weapons into the country, and<br>also wouldn\'t prevent some gun nut from burying his guns (I assume many<br>would), so you still would go through all this effort and 1. criminals<br>would still have and acquire guns, 2. you\'d never get them all, and 3.<br>you\'d instantly create criminals out of formerly law-abiding citizens,<br>many will choose to remain that way (look at the mandatory registration<br>in Connecticut as an example). All of those hundreds of millions of<br>dollars spent and guns will still be there.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
