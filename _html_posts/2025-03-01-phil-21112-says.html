<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ah yes, free will. God did, in fact, give us free will. He allows us to<br>choose to either love Him or reject Him. Just ask any atheist. They'd<br>love to tell you exactly why they have chosen to reject Him. That's a<br>poignant example of our free will.<br><br>What those atheists have told me (and I only partially believe them) is<br>that *God just isn't forceful enough* in making His presence known to<br>them in order for them to believe. They are like Thomas on steroids.<br>Thomas said that he wouldn't believe Jesus rose from the dead until he<br>touched the nail holes in Jesus' hands and put his hand in Jesus' side<br>where the spear pierced Him. And when Jesus did come back the next time<br>the disciples were all gathered in the upper room, Thomas *did* touch<br>the holes, and he *did believe*.<br><br>The atheists' problem is that even though God has left abundant evidence<br>of His existence, He has also left just enough ambiguity so as to not<br>coerce the unwilling. For love can only be freely given; it can never be<br>coerced.<br><br>\<br><br>That's all well and good, but Jesus did say He is coming back, and the<br>angel said that Jesus would return *in the same way the disciples saw<br>Him leave*. Jesus was assumed into Heaven. That means, when He<br>returns, He will *descend* from Heaven. Imagine that being broadcast<br>on every social media channel and every major news outlet in existence,<br>with firsthand eyewitness accounts of Jesus descending from Heaven.<br><br>Will the atheists believe in Him at that point? Some will, but others<br>will say it's all Hollywood magic or some kind of secret government<br>levitation suit. But eventually, Jesus is going to do stuff on earth,<br>stuff that was foretold in Revelation. And at that point, ***free will<br>is out the door***.<br><br>You had your chance to believe freely. You had your chance to be like<br>Thomas, and touch the nail holes and believe, but you blew it.<br>Eventually, ***every knee will bow, and every tongue will confess that<br>Jesus is Lord*** (Philippians 2:10--11), even if they did so<br>*begrudgingly.*<br><br>But if they did begrudgingly bend the knee, probably even still deriding<br>Jesus while being forced to believe in His existence, ***woe to them.<br>Woe to those who were forced to believe. They will discover the hard way<br>that God is, in fact, real, and eternity is an awfully long time to have<br>made the wrong choice.*** Those people will not share in the same<br>eternity as those who "did not see and yet believed." They will shuffle<br>off to Hell knowing that Jesus is real, and they exercised their free<br>will poorly.<br><br>So this actually *confirms* that free will does exist, because it<br>proves that there are indeed consequences for our choices.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
