Freedom of speech and all.<br><br>You can't sue someone for saying or posting negative things about you.<br><br>You *might* be able to sue someone for lying about you. This is an<br>offense called "defamation." In order to prove defamation, you must<br>prove four things:<br><br>1.  The false statement was made as if it was truth<br>2.  The statement was published or broadcast somewhere, or at least<br>    delivered to a third person<br>3.  The defendant showed, at least, negligence in making the statement<br>4.  Some harm or damages were done to the person bringing the claim<br><br>If you can make all of these claims, you may be able to sue for<br>defamation. If you think you can, you should talk to a lawyer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
