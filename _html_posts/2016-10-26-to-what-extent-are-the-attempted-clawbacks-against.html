<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>> *How possible is it to consider the Pentagon\'s clawbacks against some<br>> California Veterans as "Bills of Attainder?"*<br><br>Two reasons why this will not happen.<br><br>1.  The attempt to retrieve overpayment is not a means to nullify<br>    anyone's civil rights, which is what Bills of Attainder were<br>    intended to do (most notably the right to own property and thus pass<br>    it on to heirs, the right to a title of nobility, and, in at least<br>    the original usage, the right to life itself). This was simply a<br>    payment error, the California National Guard attempting to recoup<br>    losses they suffered when they mistakenly overpaid Guard members by<br>    paying re-enlistment bonuses when the members were not entitled to<br>    that money.<br>2.  Thanks to the kerfuffle that this caused in the Drive-By Media and<br>    subsequently Congress, California's National Guard has already<br>    halted any further attempts to recoup their overpayments, so it<br>    appears now that we won't have any further issues.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
