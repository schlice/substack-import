<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are no instructions from Christ telling Christians to fast. If you<br>can find one, I'd be interested to hear it.<br><br>Fasting is **taking your mind off of the things of this world so<br>that you can focus more on God.**<br><br>Fasting is often in conjunction with periods of prayer (cf Luke 2:37;<br>5:33). In Acts, the apostles would often fast before making big<br>decisions (cf Acts 13:2; 14:23).<br><br>Fasting is most frequently associated with food, but it is not<br>necessarily about food, because you can "fast" from anything. Anything<br>you give up temporarily so that you can focus your attention on God can<br>be considered a fast (cf 1 Corinthians 7:1-5). Fasting should only be<br>done for a limited time, especially if you are fasting from food,<br>because it can be unhealthy and dangerous otherwise.<br><br>Fasting doesn't make God do what we want, either. It also doesn't make<br>God like our ideas more. Fasting is about us, not about God. Fasting<br>is about removing the distractions of life so that we can focus more<br>clearly on God.<br><br>\<br><br>In the part of Romans 14 you referenced, Paul used the example of food,<br>but it's not about eating or not eating. It's about *judging each<br>other.* Paul says that some people might eat meat, and some people might<br>not. But if you eat meat, don't judge the people who don't eat meat. God<br>doesn't, so you shouldn't either.<br><br>And as far as the Sabbath goes, Paul says that some people might<br>consider one day more holy than the rest. Some other people might<br>consider all the days to be equally holy. But regardless of where you<br>stand on the issue, don't judge each other because of those beliefs. God<br>doesn't, so you shouldn't either.<br><br>> Whoever regards one day as special does so to the Lord. Whoever eats<br>> meat does so to the Lord, for they give thanks to God; and whoever<br>> abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God. --- Romans 14:6<br>> NIV<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
