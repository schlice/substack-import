If you need to extend to the middle or the<br>left side of the road, you must do so only when it is safe (i.e. don't<br>rush into oncoming traffic). But again, all jurisdictions are different,<br>and specific regulations vary.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
