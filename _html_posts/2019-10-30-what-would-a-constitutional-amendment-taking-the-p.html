<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What would a constitutional amendment taking the power to regulate (or<br>ban) abortion from both the state and federal governments look like?**<br><br>Not only would it be a complete disaster, but it is completely<br>unnecessary.<br><br>The Constitution already has a way to deal with things that are not in<br>the Constitution. It's called the 10th Amendment.<br><br>It says (paraphrased) that if it's not a power explicitly granted to the<br>Federal Government, it is reserved for the states and the people.<br><br>The problem we have today is that an activist Supreme Court "invented" a<br>right which was not written in the Constitution: the right to privacy.<br>Nowhere in the Constitution can you find a right to privacy. Those words<br>do not exist.<br><br>But they did. They found it. In the "emanations" and "penumbras" of the<br>Constitution.<br><br>This "supposed right" should be unequivocally removed. *Roe*, which was<br>based on that decision, should be overturned.<br><br>The power to decide abortion law should be left with the states.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
