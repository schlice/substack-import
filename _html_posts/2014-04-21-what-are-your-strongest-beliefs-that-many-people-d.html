<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [I have deep convictions that conflict with my own<br/>emotions, as well as others\' beliefs.\<br/>\<br/>The one that gets me in the most trouble: I believe that gay people<br/>should be allowed to marry. I believe that gay people should find a<br/>church that believes the way they do and get married. I also believe<br/>that states should be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not<br/>they want to recognize gay marriage, and whether or not they want to<br/>issue marriage licenses to gay couples. Finally, I believe that the<br/>Federal government (not state governments), if they are going to allow<br/>states to behave this way, should not tie any benefits whatsoever to<br/>marital status. Whether or not states do is up to states. Where people<br/>choose to live can then be based on the state that is most accepting of<br/>them.\<br/>\<br/>That\'s a tough one when you truly believe that gay people should be<br/>allowed to marry, but you also truly believe that states should have the<br/>right to choose whether or not they accept that marriage. It isn\'t fair<br/>to tie any benefits to marital status, especially at the Federal level<br/>if the states are going to decide for themselves. Federal benefits must<br/>be decoupled (no pun intended) from marital status.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
