<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a police officer drove his cruiser into another county could he be<br>pulled over?**<br><br>Generally, rules aren't so different between counties such that<br>something legal in one county is patently illegal in a neighboring<br>county. And if such a situation were to exist, *and* the county in<br>question was so set on charging that offense that they would stop<br>deputies from the neighboring county, you can bet that everyone would<br>know about it and would never break that rule. Besides, I can't imagine<br>a worse environment between two counties actually existing, and there'd<br>have to be a lot of greater issues in that state than just two Sheriffs<br>who disagreed on a particular policy.<br><br>It's never a good practice to have any of your deputies stopping other<br>deputies. It is certainly conceivable where such a situation could take<br>place, but it's really unlikely. What you would normally do is notify<br>your own chain of command what you saw and let them communicate to the<br>other county what they found.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
