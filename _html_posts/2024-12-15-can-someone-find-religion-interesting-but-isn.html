<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Of course you can! Anyone who enjoys history can read the Bible as a<br>historical document and be interested in what it says.<br><br>Also, God doesn't define a standard for what is interesting. God defines<br>a standard for what is *good*. So you can be not religious and still<br>find the Bible and religion interesting.<br><br>However, there is one question that is relevant. *Can you be good<br>without God?* And the answer is yes, you can be good without God, but<br>you cannot claim that you can know for certain what is good without<br>God. Yes, this means that *atheists borrow from the theistic in order to<br>claim that they know what is good.*<br><br>Why? Any knowledge of what is bad implies that you know the standard for<br>good. And if there is no overarching standard for good that applies to<br>*all people*, then you can't universally say that something is *good* or<br>something else is *bad*. It's only good for you. If there is no<br>standard of good, then it may be good for you, and it may be bad for<br>someone else, *but you're both technically right if there is no<br>standard.* Therefore, you can't truly know what is *good*, it's only<br>good *for you*.<br><br>That's why we also say that life only has meaning if you believe in God.<br>Sure, you can *create* your own meaning in life, and that's fine,<br>there's nothing wrong with doing so. But you can't say that what you<br>have found meaning in is applicable to everyone. For example, an atheist<br>could say that they find meaning in learning and finding beauty in<br>nature. But he can't reasonably expect anyone else to do the same.<br>Ultimately, everything that the atheist enjoys is just confined to<br>themselves. That's a really, really lonely existence. Being<br>self-referential is incredibly lonely for creatures who were created for<br>connection. Again, you can say that you are fulfilled in life and your<br>life has all kinds of meaning, but it's all smoke and mirrors. It's not<br>the true connection that you have been designed for. And without God,<br>that loneliness will extend *for all eternity*.<br><br>But it will be so much worse, because even the atheists benefit from<br>living in a world with God today. When they die rejecting God, they will<br>be thrust into a world *without God*, something they haven't experienced<br>yet. So it won't be a continuation of what we have today. It will be<br>utter loneliness. It won't be a party of unbelievers. They're not going<br>to meet Hitler in Hell or some such nonsense like that. It will be *just<br>that one atheist*. No God. No one else. For all eternity. Because that's<br>what you choose when you choose to separate yourself from God.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
