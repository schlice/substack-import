<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Other than the sight picture, there isn\'t much that is<br>the same. Think about it: when you fire a real gun, it\'s a small<br>explosion going off. In your hand. That\'s a bit frightening for anyone.<br>And it\'s much louder and more violent than you would expect. Much more<br>kick than your controller gives you.\<br>\<br>Plus, when you aim down the sights, you have to focus someplace; and<br>when you focus, it\'s on a point somewhere in the distance, so the stuff<br>at further distance and closer distance is blurry. When you shoot, you<br>focus on the front sight. That means the rear sight, and your target,<br>are slightly blurry. Not exactly what you see in the<br>game.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
