<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>They haven't nailed down an exact cause for these fires, but from past<br>experience, it might have something to do with the 75-year old power<br>infrastructure sparking fires.<br><br>(EDIT) Apparently, there have been some arrests for arson, but none of<br>them have been blamed as the cause of the fires.<br><br>Remember when California was turning off power over the summer? Yeah,<br>that was because they wanted to avoid starting fires.<br><br>So in all likelihood, the fires were sparked by old electrical equipment<br>(which is so old that some of it qualifies as national historical<br>landmarks).<br><br>Combine that with historically dry conditions and a state government<br>which can't seem to prioritize getting southern California aquifers and<br>reservoirs filled with water from northern California (which have<br>plenty), as well as forestry mismanagement thanks to liberal<br>environmentalist policies, in addition to local governments defunding<br>fire services in favor of DEI initiatives, and you have what we call a<br>perfect storm.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
