<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can Americans get the States Attorney\'s Office to enforce the<br>Title 18 Sections 241, 242, 245, and 249, against Law Enforcement<br>agencies?**<br><br>Why would the state attorney be reviewing violations of Federal law?<br>It's kinda not his department. The US Department of Justice would be<br>reviewing the case, which they already (usually) do. However, I think<br>you may be confusing *enforcement* with *findings you like*.<br><br>Nearly every time there is an Officer-Involved Shooting (OIS), the<br>Justice Department of the United States investigates the circumstances<br>to see if there are any violations of the victim's rights under Title 18<br>USC Sections 241, 242, 245, or 249. It happens all the time when there<br>is a police shooting, along with reviews of the incident by the District<br>Attorney, and the police department which employs the officer.<br><br>If you have standing (i.e. you are part of the estate of the victim),<br>and the Justice Department has not investigated, you can request that<br>they review the incident. You do have to have standing in order to make<br>that request, however.<br><br>Beyond this narrow scope, the Justice Department does not have<br>enforcement jurisdiction over state law, so you can't get the Federal<br>government to do something that they have not been authorized to do in<br>the Constitution.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
