<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Original question details:*<br>><br>> *Okay, today I have a lot of things to do: water my plants, do my<br>> laundry, read up for an exam, help my neighbour, clean the place, etc.<br>> Why should I add \"worship God\" to the list? What are the<br>> consequences if I keep forgetting to do it or keep postponing to do<br>> it? Will God favor me more if I worship or if I do LOTS and LOTS of<br>> it? Please, tell me the importance of worship, because honestly I<br>> already have a lot of things to do.*<br>><br>> *Update: Sorry if the last bit made my question seem rhetorical. My<br>> point is: Great thinkers and great men, both present and past, worship<br>> (and some, devotedly), so there must be great reasons to do it. What<br>> are they?*<br><br>Let's talk first about why you shouldn't worship God.<br><br>- You shouldn't worship God because you think it will buy you entrance<br>  into heaven.<br>- You shouldn't worship God because you think He demands it.<br>- You shouldn't worship God because you think He needs worship.<br>- You shouldn't worship God because you feel like you're being forced to<br>  do so.<br><br>If you believe any of those things, you have deeper issues than just<br>"should I worship God."<br><br>We worship God because He is worthy of worship.<br><br>That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. We worship God because we love<br>Him and we actively choose to give Him the worship He deserves.<br><br>So if you read that last sentence and asked yourself, "what has God done<br>that gives Him the right to be worshipped," then *that's where the<br>problem lies*. You don't know what God has done for you. So the problem<br>isn't one of understanding why you should worship God. That's just a<br>symptom of your underlying problem, which is understanding what God has<br>done for you which is deserving of worship.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
