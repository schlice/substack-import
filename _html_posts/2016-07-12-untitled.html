<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's too bad that police carry guns.<br><br>Oh wait, so can everyone else.<br><br>Actually, police are \*less\* likely to shoot you than others are. It<br>only \*seems\* like they are because...internet.<br><br>At any rate, I would remind you that there are literally millions and<br>millions of police interactions with the public each year. Very few of<br>those police interactions end in death. In fact, in 2015, police killed<br>a grand total of 990 people. The vast majority of those 990 were either<br>armed or were threatening the police officers in some way.<br><br>In comparison to the over 8000 people killed by homicide every year,<br>that number is strikingly low. In fact, the percentage of people killed<br>by police, per capita, is much lower than the percentage of people<br>killed by citizens.<br><br>(In an unrelated note, the percentage of concealed carry holders who<br>commit *any* crime is far lower than crimes committed by police)<br><br>What I'm saying is that I believe your commentary is pretty much<br>hyperbole. These "abuses" by police because "they hold all the power"<br>simply does not occur in real life. Yes, there are isolated incidents.<br>They may even be considered abuse. But if you, as a victim of what you<br>perceive is police brutality, do not stand up for yourself and hire an<br>attorney to investigate the department's conduct, when will these<br>incidents stop? You can't build a straw man and use it to denigrate the<br>police as a whole, especially if you have no statistics to back up your<br>theory.<br><br>I'll leave your comments as long as they continue to make valid points.<br>If you start going off on hyperbole, I'll delete this comment thread.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-do-the-police-think-of-the-public-saving-a-14-year-old-from-an-unjustified-arrest/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
