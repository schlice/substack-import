  or questioning?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The article talks about a piece of malware that was<br>developed by the FBI to track users of the dark net who are doing such<br>things as distributing kiddie porn. It would be really hard to<br>\"accidentally\" be there, as no ad servers link to illegal systems. The<br>people who operate dark net servers don\'t advertise their services on<br>Google. You can\'t click a search link or an ad and accidentally end up<br>looking at kiddie porn. The people who do see that stuff actually intend<br>to do so, and it would be really hard to accidentally do so.\<br>\<br>The real concern is the breadth and depth of the FBI\'s hacking<br>operation. They went so far as to modify their malware to take advantage<br>of a security hole in the Tor browser bundle, which most people use to<br>browse with Tor.\<br>\<br>The FBI used the software to identify these users and then they<br>monitored them for quite some time, almost a year according to the<br>article. If you were a casual link-clicker and you clicked on something<br>you didn\'t mean to, the FBI would pretty quickly figure out that they<br>were wasting their time watching you.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
