<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How is it legal for Trump to have his name put on the Federal<br>Government Coronavirus stimulus check? Surely this is illegal<br>campaigning?**<br><br>How is it illegal? What law does it violate? It may be Trump tooting his<br>own horn, but it's definitely not illegal. And campaigning is not<br>illegal, so there is no such thing as "illegal campaigning." You may be<br>thinking of campaign finance laws which control how much money can be<br>spent on political campaigns, from where, and when, but this move is not<br>covered by campaign finance laws.<br><br>Trump has every right to re-design the text on the check. The Economic<br>Impact Payment check will be coming from the US Department of the<br>Treasury. The Treasury is an Executive branch, and Trump is the head of<br>the Executive branch. It's not his signature on the checks, just his<br>name, right under where it says "Economic Impact Payment".<br><br>That said, I, like many others, am reasonably sure that the move is<br>meant to signal to the low-information voter that the checks are coming<br>courtesy of the president. It's an old political trick that both parties<br>have used for many years --- pandering to the low-information voter and<br>taking the quick victory when it doesn't cost anything.<br><br>Let's be honest, most people are going to get their Economic Impact<br>Payments via direct deposit, but some people will still get theirs by<br>check, particularly if you had to pay taxes last year instead of getting<br>a refund, or if you don't pay taxes at all. See how the math works out?<br>Checks are going to the poor and to those who paid taxes instead of<br>getting refunds --- the hardest hit segments of society. If he puts his<br>name on the check, it signals to the people getting the check that he<br>had a hand in getting them that check. It's a pretty powerful signal.<br>And it doesn't cost voters anything.<br><br>It also didn't delay the checks; that's Fake Newsâ„¢. It's buried in the<br>story, but it's definitely there. Unsurprisingly, it was the Washington<br>Post which erroneously reported the information without fact-checking<br>(wow, they would do that?), saying that the addition of the text on the<br>checks would delay their mailing by days. This is untrue. Even NBC is<br>reporting that it is untrue:<br><br>> The Treasury Department official disputed that and said there would<br>> not be any delays.<br>><br>> \"Economic Impact Payment checks are scheduled to go out on time and<br>> exactly as planned --- there is absolutely no delay whatsoever,\" a<br>> Treasury Department spokesperson said in a statement. \"In fact, we<br>> expect the first checks to be in the mail early next week which is<br>> well in advance of when the first checks went out in 2008 and well in<br>> advance of initial estimates.\"\[1\](#oqHjm){#cite-oqHjm<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>Trump took an opportunity when it didn't cost anyone anything, and I'm<br>okay with that. He has the right to do that.<br><br>I don't agree with him on everything; I'm not keen on the fact that he<br>defunded the WHO *right now*. I fully agree with him that the WHO needs<br>to not receive our money, but *today*? Maybe in a month when we turn the<br>corner on this virus. But *today*? I don't like it. The optics don't<br>seem to work in his favor on this one, so I'm surprised he made that<br>move. We'll have to see how it shakes out. He may be more willing to<br>take risky political moves because the centerpiece of his re-election<br>bid was a strong economy --- before the coronavirus hit. Now, he'll be<br>lucky to get positive movement in the economy before November, and maybe<br>he's more willing to take calculated political risks in this climate.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-oqHjm){.citation_index} [[Trump\'s name will appear on<br>coronavirus relief<br>checks](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d01332&url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-s-name-will-appear-coronavirus-relief-checks-n1184026){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nbcnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
