<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [No. The only persons who can park in a handicapped spot<br>are persons who have been issued a handicapped hang tag or license plate<br>by the DMV. Those are issued when a doctor has verified an issue which<br>limits mobility. It may not be a visible issue.\<br>\<br>Generally, having a baby does not impair one\'s mobility to such a<br>degree that they would qualify for a handicap tag, but that call is made<br>by the doctor. The mother must have a medical condition caused by<br>childbirth that so limits mobility that they qualify for handicap<br>parking.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
