<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What's wrong with Rand Paul? Why does he prevent the anti-lynching<br>bill to pass? Does he have enough American blood in his hands?**<br><br>Rand Paul takes his job seriously. And he's concerned because he knows<br>he's *creating law,* not just *making a political statement*.<br><br>And in his view, this bill makes *bad law*. In general, bills which do<br>nothing more than make political statements are bad law, but this one<br>was not rigorously constructed.<br><br>He is demanding changes to the bill that he says are needed to ensure<br>lynching charges can't be brought for minor injuries. He said he seeks<br>the changes "not because I take lynching lightly but because I take it<br>seriously. And this legislation does not." He presented a scenario in<br>which someone could be shoved to the floor in a bar and suffer minor<br>injuries and be accused of lynching. He said that could lead to unfair<br>incarcerations. He also claims that the current bill has no protections<br>against such charges, and he wants to make good law.<br><br>He also knows that being the lone voice of dissent on an *anti-lynching<br>bill* is horribly bad optics, especially in the time of George Floyd. In<br>response to a question about said optics, he replied, "You think I'm<br>getting any good publicity out of this? No. I will be excoriated by<br>simple-minded people on the Internet who think somehow I don't like<br>Emmett Till or appreciate the history of Emmett Till. I'll be lectured<br>by everybody."<br><br>At the very least, he stands up for what he believes, and while you can<br>fault him for many things, caving to political pressure is one thing<br>that you can't.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for<br>everyone.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
