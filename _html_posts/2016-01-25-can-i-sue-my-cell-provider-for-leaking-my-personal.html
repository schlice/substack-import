<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I did ask you for more information, but it does appear you have a<br>specific legal question, which we cannot answer here on Quora.<br><br>[[How do legal disclaimers work on Quora? What is Quora\'s policy on<br>questions and answers about legal issues and<br>problems?](https://www.quora.com/unanswered/How-do-legal-disclaimers-work-on-Quora-What-is-Quoras-policy-on-questions-and-answers-about-legal-issues-and-problems)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Anyway, you can sue anyone for anything you choose. If you can find a<br>lawyer to represent you, I\'d say go for it.<br><br>However, in the case of a data breach where a large amount of people are<br>likely affected, it\'s probable that if there is cause, there is a<br>class-action lawsuit ongoing. I\'d definitely contact the lead attorneys<br>in the class-action suit and give them your information. I\'m certain<br>they\'ll want to talk to you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
