<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Could Trump nuke London if he wanted to?<br><br>The correct answer is yes.<br><br>While there is a two-person rule when it comes to actually "turning the<br>key" to launch the missile, preventing one person from being able to<br>actually target and fire a missile, there is no two-person rule when it<br>comes to the one person issuing the order.\[1\](#KnSVC){#cite-KnSVC<br>.citation_link}<br><br>The President, as Commander-in-Chief, has the *sole* authority to<br>issue the order to launch a nuclear strike. And specifically, to answer<br>the question, the President can indeed order a direct nuclear assault,<br>even if the United States is not under direct nuclear attack.<br><br>There may be mechanisms to slow down, or possibly to stop, the decision<br>to authorize a nuclear strike, but they are highly classified. There is<br>more collaboration than you might be aware of when the President decides<br>to issue an order to the military. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, for<br>example, always act in an advisory role, and would counsel the President<br>before he issued that order.<br><br>However, the president has *unilateral* authority as<br>Commander-in-Chief to order that nuclear weapons be used for any reason<br>at any time.\[2\](#qKRTc){#cite-qKRTc .citation_link}<br><br>This may seem scary. You might even truly believe that this is<br>incorrect. However, it is not. As you can see in the associated links I<br>provided, this is a question which has not only been hotly debated over<br>the years, that debate actually validates this point of view.<br><br>The question asked specifically if Trump could nuke London if he wanted<br>to, and since the ***sole, unilateral decision authority to use nuclear<br>weapons belongs to the President, the correct answer is yes, he can***.<br><br>Will he? Of course not. The UK is our ally, and while Trump is certainly<br>brash and braggadocios, full of himself and probably quite the pig when<br>it comes to women, he's not stupid as many have claimed. He most<br>certainly would not take such an unhinged action.<br><br>But the question didn't ask whether or not he ***would*. The<br>question asked whether or not he *could*.**<br><br>And the answer is yes, he can.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-KnSVC){.citation_index} [[Debate Over Trump's Fitness<br>Raises Issue of Checks on Nuclear<br>Power](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=07ebbd&url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/science/donald-trump-nuclear-codes.html?_r%3D1){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nytimes.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-qKRTc){.citation_index} [[National Command Authority -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b33986&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Command_Authority){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
