<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [We don\'t call them \"APBs\" (All-Points Bulletin) any<br>more. These days, we release a BOLO (Be On the LookOut). BOLOs are<br>distributed verbally during shift change, and also distributed<br>electronically when the technology allows it. Officers are then required<br>to \"be on the lookout\" for the suspect person, vehicle, stolen item,<br>etc. Nearly every organization has them, and you may even receive BOLOs<br>from neighboring agencies if their search parameters spread wide<br>enough.\<br>\<br>BOLOs are general orders to look out for specific things. When the<br>search area becomes more concentrated, and dedicated resources are<br>tasked to a search, your BOLO turns into a<br>manhunt.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
