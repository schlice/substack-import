<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with all answers that involve the differences between individual<br>states, the true answer is \"it depends.\"<br><br>At a certain point (which is different among states), a moving violation<br>can be judged by a law enforcement officer to be \"careless\" or<br>\"reckless.\" For example, in Colorado, \"careless driving\" means<br>operating a motor vehicle \"in a careless and imprudent manner, without<br>due regard for the width, grade, curves, corners, traffic, and use of<br>the streets and highways and all other attendant circumstances.\" This<br>is a Class 2 misdemeanor, unless the carelessness causes bodily injury,<br>in which case it is a Class 1 misdemeanor. \"Reckless driving\" means<br>operating a motor vehicle \"in such a manner as to indicate either a<br>wanton or a willful disregard for the safety of persons or property.\"<br>While reckless driving in Colorado is an automatic Class 1 misdemeanor,<br>subsequent convictions of reckless driving automatically include a<br>mandatory fine anywhere from \$50 to \$1000, imprisonment from 10 days<br>to 6 months, or both.<br><br>Note that you don\'t necessarily have to be speeding in order to be<br>convicted of \"careless driving\" or \"reckless driving,\" but at some<br>point, excessive speed is simply careless. Aggravating circumstances<br>surrounding speed may lead an officer to believe that the operation of<br>the motor vehicle was \"careless\" or \"reckless.\"<br><br>In some states, at a certain amount over the posted speed, this<br>transition is automatic. For example, at 40 miles an hour or more over<br>the posted speed, you no longer get a speeding ticket, but automatically<br>(by statute) get a reckless driving charge. Off the top of my head, I<br>can\'t remember what states have statutory reckless driving statutes.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
