<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No.<br><br>Abraham recognized this wasn't some kind of arbitrary murder command,<br>with the ability to sacrifice whoever he wanted. He knew that it had to<br>be Isaac because he was the firstborn.<br><br>**The offering of the firstborn in the Old Testament symbolized the debt<br>every man owed to God.** Throughout the Old Testament, God lays claim to<br>each Israelite's firstborn because it represented their very lives.<br><br>- At the Passover, God killed the firstborn of every household that did<br>  not have the blood of a firstborn lamb on the doorpost.<br>- In the Hebrew sacrificial system, God required the first-born of the<br>  cattle or sheep to be sacrificed to Him, as well as the first fruits<br>  of the grain.<br>- The firstborn sons, He said in Numbers 8:17, also belonged to Him, and<br>  could only be redeemed back to the parents by means of a sacrifice:<br><br>> For all the firstborn among the people of Israel are mine, both of man<br>> and of beast --- Numbers 8:17 (cf. Exodus 22:29; Numbers 3:46)<br><br>That's why Abraham understood what God was asking of him.<br><br>[[Tim<br>Keller](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5d2687&url=https://timothykeller.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="timothykeller.com"}]{.qlink_container} explained it like<br>this:<br><br>> If Abraham had thought God had told him, "Kill Sarah, and then I know<br>> you love me," he would have never done that---he would have concluded<br>> that he was hallucinating because God would not have commanded<br>> senseless murder like that. And God would not have said it because it<br>> would have been murder. But when God said, "offer Isaac," Abraham knew<br>> exactly what that meant. The firstborn represented his very life and<br>> the debt every man owes to God.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
