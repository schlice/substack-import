It was<br>released with Lollipop, and only recently received an upgrade to Nougat.<br>It got two full OS upgrades, which is about all you can expect from the<br>S6 hardware. It's pretty much at the limit of what the hardware will<br>accomplish, and it's pretty dog slow with Nougat on it.<br><br>If you want Oreo, you have two choices:<br><br>1.  Root the device and install an open-source Android build which is<br>    based off of Oreo, such as<br>    [LineageOS(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=395593&url=https://lineageos.org/){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="lineageos.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br>2.  Buy a new device.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
