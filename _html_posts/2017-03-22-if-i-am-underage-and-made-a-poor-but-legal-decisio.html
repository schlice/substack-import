<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The short answer is "it depends," and it depends on a lot of things,<br>like what federal agency you'd like to join, and what job you'll be<br>doing.<br><br>You don't give a lot of details, but it sounds like your only crime was<br>underage drinking. This alone probably won't prevent you from being<br>hired by a federal agency, but again, it depends a lot on which agency,<br>what kind of job, and what you'll be doing in that job. For example, if<br>you're going to be working with classified information, the background<br>investigation may reveal more about what you did, and that may speak to<br>your character and your ability to safely handle classified information<br>(which is all part and parcel of the background investigation before<br>being granted a security clearance). If you're not going to be working<br>in a highly sensitive organization, perhaps this would be less of a<br>concern.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
