<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *I don\'t see why exercising my rights with police officers is<br>> something unreasonable to do.*<br><br>What "rights" do you think you should be exercising? Are you possibly<br>referring to your "right to self defense" when a police officer orders<br>you to do something you don't want to do and he (appropriately)<br>escalates his use of force and you use your "right to self-defense" to<br>defend yourself? Do you feel it's okay to "defend yourself against the<br>police" when you "did nothing wrong?"<br><br>> *Shouldn\'t there be a compromise between the anti-police rhetoric and<br>> the notion that they can do no wrong?*<br><br>Oh, but there is. It's called the courts. In fact, that's the only<br>"compromise" between anti-police hate speech and the idea that police<br>doing their jobs are always right. The court gets to determine who is<br>right.<br><br>When a police officer is performing his or her duties, you do not have<br>the right to resist him or her. Period. Before you get all butthurt that<br>you can't defend yourself, the key here is "when a police officer is<br>performing his duties." That means that in very specific situations, you<br>do have the right to defend yourself.<br><br>*See? I can defend myself against that bastard rogue cop who isn't doing<br>his job!* Not so fast, cowboy.<br><br>*How do you KNOW he is not doing his job?*<br><br>Aye, there's the rub. There is only one group who is authorized by<br>law to determine whether or not a police officer was actually doing his<br>job. That group is the court. Not you, not even the police<br>department, technically. It's the court. When you go to court, the<br>police officer will stand in front of the judge and will explain himself<br>(the only time he is required by law to do so) and the judge will<br>determine whether or not he was following the law. There is *no other<br>time* when anyone gets to make that determination.<br><br>*Okay, so what does that mean to me?*<br><br>It means that *at the scene*, you must presume the officer is acting<br>lawfully. Once you leave, you and your lawyer will review the<br>circumstances and will then try to show the judge that the officer was<br>not acting lawfully, and if they find that he was not, the case against<br>you gets thrown out, you go free and you file a big fat juicy lawsuit<br>against the department and make all kinds of paper.<br><br>But until then, you have to do what that officer tells you to do.<br><br>Alternatively, instead of fighting and making a problem worse, you could<br>always simply refuse to follow his order. If the court finds that he was<br>acting lawfully, you will be charged with failing to follow the lawful<br>order of a peace officer (or whatever it is called in your<br>jurisdiction). But you knew that, because you knew that only the court<br>could determine whether or not he was actually acting lawfully, and you<br>could potentially be refusing to obey a police officer who was acting<br>lawfully. You run that risk when you refuse an order. You'll probably be<br>arrested when you refuse. That comes with the "refusal" territory. Be<br>polite, do not resist arrest, and you will be fine.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
