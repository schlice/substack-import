<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes! Absolutely! This is what Israel has wanted for decades!<br><br>So Joe Biden wants it. Israel wants it. So what's the problem?<br><br>***Palestine doesn't want it. Hamas doesn't want it. Militant<br>Palestinians don't want it.***<br><br>They don't want a "two-state solution." **They want a "one-state<br>solution."** And guess who will live in that one state? Here's a hint:<br>not Jews.<br><br>It's the Palestinian's rallying cry: "From the river to the sea." From<br>the river (the Jordan) to the sea (the Mediterranean), means that<br>Palestinians will take over all of Israel and make good on their promise<br>to destroy all Jews.<br><br>Their other rallying cry is "Globalize the Intifada." *Intifada* in<br>Arabic means "uprising" or "shaking off" and in this context has been<br>used to describe periods of intense Palestinian protest against Israel,<br>mainly in the form of violent terrorism: The First Intifada from<br>1987-1990 and the Second Intifada from 2000-05. These periods of<br>intifada were marked with acts of terrorism, including suicide bombings<br>against Israeli civilians.<br><br>If Palestinians could live peacefully alongside Jews, Israel would allow<br>it. Israel would *welcome* it. In fact, in the previous two wars, Israel<br>offered Palestinians this very option. Agree to recognize Israel's right<br>to exist and live in peace, and become full citizens of Israel. This<br>is a big deal, because no other Arabs in the Middle East live free in a<br>true democracy. Those who took Israel's deal do indeed live free today,<br>in Israel. Nearly one-fifth of the population of Israel is Arab. Arabs<br>serve alongside Jews in the IDF. Israel welcomes peaceful Arabs.<br><br>But the militant Nazis who live in Palestine want nothing more than the<br>utter destruction of Israel. And after October 7th, which was for<br>context the largest loss of life for Jews since the Holocaust, Israel<br>has finally had enough. After decades of swatting rockets out of the<br>sky, dealing with Palestinian suicide bombers, and generally having the<br>world's worst next door neighbors, they're done. Hamas has to go, and I<br>don't mean go "home," because 1) they don't have a home, and 2) no other<br>Arab country in the region will take them.<br><br>TL;DR: Sure! Israel should agree to the two-state solution! But<br>Palestinians have to want it too, and they still don't.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
