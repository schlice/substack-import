<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not at all. Democrats are doubling down, and they are doing so<br>specifically because they believe it is the best strategy.<br><br>We've all seen them doing so, and many have been flabbergasted. *How<br>could they possibly still think that way after the drubbing they got in<br>the last election?*<br><br>They literally do not care about the results of the election. They truly<br>believe that **Trump will F up so badly that they will be able to sweep<br>in and say, "told ya so."**<br><br>They believe that in two years, Trump will have stepped on *so many<br>toes* during his first 100 day blitz and beyond that they can ride the<br>discontent into office. They believe that they will be able to<br>capitalize on all of the negatives, missteps and *faux pas* which will<br>undoubtedly be highlighted and replayed *ad nauseum* on the legacy media<br>channels, and ride that wave of discontent right back into office,<br>***utterly ignoring all of the positive change that Trump is<br>implementing.*** *And they will then get to work dismantling everything<br>that Trump has done, and we'll be right back in the same spot we were<br>two and four years before.*<br><br>So what to do?<br><br>1.  Executive Orders are not enough. EOs are easily undone on Day 1 of<br>    the next Democrat President's administration. **Trump must work with<br>    Congress to *codify these changes into law.*** EOs do not create<br>    law. Trump must give these policy changes more permanence through<br>    Congress. Congress has to take ownership of these issues and pass<br>    these measures as law, which will make it much tougher to undo them.<br>2.  The administration must do a better job showing the benefits of the<br>    changes they are making, and how those changes affect John Q. Public<br>    and Jane Q. Public. Sure, *we* can see how the changes are reducing<br>    the deficit and how they are putting our current levels of spending<br>    back on solid ground and how we are implementing the Will Rogers<br>    rule (when you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is<br>    stop diggin',) but these need to be translated to **real, tangible<br>    benefits for ordinary everyday Americans who are struggling to get<br>    by on a smaller paycheck which doesn't go as far as it did four<br>    years ago.** They just see Trump imposing tariffs (which would hurt<br>    their spending ability), not the fact that the tariff tool was<br>    nothing more than *leverage* to gain compliance (which is working,<br>    btw), and Democrats will use that misunderstanding to sow confusion<br>    amongst the low-information voters to whom they pander.<br><br>That wave of discontent which propelled Trump and his team into office<br>has crashed on the beach last month, and that's great, but if Trump and<br>his team don't justify their work, the next wave won't be carrying<br>Republicans on it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
