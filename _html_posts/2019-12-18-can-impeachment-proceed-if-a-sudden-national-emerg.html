<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can impeachment proceed if a sudden national emergency happens?<br><br>Yes, there is no clause in the Constitution which requires impeachment<br>proceedings to stop during national emergencies.<br><br>Besides the fact that such a clause could be abused by an unscrupulous<br>president who chose to declare a national emergency which miraculously<br>didn't end throughout his term, Congress probably isn't greatly impacted<br>by national emergencies, and so there is, for all practical purposes, no<br>need to stop proceedings during a national emergency.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
