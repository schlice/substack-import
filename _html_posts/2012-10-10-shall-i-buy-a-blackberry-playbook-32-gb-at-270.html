<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [I\'ll assume that the PB you are looking at is Wi-Fi only.<br/>If so, you would be paying too much. Currently, prices on eBay for new<br/>32GB PBs with Wi-Fi only are running between \$150 and \$200.\<br/>\<br/>If it is Wi-Fi and LTE, get it quick before someone realizes it\'s<br/>listed too cheaply. New PBs with Wi-Fi and LTE radios are selling for<br/>over \$450.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
