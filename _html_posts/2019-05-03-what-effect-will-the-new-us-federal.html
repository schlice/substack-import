<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What effect will the new US "Conscience Rules" have on the ability of<br>Americans to obtain emergency care and treatment when health care<br>professionals interject personal/religious moral objections?**<br><br>It will have no effect whatsoever.<br><br>We have already had a long history of conscience protections as well as<br>anti-discrimination statutes in this country. For example:<br><br>- Conscience protections related to abortion, sterilization, and certain<br>  other health services applicable to the Department of Health and Human<br>  Services and recipients of certain Federal funds encompassed by 42<br>  U.S.C. 300a--7 (the "Church Amendments");<br>- Conscience protections for health care entities related to abortion<br>  provision or training, referral for such abortion or training, or<br>  accreditation standards related to abortion (the "Coats‐Snowe<br>  Amendment," 42 U.S.C. 238n)<br>- Protections from discrimination for health care entities that do not<br>  provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions under<br>  programs funded by the Department's appropriations acts (e.g.,<br>  Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and<br>  Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019, Div. B., sec. 507(d),<br>  Pub. L. No. 115‐245, 132 Stat. 2981 (Sept. 28, 2018) (the "Weldon<br>  Amendment"); id., sec. 209);<br>- Protections from discrimination under the Patient Protection and<br>  Affordable Care Act ("ACA") for health care entities that do not<br>  provide any health care item or service furnished for the purpose of<br>  causing, or for the purpose of assisting in causing, the death of any<br>  individual, such as by assisted suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing,<br>  applicable to the Federal Government and any State or local government<br>  that receives Federal financial assistance (42 U.S.C. 18113); and<br>  conscience protections for providers, organizations, or their<br>  employees regarding counseling regarding the same (42 U.S.C.<br>  14406(1));<br>- Conscience protections regarding exemptions applicable to the ACA's<br>  individual mandate (26 U.S.C. 5000A; 42 U.S.C. 18081);<br>- Conscience protections under the ACA for qualified health plans<br>  related to coverage of abortion, and for individual health care<br>  providers and health care facilities that do not provide, pay for,<br>  provide coverage of, or refer for abortions (42 U.S.C. 18023(b)(1)(A)<br>  and (b)(4));<br>- Conscience protections for Medicare Advantage organizations and<br>  Medicaid managed care organizations with moral or religious objections<br>  to counseling or referral for certain services (42 U.S.C.<br>  1395w‐22(j)(3)(B) and 1396u‐2(b)(3)(B));<br>- Conscience protections related to the performance of advanced<br>  directives (42 U.S.C. 1395cc(f), 1396a(w)(3), and 14406(2));<br>- Conscience and nondiscrimination protections for organizations related<br>  to Global Health Programs, to the extent such funds are administered<br>  by the Secretary of HHS (the "Secretary") (22 U.S.C. 7631(d));<br>- Conscience protections attached to Federal funding, to the extent such<br>  funding is administered by the Secretary, regarding abortion and<br>  involuntarily sterilization (22 U.S.C. 2151b(f), see, e.g., the<br>  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, Pub. L. 116‐6, Div. F, sec.<br>  7018 (the "Helms, Biden, 1978, and 1985 Amendments"));<br>- Conscience protections from compulsory health care or services<br>  generally (42 U.S.C. 1396f and 5106i(a)), and under specific programs<br>  for hearing screening (42 U.S.C. 280g‐1(d)), occupational illness<br>  testing (29 U.S.C. 669(a)(5)); vaccination (42 U.S.C.<br>  1396s(c)(2)(B)(ii)), and mental health treatment (42 U.S.C.<br>  290bb‐36(f)); and<br>- Protections for religious nonmedical health care providers and their<br>  patients from certain requirements under Medicare and Medicaid that<br>  may burden their exercise of their religious beliefs regarding medical<br>  treatment (e.g., 42 U.S.C. 1320a‐1(h), 1320c‐11, 1395i‐5, 1395x(e),<br>  1395x(y)(1), 1396a(a), and 1397j‐1(b)).\[1\](#bUrNI){#cite-bUrNI<br>  .citation_link}<br><br>These laws already exist. The Department of Health and Human Services<br>has previously had in place rules which follow these Federal laws, and<br>they've been re-written and updated now. This is yet another re-write<br>and update, clarifying those same conscience protections.<br><br>The rules generally allow providers to modify their service based on the<br>dictates of their conscience. At the same time, it provides for a<br>complaint system administered by the Department's Office of Civil Rights<br>(OCR) when someone feels that discrimination has taken place and that a<br>provider may be abusing the conscience protections.<br><br>This effectively balances everyone's needs: the providers have strong<br>conscience protections, and patients have an avenue to seek redress if<br>they believe a provider is unlawfully abusing conscience protections.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-bUrNI){.citation_index}<br>[https://www.hhs.gov/sites/defaul\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fb88f9&url=https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/final-conscience-rule.pdf?smid%3Dnytcore-ios-share){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="hhs.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
