<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Rape is a crime against society only insomuch as it "shocks the<br>conscience" of society. Therefore, society is a victim insofar as<br>society in general is harmed by rapes which occur in society. Society is<br>not the actual victim.<br><br>Rape victims have the ultimate choice whether or not they file a police<br>report. I will never bemoan a rape victim if he or she chooses to not<br>file a report for one reason or another. It's their choice.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
