<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There are so many varieties of 3G service around the<br>world, but in general, you\'re talking about data rates on the order of<br>400 Kbps to 4 Mbps, on average. Your mileage may vary, as this is<br>variable by carrier, handset manufacturer, signal strength, etc. 4G<br>signals (LTE) come a little closer, with some cellular networks getting<br>40Mbps down and around 19Mbps up.\<br>\<br>WiFi connections also vary depending on signal strength, handset<br>manufacturer, access point manufacturer, etc. But in general, WiFi data<br>rates are as follows:\<br>\<br>802.11b: 11Mbps\<br>802.11g: 54Mbps\<br>802.11n: 300-450Mbps\<br>\<br>Most phones today connect comfortably to G networks. Not as many connect<br>to N networks, and even those that do only have a single receiving<br>antenna (so they\'re stuck at the lower number).\<br>\<br>So the answer is no, you would absolutely consume data faster on WiFi<br>than on 3G.\<br>\<br>The good news is that most US-based cellular carriers do not count your<br>data usage when you use your own WiFi connection. They only count your<br>data usage when you use the cellular (3G or 4G) network. So not only is<br>WiFi faster, it\'s free (usually - check with your carrier on<br>this).]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
