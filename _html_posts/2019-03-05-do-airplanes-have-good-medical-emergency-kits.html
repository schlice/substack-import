<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do airplanes have good medical emergency kits?<br><br>Answer: Yes.<br><br>According to FAA Advisory Circular AC121--33B, all aircraft will carry<br>an Emergency Medical Kit (EMK). This kit can be used to aid onboard<br>medically-trained personnel with an in-flight emergency. The equipment<br>in an EMK can be used to sustain a life until the aircraft can land<br>safely and the person can be medically evacuated.<br><br>Also in the same FAA regulation is the required contents of the EMK:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-c5f28321f68d86222a3b06f5ebe70aec){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-c5f28321f68d86222a3b06f5ebe70aec" master_w="648"<br>master_h="538"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>As you can see, the EMK has airways, needles for injectables,<br>antihistamines (for anaphylaxis), dextrose (for diabetic emergencies),<br>nitroglycerine tabs (for heart attacks), lidocaine (for local numbing),<br>inhaled bronchodilators (for asthma attacks), tourniquets, CPR masks and<br>resuscitation bulbs, aspirin, and saline and IV tubing.<br><br>Along with the EMK, most aircraft are also equipped with an automated<br>external defibrillator (AED) to correct arrhythmia until the patient can<br>be medically evacuated.<br><br>Together, it's a fairly comprehensive kit that should be able to keep a<br>person alive until the aircraft can land and meet an ambulance.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
