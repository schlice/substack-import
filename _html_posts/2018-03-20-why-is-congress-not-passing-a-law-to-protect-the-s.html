<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why is congress not passing a law to protect the special prosecutor?<br><br>Ummm...because they already did?<br><br>Way back in Nixon's time, there was a special prosecutor appointed, but<br>there were no rules at all governing him, so when he requested the<br>tapes, Nixon fired him and said that he didn't have the authority to<br>request the tapes.<br><br>Congress then passed the Ethics in Government Act (EGA) in 1977 which<br>created a federal process to appoint a special investigator. It provided<br>a basic structure controlled by the Attorney General (AG). The Act was<br>rolled into the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Chapter 6, because<br>the EGA was not renewed in 1999. CFR Chapter 6 is the law which<br>currently governs the Special Counsel (or Special Prosecutor). This<br>process gives the AG the authority to appoint a SC, as well as authority<br>over the SC's work.<br><br>> - When to appoint an SC: If pursuing a matter would be a conflict<br>>   of interest for the DOJ or if public interest would be served by<br>>   removing responsibility from the DOJ.<br>> - Congress can request an SC be appointed.<br>> - The law puts the SC on par with any U.S. Attorney. The SC could<br>>   get his or her jurisdiction expanded if necessary.<br>> - The SC can prosecute federal crimes committed, as well as<br>>   interference into the investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of<br>>   justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.<br>> - Although the SC is not subject to day-to-day supervision in the<br>>   DOJ, but may have to provide explanation of investigative steps if<br>>   the head of the DOJ requests it.<br>> - The SC can be removed by the AG for \"misconduct, dereliction of<br>>   duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause,<br>>   including violation of Departmental<br>>   policies.\"\[1\](#GaBOx){#cite-GaBOx .citation_link}<br><br>In this case, the AG recused himself, so the current SC is overseen by<br>the Deputy AG.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-GaBOx){.citation_index} [[How special counsels differ from<br>independent<br>prosecutors](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ceb09d&url=https://www.axios.com/how-special-counsels-differ-from-independent-prosecutors-1513302396-85d7a228-ae27-4589-b083-5c4eec9d94ac.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="axios.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
