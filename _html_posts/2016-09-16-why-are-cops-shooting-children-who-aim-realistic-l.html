<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Why are cops shooting children who brandish BB guns?*<br><br>**Because children are using BB guns to commit armed robbery, and<br>because anyone who brandishes a weapon is considered a threat and can<br>legally be shot, not just by police.**<br><br>It's amazing, scanning the news stories regarding this shooting, that<br>the media is doing everything it can to make this another accidental<br>shooting of a boy playing with a BB gun.<br><br>*But they couldn't be more wrong.*<br><br>Tyre King, 13, was with a group of two other juveniles who just finished<br>an armed robbery. Tyre was armed with a BB gun with a laser sight. When<br>police arrived, one of the suspects was apprehended, and two suspects<br>fled.<br><br>*Be aware that at this point, the police were legally authorized to<br>shoot the fleeing suspects. Being able to shoot fleeing armed robbery<br>suspects has been upheld by the Supreme Court as they pose a very high<br>risk for injuring the public or for committing more crime. Note that the<br>police did not shoot the boys at this time.*<br><br>The two suspects were stopped by police, at which time Tyre drew his BB<br>gun and threatened officers with it. It was at that time that he was<br>shot.<br><br>This case is only similar to Tamir Rice in age, race, and outcome.<br>Everything else about it is different.<br><br>It's apples and oranges, people.<br><br>But don't worry, the facts won't get in the way of hate groups like<br>Black Lives Matter. I bet Al Sharpton is on an airplane as we speak.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
