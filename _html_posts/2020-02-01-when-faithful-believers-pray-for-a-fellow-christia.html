<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So in essence, you are asking if prayer is even worth it, because<br>sometimes we don\'t get what we asked for, is that it?<br><br>Have you ever asked for something as a child that you didn\'t get?<br>Perhaps a special toy, or a certain food. Why didn\'t you get that<br>thing? In most cases, it was because your parent determined that you<br>would ultimately be better off without it, or maybe because they were<br>saving that money for something else, or maybe because it wasn\'t as<br>great as you thought it was. In any case, someone with more knowledge,<br>wisdom and foresight, made a decision on your behalf, despite your<br>insistence that you really wanted it and that it would definitely<br>enhance your life.<br><br>While an imperfect analogy, it\'s close enough for our purposes.<br><br>We do not know what God has planned for us. We do not know what God has<br>planned for any of us. We don\'t know how His choices fit into His plan.<br>We may never know during this lifetime. Only when we see Him face to<br>face will we ever get a small glimpse of how all the pieces for<br>together. But now? We simply don\'t know.<br><br>What we do know for sure is that He has promised that our lives will be<br>used to further His kingdom and to bring others in as well. He has<br>promised that we will be with Him. And we know that he has always kept<br>His promises, despite our inability to see the big picture.<br><br>So we may ask for healing, but we do so by saying *if it is your will,<br>heal this person.* And that\'s the key. It may not be His will that this<br>person is healed.<br><br>Prayer is not like a vending machine, where you put the money in and you<br>get your desired product. Prayer is a pleading of the heart, a heart He<br>already knows. He knows your pain, and he feels it as acutely as you do.<br><br>But He has plans for you. He has plans for all of us. Faith, therefore,<br>is our ability to trust that He has a plan, and that He will keep His<br>promises.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
