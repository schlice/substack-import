<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is William Barr legally allowed to release the full Mueller report to<br>the public?**<br><br>The relevant law around the Special Counsel's report says that it is a<br>"confidential report" delivered to the Attorney General (64 Fed. Reg.<br>37,038, 37,040-41 (July 9, 1999)). However, he does know that there is<br>great public interest in it, so he will release as much of it as he<br>legally can, since that same law allows the AG to release appropriate<br>information to both Congress and the public.<br><br>However, he cannot, by law, release the full, unredacted report. He<br>is constrained by two major legal roadblocks:<br><br>1.  Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), which imposes restrictions<br>    on the use and disclosure of information relating to \"matter\s\<br>    occurring before \a\ grand jury\" (Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(2)(B).<br>    Rule 6(e)). The report contains material which is or could be part<br>    of a grand jury proceeding, and that information is required by law<br>    to remain secret.\<br>    \<br>    To that end, the "6(e) material" which, by law, cannot be made<br>    public, will be redacted.<br>2.  Information concerning other matters which have been referred to<br>    other offices, agencies, or courts. For example, some things that<br>    the Special Counsel found were referred to other agencies to<br>    prosecute (such as New York for tax evasion). That information must<br>    also be removed from the report before it can be made public in<br>    order to protect the sanctity of those investigations.<br><br>Once that material has been redacted from the report, Barr will deliver<br>the remainder of the report to Congress, and then to the people.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
