<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can I file a small claims case against an auto shop for replacing my<br>engine and other unsafe parts of my car without my permission?**<br><br>In the United States, you can sue anyone for anything.<br><br>How likely you are to prevail is really what's at issue.<br><br>As in most civil suits, you have to show some *harm* was done. When you<br>show the harm which was done, you can request that the court award some<br>form of remuneration for that harm.<br><br>Here are the types of damages you can recoup in a civil court case:<br><br>> Compensatory<br>><br>> Compensatory damages are typically sought in personal injury or<br>> property damage suits. The person filing the suit may ask for<br>> compensation for a variety of issues, such as lost income, property<br>> repairs and medical care. Compensatory damages seek an amount for<br>> actual losses.<br>><br>> General<br>><br>> General damages are often sought in conjunction with compensatory<br>> claims. General damages do not involve any direct financial loss by a<br>> plaintiff; examples of general damages can include mental anguish,<br>> pain and suffering, loss of consortium with a spouse or loss of the<br>> use of a piece of property. They also may be sought for anticipated<br>> future loss of earning power.<br>><br>> Punitive<br>><br>> Punitive damages, as the name implies, are meant to punish a<br>> defendant. They are sought in cases where a plaintiff claims<br>> negligence or misconduct on the part of the defendant. Punitive damage<br>> awards can often far exceed compensatory damages. Many noted cases<br>> have awarded millions of dollars, particularly when the suit is filed<br>> against a large corporation. Such awards, however, often are<br>> successfully appealed and the awards cut significantly.<br>><br>> Nominal<br>><br>> At the opposite end of financial awards from punitive amounts are<br>> those for nominal damages. These generally come when a defendant is<br>> found guilty but only a small amount is awarded because the damage<br>> done to the plaintiff was slight.<br>><br>> Court Costs<br>><br>> Filing a suit can be an expensive proposition, with a variety of fees<br>> assessed to plaintiffs for legal steps such as filing and processing,<br>> court transcripts and depositions. Often, the person filing the suit<br>> will ask that the defendant be ordered to pay for court costs<br>> associated with the suit. The plaintiff also may request that attorney<br>> fees be paid by the party being sued as<br>> well.\[1\](#jtfbp){#cite-jtfbp .citation_link}<br><br>The way this would probably play out: since you did not authorize the<br>repairs, you are not under any obligation to pay for them, or the parts<br>and labor which were put into them. The shop is still liable for its<br>work, and any warranties will still attach to the work. For example, if<br>the engine which was replaced without your permission fails within the<br>shop's standard warranty period, they will still be required to fix it.<br><br>In this case, it would be up to the shop to sue you to try to get you to<br>pay for the work they did, and your defense would be that you never<br>authorized that work to be performed.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-jtfbp){.citation_index} [[Types of Damages Recoverable in<br>a<br>Lawsuit](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fb4988&url=https://legalbeagle.com/8276989-types-damages-recoverable-lawsuit.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="legalbeagle.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
