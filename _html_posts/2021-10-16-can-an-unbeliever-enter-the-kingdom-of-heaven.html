<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No. The book of Revelation provides the answer to why this is.<br><br>When we are all judged, *someone* will have to pay for that sin.<br><br>If you are a believer, then it is Jesus who paid for your sin with his<br>death and resurrection.<br><br>If you are not a believer, then you must pay for your own sin.<br><br>God does not allow those with sin debt into heaven. He is perfect, and<br>Jesus is perfect. He expects nothing less from us in his kingdom as<br>well. He is a just judge, so all sin must be paid for.<br><br>The believer has had his sin debt paid by Jesus, and can thus enter the<br>kingdom. The unbeliever still owns his sin debt, and is thus cast out.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
