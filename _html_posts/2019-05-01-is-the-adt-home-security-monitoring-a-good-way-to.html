<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is the ADT home security monitoring a good way to protect your<br>house?**<br><br>ADT home security works admirably. The ADT Pulse system is a very tidy<br>integrated system which includes all of the traditional alarm system<br>components (door/window contacts, smoke detectors, CO detectors, etc),<br>cameras, touch pad controllers, a mobile app, and the ability to<br>incorporate Z-Wave devices as well, such as thermostats, light<br>controllers, smart plugs, door locks, garage door controllers, and any<br>other compatible Z-Wave device.<br><br>Is it a good *value* for what you get? As with any of the big providers,<br>I think it is somewhat overpriced compared with what you get. You can<br>find better value elsewhere.<br><br>But if you already have a wired home security system installed in your<br>house, switching it over to ADT is a fine way to protect your home.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
