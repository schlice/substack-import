<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When I was in school taking my Criminal Justice class, we visited the<br>local medium security prison. I got to talk to some of the prisoners.<br><br>They told me that prison was their retirement plan.<br><br>They knew exactly what crime they would commit, at what age, to get them<br>sent right back to medium security, to be incarcerated for the rest of<br>their natural lives. They were perfectly happy living the rest of their<br>lives in orange jumpsuits because they were living on the taxpayer's<br>dime. Free room and board. No responsibilities other than doing what the<br>guards tell you. To them, it was paradise.<br><br>Being free meant fending for yourself. Getting and keeping a job.<br>Meeting obligations such as paying your rent, and paying your cable<br>bill.<br><br>These men didn't want that. They were perfectly content to have the<br>State care for them for the rest of their lives.<br><br>I am certain that there were more prisoners there who felt the same way.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
