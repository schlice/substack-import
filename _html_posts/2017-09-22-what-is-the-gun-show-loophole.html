<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let me explain where the "gun show loophole" comes from. The term was<br>coined from news reports which were discussing how people could buy and<br>sell guns "at a gun show" without a background check. The overall title<br>the media gave to this practice was "the gun show loophole," though it<br>has little to do with a gun show, and it's not actually a loophole.<br><br>As all of these answers correctly stated, the sellers in a gun show are<br>licensed dealers, and they will do background checks on every person who<br>buys a gun, period.<br><br>But the gun show itself is a marketplace where buyers and sellers come<br>together, *and they don't necessarily have to be on opposite sides of<br>the table*.<br><br>Let's say I'm attending a gun show. I'm not a gun dealer, just an<br>ordinary citizen attending a gun show. I'm walking around and I see a<br>guy looking at an M4 for sale. I tap him on the shoulder, and I say,<br>"Hey, I happen to have an M4 out in my car, and I'll sell it to you for<br>\$100 less than this guy." He says okay, we leave the gun show, walk out<br>to my car, and I sell him the M4. No background check, all cash.<br>*Perfectly legal*.<br><br>Why?<br><br>The gun show sales are dealer sales from FFL-licensed dealers. They<br>are required to perform background checks, and they do.<br><br>The sale out at my car is a private sale. In most states, background<br>checks are not required for private sales (that is, if I, as a<br>non-dealer \which means someone not "in the business" of selling guns\<br>sell a gun). This was a compromise put in place when the National<br>Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was implemented. Private<br>sales were exempted from the requirement for background checks. This<br>also means this is not a "loophole." A loophole is a process which<br>follows the law but does not meet the ends envisioned for the law. This<br>is a specific exemption which was put in place when the law was enacted.<br>It's not a loophole; it's the law functioning as designed.<br><br>So let's recap. Is the "gun show loophole" real? Well, it doesn't<br>actually happen in a gun show (it happens away from a gun show), and<br>it's not a loophole (the law is functioning as designed).<br><br>For those reasons, the "gun show loophole" is nothing but fake news.<br>It's a made-up propaganda piece. It's vaporware. It doesn't exist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
