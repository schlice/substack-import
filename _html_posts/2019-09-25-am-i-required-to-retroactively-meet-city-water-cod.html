You can only meet codes as they<br>are listed today.<br><br>Now, if they want to *fine* you for not previously meeting a code,<br>you can then show them that the inspectors signed off on the<br>configuration as it is, so that's on them.<br><br>But you can only meet codes as they are today. And if code today says<br>that you need a backflow preventer, you have to add it today, because<br>the code today says you must have it. And you will likely have to get it<br>re-inspected once you install the device.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
