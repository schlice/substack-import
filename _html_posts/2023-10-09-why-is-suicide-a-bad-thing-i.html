<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because you actually want to live.<br><br>If someone forcefully covers your mouth and nose, do you just sit there<br>peacefully and wait for the oxygen in your lungs to be replaced by<br>carbon dioxide? *NO!* You struggle mightily to breathe. If you are<br>drowning, do you just float away and accept your fate? *NO!* You<br>fight to get to the surface and breathe. When you are injured and your<br>body struggles to stay alive, it is yet another indication that your<br>body wants to live.<br><br>If your mind is telling you that you don't want to live, then **there is<br>a disconnect between your mind and your body.** Your body wants to live,<br>but your mind does not. This disconnect can cause a great deal of<br>anxiety in your life.<br><br>If this is happening to you, seek help. I know that seeing a mental<br>health professional has never been considered to be a good thing to do,<br>but if you need help (and this disconnect between your mind and your<br>body should be telling you that you do), seek the advice of a mental<br>health professional near you. If you feel like you might hurt yourself,<br>call 988 in the United States (or any of the numbers in the "There Is<br>Help" box on this page), or go to your nearest Emergency Room.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
