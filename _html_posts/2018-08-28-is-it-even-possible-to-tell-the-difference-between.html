<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it even possible to tell the difference between when Donald Trump<br>is being serious and when he is joking?**<br><br>The real answer: *what difference does it make?*<br><br>The President's words do not carry the weight of law. He can say<br>anything he likes, and it doesn't change one iota of your life. At. All.<br><br>However, once an Executive Order is written directing an Executive<br>Branch agency to do or not do something, or once Congress passes a law,<br>or once an Executive Branch agency makes a change to a regulation,<br>*now* something becomes binding on you.<br><br>So is he joking? Is he serious? *Who cares?* Is that going to change<br>your opinion of him?<br><br>I suspect that if you already have a negative opinion of him, nothing he<br>says or does will change your opinion of him. If you already have a<br>positive opinion of him, you'll be able to distinguish more easily<br>between his jokes and his seriousness.<br><br>Here's an example: the media (which has a negative opinion of him) could<br>not fathom the statement he made in the press conference where he joked<br>that if Russia was so good at hacking that maybe *they* could find<br>Hillary's "missing" emails.<br><br>[[Donald Trump Calls on Russia to Find Hillary Clinton's Missing<br>Emails](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fcc08d&url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nytimes.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>The media went apoplectic. "He just *invited* another country to hack<br>us!" "He's calling for other countries to invade us!" "It's treason!"<br><br>When, in fact, it was a joke. He was trying to be humorous. He's clearly<br>not very good at it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
