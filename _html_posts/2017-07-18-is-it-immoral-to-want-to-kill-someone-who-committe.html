<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I just finished reading a book series by David Simpson called,<br>collectively, the \"Post-Human Series.\" If you like sci-fi, dystopian<br>future stories, limits of human intelligence, etc., you\'ll really like<br>that series.<br><br>One of the overarching themes in that series was the following:<br><br>*\"Feelings are never wrong. Acting on those feelings may be, but<br>feelings themselves are never wrong.\"*<br><br>Likewise, *desire* to kill someone is not wrong. *Acting on that desire*<br>would clearly be wrong, but simply desiring to kill someone is not<br>immoral in and of itself. Since desire and feeling are nothing more than<br>emotion stemming from brain activity (thought), desire is borne of<br>thought. From the<br>[Encyclopedia.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8ff46a&url=http://encyclopedia.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="encyclopedia.com"}]{.qlink_container} entry for "morality of<br>thought:"<br><br>> The act of thinking is, in itself, amoral, although it is a spiritual<br>> activity proper only to a person. All moral activity involves<br>> thinking, but it also involves volition. In speaking of the morality<br>> of thoughts, therefore, thinking must be understood to include, or to<br>> be associated with, some activity on the part of the<br>> will.\[1\](#Sgloz){#cite-Sgloz .citation_link}<br><br>So, in order for a thought to gain a moral component, there must be some<br>overt action involved in it, which reinforces my quote from Simpson's<br>book.<br><br>To bring it back into context: thought is not immoral, because thoughts<br>in and of themselves are amoral. Volition or will is required to turn<br>thought or desire into overt action, which can then contain a moral<br>component.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-Sgloz){.citation_index} [[Thoughts, Morality<br>of](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=50a109&url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/thoughts-morality){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="encyclopedia.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
