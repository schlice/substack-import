<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [*Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.*\<br>\<br>If you are not attempting to pass yourself off as someone else in order<br>to extract any form of gain, you should be protected under the first<br>amendment. Its no different than wearing a military uniform. If you\'re<br>not trying to extract any sort of gain from the wearing, you should be<br>protected.\<br>\<br>You should also remember that it is illegal to lie to a government<br>official about your identity. So your charade must cease when a police<br>officer or other government official asks you who you are. Passing<br>yourself off as someone else in that scenario could land you in jail for<br>the night, if not longer.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
