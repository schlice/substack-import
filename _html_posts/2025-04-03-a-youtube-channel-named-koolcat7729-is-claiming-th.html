<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Jesus doesn't even know when the rapture is going to happen. How<br>"Koolcat7729" thinks that he knows better than Jesus is beyond me.<br><br>Jesus explicitly said that no one but God knows:<br><br>> *"But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels<br>> of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only. \-- Matthew 24:36 ESV*<br><br>Revelation also speaks of many events which will take place before<br>Jesus' return, and it's a fair assumption that those things haven't<br>happened yet. Considering that those things are being measured in<br>*years*, and they haven't even begun yet, it's a fair bet that the<br>rapture is not happening in 12 days.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
