<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I heard once that a person placed an FBI jacket and an<br>empty shoulder holster in his luggage so that TSA officials would<br>scrutinize his luggage less. I certainly hope that\'s not the case, but<br>I can\'t imagine that it wouldn\'t be. I could see TSA screeners looking<br>less closely at the contents because of the items they found in the<br>luggage, or perhaps if they were apt to take things from luggage,<br>they\'d be less apt to take something from that luggage. That\'s social<br>engineering.\<br>\<br>I would think putting police emblems on your items where they can be<br>seen in plain sight is more likely to get *you* into trouble. The<br>thought here is that you\'re misrepresenting yourself, or attempting to<br>gain privilege or special treatment by displaying police insignia.<br>Impersonating a peace officer is a fairly serious<br>crime.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
