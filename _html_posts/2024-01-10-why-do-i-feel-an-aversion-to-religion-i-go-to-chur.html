<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Mahatma Gandhi is once quoted as saying:<br><br>> *I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians<br>> are so unlike your Christ.*<br><br>Perhaps you feel the same. Perhaps you connect "Christian" with "other<br>people who call themselves Christian, including some not-so-nice people<br>who give Christians a bad name." You might be surprised to learn just<br>how many people call themselves Christian, but couldn't be identified as<br>a Christian if they didn't speak the words "I'm a Christian." Another<br>pithy quote which exemplifies what you're saying: *If you were arrested<br>and put on trial for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence<br>to convict?* For some people, probably the people you are describing, I<br>feel like there wouldn't be enough evidence of Christianity in their<br>lives, much like the people Gandhi described.<br><br>What you call yourself isn't an issue. If you don't call yourself a<br>Christian, that's fine. What *is* important is that this feeling doesn't<br>change your feeling about God or your faith walk.<br><br>So while you may have an aversion to the word "Christian," don't blame<br>Christ for that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
