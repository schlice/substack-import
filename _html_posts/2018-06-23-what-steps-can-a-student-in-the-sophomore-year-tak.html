<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What steps can a student in the sophomore year take that would help<br>him/her get into USAFA?**<br><br>I'll assume this is you, for the sake of making a question easier to<br>answer.<br><br>First thing you should know is that you're at the perfect time to start<br>thinking about what you have to do to get into USAFA. And the first<br>thing you should do is to visit the [[Academy<br>Admissions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60e33c&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} website. There,<br>you'll find a few important things:<br><br>- [[Find your<br>  ALO](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3baf43&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/outreach-programs/find-your-admissions-liaison-officer/){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container}: An ALO<br>  (Admissions Liaison Officer) is an Academy grad and Air Force officer<br>  whose job it is to assist you throughout your admissions process. Your<br>  ALO will help you select appropriate high school classes so that you<br>  can be competitive, make sure you're engaging in team sports, help you<br>  with your admissions packet, assist with the nomination process, and<br>  generally just encourage you in the right direction to give you the<br>  best chance for success. Finding your ALO and contacting that person<br>  is critical. I would not wait to do that.<br>- The Admission Tracker App: The app (available for<br>  [iPhone(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9a269e&url=http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/united-states-air-force-academy/id427133480?mt%3D8){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="apple.com"}]{.qlink_container} and<br>  [Android(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e32eee&url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id%3Dcom.u360mobile.airforceacademy%26feature%3Dsearch_result%23?t%3DW251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS51MzYwbW9iaWxlLmFpcmZvcmNlYWNhZGVteSJd){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="google.com"}]{.qlink_container}) provides a checklist of<br>  steps that you can follow to assist you along your admissions journey.<br>  Download that and start tracking your own checklist.<br><br>On the website, you'll also find all sorts of information relating to<br>your admissions packet, namely what things the Academy is looking for in<br>the ideal cadet. I'll briefly review them here, but the website goes<br>into excruciating detail about every step of the process.<br><br>The [[steps you need to<br>follow](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=80e2b6&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/the-application-process/application-steps){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} are outlined on<br>the website, but let's talk about what you can be doing right now, as a<br>sophomore, to give yourself the best chance to succeed:<br><br>- Get good grades. Academics makes up the largest portion (50%) of<br>  your entrant score. Getting the best grades you can get is critical.<br>  Now, you don't have to take all kinds of AP or Honors classes (but if<br>  you do well in them, it won't hurt). If you do score 4 or 5 on an AP<br>  class, you can actually use it as transfer credit which will apply to<br>  your core academic requirements. While AP or Honors classes are not<br>  necessary, you do have to have excellent academic scores, and you need<br>  to score well on the standardized testing (i.e. SAT or ACT). To be<br>  academically competitive for an appointment to the Academy, we<br>  recommend completion of the following high school courses:<br>  - four years of English (with a college preparatory class in writing)<br>  - four years of math (strong background in geometry, algebra,<br>    trigonometry and pre-calculus)<br>  - four years of science (lab-based and should include biology,<br>    chemistry and physics)<br>  - three years of social studies (to include a course in U.S. History)<br>  - two years of a modern foreign language<br>  - one year of computer study<br>- Participate in team sports. The large majority of cadets<br>  participated in some form of organized team sport while in high<br>  school. The Academy isn't looking to see *how many* team sports you<br>  participated in. What they are looking for is "sustained participation<br>  and leadership in a few activities." Most cadets also lettered in<br>  their team sport. Doesn't mean that you can't get in without a varsity<br>  letter, but if you consider that most cadets lettered in their varsity<br>  sport, earning a varsity letter is a step in the right direction.<br>- Participate in non-athletic extracurricular activities. Again, as<br>  I mentioned, sustained participation and leadership in a few<br>  activities (such as a team sport and other non-athletic activities)<br>  makes you a strong candidate. The Academy only looks at activities you<br>  participated in starting in your sophomore year, so again, this time<br>  is perfect for you.<br><br>Each one of these things on your admissions packet is weighted and<br>scored. These scores combined form your overall rank, and your packet is<br>ranked alongside all of the other packets that are submitted for that<br>class year. Normally, the Academy receives approximately 10,000 packets<br>per class year.<br><br>The best thing you can do right now is to focus on your grades, and make<br>sure you are doing everything you can to keep your GPA high. If that<br>means before or after school tutoring or help from your teachers, do it.<br>If it means doing extra credit assignments, do it. Do whatever you can<br>to keep your grades up. This is the time when stupid mistakes can derail<br>your chances, so don't do that.<br><br>If you have other questions, please feel free to ask.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
