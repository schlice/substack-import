<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, it is not a sin. But we are not instructed to do *only* things that<br>have something to do with God. **We are instructed to do all things for<br>the glory of God.**<br><br>In everything we do, do it for the glory of God.<br><br>There is an amazing writeup by Jon Bloom over at<br>[desiringGod.org(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0a3b06&url=http://desiringGod.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="desiringgod.org"}]{.qlink_container}, and I want to<br>reproduce that here. It's totally readable, so take the time to read it.<br><br>> Explain this verse in your own words: "So, whether you eat or drink,<br>> or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God." If someone walked up<br>> to you right now and asked you how [[1 Corinthians<br>> 10:31](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a808a1&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%252010.31){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container} worked --- in eating, in<br>> drinking, in everything --- how would you respond? Do you know what<br>> Paul really meant?<br>><br>> The verse is so familiar, we can easily assume we understand it, even<br>> if we don't. By itself the verse's meaning seems patently obvious:<br>> *glorify God in everything you do*. Well, of course that's true at the<br>> highest level. But what does Paul specifically mean by *glorify God*,<br>> and what does he mean by *everything*?<br>><br>> If our primary application of this verse is thanking God for the tasty<br>> pizza we're eating, we haven't understood Paul --- even though he<br>> certainly would want us to thank God for the tasty pizza we're eating<br>> ([[1 Corinthians<br>> 10:30](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f88af3&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%252010.30){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). Paul has something quite<br>> specific in mind --- something quite relevant to us. When we look at<br>> the verse in its wider context, we see that Paul's command to do all<br>> to the glory of God relates to cultural idols, the Christian<br>> conscience, and how we live before an unbelieving world.<br>><br>> A Wonderful, New Freedom<br>><br>> Paul begins his point in chapter 8. There we discover that food was a<br>> major issue of Christian liberty in the Corinthian church ---<br>> specifically, "food offered to idols" ([[1 Corinthians<br>> 8:1](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fb783d&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%25208.1){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). All the Corinthian<br>> Christians (except perhaps the Jewish ones) would have had backgrounds<br>> in pagan idol worship. When they became Christians, they renounced<br>> these idols and all the expressions of worship associated with them.<br>><br>> The problem was that idol worship was woven into the very fabric of<br>> Corinthian civic, trade, and social life --- it was culturally<br>> pervasive. Idol temples were social centers, and could function<br>> similarly to public restaurants ([[1 Corinthians<br>> 8:10](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8c63e1&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%25208.10){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). And much of the meat<br>> sold in the markets and served in homes had been ritually offered to<br>> idols ([[1 Corinthians<br>> 10:25](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=74f325&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%252010.25){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container},<br>> [27(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=636482&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Corinthians%252010.27){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). That meant eating meat<br>> could be interpreted as an act of idolatry, a betrayal of Christian<br>> beliefs ([[1 Corinthians<br>> 8:10](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8c63e1&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%25208.10){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br>><br>> Wonderfully, however, some Corinthian Christians were discovering that<br>> "an idol has no real existence, and that there is no God but one" ([[1<br>> Corinthians<br>> 8:4](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cffccf&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%25208.4){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). Since idols were *no<br>> real things*, they realized that meat sacrificed to idols was meat<br>> sacrificed to *nothing* ([[1 Corinthians<br>> 10:19--20](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b5abdb&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%252010.19%25E2%2580%259320){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). Therefore, eating meat<br>> sacrificed to idols could not be idolatry if the people eating knew<br>> that idols weren't real. They were free to eat this meat with a clear<br>> conscience! Paul agreed with them ([[1 Corinthians<br>> 10:26](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9154eb&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%252010.26){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container},<br>> [29(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9f9d1b&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Corinthians%252010.29){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br>><br>> Freedom's Power to Destroy<br>><br>> Paul did not agree, however, with how some of them were exercising<br>> this newfound Christian freedom. In effect, some of the Corinthians<br>> had placed a higher value on enjoying this freedom than on the<br>> spiritual good of other souls. First, not all the Corinthian<br>> Christians "possessed this knowledge" ([[1 Corinthians<br>> 8:7](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=dde9a3&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%25208.7){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). Some of them, perhaps<br>> newer converts or those who, for whatever reason, had tender<br>> consciences, still felt like eating meat sacrificed to an idol was a<br>> form of idolatrous worship. For them, to eat sacrificial meat was to<br>> deny Christ.<br>><br>> Second, others, who may have even believed idols were nonentities,<br>> would face temptation to a different kind of idolatry by eating such<br>> meat. Many Corinthian converts likely paid a high price to become<br>> Christians. Renouncing the false pagan religion(s) meant renouncing<br>> social customs, family traditions, and friendship networks. Some, no<br>> doubt, lost their jobs. You can imagine the temptation some<br>> experienced to give at least an appearance of homage to the prevailing<br>> religion in order to avoid losing employment, social status, and<br>> family disapproval.<br>><br>> Third, there was the issue of gospel witness among non-Christians who<br>> were watching the Christians. What would pagans think of Christians<br>> who knowingly ate meat sacrificed to idols? They would likely assume<br>> that the Christians venerated the idols just like they did, and<br>> therefore there was no real reason to give heed to Christians' odd<br>> claims. And what would Jews think of this behavior? That Christians<br>> were pagans and that Christianity was demonic.<br>><br>> So, Paul strongly reminded the Corinthians that far more was at stake<br>> than enjoying sacrificial steaks. If Christians whose consciences were<br>> free to eat meat sacrificed to idols weren't very careful, the<br>> exercise of their freedom could destroy the faith of another Christian<br>> ([[1 Corinthians<br>> 8:9--11](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ac02cd&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%25208.9%25E2%2580%259311){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}) or ruin Jesus's<br>> reputation among non-Christians ([[1 Corinthians<br>> 10:27--29](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ed6887&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%252010.27%25E2%2580%259329){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br>><br>> True Christian Freedom<br>><br>> This is why Paul said, "If food makes my brother stumble, I will never<br>> eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble" ([[1 Corinthians<br>> 8:13](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c2ce05&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%25208.13){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). And then he went on to<br>> describe throughout chapter 9 many ways he voluntarily abstained from<br>> things he was free to enjoy as a Christian --- not to mention an<br>> apostle --- like various kinds of food and drink, marriage, and a<br>> full-time ministry salary ([[1 Corinthians<br>> 9:4--7](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=59ac18&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%25209.4%25E2%2580%25937){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br>><br>> Paul's whole orientation in life was to win as many people to the<br>> gospel as possible ([[1 Corinthians<br>> 9:22--23](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a08396&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%25209.22%25E2%2580%259323){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}), so he sought to remove<br>> as many obstacles to the gospel as possible ([[1 Corinthians<br>> 9:12](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=27132f&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%25209.12){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). For Paul, this was<br>> Christian freedom: "For though I am free from all, I have made myself<br>> a servant to all, that I might win more of them" ([[1 Corinthians<br>> 9:19](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bcc7e7&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%25209.19){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). So, when Paul heard that<br>> the Corinthian Christians were arguing over whether or not they were<br>> free to eat sacrificial meat, he essentially told them they were<br>> missing the point:<br>><br>> "All things are lawful," but not all things are helpful. "All things<br>> are lawful," but not all things build up. Let no one seek his own<br>> good, but the good of his neighbor. ([[1 Corinthians<br>> 10:23--24](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4ba623&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%252010.23%25E2%2580%259324){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container})<br>><br>> To Paul, this was true Christian freedom: to do whatever it takes to<br>> love one's neighbor for the sake of Jesus.<br>><br>> Do All to the Glory of God<br>><br>> This is what Paul had in mind when he wrote, "So, whether you eat or<br>> drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God" ([[1<br>> Corinthians<br>> 10:31](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a808a1&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%252010.31){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). We glorify God when, out<br>> of love for him, we lay down our rights, our freedoms, in eating or<br>> drinking or *whatever* in order to do what is most loving toward<br>> others, either for the "progress and joy \of their\ faith"<br>> ([[Philippians<br>> 1:25](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d33830&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Phil%25201.25){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}), or that they may be<br>> saved ([[1 Corinthians<br>> 9:22](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e7797d&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%25209.22){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). Paul's very next<br>> sentence says, "Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church<br>> of God" ([[1 Corinthians<br>> 10:32](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=592180&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%252010.32){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br>><br>> Now, back to our tasty pizza. God is certainly glorified when we<br>> wholeheartedly enjoy the fullness of the earth he created for our<br>> enjoyment ([[1 Corinthians<br>> 10:26](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9154eb&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%252010.26){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). Paul was a great<br>> advocate for our freedom from all false, legalistic abstinence from<br>> food or anything else ([[1 Timothy<br>> 4:1--3](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2633de&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Tim%25204.1%25E2%2580%25933){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). He stated it clearly:<br>> "Food will not commend us to God" ([[1 Corinthians<br>> 8:8](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3ab02b&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%25208.8){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). And "everything created<br>> by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with<br>> thanksgiving, for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer" ([[1<br>> Timothy<br>> 4:4--5](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1ae847&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Tim%25204.4%25E2%2580%25935){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). So, Paul would take no<br>> offense by our applying [[1 Corinthians<br>> 10:31](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a808a1&url=https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%2520Cor%252010.31){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container} to savoring our pizza ---<br>> provided that we have not lost sight of the more excellent way of<br>> glorifying God: sacrificial love.<br>><br>> And this kind of sacrificial love is still needed, maybe especially<br>> needed, when it comes to Christian freedoms. For we, too, have our<br>> cultural idols, our saints with tender consciences, and our watching<br>> unbelievers. So, in "whatever you do," do not use your freedom to<br>> merely pursue what you feel free to enjoy, but use your freedom to<br>> pursue the ultimate spiritual good of your neighbor. As a Christian,<br>> you are free from all constraints: the external constraints of false<br>> religion and the internal constraints of your selfishness. You are<br>> free to enjoy all God has provided, and free to abstain for the sake<br>> of love. Do all you do to the glory of God.\[1\](#lJkOE){#cite-lJkOE<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>So if by you playing games or chopping trees you give the impression<br>that you honor other gods besides Him, you shouldn't do those things.<br>Like Jon says, "\D\o not use your freedom to merely pursue what you<br>feel free to enjoy, but use your freedom to pursue the ultimate<br>spiritual good of your neighbor." So while you may be free to do it, you<br>must make sure that you don't unintentionally hurt others' faith walks<br>in so doing.<br><br>Do all you do to the glory of God.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-lJkOE){.citation_index} [[How to Do Everything to the<br>Glory of<br>God](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7cb187&url=https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/how-to-do-everything-to-the-glory-of-god){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="desiringgod.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
