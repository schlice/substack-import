<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [No one can speak for every police officer. But most guys I<br>know want to become anonymous when they go off duty. It\'s tiring having<br>video cameras pointed at you all day, knowing you work in the only<br>profession in the world (besides \"being a celebrity,\" if you can call<br>that a profession) where you are constantly being recorded wherever you<br>go. Every time you get out of your car, there is at least one person<br>with a cell phone camera recording you, hoping you slip up so they can<br>get their 15 minutes of YouTube fame.\<br>\<br>So most guys I know will change out of their uniforms, slip into their<br>private cars, put on some music, and cruise home.\<br>\<br>Below the speed limit.\<br>\<br>Because they\'ve attracted enough attention all day. Once they\'re done<br>with work, they want to become invisible.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
