<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Current CPR guidelines emphasize the chest compressions (OMG, you might<br>have to touch her BOOBIES!) over the breathing. Keeping the blood flow<br>through the brain is far more important.<br><br>Speaking of current procedures, anyone trained on the use of AEDs<br>(automated external defibrillator) knows that they include a pair of<br>forceps (big scissors). Any idea what that\'s for? Yep, you have to cut<br>her shirt and her bra off (well, specifically, cut them in half, up the<br>middle) to apply the contact electrodes. To answer your next question, a<br>woman died when a man was trying to maneuver the electrode under the<br>female victim\'s bra because he was afraid she would be embarrassed that<br>he had to cut it open. She\'s not embarassed, she\'s dead. Ask any woman<br>if she\'d rather be embarassed or dead and then decide if you will do<br>what needs to be done to save a life.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
