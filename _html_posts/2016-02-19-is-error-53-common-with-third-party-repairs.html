<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, as you know the issue occurs when particular components which are<br>integrated into Apple\'s security model, such as the fingerprint sensor<br>or touchscreen, are replaced by third-party repairers.<br><br>However, after much public pressure over forcing users to repair their<br>devices through Apple rather than third-party maintainers, Apple<br>released [[a new<br>version](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=09bffd&url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205628){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="apple.com"}]{.qlink_container} of iOS 9.2.1 over iTunes if<br>your device has been hit by Error 53. This version will not<br>automatically be pushed to all users; you can only get it if your device<br>has been affected by an Error 53.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
