<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it right for homeowners associations to regulate how long you can<br>have holiday lights hung and in use?**<br><br>Let's answer this question by understanding what the purpose of a<br>Homeowner's Association actually is.<br><br>*Homeowner's Associations exist to keep your home value as high as<br>possible.*<br><br>They do this not by telling you what *you* can do with *your* home, but<br>by ensuring that your *neighbors* don't do wacky stuff to *their* homes,<br>which can, in turn, lower *your* home's value.<br><br>While it's challenging to make generalizations (as every neighborhood is<br>different), we can generalize and say that "a neat neighborhood<br>generally has higher home values than a messy neighborhood."<br><br>You can tell a messy neighborhood: you can barely drive up the street<br>because there are cars everywhere. One person painted his house hot<br>pink. Another has weeds as tall as the windows. A third has seven cars<br>in the driveway, and only three have wheels.<br><br>Then you drive to a neighboring community: the streets are (relatively)<br>car-free. The lawns are all (at least) mowed. No one's house is hot<br>pink. No one has an auto repair shop in their driveway. The neighborhood<br>at least appears to be a place where people would *want* to live.<br><br>Which neighborhood do you think could command a higher price for a<br>similar house?<br><br>Making sure that holiday decorations are only visible *during the<br>holidays* makes for a neat neighborhood. This is definitely squarely<br>within the purview of an HOA.<br><br>To bring the analogy home: when you have a house with year-round holiday<br>lights, what do you think that might do to the neighbors' home values?<br>Is it really fair to them? The HOA exists to keep *their* home values<br>high by preventing *you* from doing wacky things to *your* house which<br>might lower *their* property values.<br><br>**TL;DR: Making sure neighborhoods stay neat is an important part of an<br>HOA's job, so it is right for them to regulate how long before and after<br>the holidays you can have holiday lights hung.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
