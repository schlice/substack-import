<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does Luke 14:23 imply that unbelievers are to be compelled by force to<br>become Christians, as Augustine argues?**<br><br>As with all things, context is important. Let's read the entire parable<br>as Jesus told it:<br><br>> The Parable of the Great Banquet<br>><br>> 15 When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to<br>> Jesus, "Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of<br>> God."<br>><br>> 16 Jesus replied: "A certain man was preparing a great banquet and<br>> invited many guests.<br>><br>> 17 At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who<br>> had been invited, 'Come, for everything is now ready.'<br>><br>> 18 "But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, 'I have<br>> just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.'<br>><br>> 19 "Another said, 'I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I'm on my<br>> way to try them out. Please excuse me.'<br>><br>> 20 "Still another said, 'I just got married, so I can't come.'<br>><br>> 21 "The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the<br>> owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant, 'Go out<br>> quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor,<br>> the crippled, the blind and the lame.'<br>><br>> 22 "'Sir,' the servant said, 'what you ordered has been done, but<br>> there is still room.'<br>><br>> 23 "Then the master told his servant, 'Go out to the roads and country<br>> lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full.<br>><br>> 24 I tell you, not one of those who were invited will get a taste of<br>> my banquet.'" *(Luke 14:15--24)*\[1\](#vaSwS){#cite-vaSwS<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>So what is it that Jesus is trying to say here? Matthew retells the same<br>story, so it may be easier to understand when you hear it from him:<br><br>> 1 Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying: 2 "The kingdom of<br>> heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. 3 He<br>> sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell<br>> them to come, but they refused to come.<br>><br>> 4 "Then he sent some more servants and said, 'Tell those who have been<br>> invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle<br>> have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding<br>> banquet.'<br>><br>> 5 "But they paid no attention and went off---one to his field, another<br>> to his business.6 The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and<br>> killed them. 7 The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed<br>> those murderers and burned their city.<br>><br>> 8 "Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding banquet is ready, but<br>> those I invited did not deserve to come. 9 So go to the street corners<br>> and invite to the banquet anyone you find.' 10 So the servants went<br>> out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, the<br>> bad as well as the good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.<br>><br>> 11 "But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man<br>> there who was not wearing wedding clothes. 12 He asked, 'How did you<br>> get in here without wedding clothes, friend?' The man was speechless.<br>><br>> 13 "Then the king told the attendants, 'Tie him hand and foot, and<br>> throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and<br>> gnashing of teeth.'<br>><br>> 14 "For many are invited, but few are<br>> chosen."\[2\](#kGBlX){#cite-kGBlX .citation_link}<br><br>Who is Jesus talking about here? Clearly, he is referring to religious<br>people who claim they have no time for God. They are represented by<br>people who have accepted an invitation to a wedding banquet, but when it<br>comes time to go, they can't seem to find the time to actually show up.<br>In Matthew's accounting, it's more than just not having time for God;<br>it's living in open contempt of God, and you can see that when the<br>guests torture and murder the servants who were simply delivering the<br>message.<br><br>To your question about *compelling* people off the streets to come in to<br>the banquet, he was trying to make the point that his house would be<br>absolutely full, and that even if one of the originally invited guests<br>wanted to attend, now they could not, because the house was full. He<br>says, "I tell you, not one of those who were invited will get a taste of<br>my banquet." The point of *compelling people off the streets* into the<br>banquet was to make the point that the king would do anything to ensure<br>that those who refused his invitation would not be welcome once they did<br>so. It has nothing to do with forcing religion upon anyone.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-vaSwS){.citation_index} [[Bible Gateway passage: Luke<br>14:15-24 - New International<br>Version](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=944d79&url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search%3DLuke%2B14%253A15-24%26version%3DNIV){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="biblegateway.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-kGBlX){.citation_index} [[Bible Gateway passage: Matthew<br>22:1-14 - New International<br>Version](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=39fd06&url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search%3DMatthew%2B22%253A1-14%26version%3DNIV){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="biblegateway.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
