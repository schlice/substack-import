<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [What you are describing is the beginnings of an eating<br>disorder. The feelings you describe are some of the feelings that people<br>with eating disorders commonly feel. I will avoid labeling this disorder<br>with a name; there are several eating disorders out there. I will let<br>the professionals handle that part.\<br>\<br>You need to seek mental health care. You need to do this soon (i.e. this<br>month). Please do not let this go. Talk to someone now before this gets<br>out of hand. Believe me, there are treatments available to help you. If<br>this gets worse, it can physically hurt you. The other respondents here<br>are correct, you can get seriously hurt if you allow this to continue.<br>Don\'t feel bad about going to seek help; none of us are perfect, we all<br>need help occasionally. Please talk to a mental health professional. If<br>you don\'t have one to talk to, talk to your doctor, or (worst case) go<br>to the ER.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
