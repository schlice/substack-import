<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>One of the first things we learned in our *Ethics of Law* class:<br><br>*You can\'t legislate morality.*<br><br>But why not? Isn\'t law the imposition of the morality of a legislator<br>onto the masses? Don\'t we impose our will (and thereby our morality)<br>onto the population through the imposition of law?<br><br>Yes and no.<br><br>The law that is imposed on the population is the minimum set of moral<br>standards required to function as a civil society. So, in a way, laws do<br>set morality, but only the most basic of morality. The laws we pass are<br>the minimum required standard of morality, not its height. Laws are<br>basic rules that people must obey if they are going to be able to live<br>side by side in a mutually beneficial arrangement. ***Laws, therefore,<br>set a baseline for human morality in a civil society***. Clearly, not<br>all citizens can live up to the standard set by the law, but laws (and<br>therefore basic required moral codes in any civil society) are defined<br>by the majority and are agreed to by the whole.<br><br>Laws certainly are not the end-all, be-all of morality. Why? Because<br>after the bare minimums are met, morality becomes *relative.* Above the<br>basics required for a society to function, your morality may not<br>apply to everyone. My morality says that we should go to church on<br>Sunday. Yours may not. Should we make a law that says that everyone must<br>go to church on Sunday? Certainly not! Our laws allow for the free<br>exercise of religion, or no religion at all. This means that each<br>citizen is allowed to exercise his or her own moral code when it comes<br>to religion; the state will not impose that set of moral standards on to<br>you. So in this situation (my morality says to go to church, yours may<br>not), whose morality is right? The answer is that both of our<br>moralities, in a free society, are right, and you have as much right to<br>live by your moral code as I have to live by mine.<br><br>Your statement about universal morality is untrue because once we have<br>passed the baseline of moral behavior to live in a civil society,<br>moralities differ. There is no such thing as universal morality. Many<br>have tried to define it, using various names. The UN put together a<br>statement of basic human rights (called the \"Universal Declaration of<br>Human Rights\"), which is, in essence, another attempt to set a baseline<br>for all human morality. But again, these are just baselines. They are<br>not moral life goals.<br><br>Laws set the baseline. Hopefully, your search for knowledge,<br>understanding, community, compassion, connection, and enlightenment set<br>the limit.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
