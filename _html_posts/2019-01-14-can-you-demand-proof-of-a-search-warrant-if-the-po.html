Video proof is helpful (take out your phone and record<br>them or take snapshots). Your lawyer will need this information.<br><br>You can demand to see the warrant all you like, but it's unlikely you'll<br>be able to physically prevent them from entering. They have battering<br>rams and superior force, and if they want in, they're coming in.
