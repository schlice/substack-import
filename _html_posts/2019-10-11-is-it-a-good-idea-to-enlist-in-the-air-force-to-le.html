<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it a good idea to enlist in the Air Force to learn how to fly? I<br>want to be a pilot as my career, but I know it's very expensive.**<br><br>If you want to be a pilot in the Air Force, enlisting will likely not<br>get you there.<br><br>I say *not likely* because while it is *possible,* it is one of the most<br>difficult paths in the Air Force to navigate. I personally know people<br>who were prior enlisted and made it into the Air Force Academy and went<br>on to become Air Force pilots. It is hard, but it is possible.<br><br>If your goal is to be an Air Force pilot, there are ways to do it that<br>have a higher degree of likelihood than enlistment.<br><br>The biggest thing you can do: go to college. The reason: **only Air<br>Force officers are pilots. And only college graduates can become Air<br>Force officers.**<br><br>Going to college gives you a chance to become an Air Force officer and<br>go to pilot training. Once you are an Air Force officer, you can get<br>into pilot training.<br><br>The big hurdle when you are enlisted is *becoming an officer*, not<br>*going to pilot training.*<br><br>If you can set yourself on the path of Air Force officer rather than<br>Air Force enlisted member, you will have a much higher chance of<br>becoming a pilot.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
