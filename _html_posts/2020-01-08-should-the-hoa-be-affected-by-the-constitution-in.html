<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should the HOA be affected by the constitution? In some communities,<br>the HOA can force residents to go to church or face fines and eviction<br>if not paid.**<br><br>*(US Answer Only)*<br><br>In the United States, a Homeowner's Association only has control over<br>your property. They do not have control over your life. They absolutely<br>cannot force you to go to church. If you have evidence to the contrary,<br>feel free to submit it as a comment to your question and we'll review.<br><br>The HOA only controls the community and how it looks (as well as how it<br>smells, some have noxious odor rules). To that end, they can write rules<br>(which you do have to follow) which dictate what the exterior of your<br>property must look like, and how you go about making changes to the<br>exterior of your property. They can also control things like how many<br>and what kinds of pets you can have, how you maintain the lawn, where<br>you park your cars, etc.<br><br>But whether or not you go to church? Nope, not under HOA control. Any<br>HOA trying to force a homeowner to go to church would find themselves on<br>the wrong side of a Constitutional lawsuit.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
