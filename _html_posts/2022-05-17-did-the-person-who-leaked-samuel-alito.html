<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Potentially. A Bloomberg article said it best: "A federal prosecutor<br>focused on protecting the integrity of the judicial process, and armed<br>with persuasive evidence of intentional leaking, will almost certainly<br>be able to present charges to a federal grand jury."<br><br>Here's some of the potential charges the leaker could face:<br><br>> Corruptly Influencing an Official Proceeding<br>><br>> Enacted with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 18 U.S.C. ยง 1512(c)(2)<br>> makes it criminal to, among other things, corruptly influence an<br>> "official proceeding." The issuance of an opinion certainly is part of<br>> an official proceeding, and, depending on the evidence, it is<br>> foreseeable that a law clerk could seek to corruptly (that is,<br>> wrongly, as in *United States v. Nordean*) influence a proceeding by,<br>> say, changing the outcome of the justices' vote or the scope of the<br>> court's holding, through external pressure, threat, intimidation, or<br>> otherwise.<br>><br>> Theft of Government Property<br>><br>> The taking of the confidential work product of the justices may also<br>> implicate 18 U.S.C. ยง 641, because, broadly described, it is the theft<br>> of government "property." Perhaps the law clerk "stole" the paper<br>> ("thing of value") on which the ruling was printed. If, as is likely,<br>> the value of the thing stolen is under \$1,000, however, we are in<br>> misdemeanor territory.<br>><br>> The more substantive question, characterized by a current circuit<br>> split, is whether confidential "information" qualifies as a "thing of<br>> value." As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit put it<br>> more than 40 years ago, the government has a "property interest in<br>> certain of its private records which it may protect by statute as a<br>> thing of value."<br>><br>> It is hard to disagree. After all, federal courts decide issues of<br>> enormous economic, social, and legal importance (and value). Advance<br>> notice of a court decision creating or removing an asserted right or<br>> privilege (or ruling in favor of one litigant or another in a business<br>> dispute) would appear to be especially "valuable." (See also *United<br>> States v. Middendorf* ---intangible confidential information is<br>> "property.")<br>><br>> Disclosure of Confidential Information<br>><br>> The disclosure of confidential court information might also fit well<br>> within the parameters of the oft-overlooked misdemeanor statute, 18<br>> U.S.C. ยง 1905 (prohibiting the "disclosure of confidential information<br>> generally"). Law clerks are federal employees, the information they<br>> obtain is "confidential," it comes to them "in the course of \their\<br>> employment," and the disclosure is not "authorized by law." (*United<br>> States v. Wallington*---U.S. Customs Service employee running<br>> unauthorized background checks for a friend; the confidential<br>> information need not come from, nor be generated by, a private party.)<br>><br>> Although it is true that the only Section 1905 prosecutions thus far<br>> have been brought against executive branch employees, this bit of<br>> legal historiography offers little protection to judicial or<br>> legislative branch employees. After all, the text applies to any<br>> "officer or employee of the United States," which includes, but is not<br>> limited to, any "department or agency thereof."<br>><br>> Finally, the fact of a 5-to-4 split ruling, the outcome of a case, or<br>> similar information can be said to "concern" or "relate to" the<br>> judicial "process," "operation," or "style of work,"---at least, the<br>> prosecutor will so argue (although there is some room for defense<br>> counsel to claim otherwise).<br>><br>> Conspiracy to Defraud the U.S.<br>><br>> In 1919, Ashton Embry, a clerk to Supreme Court Justice Joseph<br>> McKenna, sent an opinion to Wall Street financiers ahead of a judgment<br>> involving a railroad company. He was indicted for having violated 18<br>> U.S.C. ยง 371. The prosecution's theory was that, by releasing the<br>> opinion early, the clerk and his "co-conspirators deprived the Court<br>> of the right to announce its decisions at the customary time."<br>><br>> In short, the early release upset the court's established custom. The<br>> district court rejected Embry's motion to dismiss, but the prosecutor<br>> thereafter, for undisclosed reasons, dismissed the case. Although the<br>> case was not seen to its conclusion, the unfinished prosecution of<br>> Embry is interesting if for no other reason than that it belies recent<br>> assertions that law clerk leaking is terra incognita. (*Middendorf*<br>> ---holding that intent to defraud by sharing intangible information<br>> may be "incidental to another primary<br>> motivation.)\[1\](#UMMpL){#cite-UMMpL .citation_link}<br>><br>> \<br><br>Original answer:<br><br>Did the person who leaked Samuel Alito\'s draft opinion of the US<br>Supreme Court\'s decision to overturn Roe v.
