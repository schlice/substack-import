<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can a HOA prevent a homeowner from doing an emergency roof<br>replacement? Paperwork has been filed and phone calls attempted. I\'m<br>only receiving an automated response that they have 45 days to respond.<br>Nothing is changing on the roof.**<br><br>Ultimately, HOA rules require that you get approval before every change.<br><br>Can the HOA *physically prevent* you from doing an emergency roof<br>replacement? No, they cannot. They cannot prevent a contractor from<br>coming to your house, which you own, and repairing your roof.<br><br>However, if you do not follow HOA rules and get approval before work<br>commences, you can still be fined for that violation. It could be a<br>one-time fine for failing to get approval before commencing work (if<br>your HOA has such an offense). Or, if you do the work without approval<br>and it is wrong (i.e. your roofer puts the wrong color roofing tile on<br>the roof), the HOA can fine you for *every day that your roof is out of<br>compliance*.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
