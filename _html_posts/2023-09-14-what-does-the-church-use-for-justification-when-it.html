<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Bible sees suicide as equal to murder, which it is (self-murder).<br><br>God is the only one who gets to decide when a person should live and<br>when they should die. As it says in Psalms, "My times are in your hands"<br>(Psalm 31:15).<br><br>The Bible clearly says throughout that God gives life. It also says that<br>God gives, and God takes away (Job 1:21). Suicide (the taking of one's<br>one life), therefore, is ungodly because the person takes God's<br>authority on themselves to end their own life. No human should presume<br>to take God's authority on themselves.<br><br>Therefore, suicide is a sin.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
