<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [So I am not a psychiatrist, and no one here is going to<br>give you a diagnosis.\<br>\<br>BUT\<br>\<br>Because I have graduated from the Google School of Psychiatry, I feel<br>confident enough to provide you with this:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> *Troubled children are much more likely to mistreat animals.*<br>> While less than 5% of U. S. children are estimated to have<br>> intentionally hurt an animal, for children at mental health clinics,<br>> animal cruelty rates range from 10 to 25%. Prof. Frank Ascione at the<br>> University of Denver and Prof. Arnold Arluke at Northeastern<br>> University estimate that one in four children and adolescents with<br>> conduct disorder have abused animals. Children who have been<br>> physically abused and exposed to domestic violence are at even higher<br>> risk. In an assessment of 1433 children ages 6 to 12, Ascione found<br>> that among abused children, 60% had abused animals.\<br>> \<br>> ***Animal abuse is often the first sign of serious disturbance among<br>> adolescent and adult killers*.** On Oct. 1, 1997, Luke Woodham, a<br>> sophomore at Pearl High School, in a suburb of Jackson, MI, stabbed<br>> his mother to death and then opened fire on classmates with a hunting<br>> rifle, killing two girls and wounding seven other students.<br>> Investigators later found Woodham's account of his torture and killing<br>> of his pet dog Sparkle, which the boy described as his "first kill."<br>> On May 21, 1998, fifteen year old Kip Kinkel shot his parents to death<br>> before emptying three guns at his classmates in Thurston High School,<br>> Springfield, OR, leaving one dead and 26 injured. Kip had often<br>> bragged to others at school about how he tortured animals. Jeffrey<br>> Dahmer, Albert DeSalvo (the "Boston strangler"), David Berkowitz (the<br>> "Son of Sam") and Carroll Edward Cole, a serial killer accused of 35<br>> deaths, all recounted animal torture as their first violent act. When<br>> counselors at several federal penitentiaries evaluated inmates for<br>> levels of aggression, 70% of the most violent prisoners had serious<br>> and repeated animal abuse in their childhood histories, as compared to<br>> 6% of nonaggressive prisoners in the same facilities.<br><br>Source: [[Psychology<br>Today](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f6be14&url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/why-the-wild-things-are/201302/do-mass-killers-start-out-harming-pets){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="psychologytoday.com"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>\<br>So what does all of this mean? For you, nothing. If you have grown out<br>of the whole \"hurting animals\" thing, I would venture to say you\'re<br>fine. But if you still feel that way (like it would be fun, exciting, or<br>anything to torture animals), I would suggest you speak with a<br>psychiatrist.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
