<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**After 7 years of marriage, my husband has started talking to his<br>girlfriend. What should I do?**<br><br>Look, we can speculate all day about why he's talking to his<br>ex-girlfriend again. So let's not do that.<br><br>The only way you're ever going to know is if you talk to him. Tell<br>him you know that he's talking to his ex-girlfriend, and you're<br>concerned. Is he unhappy with your marriage? Is there something missing<br>in your marriage that he may be looking for from his ex? Is there<br>something that you're doing/not doing that is concerning to him?<br><br>Talking to him is not "admitting weakness" or anything of the sort. It's<br>you working to save your marriage. Open, honest communication is the<br>only thing that will save a marriage.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
