What recourse does Congress have?**<br><br>Since I'm assuming you are talking about the "impeachment inquiry"<br>regarding President Trump, I'll answer by quoting a post from Andrew C.<br>McCarthy, former Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern<br>District of New York who is most notable for leading the 1995 terrorism<br>prosecution against Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman and eleven others.<br><br>McCarthy is a contributing writer at<br>[TheHill.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b6bcbe&url=http://TheHill.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="thehill.com"}]{.qlink_container}. This is a long read, but<br>it is 100% worth it if you truly want to understand why the White House<br>can ignore these "subpoenas" (and also why I'm putting all this stuff in<br>quotes. Also, emphasis mine):<br><br>> There is no impeachment inquiry. There are no subpoenas.<br>><br>> You are not to be faulted if you think a formal inquest is under way<br>> and that legal process has been issued. The misimpression is<br>> completely understandable if you have been taking in media coverage<br>> --- in particular, reporting on a haughty Sept. 27 letter from House<br>> Democrats, presuming to direct Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, on pain<br>> of citation for obstruction, to cooperate in their demands to depose<br>> State Department officials and review various records.<br>><br>> The letter is signed by not one but three committee chairmen. Remember<br>> your elementary math, though: Zero is still zero even when multiplied<br>> by three.<br>><br>> What is portrayed as an "impeachment inquiry" is actually just a<br>> made-for-cable-TV political soap opera. The House of Representatives<br>> is not conducting a formal impeachment inquiry. To the contrary,<br>> congressional Democrats are conducting the 2020 political campaign.<br>><br>> The House has not voted as a body to authorize an impeachment inquiry.<br>> What we have are partisan theatrics, proceeding under the ipse dixit<br>> of Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). It raises the profile, but not the<br>> legitimacy, of the same "impeachment inquiry" House Judiciary<br>> Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) previously tried to<br>> abracadabra into being without a committee vote.<br>><br>> Moreover, there are no subpoenas. As Secretary Pompeo observed in his<br>> fittingly tart response on Tuesday, what the committee chairmen issued<br>> was merely a letter. Its huffing and puffing notwithstanding, the<br>> letter is nothing more than an informal request for voluntary<br>> cooperation. Legally, it has no compulsive power. If anything, it is<br>> rife with legal deficiencies.<br>><br>> The Democrats, of course, hope you don't notice that the House is not<br>> conducting a formal impeachment inquiry. They are using the guise of<br>> frenetic activity by several standing committees --- Intelligence,<br>> Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, Oversight and Reform, Financial Services,<br>> and Ways and Means --- whose normal oversight functions are being<br>> gussied up to look like serious impeachment business.<br>><br>> But standing committees do have subpoena power, so why not use it?<br>> Well, because subpoenas get litigated in court when the people or<br>> agencies on the receiving end object. Democrats want to have an<br>> impeachment show --- um, inquiry --- on television; they do not want<br>> to defend its bona fides in court.<br>><br>> They certainly do not want to defend their letter. The Democrats'<br>> media scribes note the chairmen's admonition that any failure by<br>> Pompeo to comply "shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the<br>> House's impeachment inquiry." What a crock.<br>><br>> In criminal proceedings, prosecutors demand information all the time<br>> and witnesses often resist --- just as congressional Democrats<br>> encouraged the Justice Department and FBI to resist when<br>> Republican-controlled committees were trying to investigate such<br>> matters as Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse. Presumptively,<br>> resisting an information request is not evidence of obstruction. It is<br>> evidence that the recipient of the demand believes he or she has a<br>> legal privilege that excuses compliance. The recipient can be wrong<br>> about that without being guilty of obstruction.<br>><br>> Congressional Democrats know this, of course --- many of them are<br>> lawyers. They are issuing partisan letters that pose legally offensive<br>> threats, rather than subpoenas, because this is a show, not an<br>> impeachment inquiry. Subpoenas don't require chest-beating about<br>> obstruction. Everyone knows they are compulsory, but everyone also<br>> knows they may be challenged in court. Such challenges take time,<br>> though, and Democrats are in a hurry to close this show after a short<br>> run.<br>><br>> To be sure, the Constitution vests the House alone with the power of<br>> impeachment (as opposed to impeachment trials, which are the sole<br>> responsibility of the Senate). The judiciary has no authority to tell<br>> the House how to conduct impeachment proceedings. And the House is a<br>> "majority rules" institution, so if Speaker Pelosi and her partisans<br>> want to ipse dixit their way to impeachment articles, no one can stop<br>> them.<br>><br>> That said, the courts maintain their authority to protect the legal<br>> rights of persons and institutions ensnared in kangaroo tribunals. The<br>> fact that House Democrats invite you to their circus does not require<br>> you to beclown yourself.<br>><br>> **Any competent court asked to evaluate a demand for information under<br>> the rubric of impeachment will observe that the process has a<br>> history**. When the Framers debated whether to include an impeachment<br>> clause in the Constitution, they had serious concerns. They were<br>> designing a separation-of-powers system that endowed the coordinate<br>> branches with checks and balances to police each other. They<br>> understood that impeachment authority was necessary, but feared it<br>> would give the legislature too much power over the executive.<br>><br>> They also worried that impeachment could be politicized. If it were<br>> too easy to do procedurally, or it could be resorted to for trifling<br>> acts of maladministration, factions opposed to the president would be<br>> tempted to try to overturn elections and grind the government to a<br>> halt.<br>><br>> **To address these concerns, the Framers adopted a burdensome standard<br>> --- high crimes and misdemeanors (in addition to treason and bribery)<br>> --- that would restrict impeachable offenses to truly egregious abuses<br>> of power. Then they erected an even higher bar: a two-thirds<br>> supermajority requirement for conviction in the Senate.**<br>><br>> **All this was to ensure that the electoral will of the people must<br>> never be overturned in the absence of misconduct so severe that it<br>> results in a broad consensus that the nation's well-being requires<br>> removing the president from power.**<br>><br>> Although the House has the raw power to file articles of impeachment<br>> based on frivolous allegations and minor abuses, the Senate<br>> supermajority requirement for removal is designed to have a sobering<br>> effect on the lower chamber. **Impeachment should not be sought out of<br>> partisanship.** There must be misconduct that would convince objective<br>> Americans, regardless of their politics, that the president must be<br>> ousted --- not merely criticized or censured, but stripped of<br>> authority.<br>><br>> In defending against any congressional demand for information, the<br>> president has various privileges against disclosure. Executive<br>> components such as the State Department are also repositories of<br>> highly sensitive information involving national security and foreign<br>> relations --- conduct of the latter being a nearly plenary executive<br>> authority. The judiciary is generally deferential toward the<br>> executive's claims of privilege. But Congress is given wider latitude<br>> to probe in a real impeachment inquiry. **When the House, as an<br>> institution, endorses such an inquiry in a formal vote, the courts<br>> must presume the inquiry is based on a reasonable suspicion of<br>> grievous misconduct.**<br>><br>> **By contrast, any reasonable judge asked to weigh the demands for<br>> information presented to Pompeo would not give them the time of day.<br>> They do not reflect the judgment of the House. They are reflective,<br>> instead, of partisan House leadership that realizes it does not have<br>> impeachable offenses --- so much so that Pelosi & Co. fear the wrath<br>> of voters if Democrats in districts friendly to President Trump are<br>> put to the test of voting to authorize a formal impeachment inquiry.**<br>><br>> Every presidential impeachment inquiry, from Andrew Johnson through<br>> Bill Clinton, has been the subject of bipartisan consultation and<br>> debate. The House has recognized that its legitimacy, and the<br>> legitimacy of its most solemn actions, must be based on the<br>> consideration of the whole body, not the diktat of a few partisan<br>> bosses.<br>><br>> Not this one. This one is a misadventure in exactly the bare-knuckles<br>> partisanship the Framers feared. To be sure, no one has the power to<br>> prevent willful House leadership from misbehaving this way. But we're<br>> not required to pretend the charade is real.<br>><br>> Democrats are mulishly determined to ram through an article of<br>> impeachment or two, regardless of whether the State Department and<br>> other agencies cooperate in the farce. Their base wants the<br>> scarlet-letter "I" attached to Trump. The party hopes to rally the<br>> troops for the 2020 campaign against Trump (although smarter Democrats<br>> know it could boomerang on them).<br>><br>> If Democrats truly thought they had a case, they wouldn't be in such a<br>> rush --- they'd want everyone to have time to study it. But they don't<br>> have a case, so instead they're giving us a<br>> show.\[1\](#lESYo){#cite-lESYo .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-lESYo){.citation_index} [[Ignore the hype --- this is not<br>an impeachment<br>inquiry](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c99e06&url=https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/464140-ignore-the-hype-this-is-not-an-impeachment-inquiry?utm_source%3Dquora%26utm_medium%3Dreferral){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="thehill.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
