<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: no.<br><br>Longer answer: Your car is a lethal weapon. It can kill people.<br>Before you can run someone over, you have to prove that there was a<br>threat to your life or the lives of the people in your car. Most<br>definitely, if the protestors start smashing your car windows with rocks<br>or tools, by all means defend yourself and your family with whatever<br>means you have at your disposal (which in this case simply means lifting<br>your foot off the brake).<br><br>What *should* be happening is police should be getting tougher on<br>protestsors who block roadways. This is *patently illegal*. You<br>cannot block a roadway and call it a protest. In fact, you must have a<br>permit to hold a protest on a public street so the road can be closed<br>and traffic re-routed. Additionally, if the police tell you to leave,<br>you must leave or you can be arrested for this alone.<br><br>This is not happening because right now, police chiefs are *afraid*. I<br>get that. But when do we stop being afraid and when do we wake up to the<br>fact that these are not protestors, they are bullies? I'd say call<br>in the Fire Department and let them practice putting out fires on these<br>protestors. A few seconds of being blasted by the truck-mounted water<br>cannon will clear them from the highway pretty quickly. It won't hurt<br>them, and if they get hurt and try to sue, they're going to have a hard<br>time explaining why they were standing in the middle of a highway,<br>illegally, attempting to protest without a permit.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
