<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You cannot be thrown out of a restaurant because you didn't have<br>documentation, as there is no documentation requirement in the Americans<br>with Disabilities Act (ADA) for service animals. An establishment which<br>did this would likely be in violation of the ADA, and if this happened<br>to you, you should consult with an attorney in your area who specializes<br>in disability law.<br><br>However. in order for your animal to be allowed in the restaurant, you<br>must have an actual service animal which has been trained to assist with<br>a recognized disability, and the restaurant owner is allowed to ask you<br>about that.<br><br>The establishment may ask you two questions:<br><br>1.  Is this a service animal required because of a recognized disability<br>    under the ADA?<br>2.  What is the animal trained to do?<br><br>Beyond these two questions, they cannot ask you for anything else. A<br>vest on the animal is not required. Documentation or an ID tag is not<br>required. A service animal recognized by ADA is allowed anywhere that<br>the public is allowed.<br><br>The only time your animal can be asked to leave is if it is being<br>disruptive and you cannot control it, or it could potentially cause harm<br>to others.<br><br>Note that we have seen a rise in people bringing *emotional support<br>animals* with them because of certain medical or psychiatric conditions.<br>It is important to note that restaurants *can* exclude emotional<br>support animals from their establishments, as in most cases, these<br>animals are not trained to provide a service because of a recognized<br>*disability* under ADA, and are therefore *not covered* in the same way<br>that service animals are covered. Psychiatric conditions are most<br>generally not classified as disabilities under ADA. Also, in the large<br>majority of cases, emotional support animals are not trained to do<br>anything, which also makes them ineligible for protection under ADA.<br><br>This means that if a restaurant owner asks you if your emotional support<br>animal is trained to assist with a recognized disability under ADA and<br>you say no, they can ask you to take it out, and they would not be wrong<br>to do so. You have no legal recourse in such a case.<br><br>However, all of that said, if you ever experience an incident in which<br>you are asked to leave an establishment and you think your rights under<br>ADA may have been violated, please speak to an attorney in your area who<br>specializes in disability law.<br><br>*I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
