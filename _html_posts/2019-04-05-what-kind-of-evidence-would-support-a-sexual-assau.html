<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What kind of evidence would support a sexual assault case that will<br>prove it was not consensual?**<br><br>Any physical evidence or direct witness testimony that speaks to the<br>fact that the contact was unwanted.<br><br>These can include, but are not limited to:<br><br>- defensive injuries (scratches, bruises, marks) consistent with a<br>  struggle in the orientation the victim claims he or she was in at the<br>  time<br>- "rape kits" performed by an emergency room physician<br>- witness testimony confirming that a struggle was directly heard.<br>  Hearsay is completely useless (i.e. I heard from so-and-so that she<br>  said no).<br>- witness testimony immediately following the assault speaking to the<br>  state of mind of the victim, even if the crime was not immediately<br>  reported.<br><br>Beyond direct physical evidence or direct witness testimony, the span of<br>time between the alleged attack and any reporting made is also a factor.<br>Did the victim go immediately (or reasonably quickly) to an emergency<br>room or call the police, or did the victim wait 20 years before telling<br>anyone? The quicker the victim reports the attack, the more direct<br>evidence can be collected, and it also speaks to the consensuality of<br>the contact.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.
