<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is no such thing as instrument take-offs. If you can't see the<br>runway to take off, the airport is "socked in" and is inoperable. There<br>is a minimum visible distance which must exist around the airport in<br>order to take off or land there.<br><br>Runways are indeed assigned before takeoff, and ground control directs<br>you to your assigned runway in the same way your GPS directs you to get<br>somewhere (turn left on taxiway BB and taxi to runway 34R).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
