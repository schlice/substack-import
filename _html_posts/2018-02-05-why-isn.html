<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Apple does not give away their software for free. You buy Apple's<br>software every time you buy an Apple product.<br><br>Here's the difference: Microsoft is a software company and Apple is<br>a hardware company.<br><br>Apple sells hardware. The sell iPhones and iPads and MacBooks and a<br>variety of other hardware. They also distribute software that you can<br>only legally run on that hardware. Legally, I can't take Mac OS X and<br>install it on my Dell Precision Tower here under my desk. You are only<br>licensed to install Apple software on Apple hardware. Apple does not<br>independently sell software because that software is designed only to<br>run on the hardware you already bought. Therefore, the cost of Apple's<br>software is bundled into the hardware you already purchased. You didn't<br>get Apple software for free. You paid for it when you bought Apple<br>hardware.<br><br>By contrast, Microsoft is a software company. Sure, they have made<br>some forays into the hardware side with devices like the Surface, but by<br>and large, Microsoft sells software. When you buy a PC with Windows<br>pre-installed on it, you have received an OEM copy of Windows (or<br>Original Equipment Manufacturer copy). Microsoft entered into a<br>licensing agreement with that computer manufacturer and they sold copies<br>of Windows at a bulk discount. The hardware manufacturer then passes on<br>the lower cost of that copy of Windows to the end consumer in the price<br>of their computer.<br><br>Since you asked about Office, and not about Windows, let's compare<br>apples to apples:<br><br>Apple's iWork suite (which is similar to to Microsoft Office) is priced<br>under a similar pricing structure. Once you have a license to install<br>Apple software (which means you have purchased or are otherwise a valid<br>user of Apple hardware), you can install iWork at no additional charge.<br>Office 365 is priced under a new Microsoft pricing structure which<br>recognizes the cloud-based nature of work today, and the requirement for<br>portability. As a personal user, you can buy a license to Office 365,<br>for one user, which includes cloud-based access to all of the Office<br>applications from anywhere, tablet and mobile use, and full installation<br>on one PC, for \$6.95 per month, or \$69.99 per year. If you want to<br>purchase the standalone Office software package as with previous<br>versions of Office, it's \$149.95.<br><br>**TL;DR: You actually bought iWork when you bought your Apple hardware.<br>The cost of Apple's software is rolled into the cost of Apple's<br>hardware, which is why you cannot install Apple software onto anything<br>but Apple hardware.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
