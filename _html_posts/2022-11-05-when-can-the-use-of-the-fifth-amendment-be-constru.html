<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In criminal cases, you are allowed to "plead the Fifth" and your silence<br>cannot be used against you. In civil cases however, such as divorce<br>cases or cases over orders of protection, you can still claim your Fifth<br>Amendment right if necessary, but the judge or the jury is allowed to<br>assume that by "pleading the Fifth," your answer would have been bad for<br>you. This is called an *adverse inference*.<br><br>So while pleading the Fifth doesn't necessarily mean that you are<br>guilty, and doing so never amounts to an admission of guilt, in civil<br>cases, pleading the Fifth creates an adverse inference, which may not<br>help your case.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
