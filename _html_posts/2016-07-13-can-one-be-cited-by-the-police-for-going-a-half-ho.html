<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Under normal circumstances, you are allowed to drive below the speed<br>limit. There are some limitations. On some roads (such as highways),<br>there can be a minimum speed posted; you cannot drive below the minimum<br>speed posted. Also, you cannot create a traffic hazard; if you are<br>driving slower than the rest of traffic, please try to stay to the<br>right. If you are driving so slowly that you create a traffic hazard,<br>you can also be stopped and/or cited. If you are driving like this, you<br>should have your hazard lights on and be in the rightmost lane or on the<br>shoulder.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
