<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think Christians are concerned about both.<br><br>**But believers who simply misunderstand God have a better chance of<br>being saved than atheists.**<br><br>Some people are simply not destined to be saved. I know it sounds harsh,<br>but it's nevertheless true. And if that is true, then die-hard atheists<br>are beyond salvation through their own choices.<br><br>But Christians who misunderstand God have a chance to improve, learn,<br>and be redeemed.<br><br>I'd want to invest more time in the misunderstanding Christian than in<br>the die-hard atheist.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
