<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>U. S. military academy cadets from any academy can cross-commission<br>into another service. They can apply for, and accept, a commission in<br>any service, depending on availability of slots in the other service. I<br>had several USAFA classmates who took Army or Marine Corps commissions.<br><br>The number who cross-commission is very low; generally if you're at the<br>Air Force Academy, you'd really like to be in the Air Force, and<br>similarly for the other service academies. But perhaps there was some<br>other factor that didn't allow you to get into the service academy of<br>your choice, so you entered whatever service academy you could make it<br>into with hopes of cross-commissioning. Or perhaps, as in my classmates'<br>cases, you have a better chance of doing the job you really want to do<br>in another service than in the Air Force. Regardless, we had roughly<br>1200 graduates in my class, and I think there were maybe 10 cadets who<br>cross-commissioned.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
