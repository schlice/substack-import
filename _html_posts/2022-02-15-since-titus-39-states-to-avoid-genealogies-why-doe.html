It refers to a genealogical practice which was going on in Paul's<br>time: using lineage to create false authority.<br><br>During Paul's time, there were many apostate teachers who would recite<br>their lineage to give their teaching more credibility. For the same<br>reason, other apostate teachers would manufacture a lineage out of whole<br>cloth. This practice caused a great deal of controversy among the Jews<br>and the Gentiles, and this was the practice that Paul was warning<br>against, not necessarily creating a family tree or investigating who<br>your ancestors were.<br><br>It's okay to have pride in your family tree. But you shouldn't use your<br>genealogy to attempt to make yourself look better or more important.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Since Titus 3:9 states to avoid genealogies, why does the Bible have<br>numerous genealogies in it?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
