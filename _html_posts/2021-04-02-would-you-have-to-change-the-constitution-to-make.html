<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Would you have to change the Constitution to make DC a state?<br><br>Yes. There are several sections of the Constitution which must<br>change in order to make Washington D.C. a state.<br><br>- Article I Section 8<br><br>This section reads:<br><br>> The Congress shall have Power\... To exercise exclusive Legislation in<br>> all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles<br>> square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of<br>> Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States\....<br><br>This essentially means that Congress controls the area which houses the<br>seat of government. Congress can delegate some of its powers to the<br>local mayor, but it always retains the final authority.<br><br>But the Supreme Court has *also* ruled that this means that giving D.C.<br>its own statehood (and thus its own authority) would be abrogating this<br>power which the Constitution assigns to Congress.<br><br>- Article IV, Section 3<br><br>This section says that new states can only be made out of the areas of<br>old states with the permission of the legislatures of those states and<br>Congress. The land for DC came from Maryland, so you would need<br>Maryland's permission to turn DC into a state, right?<br><br>Some argue that you don't, because Maryland already gave it up. They<br>argue that in Maryland's land use agreement, there were absolutely no<br>conditions placed on the use of that land.<br><br>However, that same land use agreement also says that the land was given<br>\"pursuant to the tenor and effect of the eighth section of the first<br>article of the constitution of the government of the United States."<br>Maryland, therefore, did not give the land to become a new state, but to<br>house the seat of government *outside* of the control of a state.<br><br>- The 23rd Amendment<br><br>This one is going to be tough to argue against. It says:<br><br>> The District constituting the seat of government of the United States<br>> shall appoint in such manner as the Congress may direct: A number of<br>> electors of President and Vice President equal to the whole number of<br>> Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would<br>> be entitled if it were a State, but in no event more than the least<br>> populous State\....<br><br>It's literally right in the text. It grants DC the number of electors<br>for President and Vice President to be the number of Congressional<br>representatives that DC would have *if it were a state*.<br><br>In other words, the Constitution recognizes clearly that DC was never<br>intended to be a state. It's really tough for Congress to pass a law to<br>make DC a state when the Constitution refers to it "as if it were a<br>state."<br><br>So yes, at the very minimum, a Constitutional amendment would be<br>required to make DC a state.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
