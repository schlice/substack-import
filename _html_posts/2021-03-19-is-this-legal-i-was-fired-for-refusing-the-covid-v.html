<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is this legal? I was fired for refusing the covid vaccine because I<br>believe there's not enough testing and EUA approval only I wanted to<br>wait for long term results and FDA approval first? Can they fire me? In<br>Oregon?**<br><br>Everyone here telling you that Oregon is an "at will employment" state<br>is correct. They can fire you for any non-protected reason.<br><br>Everyone here telling you that your employer in Oregon can fire you<br>because you didn't take the COVID-19 vaccine is 100% wrong.<br><br>Both of those statements are true. How? Vaccines are governed under<br>Federal law, and Oregon's right to work statute is state law.<br><br>Last time I checked, Federal law trumps state law.<br><br>Drugs covered only by Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) can only be<br>taken voluntarily, when a patient agrees to the risk and at a patient's<br>own risk. This is Federal law surrounding EUAs.<br><br>Consequently, you cannot be compelled to take a drug only covered by an<br>EUA, and **no employer can terminate you for failing to agree to take a<br>vaccine only covered by an EUA.**<br><br>If your termination was *specifically* listed as due to you failing<br>to take the COVID-19 vaccine, you can hire an attorney and sue them for<br>wrongful termination. Even in a right-to-work state, you can still sue<br>for wrongful termination. Let's say you were terminated because you are<br>black. Can the employer say, "Well, it's a right to work state, I can<br>fire you for any reason"? Of course not, it would be in violation of the<br>federal Civil Rights Act. This is exactly the same. If they fired you<br>specifically because you didn't take a vaccine only authorized under an<br>EUA, they have violated Federal law surrounding vaccines.<br><br>If, however, no specific reason was given for your termination (which is<br>the upshot of working in a "right to work" state), you're going to have<br>a difficult time proving that you were fired because you didn't take the<br>shot, unless you have some evidence showing that you were pressured to<br>take the vaccine with loss of your job, you failed to take the shot, and<br>then lost your job. If you have such evidence, the advice is the same:<br>hire an attorney and sue the employer for wrongful termination.<br><br>Oregon state law prohibits retaliating against an employee for refusing<br>to participate in a violation of federal law. Organizations that require<br>COVID-19 vaccination in violation of federal law may face lawsuits under<br>these state laws. You cannot be fired because you refused to violate<br>federal law and take a vaccine against your will when it is only covered<br>by an EUA.<br><br>**TL;DR: Hire an employment attorney in your area and investigate<br>whether or not you can sue for wrongful termination due to<br>retaliation.**<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice.
