<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Constipation is an over-absorption of water from stools in<br>the colon (large intestine). It can be caused by dehydration (which is<br>why you are being recommended to drink lots of water), and it can be<br>caused by a lack of roughage in your diet (which is why you are being<br>recommended to eat more fiber). Laxatives are a short-term fix (and<br>overuse of laxatives can actually increase the likelihood of<br>constipation over time). You\'re looking at a more long-term solution.\<br>\<br>Here\'s the list of some causes of constipation (from WebMD):\<br>]<br><br>- Antacid medicines containing calcium or aluminum<br>- Changes in your usual diet or activities<br>- Colon cancer<br>- Eating a lot of dairy products.<br>- Eating disorders<br>- Irritable bowel syndrome<br>- Neurological conditions such as Parkinson\'s disease or multiple<br>  sclerosis<br>- Not being active<br>- Not enough water or fiber in your diet<br>- Overuse of laxatives (Over time, this weakens the bowel muscles)<br>- Pregnancy<br>- Problems with the nerves and muscles in the digestive system<br>- Resisting the urge to have a bowel movement, which some people do<br>  because of hemorrhoids<br>- Some medications (especially strong pain drugs such as narcotics,<br>  antidepressants, or iron pills)<br>- Stress<br>- Under active thyroid (hypothyroidism)<br><br>Notice that in only one bullet do they talk about a lack of water or<br>fiber in your diet. Most of these require diagnosis by a doctor or<br>gastrointestinal specialist.\<br>\<br>If you\'ve already hit the high points (water and fiber) and you\'re not<br>getting any relief, it\'s time to make an appointment with your doctor.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
