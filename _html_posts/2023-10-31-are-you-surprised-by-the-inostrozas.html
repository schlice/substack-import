<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes. The Inostrozas' experience is definitely the *exception* rather<br>than the *rule.*<br><br>For those who are unfamiliar, here's their story:<br><br>[https://www.nbclosangeles.com/ne\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cabc1c&url=https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/business/money-report/in-some-states-its-nearly-impossible-to-buy-a-home-that-isnt-part-of-a-homeowners-association-expert-says/3256237/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nbclosangeles.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>In the vast majority of states, you cannot sell a home unless the HOA<br>dues are satisfied. This couple found that their property had an<br>outstanding balance from before they bought it: unpaid dues, along with<br>other penalties and charges.<br><br>In almost all states, the HOA dues must be satisfied before the deed can<br>be transferred. In some states, the sale can take place, and the unpaid<br>dues will be separated from the property. The HOA can still go after the<br>previous owner to try to get the money that they are owed. Typically<br>however, the Association has to recover the debt through foreclosure or<br>personal lawsuit (except in maybe one or two states, they can\'t legally<br>ask the new buyer to pay it). In most states there is a three year<br>statue of limitations on this. In some cases, if the debt is for a<br>special assessment (i.e. a new amenity that the new owners may benefit<br>from), the Association *may* ask that the new buyer to pay some or all<br>of that (but in most states, this isn\'t legal either), and even if they<br>did, that would be part of the sale contract.<br><br>In the vast majority of US states, the debt stays with the owner, not<br>the property.<br><br>In any case, if you're buying a house in a HOA-controlled community, you<br>should ensure during the closing that the property is "free and clear,"<br>and the HOA does this for you by providing you with a certificate of<br>account showing that there are no past due fees on the property. In most<br>closings, the title company retrieves this information and you get a<br>copy during the closing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
