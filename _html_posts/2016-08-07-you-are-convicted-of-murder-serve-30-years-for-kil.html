<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There was a movie made about this starring Ashley Judd called,<br>accordingly, \"Double Jeopardy.\" Good movie. It just so happens that<br>this was exactly the plot of that movie.<br><br>In this case, you could not be charged with murder since you were<br>already found guilty of, and served your time for, that murder. The<br>double jeopardy rule applies. You could be charged with a few other<br>offenses if you shot him, such as unlawful discharge of a firearm<br>resulting in death, discharge of a firearm within city limits, etc., and<br>on the civil side you could be found liable for wrongful death and owe<br>punitive damages to the family of the person you killed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
