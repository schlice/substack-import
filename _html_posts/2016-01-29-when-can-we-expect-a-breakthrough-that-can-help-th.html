<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Thanks for the A2A.<br><br>First, it\'s important to understand that we have made major<br>progress in the treatment of this disease over the last roughly 40<br>years. Before then, we didn\'t have a way to slow down the disease at<br>all. Medicine could only treat the symptoms of the disease, and not very<br>effectively either. We\'ve known about MS and recognized symptoms of the<br>disease for more than 300 years. Having the first real advances in<br>treatment of the disease just happening within the last 30 years is<br>astonishing.<br><br>Starting about 25 years ago, some of the first MS treatments were<br>introduced. They are a class of medications called<br>*immunomodulators*. Primarily, they modulate (or modify) the immune<br>response using *interferons*. Interferons are naturally-occurring<br>proteins secreted by cells in the immune system. These interferons are<br>not well understood, but we understood them well enough to create<br>medications which can *modulate* the immune system response. The early<br>MS medicines (Avonex, Betaseron) are interferons that modulate how the<br>immune system responds to nerve cells, slowing down their attacks on<br>myelin. Other immunomodulators like Copaxone are synthetic proteins<br>which mimic the protein structure of myelin. When immune cells bind to<br>Copaxone\'s synthetic protein, they create anti-inflammatory cells<br>rather than the inflammatory cells created when immune cells bind to<br>myelin.<br><br>A host of other MS medicines have been introduced, including the latest<br>medicines, oral medications. Finally, something to treat MS, in a pill!<br><br>While none of these are *cures*, we have progressed the medications such<br>that a person diagnosed with MS today can expect roughly the same<br>lifespan as someone without MS, and can also enjoy an acceptable quality<br>of life, with some lifestyle modifications. Incidence of severe<br>disability is low (around 10%), so most people with MS will continue<br>being normal, active people.<br><br>Now, on to specifically what you asked: what progress has been made<br>towards a cure? Until we can identify a cause, we can\'t think<br>about identifying a cure. We know epidemiologically that there is a<br>hormonal component (as women get MS two to three times more frequently<br>than men), there is a familial component (close first-degree relatives<br>of someone with MS have a higher chance of developing the disease),<br>there is a geographical component (living at higher than 40 degrees<br>latitude poses a greater risk of developing the disease), and there is<br>an ethnic component (whites of eastern European descent are most likely<br>to get the disease). We know that vitamin D has prophylactic qualities,<br>and studies have shown that many MS patients also have very low vitamin<br>D levels, and generally cannot maintain normal vitamin D levels without<br>supplementation. We also know that there is some infectious trigger that<br>initiates the disease process in a person who is predisposed to getting<br>the disease. Beyond that, we still do not know what defect causes the<br>immune system to attack normal, healthy body cells.<br><br>We have learned much more over the past 15 years about T cells, which<br>are the primary aggressors against myelin. There are three broad<br>categories of T cells:<br><br>- Helper T cells which recognize foreign antigens and activate other T<br>  cells<br>- Regulatory T cells which do the opposite, or \"turn off\" other immune<br>  functions<br>- Cytotoxic or \"Killer\" T cells which attack and destroy antigenic<br>  cells.<br><br>What we\'ve found over the last 15 years is interesting regarding the<br>blood of MS patients when compared to healthy persons:<br><br>- Decreased regulatory T cells in peripheral blood during an attack<br>- Increased helper T cells in CSF (cerebrospinal fluid)<br>- Increased activated T cells crossing the blood-brain barrier, which<br>  then attracts other immune cells<br>- Increased T cell activity against myelin<br>- T cells found in MS plaques (scars) on nerves<br><br>So what does all of this mean for treatment and potentially a cure? The<br>MS Society says the following (emphasis mine):<br><br>> The abnormal immune process that is likely to be responsible for the<br>> central nervous system demyelination in MS appears to involve<br>> selective activation of helper T cells and killer T cells, with a<br>> corresponding decrease in regulatory T cells. **These findings suggest<br>> the rationale for therapies that target only specific T cells or T<br>> cell receptors that are sensitized to myelin.** Some of these<br>> approaches --- such as the use of monoclonal antibodies directed<br>> against certain T cells --- have proven successful in treating animals<br>> with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of<br>> MS. Pilot clinical trials are in progress. **Future experimental<br>> therapies may involve antibodies directed against the cytokines that<br>> turn on the T cells or therapy designed to desensitize or inhibit T<br>> cell activity.**<br>><br>> While much more information is needed before the exact nature of the<br>> immune response in MS is explained, it appears that T cells and their<br>> cytokines are the keys to this process. **Ongoing research in these<br>> areas may provide new, specific immunotherapies that will stop the<br>> progression of MS, without harming any immune cells that are not<br>> involved in the process of myelin destruction.**<br><br>I am actually using one such drug \-- Gilenya. Gilenya works by trapping<br>certain T cells within lymph nodes and not allowing them to leave and<br>attack the nerve cells. Not all T cells are affected, but enough T cells<br>are trapped in lymph nodes to slow down the progression of the disease.<br><br>I think we are just a few years away from having therapies that directly<br>target the progression of MS while leaving other immune cells untouched.<br>We\'re very close today. So we are rapidly approaching a time where we<br>can directly target the cause of the symptoms of the disease, even if we<br>haven\'t yet found the actual cause of the immune-mediated response yet.<br><br>I have said since the beginning, if I was to get MS at any time in<br>history, this isn\'t the worst time to get it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
