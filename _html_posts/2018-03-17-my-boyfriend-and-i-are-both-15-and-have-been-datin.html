<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I'm 15 and my parents recently found me and my boyfriend (almost 16)<br>of a year & 5 months have had oral sex. They have Christian morals and<br>they've basically banned me from seeing him. When I try to talk it out<br>it ends in a fight. What can I do?**<br><br>What can you do? Nothing. You are a minor. Your parents are in charge of<br>you until you turn 18. That means they set the rules. They can literally<br>send you to school, bring you home, and lock you in your room in all of<br>the in-between time until you turn 18. Additionally, what you're doing<br>may be illegal where you live. Some states don't consider sex between<br>two minors as statutory rape, but some do (I know Utah and California<br>do, off the top of my head). Nevertheless, while you are a minor living<br>at home, your parents make the rules.<br><br>So if your parents' rules say no sex until you're married, or no sex<br>until you're 18, you're going to either have to abide by their rules, or<br>be sneakier and better at lying to them.<br><br>I'm not going to tell you what I think you should do because that's not<br>what you asked. You didn't ask for my opinion about your activities, and<br>I'm not going to give it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
