<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the United States, it\'s not really illegal to record much. The<br>general rule is if you can see it, you can shoot it. If it is<br>occurring in a place where there is no reasonable expectation of<br>privacy, and where there is no specific exclusion on video recordings<br>(i.e. certain government buildings, etc), it\'s perfectly legal to<br>record anything, including the commission of a crime. What\'s more<br>important about recording a crime is not the act of recording the crime,<br>but what is done with the video afterward.<br><br>If you are, truly, a bystander, meaning you don\'t know what they are<br>about to do, you never encouraged them to do it, and you are not a<br>participant, but you record the commission of a crime, what is most<br>important is what you do with the recording.<br><br>The law enforcement side of me says you should immediately take the<br>video to the police. If the police can use the video and find the<br>victim, they can arrest the perpetrators and charge them with the crime.<br><br>The friend side of me would say that you should tell your friends to<br>turn themselves in along with the video. Prosecutors will tell you that<br>there is a lot to be said for voluntary compliance, especially when the<br>crime would have otherwise been very difficult, time-consuming and<br>costly to solve. Prosecutors will work with you if you work with them. I<br>would convince my friends that it\'s in their best interest to take the<br>video down to the police station themselves and turn themselves in.<br>Anything else would be worse for them. If they don\'t turn themselves in<br>and they get caught, they will face much harsher penalties than if they<br>voluntarily come forward. They will get off with a much lighter sentence<br>if they turn themselves in.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
