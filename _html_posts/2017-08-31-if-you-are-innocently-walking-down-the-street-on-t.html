<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Stopping you and asking for your ID are two separate things.<br><br>The stop is covered in the United States by the Supreme Court decision<br>in *Terry v. Ohio*. The police have the ability to perform brief<br>investigatory stops, sometimes called *stop-and-frisk* or *Terry stops*.<br>The police have to be able to articulate a valid reason for stopping you<br>using specific facts, which constitutes what we now call *reasonable<br>suspicion*. The officer has the right to continue the line of reasonable<br>suspicion and *frisk* the suspect, which is different from a *search*<br>incident to an arrest, or a search with a warrant. The frisk is in the<br>outermost clothing only, and is only for the officer's safety (i.e.<br>searching for weapons).<br><br>Asking for your name and/or valid ID is more related to [[stop-and-ID<br>laws](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=af08f0&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_and_identify_statutes){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, which vary by state.<br>These laws have been found to be Constitutional, but not all states have<br>them. For example, in Colorado, the stop-and-ID law reads:<br><br>> \(1\) A peace officer may stop any person who he reasonably suspects<br>> is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a crime and may<br>> require him to give his name and address, identification if available,<br>> and an explanation of his actions. A peace officer shall not require<br>> any person who is stopped pursuant to this section to produce or<br>> divulge such person\'s social security number. The stopping shall not<br>> constitute an arrest.<br>><br>> \(2\) When a peace officer has stopped a person for questioning<br>> pursuant to this section and reasonably suspects that his personal<br>> safety requires it, he may conduct a pat-down search of that person<br>> for weapons.\[1\](#TjLtH){#cite-TjLtH .citation_link}<br>><br>> C.R.S. 16--3--103(1--2)<br><br>So the Colorado statute takes the *reasonable suspicion* standard<br>developed in *Terry* and extends it to a state-level requirement to<br>provide name, address, ID (if you have it), and an explanation of your<br>actions. Note that SSN is not part of your personally identifying<br>information. Also of note is that paragraph 2 expands and clarifies<br>*Terry* to include pat-down searches looking specifically for weapons.<br><br>While *Terry* is a SCOTUS ruling, not all states have mandatory ID laws<br>during *Terry* stops.<br><br>Now, if you are arrested, you are *required* to give your personally<br>identifying information, and you may not lie about that. If you're just<br>stopped on the street, whether or not you are required by law to give<br>your name varies by state.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-TjLtH){.citation_index} [[Colorado Revised Statutes<br>Research<br>Tool](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a750a1&url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/colorado/?app%3D00075%26view%3Dfull%26interface%3D1%26docinfo%3Doff%26searchtype%3Dget%26search%3DC.R.S.%2B16-3-103){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="lexisnexis.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
