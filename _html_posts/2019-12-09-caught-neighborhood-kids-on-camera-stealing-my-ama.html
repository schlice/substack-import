<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Caught neighborhood kids on camera stealing my Amazon package, should<br>I post the video online and call the police?**<br><br>Do these things, in this order:<br><br>1.  Call the parents. Show them the video. Insist they talk to their<br>    kids and get the package back, preferably unopened, but at least<br>    with all of your stuff in it.<br>2.  If they don't play ball, go to the police. The police may actually<br>    help you, since the video clearly identifies the kids. They still<br>    may not do anything about it.<br>3.  If neither of these avenues of action work for you, feel free to<br>    post the video online. Call out the kids and their parents. Don't<br>    slander them, don't lie about them, and don't tell your neighbors to<br>    do or say anything to them. Just say very clearly what happened and<br>    let everyone else draw their own conclusions.<br><br>Oh. and then give the police report to Amazon (you'll get a police<br>report even if they don't investigate) so that they can re-send your<br>package. This time, send it to a nearby Amazon Locker instead of to your<br>door.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
