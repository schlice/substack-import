<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It is a [[Heat Reflective Emergency<br>Blanket](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e86994&url=http://www.amazon.com/Reflective-Emergency-Blanket-Survival-blanket/dp/B000FNQ7A4){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}, sometimes called a survival<br>blanket. It folds down to about the size of a deck of cards, so it\'s<br>very convenient to carry and keep with you in an emergency pack. Rescue<br>crews can carry lots of these in small amounts of space.<br><br>It would be silly if it didn\'t work, but it actually does keep you<br>warm! It reflects about 90% of your own body heat back to you, even in<br>temperatures below freezing. It\'s waterproof and thus rainproof.<br><br>In the heat, if you use it to create a small lean-to, it reflects solar<br>heat away from you, thus keeping you cooler underneath it than any<br>traditional covering could. Plus, with such a large reflective surface,<br>it\'s perfect for signaling rescue craft as to your location.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
