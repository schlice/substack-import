Is it<br>illegal to do so?**<br><br>[[Roger<br>Curtiss](https://www.quora.com/profile/Roger-Curtiss-1)]{.qlink_container}<br>has the right answer here.<br><br>"Flashing your lights" by turning them on and off *may be illegal in<br>some states* as some states have a statute which requires motorists to<br>have headlights on continuously during periods of reduced visibility or<br>darkness. So if you're flashing your lights in this way during a period<br>of reduced visibility or darkness, you could be cited under that law.<br><br>"Flashing your lights" by using the "flash to pass" function where<br>pulling the turn signal stalk momentarily turns on your high beams is<br>likely not illegal in most states.<br><br>Plus as Roger mentioned, part of the goal of police monitoring speed is<br>to "encourage" compliance with the speed limit. Drivers warning other<br>drivers of police activity is no different than using Waze and marking<br>police locations, or (back in the day) using CB radio and calling out a<br>"smokey" when you saw one. Any one of these activities accomplishes that<br>goal, so honest police organizations (who are not trying to make revenue<br>off of speeding tickets) should acknowledge this.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
