<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, it is possible for a Filipina to get MS. I am unaware of any higher<br>or lower risk to Filipinas specifically in terms of contracting MS, but<br>it's certainly not impossible for a Filipina to contract MS.<br><br>The next step for you is to find a neurologist in your area who can help<br>you diagnose what you're experiencing. MS is a difficult disease to<br>diagnose, because every symptom of MS is also a symptom of another<br>disease or condition. Your neurologist has to rule out all of the other<br>diseases or conditions which can cause your symptoms before diagnosing<br>you with MS.<br><br>Short answer: find a neurologist who can help you determine from where<br>your symptoms originate.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I lived in the Philippines and I think I have the symptoms of multiple<br>sclerosis. Is it possible for a Filipina to have it?<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
