<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes.<br><br>The process for changing your name varies by state, but to get a name<br>change outside of a marriage or a divorce, you will generally be<br>required to file a petition with the court.<br><br>The court will check a few things before granting your petition. They<br>will make sure that, for example, you are not changing your name to<br>avoid prosecution, or to avoid creditors. They'll also make sure that<br>you're not changing your name to the name of a famous person in order to<br>mislead people, or changing your name to a racial slur or a name which<br>includes "fighting words."<br><br>If the court approves your petition, they will enter a decree with your<br>new name.<br><br>You can then use the decree to get a new Social Security card, a new<br>driver's license, and with all three of those, you can correct your name<br>everywhere else it is recorded (mortgage, credit cards, etc).<br><br>But the bottom line is that if you want to legally change your name to<br>Lucifer or Iblis, you should talk to a lawyer in your area to ensure<br>that your name is legally valid.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer**:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
