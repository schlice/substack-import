<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You asked if the police have the legal right to deny a<br>person their civil rights. Since detention is a denial of your right to<br>freedom, if a police officer detains you, you have just had your civil<br>rights denied.\<br>\<br>So yes, legally, a police officer can deny anyone their civil rights.\<br>\<br>If you feel your civil rights have *unjustly* or *unfairly* been denied,<br>you can hire a lawyer and sue the department for unlawful<br>arrest.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
