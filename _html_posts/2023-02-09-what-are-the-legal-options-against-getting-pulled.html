<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are no legal options against these things. There are only options<br>for fighting them after they happen.<br><br>If you get pulled over without probable cause that a traffic violation<br>occurred or that there is criminal activity happening, you can argue<br>that the stop was unlawful.<br><br>If your car is searched but the officer did not have probable cause to<br>do so, you can argue that the search was unlawful and anything found in<br>the search is inadmissible.<br><br>If your municipality has a law which says that officers clocking traffic<br>must be in plain sight, or in marked vehicles, or have at a minimum<br>marker lights turned on, and you were clocked by an officer not meeting<br>the minimum standard as required in your jurisdiction, you can argue<br>that the stop was unlawful.<br><br>\<br><br>You cannot *prevent* the traffic stop from happening. You cannot<br>*prevent* the search from happening. If the officer demands to<br>search your car, you can decline because he needs probable cause or a<br>warrant, but if he insists anyway, you must allow him to proceed.<br><br>However, if the legal standards were not met, you and your attorney can<br>argue that later. The officer must follow the law or the stop will be<br>ruled unlawful and any evidence found inadmissible.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
