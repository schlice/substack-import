<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>*(Full disclosure: I voted for Trump, but remember I'm a law guy, so my<br>main issue was the future composition of the Supreme Court, and I vote<br>for policy, not personality)*<br><br>I think if you don't understand how scared some Americans are, you only<br>need to turn on the TV and look at the mainstream media outlets showing<br>protests and rioting in New York, LA, and Chicago. Interestingly enough,<br>the protests are all taking place in areas which voted for Clinton.<br>There are no protests taking place anywhere where a majority of voters<br>voted for Trump. I wonder if there is a correlation. Not to say that<br>it's all Democrats that are protesting, but let's be honest with<br>ourselves, it is.<br><br>But it's also just as important to understand that ***conservatives felt<br>exactly as you feel today when President Obama was elected***. We were<br>scared that social programs would outpace job creation (it did), we were<br>scared that taxes would rise in response (it did), we were afraid that<br>socialist principles would guide policy (it did), and as a result, we<br>got stimulus plans (throwing money at a problem instead of fixing the<br>root of it) and Obamacare (also throwing money at a problem instead of<br>fixing it). Most of our fears were realized, some were not. You should<br>also note that none of our fears had anything to do with the color of<br>his skin, and everything to do with his policies. I was perfectly ready<br>for a black president, just not *that* one. The point I'm trying to<br>make: many of our fears are not really fears at all, but are concerns<br>about the future direction of the country, which is not in line with our<br>own beliefs about the best direction for the country.<br><br>You should also note that ***not a single conservative rioted or<br>protested*** after Obama was elected (twice). I wonder if that's telling<br>at all. (EDIT: there was a small protest at the University of<br>Mississippi in 2012 after Mr. Obama was re-elected, but it was hardly<br>anything to move the needle in comparison to what we are seeing today).<br><br>Ultimately, while everyone's feelings are important, everyone's feelings<br>matter, and I do understand that some people are nervous, scared, etc.,<br>I believe those feelings are unfounded for a number of reasons:<br><br>- The President, while setting the *tone*, doesn't actually make<br>  *law*. Yes it's true, the President sets the tone for his<br>  administration. He has a number of priorities that he wants to<br>  accomplish during his first 100 days. On his first day, he pledged to:<br>  - Repeal and replace 'Obamacare,'<br>  - Immediately suspend the admission of Syrian refugees<br>  - Order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight<br>    years, and begin lifting all regulations that are hurting our<br>    workers and our businesses<br>  - Terminate every single unconstitutional executive order signed by<br>    President Obama, thus restoring the rule of law to our land<br>  - Begin implementing plans for construction of a wall along our<br>    southern border<br>  - Get rid of international gangs of thugs and drug cartels<br><br>...and that's all on Day 1. During the subsequent 99 days, he said he<br>would:<br><br>- - "Drain the Swamp" - the colloquial term for rooting out corruption<br>    in Washington<br>  - Get the ball rolling on a "constitutional amendment to impose term<br>    limits on all members of Congress."<br>  - Get a law started barring government officials from lobbying the<br>    government within five years of their service and prohibiting<br>    lobbying by those officials on behalf of foreign governments.<br>  - Institute a hiring freeze in order to reduce the size of the federal<br>    government.<br>  - Institute campaign finance reform by forbidding foreign lobbyists<br>    from raising money on behalf of campaigns in the U.S.<br>  - Renegotiate NAFTA and withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership<br>    (TPP)<br>  - Renegotiate the Iran nuclear deal<br>  - Call a NATO summit to update their mission and re-balance members<br>    "financial commitments"<br>  - Cancel payments to the UN Commission on Climate Change and its<br>    associated programs, diverting that money to domestic infrastructure<br>    improvements<br>  - Increase investment in the US military<br>  - Be "unpredictable" when fighting ISIS in the Middle East<br>  - Implement "the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan"<br>  - Increase police training and create a task force on violent crime<br>    (note: we already have such a task force, but perhaps he could<br>    bolster it)<br>  - Eliminate Common Core<br>  - Immediately move to nominate a Supreme Court justice to replace<br>    Antonin Scalia.<br><br>That's a pretty exhaustive list. But realistically, how many of these<br>can he do *on his own*? Very few, in fact. He can modify and undo<br>Executive Orders, as they are nothing more than orders directing the<br>Executive branch of the government how to implement their directives. He<br>can change those just as easily as they were implemented (live by the<br>executive order, die by the executive order). He can call a NATO summit,<br>he can nominate a Supreme Court justice, and he can modify immigration<br>policy, all on his own, under the law. Everything else requires the<br>support and action of Congress. So he's not some rogue maverick who is<br>going to upend the world. Congress has to act in order to accomplish the<br>vast majority of this plan. So it's telling that this is the first time<br>since Grover Cleveland was president that a Republican had a unified<br>government to actually implement some of these things. Admittedly,<br>understanding that this is the first time the Republicans have had a<br>real chance to implement some of their ideas, you might be a little<br>worried. I'm nervous, but it's more of a nervous excitement to see what<br>a unified Republican government can truly accomplish.<br><br>- **Regardless of how you feel or how you voted, the sun will come out<br>  tomorrow.** To quote the song, yes, the sun will come out tomorrow. We<br>  will all get up, go to work, feed our kids, wash our cars, water our<br>  lawns, and generally go about our lives unaffected by what happens in<br>  Washington. We put a lot of stock in the presidency, probably way more<br>  than we should.<br>- The President cannot undo laws. Some people are afraid that Trump<br>  will "overturn *Obergefell* and overturn *Roe*." Neither of these<br>  things are further from the truth. The president cannot undo a law.<br>  There are only three ways a law can be changed:\<br>  \<br>  - Congress can write a new law which nullifies the first law\<br>  - Congress can repeal the law\<br>  - The court can rule the law unconstitutional, thus nullifying it.\<br>  \<br>  The SCOTUS is unlikely to change any of its decisions, because its<br>  political makeup will be exactly the same under Trump as it was when<br>  these decisions were passed down. Remember that Scalia was a strict<br>  constructionist, Trump will be nominating a strict constructionist. So<br>  the same court makeup that brought you *Obergefell* will be the same<br>  makeup after Trump nominates a replacement for Scalia. There are no<br>  plans to overturn *Obergefell;* any challenge to the law will likely<br>  not have cert granted, as a decision has already been made.<br>- **Many of the fears are based on things that Trump was asked during<br>  the course of the campaign**, and many of those questions were just<br>  silly and misleading, trying to miscategorize candidate Trump. Do you<br>  remember when the headline came out that Trump would punish a woman<br>  for having an abortion? I do. But not many remember ***the question he<br>  was asked*. He was specifically asked, "*If we made abortion<br>  illegal***, would you support penalties for a woman who had an<br>  abortion?" This is one of those dirty, underhanded questions you ask<br>  someone so you can get a sound bite you can quote later on and bash<br>  someone with. Trump's answer: Of course, if you made it illegal, of<br>  course you would have penalties for having an abortion. Duh. And they<br>  (conveniently) omitted the question, and only reported the answer. An<br>  experienced politician would have seen that trick question for what it<br>  was. Trump, being a businessman (not an experienced politician),<br>  didn't.<br>- Trump knows that he doesn't know everything. He knows plenty. But<br>  he doesn't know everything. We tend to ask a lot of our president, but<br>  in fairness, *we shouldn't expect a leader to know everything*. We<br>  should expect a leader to *delegate* to the smart people to get the<br>  job done. We expect the leader to set the tone and drive the agenda.<br>  We expect his staff to do the heavy lifting of actually implementing<br>  things. If you've seen some of his potential choices for his cabinet,<br>  you'll also see that he wants to surround himself with some of the<br>  brightest minds he can in order to accomplish his agenda.<br>- Trump has already shown that he can act presidential, even if he<br>  doesn't do it every minute of the day. He has met with foreign leaders<br>  and no international incidents occurred. He has met with our current<br>  sitting president, and they had a long conversation about many topics,<br>  including the smooth transition of power between two diametrically<br>  opposed political parties. This is a hallmark of society in the United<br>  States: the peaceful transition of governments.<br><br>Be proud that our leaders have stated publicly, many times, that the<br>election is over and we need to get behind our new government and<br>support it and play a part in it. Hillary said it in her concession<br>speech: we have an obligation to take part in our government, not just<br>every four years, but every day.<br><br>Do you think that *protests* are the best way to accomplish that? Do you<br>think that clogging city streets, holding signs and chanting are going<br>to get your viewpoint across? It's probably less effective than you<br>think. You're probably better off lobbying your elected officials:<br>calling their offices, emailing them, attending roundtables with them,<br>etc. Make your opinion and your voice heard, but do it in the most<br>effective way possible. Your representatives in government represent<br>*you, regardless of your political beliefs*. Work *with* them.<br>Support them, keep them informed on issues that affect you. They need to<br>know, as it helps them shape policy.<br><br>Remember too that not everything will work out the way you want it to.<br>You don't win 100% of the contests you enter.
