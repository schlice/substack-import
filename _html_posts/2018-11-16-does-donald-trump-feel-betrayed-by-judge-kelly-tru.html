<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does Donald Trump feel betrayed by Judge Kelly, Trump\'s appointee,<br>who just ruled that Jim Acosta\'s White House press pass be<br>reinstated?**<br><br>He probably does, but he shouldn't.<br><br>If Trump did his job, he should have appointed judges who follow the law<br>and the Constitution.<br><br>Apparently, there is at least a question of whether Acosta's 5th<br>Amendment due process rights were violated, and a temporary restraining<br>order was issued to, at least temporarily, preserve that right.<br><br>This is a decision which, while I find curious how the courts intend to<br>override White House security protocol with a Constitutional amendment,<br>I can get behind.<br><br>Again, I don't have to like it or agree with it, but I do have to at<br>least support it temporarily, as it is only a temporary restraining<br>order.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
