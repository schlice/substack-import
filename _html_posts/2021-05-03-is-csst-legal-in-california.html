<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Interesting question. I didn't know the answer. So I did what I always<br>do: I asked Google. Here's what Google told me, in an article from 2002.<br>First, I learned that CSST stands for Corrugated Stainless Steel Tubing,<br>or flexible tubing designed for natural gas delivery. I also learned<br>that proposed legislation in November of 2001 would have prohibited<br>several types of piping for natural gas, including PEX water piping, and<br>CSST.<br><br>Instead, they made a new proposal:<br><br>> \G\as piping may be wrought iron, steel, yellow brass, or types K, L<br>> or ACR copper tube. Approved polyethylene pipe may be used in<br>> underground applications. CSST may be used if it is part of a system<br>> listed by an approved agency, " \... except that the local<br>> administrative authority may disapprove use of corrugated stainless<br>> steel tubing based on health, safety or performance considerations."<br>><br>> HCD noted that both copper tubing and CSST had previously been<br>> approved in California under the 1998 California Mechanical Code. The<br>> department said it could not find any corroborated reports or<br>> scientific evidence that the materials posed health and safety<br>> concerns.\[1\](#qcIZf){#cite-qcIZf .citation_link}<br><br>However, a quick review of current California Plumbing Code includes<br>using CSST:<br><br>> 1212.1 Connecting Gas Appliances<br>><br>> Appliances shall be connected to the building piping in accordance<br>> with Section 1212.5 through Section 1212.7 by one of the following:<br>><br>> \...\<br>><br>> \(5\) CSST where installed in accordance with the manufacturer\'s<br>> installation instructions.\[2\](#FFEFo){#cite-FFEFo .citation_link}<br><br>As always, when you are dealing with things like natural gas or electric<br>in your home, I would always consult a licensed, bonded professional<br>before undertaking any project where you tie in to utilities.<br><br>> \<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is CSST legal in California?<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice.
