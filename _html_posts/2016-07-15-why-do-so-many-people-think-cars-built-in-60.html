<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>People make a *value judgment* and compare cars to any other product<br>commercially available on the market, like toasters, blenders, and<br>refrigerators. They say, "these products are made cheaply, with<br>components which wear out faster, and are not designed to last." People<br>then incorrectly assign these product characteristics to cars.<br><br>This is incorrect for many reasons, but primarily because auto<br>manufacturers are under some of the strictest government guidelines<br>controlling their products, far stricter than any other product<br>manufacturer.<br><br>For example, you may have noticed a strong trend in the auto industry<br>towards smaller engines and the addition of turbochargers to make up for<br>the difference in BHP (brake horsepower). This was not caused by any<br>trend in buying habits (as the rest of the manufactured goods markets<br>are), it was caused by government clean-air regulations. Fuel efficiency<br>can only be increased so far, as far as physics allows, so in order to<br>increase fuel efficiency further than physics (which is normally<br>impossible), the only thing which can be done is to reduce the size of<br>the engine. Smaller engines burn less fuel and therefore, by default,<br>run more "efficiently" in terms of miles per gallon. But that reduction<br>in engine size reduces the power output of the engine, which is why<br>turbochargers were added.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
