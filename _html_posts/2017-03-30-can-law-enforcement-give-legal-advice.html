<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You're asking about whether or not a police officer can give you "legal<br>advice," meaning advice you can use in a court of law.<br><br>**The short answer is only lawyers licensed in the jurisdiction in<br>question can give legally-binding advice, and they will only do so if<br>you are in an attorney-client relationship with them.**<br><br>But you're not going to get a legal consultation every time you have<br>simple questions of law, right? Of course not. So the question becomes:<br>*do you need "legal advice" for every possible legal question?*<br><br>Let's take the police out and substitute Quora instead, to illustrate<br>the answer. If you were to ask Quora about those laws, there would<br>probably be a tag at the bottom of the answer that says that the answer<br>is "informational," not "legal advice." Answers do not constitute the<br>formation of an attorney-client relationship, nor are the answers<br>solicitation to form such a relationship. They are informational only.<br><br>And ideally, all you need is "information," not "legal advice."<br><br>The information you get from state or local police officers, as far as<br>whether or not they are legally binding, would be exactly the same. The<br>information you get from them is "informational." If you act on that<br>information, and it is legally incorrect, you could face charges. Of<br>course, you'd have a pretty rock-solid defense when you quote your<br>conversation with a police officer who gave you the advice. But if it's<br>the police that are telling you what to do, I'd be very surprised if the<br>police then charge you with violating the law they told you was not a<br>violation in the first place.<br><br>*In short, asking a police officer is about the best advice you can get<br>short of talking to a lawyer.* Does it rise to the level of "legal<br>advice?" Technically, no it does not. However, if there is any<br>organization which works with the law and legal matters as much as<br>lawyers, it is the police.<br><br>Therefore, I would still feel pretty confident accepting advice from the<br>police on legal matters that pertain exactly to their job, such as<br>commercial vehicle laws, firearms transportation, etc. I certainly<br>wouldn't ask them about tax law or corporate law, but they regularly<br>deal with the portions of the law pertaining to road transportation,<br>firearms, criminal activity, family law, etc., and I would think they<br>probably have a decent grasp on those legal concepts for their area.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
