<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [HuffPo was kind enough to provide [[the details of that<br/>show](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8ea6e8&amp;url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zoe-triska/every-clue-revealed-in-true-detective-episode-4_b_4759353.html){.external_link<br/>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br/>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br/>qt-tooltip="huffingtonpost.com"}]{.qlink_container} and a few salient<br/>facts. The most important one:\<br/>\<br/>]<br/><br/>&gt; CLUE FIVE: He mentions that it\'s the detectives curse to have the<br/>&gt; solution right under your nose, but to be paying attention to the<br/>&gt; wrong clues.<br/><br/>\<br/>The detective is never fortunate enough to have the solution right under<br/>his nose. In the case of my big Italian schnoz, if it was there, I<br/>likely would miss it too.\<br/>\<br/>From what I know of actual detectives (I was raised by one), the clues<br/>aren\'t elusive. They are right there, staring you plainly in the face,<br/>not hiding under your nose (regardless of how big it may be). It is the<br/>facts{.underline}, on the other hand, that take a great deal of<br/>hard work to find, and often are still elusive. I have witnessed<br/>investigations that have gone on for months and have produced nothing. I<br/>have witnessed others that have gone on for months and finally revealed<br/>something which the detective could use to find and close in on the<br/>criminal and eventually arrest (and hold) the same criminal.\<br/>\<br/>The Detective\'s Curse, therefore, in my opinion, is knowing exactly who<br/>did it and how they did it, but being unable to prove it with hard<br/>evidence, and having \"the establishment\" try to thwart your efforts at<br/>every turn.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
