<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I spend most days, at some point, feeling useless and stupid.<br>Psychologists tell us that your attitude is a better indicator of<br>success than your intelligence. So it's a good bet that you just "feel"<br>useless and you just "feel" stupid. With work, you can improve.<br><br>How? The first step: take a look at the top of this thread, up near your<br>question. There is a box labeled "There is help" there with some phone<br>numbers and email addresses for you. Please call one of them and talk to<br>those folks. They are very good at what they do.<br><br>Ignore the pills and the beer, it's only going to make you ill. Pick up<br>the phone instead.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
