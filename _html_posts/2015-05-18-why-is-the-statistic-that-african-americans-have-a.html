<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Because it\'s in vogue these days to blame all bad black<br>outcomes on race. Everyone from the president on down is doing it.\<br>\<br>No one has open, honest conversations about what causes bad black<br>behavior. No one even admits that there is such a thing. It\'s<br>tantamount to racism to even admit something such as that, especially if<br>you\'re white.\<br>\<br>Plus, there are entire industries in the United States that capitalize<br>on racism, such as the NAACP, an organization which has made its<br>business monetizing white guilt. They have a vested interest in keeping<br>the narrative of \"racism\" causing all bad black outcomes going. They<br>even convince blacks that want to talk about the real issues that they<br>are nothing more than sell-outs.\<br>\<br>Some blacks even believe that other blacks who actually want to discuss<br>these issues are racist against blacks, which by definition, is<br>impossible (racism, by definition, is a state which believes that your<br>race is better than another race; since the two races in question are<br>the same, racism does not apply). They blame blacks talking about the<br>real issues on everything from \"groupthink\" to brainwashing by the<br>white community.\<br>\<br>C\'mon, people! When are you going to wake up and actually start to<br>address the real issues?\<br>\<br>For example, ***why do blacks commit a disproportionate amount of<br>crime?***\<br>\<br>Blacks make up about 14% of the population of the United States, yet<br>they commit more than half the violent crime in this country. The black<br>population of state prisons (where 90% of our prisoners are) is 37.5%.<br>37% of those prisoners are there because of violent crimes, not drugs.<br>Why is that? Why do blacks commit proportionately more crime than their<br>proportion of the population? If they committed a proportionate amount<br>of crime, then only 14% of violent crimes would be committed by blacks,<br>yet it\'s more than 50%. Why? Could it be because of social norms in<br>black society? Could it be that there is a culture that rejects good<br>behavior? Or is it all \"racism?\" Is it ol\' whitey keepin\' the black<br>man down, and all he can do is fight back? Is there some pockets of that<br>still around? Of course there is, and as long as people are people, it<br>will always exist. But is the leading cause? Is it the driving factor?\<br>\<br>If it were the leading factor, then racism would have to be far more<br>prevalent in society than it is. As it is, we don\'t tolerate racism<br>when we find it. Very few racist people actually exist out in the open.<br>When they are discovered, they are ostracized and marginalized. So is it<br>really so big a problem that it would drive these violent outcomes?\<br>\<br>The leading cause of death for young black men is homicide, and in 90%<br>of cases, the shooter is another young black man. How is racism part of<br>those stories? There\'s no other race involved in 90% of these cases.\<br>\<br>One narrative being bandied around is that racist cops are out there<br>killing blacks for no good reason. Except that it\'s not true. Cops are<br>six times more likely to be shot by a black man than the other way<br>around. Cops aren\'t even involved in 98% of black shootings.\<br>\<br>As I already said, racism exists. There will always be those who are<br>driven by a fear and hatred of things they don\'t understand or can\'t<br>appreciate. But to claim that it is the leading factor in all bad black<br>outcomes is to deny the evidence that is plainly there: there is a<br>\"learned helplessness\" that pervades the black culture that says that<br>all bad black outcomes are based on race, and that the black man is<br>continually and constantly being hounded by race issues, and that his<br>only recourse is violence. Is that really the truth, or is that the<br>story we tell ourselves to justify our behavior?\<br>\<br>If you have constructive points to share, please feel free. But<br>please don\'t call me a cracker racist, or try to insult me or shame or<br>guilt me. It won\'t work, so don\'t bother. Please limit your responses<br>to the question, and to the points raised.\<br>\<br>Again, just so we\'re clear: if your comment has merit, I\'ll respond.<br>If I don\'t respond\...you know why.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
