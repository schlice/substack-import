<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is Quora happy for people to ask how to commit criminal acts, and<br>censure those who object?**<br><br>Because [[Quora's Conduct<br>Policy](https://www.quora.com/about/conduct)]{.qlink_container} doesn't<br>prohibit it.<br><br>Specifically, the Conduct Policy prohibits the following in relation to<br>illegal acts:<br><br>> 1. Illegal activity<br>><br>> Do not use Quora to engage in unlawful activity or to promote illegal<br>> acts.<br><br>When someone answers a question about how to commit a criminal act, the<br>answerer is not "promoting an illegal act." They are merely answering a<br>question on how to do a thing, as many people all over the Internet are<br>wont to do. That thing may be illegal in one or more locations, but the<br>choice about whether or not to break the law remains with the reader.<br><br>This is the very nature of free speech. Quora ensures that people do not<br>engage in unlawful activity, and they don't support the promotion of<br>unlawful activity, but when people are *genuinely curious* about how<br>criminals do things, they can feel safe asking, and people can feel safe<br>answering.<br><br>For example, one of my more popular answers is in regards to[ [a way to<br>defeat traffic cameras and red light<br>cameras](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-way-to-trick-traffic-cameras-so-they-wont-have-the-license-number/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}.<br>I began my answer explaining that in nearly all states, adding any<br>accessory or treatment to your license plates that enables you to evade<br>a traffic camera is illegal, but then I discussed those treatments and<br>accessories. We had a lively discussion that veered off into the<br>Mythbusters testing of some of the myths surrounding radar speed<br>measuring devices. It was a generally well-received answer.<br><br>But nowhere in my answer did I *promote* doing any of the things we<br>discussed. As we've already mentioned, whether or not you do a thing is<br>entirely up to you. Additionally, the laws may be different where you<br>live. We reach a global audience as well, so this is important.<br><br>Now, after all of this, if you see an answer that you believe violates<br>the Conduct Policy, please report it. Quora's Moderation Team will<br>gladly review the content, and if it is found to violate a policy, it<br>will be removed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
