<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Correlation does not equal causation.<br><br>Jesus did not suddenly gain the power to do miraculous works at the<br>moment he was baptized by John the Baptist in the Jordan River. Jesus<br>was still fully God. But he didn't begin his ministry until after that<br>event.<br><br>> Now it came about when all the people were baptized, that Jesus also<br>> was baptized, and while He was praying, heaven was opened, and the<br>> Holy Spirit descended upon Him in bodily form like a dove, and a voice<br>> came out of heaven, "Thou art My beloved Son, in Thee I am<br>> well-pleased." (Luke 3:21-22 NASB)<br>><br>> And when He began His ministry, Jesus Himself was about thirty years<br>> of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph, the son of Eli... (Luke<br>> 3:23 NASB)<br><br>Once he began his ministry, he started performing miracles. The Bible<br>has no record of Jesus performing miracles before his ministry began.<br><br>There are some Gnostic legends of Jesus performing miracles as a child,<br>but these have been roundly rejected by both the Protestant and Catholic<br>churches. These legends were written long after Jesus' and the apostles'<br>deaths (around 300 AD).<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Jesus only started doing miraculous works and deeds after he got the<br>Holy Spirit. Couldn\'t he do those without the Holy Spirit? Does that<br>mean believers can also do those awesome things?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
