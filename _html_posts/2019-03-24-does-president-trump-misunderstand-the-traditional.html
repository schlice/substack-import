<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Does President Trump misunderstand the traditional separation between<br>a president and his Justice Department?**<br><br>Not at all, because there is no separation.<br><br>He is their boss.<br><br>The Department of Justice is an Executive Branch office who works *at<br>the pleasure of the President*.<br><br>The Constitution states in Article II Section 1, "The executive power<br>shall be vested in a President of the United States of America." The<br>power to prosecute is an executive power, given *solely* to the<br>President. Attorneys general and the Department of Justice undertakes<br>prosecutions through *delegation of the authority of the President*.<br>That means the DOJ only prosecutes people with the implied consent of<br>the President, who has delegated such authority to them.<br><br>This is also the reason why the DOJ can't indict a sitting president. It<br>is his power, and he would have to consent to its use on himself, which<br>he most certainly would not do. Therefore, looking at it<br>Constitutionally, the DOJ cannot indict him for a crime. They would have<br>to refer the matter to Congress to begin impeachment proceedings, the<br>correct Constitutional remedy.<br><br>**TL;DR: There is no separation. He is their boss. They work for him,<br>and they derive their authority directly from him.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
