As a matter of fact, they do it every day, albeit<br>in a mostly automated fashion. But if you're talking about using an<br>employer's email and phone system, they already have those records, and<br>you consented to their monitoring of your email and phone (and Internet<br>use) when you logged in. It's usually posted in a logon banner that you<br>probably absent-mindedly click through. What it would take an employer<br>to look at email and phone records is desire. They already have<br>authority.<br><br>If you're not talking about an employee, the only way to subpoena email<br>and phone records is with a subpoena. You get one of those when there is<br>an investigation. In most cases, that investigation is in conjunction<br>with a lawsuit, or when the district attorney is conducting a criminal<br>investigation. The criteria, therefore, would be either a criminal<br>investigation or a subpoena pursuant to discovery in a lawsuit.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
