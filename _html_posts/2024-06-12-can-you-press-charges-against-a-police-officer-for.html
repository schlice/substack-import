<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can't "press charges" for violating your rights, as that's not a<br>crime. Violating the law is a crime that an officer can be arrested for,<br>but that's tough to prove, and it's the District Attorney who would<br>charge an officer with a violation of law.<br><br>As far as "violating your rights" is concerned, you can hire an<br>attorney and file a lawsuit against the department alleging your rights<br>were violated. In actuality, the US Department of Justice automatically<br>investigates this in cases of police shootings, to ensure that the<br>suspect's civil rights were not violated, and if they were, they bring<br>lawsuits against the officer and the department. You can engage a civil<br>rights attorney yourself to sue the department and/or the officer for<br>violations of your civil rights.<br><br>Using "excessive force" is something which is very difficult for<br>civilians to quantify, as police arrest control techniques look very<br>painful and "excessive." Most people who believe they have an "excessive<br>force" complaint actually do not when the evidence is examined.<br>Mitigation for excessive force complaints are normally the suspect<br>resisting arrest, and the officers being required to use more force to<br>overcome that resistance. But again, if you feel you have an excessive<br>force complaint, you can engage a civil rights attorney to review your<br>case and possibly file a lawsuit against the department.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
