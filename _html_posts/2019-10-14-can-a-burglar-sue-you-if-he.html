<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can a burglar sue you if he\'s injured in your house?<br><br>The short answer is yes, but this is a very complex answer, and yes is<br>far too simplistic to be illustrative, and as with every legal question,<br>the answer is "it depends."<br><br>First of all, a property owner can always face negligence charges for<br>failing to address known hazards on his property that caused someone<br>injury. This is called "ordinary care." For example, if there's a hole<br>in my floor and I simply cover it with a rug, anyone hurting themselves<br>in that hole can claim that I did not take ordinary care to prevent<br>someone from hurting themselves on that hole. It doesn't matter what<br>their legal status is, pertaining to whether or not they were authorized<br>to be in that location. Owners are required to take ordinary care to<br>ensure that people are not injured by known hazards in their owned<br>facilities.<br><br>As I mentioned, the legal status of the person entering the location is<br>not really applicable. For example, what is a trespasser? If you have a<br>house party and I wander into an area in which I was not specifically<br>authorized to be, I am technically a trespasser. If I'm legally present<br>in your place of business and I inadvertently wander into an Employees<br>Only area in search of an employee, again I am technically trespassing.<br>Just because I'm in an area in which I was not supposed to be, is the<br>owner no longer liable if a hazard hurts me? And what about police or<br>fire personnel? They have not specifically been granted authority to<br>enter my home or business, but exigent circumstances may allow them to<br>enter without my permission. What if they get hurt? Am I liable then?<br><br>Secondly, there is a doctrine called "attractive nuisance" which puts<br>even more onus on the property owner to provide additional protection<br>for "attractive nuisances;" the most common ones are things like<br>swimming pools or backyard trampolines. The person entering those spaces<br>is clearly trespassing, but this does not alleviate the owner of the<br>responsibility to protect those areas.<br><br>So it is not at all cut and dried as to whether or not a person can<br>recover damages notwithstanding his legal permission to be in the<br>location in which he was injured. A burglar can indeed sue the owner of<br>the building he was attempting to rob if the owner was negligent in<br>addressing known hazards and not taking ordinary care that anyone<br>entering that premises might not be injured there.<br><br>Remember though, the devil is in the details, and while the burglar can<br>sue, only a competent court can determine whether or not that person can<br>collect.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
