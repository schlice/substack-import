<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>Check your Covenants, Conditions, Rules & Regulations (CCR&R) documents<br>for your HOA. All HOAs have them, and they are on file with your local<br>government if you can't find them.<br><br>Your HOA may even have a separate Architecture Review group which may<br>have its own guidelines published.<br><br>In MOST cases, *if you repaint with* ***the same color that was<br>previously approved***, this is not considered an exterior "change."<br>This is considered "standard maintenance" which you are required to do,<br>and does not require additional approval. Note that some HOAs still<br>require pre-approval, even if you are repainting with the same color.<br>Check your Rules and Regulations document to be sure.<br><br>In ALL cases, *if you are going to* ***change the color of your<br>house,* this IS considered to be an exterior "change," and your HOA<br>will need to approve your change before you make it.<br><br>And since I can't stress this point enough, **before beginning any work<br>on the exterior of your home**, check your HOA Governing Documents and<br>be sure you understand the requirements. Ask your Architecture Review<br>group or your HOA Board members if you have questions.<br><br>\<br><br>*Unless you live in my neighborhood, I am not a Director on your HOA<br>Board. I cannot give you advice about YOUR specific CCR&R documents. The<br>advice given is for GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. Be sure you<br>read through your CCR&R documents thoroughly before you make any changes<br>to your residence. Consult with your Board or with a licensed attorney<br>in your area before beginning any projects on your residence.*<br><br>*Quora users who answer legal questions are intended third-party<br>beneficiaries with certain rights under Quora's* [[*Terms of<br>Service*](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If you live in a community with a Homeowners Association (HOA), is it<br>legal to repaint your home without approval from the HOA first?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
