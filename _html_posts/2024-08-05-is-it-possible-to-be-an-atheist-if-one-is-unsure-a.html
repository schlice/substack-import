<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>An *atheist* says, "I know there is no god." An *agnostic* says,<br>"I don't know whether or not there is a god."<br><br>Agnostics come in two flavors: *ordinary* agnostics say, "We don't know<br>whether or not God exists." *Ornery* agnostics say, "We *can't* know<br>whether or not God exists.<br><br>So it sounds like this person really isn't an atheist, because an<br>atheist says that they know that there is no God. It is only the<br>agnostic who says that they don't know whether or not there is a God.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
