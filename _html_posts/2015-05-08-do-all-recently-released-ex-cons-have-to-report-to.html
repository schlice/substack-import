<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [\"Parole Officers\" monitor inmates who have been released<br>on \"parole.\" Generally, this means before the completion of the<br>person\'s prison sentence. This is also generally done because prisons<br>are overcrowded, and hardly anyone stays in prison for their full term.<br>If they are well-behaved, and the Parole Board approves, a prisoner can<br>be released to serve the remainder of his sentence on \"parole.\"\<br>\<br>Parole is basically modified prison. It\'s sort of a \"halfway house\"<br>for criminals. Criminals released on parole are under restrictions. They<br>generally cannot leave the state in which they are living. They<br>generally must completely and totally follow the law. They generally<br>can\'t use drugs or alcohol. They generally must find gainful<br>employment, they can\'t have any contact with their victim, and finally,<br>they must report in to their parole officer, generally weekly. If they<br>are found to have violated the terms of their parole release, they go<br>back in to prison to complete their sentence and serve any additional<br>time related to the reason they violated, if any.\<br>\<br>Prisoners who serve their entire term in prison walk out the front door<br>and go on with their lives, no further contact needed. It does happen,<br>but these days it is rare.\<br>\<br>The only exception that I know of is, of course, my own state, Colorado.<br>Parole is an additional punishment, after the entire sentence is served.<br>\1\\<br>\<br>There is another concept called \"mandatory supervision\" which some<br>states like Texas have. Mandatory supervision is a system wherein<br>inmates are compensated with \"good time\" which then counts towards<br>their term as time served. So an inmate can have a six year term, can<br>have served three years, and also have three years \"good time,\" after<br>which they must then be released unless the parole board says otherwise<br>in writing (usually because they are deemed a threat to society). There<br>is no parole board to meet before mandatory supervision releases kick<br>in.\<br>\<br>Hope this helps.\<br>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\<br>\1\ C.R.S. 18-1.3-401(1)(a)(V)(B)]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
