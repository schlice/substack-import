<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it easier to become a police officer now that there is so much<br>demand for them?**<br><br>The answer is no.<br><br>Yes, there is more *demand* for police officers. We have many spots<br>which need to be filled.<br><br>However, the demand for officers does not change the entrance<br>requirements.<br><br>You would think that with such great need for officers that perhaps we<br>should *lower the standards* for an officer candidate, right? I mean,<br>you'd get more people to *pass* the entrance requirements if you just<br>made it *easier* to pass.<br><br>Except, if you really stop and think about it, I don't really think<br>anyone wants that.<br><br>People already rail on about how police officers are racist and bigoted<br>and obviously didn't pass any psychological screenings when they were<br>hired.<br><br>This, of course, is simply untrue.<br><br>But why, in the same breath, do we say, "Well, we need more<br>psychological screenings before we hire police officers, but boy, we're<br>short on cops, so let's skip the whole psych screening and just let<br>anyone join."<br><br>Doesn't make much sense, does it.<br><br>So while there is a greater demand for new officers, the standards by<br>which we determine whether or not someone will be appointed to the<br>police academy do not, and should not, change.<br><br>The only way we can get more officers into the academy is to get more<br>people to apply to be police officers. The way to accomplish that is not<br>by making standards lower. Maybe a good start would be to make pay<br>higher. That would attract more applicants.<br><br>But making it easier to become an officer? No, definitely not an option.<br>And if you stop and think about it, you don't really want that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
