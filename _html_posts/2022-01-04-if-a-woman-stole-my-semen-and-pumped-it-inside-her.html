<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is yes, you are. If it is your biological child, you are<br>responsible for paying child support.<br><br>Let's take this hypothetical a step further. What if you (man) are raped<br>(by a woman) at gunpoint and she gets pregnant --- do you still have to<br>pay child support? The answer to this is also yes.<br><br>Remember that child support is not about punishing anyone --- that's<br>what criminal and/or civil charges are for. Child support falls outside<br>of the realm of the courts as it is mandated by the state in order to<br>care for the child. Child support isn't about punishing the man or<br>enriching the woman --- it's about caring for the child. The state has a<br>compelling interest in caring for the child, so they mandate that the<br>two biological entities who created the child pay for that child's<br>upbringing.<br><br>The only time this is different is if you donated sperm to a sperm bank.<br>Any children created out of that sperm are not associated with you, and<br>you do not owe child support for those children.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If a woman stole my semen and pumped it inside her and made a baby, am I<br>still liable to pay for child support?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
