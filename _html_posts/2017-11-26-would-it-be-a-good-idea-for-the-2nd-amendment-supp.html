<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Would it be a good idea for the 2nd Amendment supporters to pass a law<br>shielding manufacturers of ALL products from liability for misuse of<br>products?**<br><br>First of all, I should probably point out the logical flaws here.<br><br>- 2nd Amendment supporters (which should be everyone in America because<br>  if you're American, you should support the Constitution) don't have<br>  any special relationship with the law beyond what any other American<br>  has.<br>- 2nd Amendment supporters don't pass laws. Congress does.<br><br>That said, if there was a rash of lawsuits that was designed to drive<br>companies out of business simply by suing them, when their products<br>actually functioned as designed, then yes, we should push for a national<br>law that defines product liability lawsuit statutes more strictly. In<br>other words, the product actually must malfunction, or be used contrary<br>to its design, in order to bring a product liability lawsuit.<br><br>But that's not the case.<br><br>It's only in the firearms industry that product liability lawsuits are<br>brought when the product functions normally. The entire point of these<br>lawsuits is not to address a faulty product, but a faulty use of the<br>product, which is not the purpose of a product liability lawsuit. The<br>entire point is to drive these companies out of business by constantly<br>having to defend against product liability lawsuits. When the goal of a<br>lawsuit is to destroy a company, You're Doing It Wrongâ„¢. You don't sue a<br>company so you can destroy it. You don't file a product liability<br>lawsuit when the product performs exactly as designed.<br><br>This is why the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act was passed in<br>the first place. Guns are indeed designed to kill, and they do so<br>effectively. Therefore, suing the gun manufacturer when the gun<br>functions exactly as it was designed, is an incorrect application of a<br>product liability lawsuit.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
