<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the VAST majority of HOAs, the answer is no, because in the VAST<br>majority of HOAs, the inside of your home is not regulated. I have seen<br>SOME garages be regulated by the HOA, but usually only by saying you<br>need to park cars in your garage so it can't be full of crap. If you<br>were to make a claim that you're parking in your driveway because your<br>garage is full of cars, some of these HOAs regulating garage use in this<br>way *may* be able to look inside your garage window to confirm that your<br>garage is, indeed, full of cars, and not junk.<br><br>That said, to fully and *correctly* answer this question for any given<br>HOA, you must check the Governing Documents of that HOA to see what<br>authority the Board members have to enter property, or to look into<br>windows in the home. Whatever authority they have will be spelled out in<br>the Governing Documents.<br><br>While I can't say for certain, because I haven't read the Governing<br>Documents for every HOA and COA in the country, **I highly doubt any of<br>them would authorize Board members to enter your house without your<br>permission. Entering your *property*** outside of your house is a<br>different story, but I'm almost certain that none of them allow Board<br>members to enter your home uninvited.<br><br>IF THERE IS A REQUIREMENT AT ALL TO ENTER YOUR HOME, it will be **BY<br>APPOINTMENT and WITH ADVANCED NOTICE**. But again, I highly doubt<br>that any allow that at all.<br><br>AT BEST, in any HOA on which I have ever served, I was able to enter the<br>property (not the home) to address *emergency issues, and only<br>issues* *which impacted other homeowners,* when the homeowner was<br>not home. I did this one time, when a sprinkler line had burst and was<br>spraying water 20 feet into the air and into the neighbor's window and<br>yard. I entered the property (all on video, of course), located the<br>in-ground valve connecting the sprinkler system to the county's<br>reclaimed water delivery system, and turned it off. We then emailed the<br>video to the homeowner so that they knew why their sprinkler water was<br>turned off.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
