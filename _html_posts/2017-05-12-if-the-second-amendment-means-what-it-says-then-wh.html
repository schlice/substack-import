<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If the First Amendment means what it says, why can't I shout "Fire!" in<br>a crowded movie theater?<br><br>If a state can limit my free speech when it could significantly hurt<br>people (which the state is charged with protecting), can't they also<br>limit my gun rights when it could significantly hurt lots of people?<br><br>The short answer, clearly, is yes. Because "limiting" or "restricting"<br>the right is not legally considered "infringing" on the right as the<br>Amendment states.<br><br>The courts have found over the years that states can limit rights when<br>there is a compelling state interest to do so. They must also do so<br>in the least restrictive way possible to achieve their compelling<br>interest.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
