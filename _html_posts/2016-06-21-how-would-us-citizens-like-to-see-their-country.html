<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm sure many respondents said what I'm going to say, but this is my<br>answer, so I'm giving it.<br><br>I would like to see the following:<br><br>- Overhaul NICS to allow for full public access. Create a web portal<br>  where you can input a name and SSN and NICS spits out a YES or NO<br>  decision with a printable certificate and reference number. The portal<br>  also works the other direction: input the certificate reference number<br>  and it displays who the background check was performed against and the<br>  valid dates of the certificate (6 months is probably an appropriate<br>  timeframe).<br>- Along with this overhaul, expand NICS to allow for people suspected of<br>  terrorism to be flagged when a FFL does the check. Not summarily<br>  denied, but flagged. If a gun store did the check, the purchase would<br>  be delayed (not denied outright) and the government would be<br>  alerted that a terror suspect attempted to buy a gun. The government<br>  would have the *opportunity* to bring a case against that person. If<br>  they chose not to, the system would still default to approve after<br>  five business days. We still strongly favor retention of individual<br>  rights, and we want to ensure that the government cannot enact a *de<br>  facto* gun ban simply by failing to approve delayed purchases, so we<br>  will never change the background check to default deny. Dylan Roof's<br>  case was a mistake on behalf of the government; we do not punish the<br>  citizens when the government screws up.\<br>  \<br>  By the way, the NICS overhaul and the increased investigation<br>  requirement by FBI and BATFE into these suspected terrorists all<br>  require lots of dollars. I know how to get the government more<br>  dollars, but that's an answer to a different question.<br>- Once the NICS overhaul is complete, require that ALL transfers of<br>  firearms, through any form (sale, gift, etc) have a certificate and<br>  reference number to show that the background check was completed.<br>  Gifting a firearm requires a simple form (no bigger than a half sheet<br>  of paper) be filled out and included with the gift and the<br>  certificate. The new owner and the previous owner must retain those<br>  forms for a minimum of 10 years. Electronic retention is acceptable.<br>  For purchases, you can now expedite the process and pre-approve<br>  yourself and bring your certificate in to a gun store to show that you<br>  are valid. The gun store would check your certificate number to ensure<br>  validity and then sell you your gun.<br>- The increased funding for BATFE should cover investigations of<br>  less-than-honorable FFL gun dealers. If we give them the manpower, we<br>  must also come down on them and make sure they are revoking licenses<br>  when dealers fail to do background checks. With the new system in<br>  place, there should be no reason that a dealer fails to do a check.<br>  FFLs should know that if BATFE discovers a sale where there was no<br>  check done, they lose their license, period.<br>- Require states to issue concealed carry licenses to citizens (i.e.<br>  "shall issue" laws). Require states to follow a model similar to<br>  driver's licenses: a nominal fee (which should no longer include<br>  investigative fees, meaning the government will have to pay for<br>  investigations), a written and a practical test. Full reciprocity<br>  between all states. Police can require identification when a gun is<br>  being carried.<br>- Get rid of free-fire...er...gun-free zones. If you are licensed, you<br>  can carry your gun anywhere, except for certain government buildings<br>  (courthouses, etc).<br>- Increase penalties for carrying without a license. Harshly increase<br>  penalties for crimes committed with a gun. Do not allow charges of<br>  crimes committed with a gun to be plea-bargained away, and I'm also<br>  leaning towards mandatory minimum sentences for crimes committed with<br>  a gun. Yes, this will increase the load on the courts, but criminals<br>  will know that if they are caught committing a crime with a gun, they<br>  are going to jail, period.<br>- Legalize marijuana, and de-criminalize most other drug use charges.<br>  Retain penalties for dealing and transporting illegal drugs. Divert<br>  some of the funding for the "war on drugs" to mandatory treatment and<br>  increased psychological testing and treatment. Reducing drug<br>  prosecution should reduce crime, reducing the need to use a gun in the<br>  first place.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
