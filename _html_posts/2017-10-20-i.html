<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Depends on what state you're in.<br><br>In general, in most states, **you do not have to consent to a FST (field<br>sobriety test). Additionally, in most states, you do not have to<br>consent to a PAS (preliminary alcohol screening).** That's the handheld<br>breathalyzer that some police officers have access to at the scene. Bear<br>in mind, however, that **this may not stop the officer from arresting<br>you for DUI if there is enough evidence for him to do so.**<br><br>However, in most states, **there are consequences for refusing the<br>actual breathalyzer** at the police station once you are arrested,<br>because usually the evidentiary breath test you are given at the police<br>station is covered under *implied consent laws* when you get a driver's<br>license. In other words, you consented to evidentiary breathalyzer tests<br>when you got your license. If you refuse the breathalyzer at the police<br>station, you can automatically lose your license.<br><br>You don't have to give a blood sample, and the police cannot take one<br>without a warrant, absent exigent circumstances such as where evidence<br>may be lost because a subject is unconscious and can't consent.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
