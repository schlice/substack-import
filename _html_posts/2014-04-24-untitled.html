<br/><br/>Answer Comment<br/><br/><br/>Content: [No one was forcing the driver behind to exceed the speed<br/>limit; the police were not creating a condition in which someone would<br/>break the law when they would normally not (the very definition of<br/>entrapment). I would think entrapment would be a very difficult defense<br/>to make in such a scenario. Additionally, there are several reasons an<br/>officer can exceed the speed limit without lights and siren; this<br/>behavior of an officer is not an indication that the public is thus<br/>allowed to break the law. If the police were simultaneously speeding and<br/>covering up or obstructing the view of speed limit signs, this could<br/>potentially be considered entrapment, but no such scenario was offered.<br/>No one is affirmatively stating that the speed limit is null and void,<br/>and a reasonable person would not believe that a speeding police car is<br/>an affirmative indication of a lack of a speed limit, so entrapment by<br/>estoppel is not a defense either.\<br/>\<br/>As far as most VTLs (Vehicle and Traffic Laws) are concerned, cruisers<br/>are considered \"emergency vehicles\" and are therefore not subject to<br/>speed limits other than what the local department policy<br/>dictates.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Answer:<br/>https://www.quora.com/As-a-police-officer-if-you-were-speeding-without-your-lights-on-and-not-on-a-call-and-someone-was-driving-behind-you-at-the-same-speed-would-you-give-them-a-ticket/answer/Bob-Cooke-1<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
