<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do cell phones emit unique, intercept-able signals (when they<br>communicate with anything: wifi, cell towers, bluetooth)? Can you tell<br>one phone\'s signals apart from another\'s?**<br><br>Let\'s discuss cellular communications, since Wi-Fi and Bluetooth work<br>exactly according to their respective protocols, regardless of whether<br>it\'s a phone, a laptop, or a tablet.<br><br>For cellular radio communications, yes they do, but the equipment needed<br>to intercept it is prohibitively costly for the casual listener.<br><br>Remember when "police scanners" used to be a thing? You could listen on<br>many different channels at the same time.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-730adb30c5f055ddcb8ef740f812c52b){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-730adb30c5f055ddcb8ef740f812c52b" master_w="357"<br>master_h="443"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>But police technology improved. They went to digital trunked radio<br>systems and mobile data terminals. Listening in on those transmissions<br>today would sound like old telephone modems. You still could (assuming<br>they\'re not frequency hopping or using spread spectrum), but you need a<br>special DAC (digital to analog converter) to do it, and they are not<br>cheap.<br><br>Cell phones today are the same. They communicate using all digital<br>signals between the tower and the handset. You would need a very<br>specialized DAC setup to even get close to being able to hear anything.<br>But cell phone radios use specialized broadcast techniques to save<br>battery and improve bandwidth, and these techniques do not lend<br>themselves to easy interception.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
