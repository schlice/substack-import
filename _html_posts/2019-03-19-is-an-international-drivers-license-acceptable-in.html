<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> ***Is an international drivers license acceptable in all of the United<br>> States***<br><br>Each state has its own requirements. Some states allow a valid license<br>from a foreign government only, some states require a valid license and<br>an Internationlal Driving Permit (IDP). An IDP is really just an<br>international translation of your home country's driver's license which<br>is prepared and issued by your home country; therefore, both documents<br>are usually required. Check with the state department of motor vehicles<br>if you're a foreign national wishing to drive in the United States. In<br>order to rent a car, you may need both your license and an IDP.<br><br>However, tourists who do not have a driver's license at all may be able<br>to test and get a US driver's license which is valid during the time<br>that their visa is valid. However, not all states will issue driver's<br>licenses to tourists. For example, Florida and California will, but<br>Missouri will not.<br><br>> ***and is there a time limit before an individual must get a US<br>> license?***<br><br>Non-US residents (i.e. visitors on tourist visas) do not need to get a<br>US driver's license to drive in the US (see the above answer). Lawful<br>permanent residents (Non-US citizen residents) may be eligible to apply<br>for a driver's license in the state in which they live. If you're a<br>lawful permanent resident and you are eligible to apply for a driver's<br>license in your state, you must do so in order to lawfully drive in the<br>US. New residents in a state, regardless of their origin, generally have<br>60 to 90 days (depending on state) to get a state-issued driver's<br>license.\[1\](#KJyHF){#cite-KJyHF<br>.citation_link}\[2\](#fnuVI){#cite-fnuVI .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-KJyHF){.citation_index} [[How to Get a US Driver's License<br>Coming on a Tourist Visa -<br>Driver-Start.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=04c781&url=https://driver-start.com/blog/how-to-get-a-us-driver%25E2%2580%2599s-license-coming-on-a-tourist-visa/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="driver-start.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-fnuVI){.citation_index} [[Foreign Nationals Driving in the<br>U.S. \|<br>USAGov](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7bf947&url=https://www.usa.gov/visitors-driving){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="usa.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
