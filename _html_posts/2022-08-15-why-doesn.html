<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because he gave us free will, and he actually wants that will to be<br>free.<br><br>If he were to reveal himself, you know, come down on a massive cloud,<br>with angels singing and thunder and lightning flashing all around, and<br>he shot lightning bolts from his fingers and zapped Satan and all of his<br>minions to the wild cheers and adulation of all, who *wouldn't* believe?<br>Only the clinically insane would not believe. I mean sure, some people<br>might choose to not accept him as lord because they (wrongly) feel his<br>actions are immoral, but they would certainly not fail to believe he<br>exists.<br><br>But that's not what he wants. He doesn't want mindless followers who<br>only believe because they fear the lightning.<br><br>He wants smart followers who believe because they understand what he's<br>done, willingly, for them. And then those followers *choose,*<br>*willingly*, to accept him as lord and savior.<br><br>TL;DR: He's left us more than enough evidence in this world of his<br>existence, but he has not given us his direct presence, which would be<br>too awesome and overpowering to ignore, so as to override our free will.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why doesn\'t God just reveal Himself and remove all the doubt?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
