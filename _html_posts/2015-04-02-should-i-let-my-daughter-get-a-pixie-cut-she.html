<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [As a parent, you have to learn not to fight some<br>battles, even if they are battles you can win.\<br>\<br>One thing my parents never did (which ended up costing me at least a<br>year in therapy) is let me *make mistakes*. They were so protective of<br>me that I *never broke a single bone in my body* until I was in my late<br>30\'s.\<br>\<br>This is the time that your children should be allowed to make<br>mistakes. If she really wants something and you let her get it and it<br>turns out badly, she learns that she should not succumb to all her<br>wants, and this is a lesson that will greatly benefit her once she \...<br>er \... blossoms into a woman. Lessons that kids teach themselves tend<br>to stick better than lessons we verbally teach them.\<br>\<br>If she gets the pixie cut and it looks bad or is hard to manage, in the<br>back of your mind, you should be thinking that this is a good lesson to<br>learn, and that this is a great time in her life to learn it.\<br>\<br>And, for crying out loud, it\'s *hair*. Unless she\'s got a beauty<br>pageant coming up, let her cut it the way she wants. Let her express her<br>individuality in a safe, nurturing environment.\<br>\<br>And if worse comes to worse, it will grow out and she can try it<br>again.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
