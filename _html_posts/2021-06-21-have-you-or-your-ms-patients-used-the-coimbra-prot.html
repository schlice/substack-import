<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I was treated using a similar protocol to Dr. Coimbra's approach. I was<br>on 5000 IUs of Vitamin D for a year because my Vitamin D levels were so<br>low.<br><br>I ended up with kidney stones.<br><br>Turns out, high-dose vitamin D is [[really bad for<br>you](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=947750&url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7218089/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nih.gov"}]{.qlink_container}. From the study:<br><br>> Vitamin D intoxication might become clinically relevant in persons<br>> using very high doses (mostly \>50,000 IU/d), resulting in serum<br>> 25(OH)D concentrations â‰¥150 ng/mL (375 nmol/L). These doses and serum<br>> concentrations can lead to hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and<br>> hyperphosphatemia, which can manifest as nausea and emesis, muscle<br>> weakness, polyuria, calcification of the kidneys, and in extreme cases<br>> kidney failure. Therefore, ultra-high-dose vitamin D regimens such as<br>> the "Coimbra-protocol" in MS with suggested doses of up to 400,000<br>> IU/d pose a considerable safety hazard for patients.<br><br>I guess I was fortunate that my hypercalciuria *only* led to calcium<br>oxylate kidney stones, after which I (wisely) stopped the vitamin D<br>therapy.<br><br>This type of therapy should only be done under the strict guidance and<br>supervision of a doctor, and as of yet, there are no repeatable, proven<br>results.<br><br>We know that MS occurs with greater frequency in higher latitudes. It is<br>*presumed* that this is due to the prophylactic effect of vitamin D in<br>the development of MS. However, we also know that beyond age 15, moving<br>to a new location (i.e. with lower rates of MS, or a lower latitude)<br>won't manifest in the current generation, but in the *next* generation.<br>So the effect of increasing vitamin D in adults and its effect on MS<br>have yet to be proven, at best.<br><br>As always, take everything you read on the internet with *massive*<br>grains of salt, never make any extreme dietary changes without<br>consulting your doctor, and never ever change your medications yourself<br>without your doctor's approval.<br><br>> \<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Have you or your MS patients used the Coimbra protocol?
