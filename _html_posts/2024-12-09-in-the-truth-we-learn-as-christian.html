<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You are not alone in your misunderstanding. Many Christians seem to have<br>missed the memo on judging.<br><br>It's funny, because not just 2 John says we need to judge in order to<br>decide with whom to associate. Even Jesus, right after He talked about<br>judging in the Sermon on the Mount, went on to tell us that we needed to<br>judge! He says:<br><br>> *"Do not give dogs what is holy, and do not throw your pearls before<br>> pigs, lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack you. \--<br>> Matthew 7:6 ESV*<br>><br>> *"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but<br>> inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will recognize them by their fruits.<br>> Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? \--<br>> Matthew 7:15--16 ESV*<br><br>In both of these passages, both in revealing the Gospel to those who<br>just want to use it to tear you down, and being wary of false prophets,<br>we have to judge them in order to either beware or not cast pearls<br>before swine. How are we to discern who are the "dogs" and "pigs" and<br>"false prophets" unless we have the ability to make a judgment call on<br>doctrines and deeds? Jesus is giving us permission to tell right from<br>wrong.<br><br>In other words, apparently right after He says don't judge, He says *to*<br>judge.<br><br>When we find an apparent contradiction in the Bible, the process to fix<br>it is exactly the same. Usually, it's because we're not looking wide<br>enough. In other words, we're probably missing context.<br><br>Jesus says, in John 7:24, that we should "stop judging by mere<br>appearances, but judge correctly." Ah, so there is a *correct* way to<br>judge? Yes, there is.<br><br>Certain types of judgements are not acceptable:<br><br>> - *Superficial judgment* is wrong. Passing judgment on someone based<br>>   solely on appearances is sinful (John 7:24). It is foolish to jump<br>>   to conclusions before investigating the facts (Proverbs 18:13).<br>>   Simon the Pharisee passed judgment on a woman based on her<br>>   appearance and reputation, but he could not see that the woman had<br>>   been forgiven; Simon thus drew Jesus' rebuke for his unrighteous<br>>   judgment (Luke 7:36--50).<br>> - *Hypocritical judgment* is wrong. Jesus' command not to judge others<br>>   in Matthew 7:1 is preceded by comparisons to hypocrites (Matthew<br>>   6:2, 5, 16) and followed by a warning against hypocrisy (Matthew<br>>   7:3--5). When we point out the sin of others while we ourselves<br>>   commit the same sin, we condemn ourselves (Romans 2:1).<br>> - *Harsh, unforgiving judgment* is wrong. We are "always to be gentle<br>>   toward everyone" (Titus 3:2). It is the merciful who will be shown<br>>   mercy (Matthew 5:7), and, as Jesus warned, "In the same way you<br>>   judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it<br>>   will be measured to you" (Matthew 7:2).<br>> - *Self-righteous judgment* is wrong. We are called to humility, and<br>>   "God opposes the proud" (James 4:6). In Jesus' parable of the<br>>   Pharisee and the tax collector, the Pharisee was confident in his<br>>   own righteousness and from that proud position judged the publican;<br>>   however, God sees the heart and refused to forgive the Pharisee's<br>>   sin (Luke 18:9--14).<br>> - *Untrue judgment* is wrong. The Bible clearly forbids bearing false<br>>   witness (Proverbs 19:5). "Slander no one" (Titus 3:2).<br>><br>> Christians are often accused of "judging" or intolerance when they<br>> speak out against sin. But opposing sin is not wrong. Holding aloft<br>> the standard of righteousness naturally defines unrighteousness and<br>> draws the slings and arrows of those who choose sin over godliness.<br>> John the Baptist incurred the ire of Herodias when he spoke out<br>> against her adultery with Herod (Mark 6:18--19). She eventually<br>> silenced John, but she could not silence the truth (Isaiah<br>> 40:8).\[1\](#JonDu){#cite-JonDu .citation_link}<br><br>The context tells us that judging alone is not wrong. But *judging<br>wrongly* is indeed wrong. And speaking out against sin is also not<br>wrong. We hold Christians to that standard, and clearly, those who<br>choose sin over God won't be happy with you pointing out the speck in<br>their eye. So long as we have removed the plank from our own eye (see<br>hypocritical judgement above), we can, and indeed are commanded to,<br>point out the speck in our brother's eye.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-JonDu){.citation_index} [[What does the Bible mean when it<br>says, "Do not<br>judge"?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c11ee9&url=https://www.gotquestions.org/do-not-judge.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gotquestions.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
