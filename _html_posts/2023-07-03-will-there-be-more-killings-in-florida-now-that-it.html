<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>History and logic tells us that this will not happen.<br><br>In every other state where Constitutional Carry has been implemented,<br>killings have not increased. Remember, the people who were getting<br>permits in the first place are the people who were law-abiding already.<br>We simply now allow the law-abiding to not have to jump through the<br>hoops of getting a permit.<br><br>*At worst*, what may happen is that *accidents* may increase<br>because there are both more guns in public, and more opportunities for<br>negligent discharges to occur because of the larger density of firearms.<br><br>But this comes at the benefit of removing the financial barrier of<br>having to get a permit before being able to protect yourself with a<br>firearm. In other words, this Constitutionally-authorized protection is<br>now equally available to all people who would otherwise qualify, money<br>is no object. This means the poor are more able to carry a firearm for<br>protection; we're not adding another barrier for the poor to protect<br>themselves.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
