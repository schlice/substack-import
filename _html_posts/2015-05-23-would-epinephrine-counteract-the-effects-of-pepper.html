<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Probably not. Epinepherine is a hormone, not an<br>antihistamine. It\'s used for treating anaphylaxis, not histamines.\<br>\<br>You might consider something like Benadryl (an antihistamine) if you<br>wanted to reduce the swelling and some of the mucous production from the<br>mucous membranes. An NSAID like Motrin would also be beneficial.\<br>\<br>There are topically-applied products that can remove the oil from your<br>skin; ambulance crews carry these products to treat people sprayed with<br>pepper spray.\<br>\<br>But there isn\'t any oral or injectable medication that will completely<br>counteract pepper spray.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
