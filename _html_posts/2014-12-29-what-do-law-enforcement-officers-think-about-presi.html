<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [[[The Bureau of Justice<br>Statistics](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=71a913&url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty%3Dtp%26tid%3D71){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bjs.gov"}]{.qlink_container} shows that there are just under<br>500,000 sworn peace officers in the United States. Funding 50,000<br>cameras touches barely 10% of the officers in the US. So if he wanted<br>body cameras on every sworn officer, he would have needed to fund ten<br>times the amount of cameras he did.\<br>\<br>This is purely a token effort by the government to show that they are<br>\"doing something\" without actually doing something.\<br>\<br>It will still be up to local departments to actually fund cameras for<br>their officers, since this funding will only get cameras for 10% of<br>their officers.\<br>\<br>(ED) I think that the biggest problem departments will face is not the<br>actual cameras themselves. It is funding the infrastructure the<br>department will need to store, manage, and retrieve the video.<br>Additionally, while the funding may buy the initial round of cameras,<br>there is still a \"serviceable life\" that a camera has, plus you have<br>to account for actual wear-and-tear and breakage during normal use.<br>Until the cameras get into regular use, we won\'t know what the actual<br>service life of a camera is. It could be as high as 30% of the cameras<br>in a year needing replacement, and the funding doesn\'t take that into<br>account.\<br>\<br>Additionally, we are talking about petabytes of data that must be<br>stored. The actual amount of data that is stored is dependent on several<br>factors (how long must non-evidentiary recordings be stored, how often<br>are officers required to record their public interactions, etc). The<br>longer department policy requires cameras to be running, the more<br>storage space will be required to store the videos, and the longer<br>departments keep non-evidentiary recordings, the more space is required.<br>While most non-evidence recordings can usually be deleted after 90-180<br>days (which is what privacy advocates would like), people can bring<br>complaints against officers any time, and it would have been nice to<br>have the video of that contact that you just deleted. Most departments<br>are not opting for cloud-based storage, as the security isn\'t well<br>defined enough, so all the data will have to be stored in-house.\<br>\<br>Beyond just the data storage hardware (which is expensive enough), most<br>departments do not have dedicated Storage Admins on staff, and will have<br>to get approved and budgeted a new tech position just to handle ops data<br>storage (at \$70-\$110K per year). Dash-cam recordings are much smaller<br>and don\'t run all the time in all departments.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
