She may have been trying to make you feel better at the time.\<br>\<br>However, there isn\'t some magical \"kill switch\" in your body such<br>that when you first start mensturating, you\'ll stop growing. When you<br>stop growing, you stop growing. Your menstrual cycle has no impact on<br>whether or not you stop growing. At 11, you probably still have some<br>growing left to do before you\'re done.\<br>\<br>]<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-ded68a52e9590f1fb978484a9a525982){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-ded68a52e9590f1fb978484a9a525982" master_w="680"<br>master_h="482"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br>This is an average growth chart for females through age 20.
