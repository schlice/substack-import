<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If Trump or any President was to issue a pardon when leaving the White<br>House, and the person who they selected was a mass murderer, terrorist<br>or a sex offender against kids, and was a danger to the public, would<br>the authorities refuse?**<br><br>No. Considering that the authorities in question (the Federal Bureau of<br>Prisons) works directly for the President, it's unlikely they would<br>refuse a direct order from their boss.<br><br>The President's pardon power is absolute. It's in the Constitution. It<br>doesn't matter who he pardons, or what that person did. If he issues a<br>pardon, that person's sentence is over, and he is released from<br>incarceration *poste haste*. It doesn't matter how much of a continuing<br>danger that person is to society.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
