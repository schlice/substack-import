<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Were the sheriff\'s deputies to actually stop the bikers<br>from entering the county, they would be in violation of the 1st<br>Amendment. Freedom of assembly implies that you can freely use<br>Federally-funded roads in order to assemble, and traversal within any of<br>the states in the country is also legally protected as [[Cliff<br>G.](https://www.quora.com/profile/Cliff-G-13)]{.qlink_container}<br>mentioned.\<br>\<br>What might happen is they might get an \"escort\" to ensure their free,<br>unobstructed movements throughout the county (and surreptitiously<br>observe their behaviors; what group of fully-law-abiding citizens<br>wouldn\'t like to have a police escort?). The \"escort\" could ensure<br>that the gang (especially if it is a large one) doesn\'t impede traffic<br>and isn\'t impeded itself. The gang isn\'t unlawfully burdened by the<br>presence of the police escort. So everyone\'s happy.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
