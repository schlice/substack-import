<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Christian belief in the sanctity of life does not shape the response<br>to this request at all. The only thing that "shapes" response is the<br>letter of the law.<br><br>If a terminally ill patient requests euthanasia to end their suffering,<br>a doctor will only be permitted to assist if "medical aid in dying"<br>(what we used to call "assisted suicide") is legal.<br><br>Currently, medical aid in dying is legal in the District of Columbia and<br>ten states (California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawai'i, Maine, Montana,<br>New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. Rules vary in<br>each state, but in general the law allows providers to provide<br>prescriptions for medications when taken as directed, will painlessly<br>end the individual's life.<br><br>\<br><br>But now that we have the details out of the way, let's discuss the<br>elephant in the room. There are plenty of Christians who believe in the<br>sanctity of life who also struggle with the problem of suffering, and it<br>does not at all make you any less Christian to believe that there is<br>merit to the idea of minimizing a person's suffering. Those people are<br>no less Christian than anyone else who calls themselves Christian. You<br>can still believe in the sanctity of life and feel conflicted at these<br>edge cases, such as the terminally ill person in continuous pain who<br>just wants to die with dignity, or the mother who is brain dead but is<br>being kept alive on a ventilator so that her unborn baby in her womb has<br>the *potential* to be born at 32 weeks. These are challenging ethical<br>issues; no one ever said that they are easy.<br><br>To be fair, as Christians, we do believe that objective morality exists.<br>We believe that there are morally right and wrong answers to these<br>questions, as we believe that there is an unchanging moral standard<br>established by God. But it doesn't make us any less Christian to<br>acknowledge the suffering and to desire to minimize it because we love<br>our neighbor. Also, not every one of us Christians is a world-renowned<br>Christian philosopher who is able to do the moral math instantly in<br>their heads and always produce the "morally correct" answer.<br><br>In fact, I think that our propensity to struggle with issues like this<br>shows that we are human. It makes us far more relatable and reasonable<br>to those who support medical aid in dying than trying to twist ourselves<br>into knots to avoid giving up an inch of ground on the ethical part<br>versus the legal part.<br><br>In other words, we can simultaneously hold the view that all life is<br>sacred and it is still wrong to take that life before God decides to do<br>so, while at the same time having empathy and compassion for the person<br>involved and desire to minimize their suffering.<br><br>These horrific edge cases matter, and deserve to be discussed, but they<br>shouldn't keep Christians from working together to end medical<br>assistance in dying.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
