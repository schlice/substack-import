Treason is a specific crime which can only be committed during a<br>    time of war by giving aid and comfort to the enemy.<br>2.  The agency which addresses laws which violate the Constitution is<br>    the court, not the police or the military.<br>3.  Passing an unconstitutional law is not a crime. It may indicate a<br>    lack of ability as a legislator and may warrant that legislator not<br>    being re-elected, but passing a law which violates the Constitution<br>    is not a crime.<br>4.  Even if it was illegal, the military cannot enforce laws. They<br>    defend the country; they do not police the country.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
