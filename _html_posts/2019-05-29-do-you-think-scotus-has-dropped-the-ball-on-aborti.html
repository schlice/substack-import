<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do you think SCOTUS has dropped the ball on abortions?<br><br>Not yet, but they'll have the opportunity to do so soon.<br><br>The only case they've decided so far has been *Box v. Planned Parenthood<br>of Indiana and Kentucky*. Many people saw it as the opportunity for the<br>high court to start weighing in on the constitutionality of *Roe v.<br>Wade*. They did not. Not yet, anyway.<br><br>They essentially declined to hear an appeal on a law banning abortions<br>for specific reasons (i.e. the baby is the wrong sex, or the baby has a<br>disability). This essentially means that the court is not expressing any<br>specific view about the constitutionality of such laws.<br><br>Also, there generally needs to be a split in the lower courts over the<br>constitutionality of such laws before they will step in and decide. In<br>this case, there was no such split.<br><br>The court did uphold part of that law, the one that requires abortion<br>providers to either bury or cremate fetal remains.<br><br>So has SCOTUS dropped the ball? No, they took a hard pass. They are<br>clearly leaving the revisitation of *Roe* for another day.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
