<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is "it depends."<br><br>It depends on where you got the hair.<br><br>If the person got their hair cut and then left the hair on the floor of<br>the salon, this is legally called "abandonment" and their former<br>property (which now has no owner) can legally be acquired by anyone.<br>Normally the property is no longer wanted and ends up in the trash. But<br>if you wanted to take possession of it after it has been abandoned by<br>its former owner, it is perfectly legal. You can then go on and resell<br>that item if you choose.<br><br>If the person got their hair cut and while it was being cut they said,<br>"I want to keep all the hair you cut from me," they are not abandoning<br>the hair. They are asking to keep it. You can't take it as that would be<br>theft of property. The value would be pretty low, but it's petty theft<br>nonetheless. It would be illegal to resell the hair at that point, as<br>you would be selling stolen property.<br><br>I also don't think Donald Trump is in the market for anyone's hair.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
