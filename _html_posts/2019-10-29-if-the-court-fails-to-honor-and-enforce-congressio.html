<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If the court fails to honor and enforce Congressional subpoenas does<br>this set precedence for their own to be dishonored?**<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>And what it depends on is *why* the court fails to honor Congressional<br>subpoenas.<br><br>So *if* the court finds that a subpoena is not enforceable, you have to<br>determine the court's rationale. Does the subpoena follow the rules the<br>body itself has set out, including the body's own precedents? And if it<br>is changing that precedent, has it gone through the appropriate body<br>process to do that? Is the subpoena authorized by the charter of the<br>body requesting it? For example, can the Ways and Means committee do a<br>criminal investigation? Unlikely, since it it outside of their charter.<br><br>If the legitimacy of a subpoena is appealed to the Supreme Court, and<br>they decide to hear the case, then they will be right. Remember, SCOTUS<br>is not the last word because they're always right; SCOTUS is always<br>right because they're the last word.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
