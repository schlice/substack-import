<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We are a federation of independent states. Police enforce state law, and<br>since each state is independent, it can have its own laws. Those laws<br>are enforced by police in that state, who answer to the governor.<br><br>There is a national police force: the FBI. But they only enforce federal<br>law, not state law. Federal law is only concerned about actions which<br>are *interstate* actions (or at least, that's how it is in theory).<br>There is no "national police force" because there is no set of "national<br>laws" that applies to all states intra-state. Each state manages its<br>own laws, and has its own set of police forces to enforce state law.<br><br>As for order coming out of chaos, I think at some point, there would be<br>some form of order that would eventually take hold.<br><br>But if human history is to be any guide, it will be rule by the<br>strongest, or the most well-armed, who will rule over the weaker,<br>unarmed populace. Gangs will likely take over and will lord over their<br>territories.<br><br>That is, unless some organized, armed militia (such as the National<br>Guard) takes over so that the rule of law is maintained.<br><br>So stepping back, you must concede that at some point, if we are to have<br>order and a rule of law (which we do, rather than allowing the situation<br>to naturally devolve until some form of order is eventually reached), we<br>will have to have armed enforcement of that law. In a federation of<br>independent states, this is most appropriately accomplished at the state<br>level.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-police-in-the-US-didn't-have-guns-anymore/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
