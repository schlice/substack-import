<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with all legal answers, this one is the same: it depends.<br><br>In most cases, insurance companies cannot cancel insurance policies<br>without providing 30 days written notice. Most states require insurers<br>to give policyholders a specific period of written notification before<br>canceling a policy, regardless of the reason, including flood damage.<br><br>Each state has different rules about *how much* notice must be given<br>before a policy can be cancelled with a written notice, regardless of<br>the reason. And yes, a flood can be a factor for your insurance company<br>to not renew your policy.<br><br>Typically though, insurance companies need to provide written notice<br>before cancelling policies in the middle of the coverage term.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
