<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If we have freedom of speech in the U.S., why is bullying illegal?<br><br>Bullying is a *behavior*, not a set of words.<br><br>It's not illegal to speak the words, but if the words create a bullying<br>act, it may be illegal.<br><br>In California, bullying *behavior* has been made to violate education<br>laws. Sections 234.2 and 48900 of the Education Code were amended to add<br>*bullying acts.* The words themselves are protected, and the government<br>has not prohibited you from speaking the words. But if the words create<br>a *bullying act*, you have fallen afoul of the law. In just the same way<br>that you can say whatever you want about a person, but if it's a lie and<br>it harms them, you have *slandered* that person, and that's illegal.<br><br>Bullying is not illegal at the Federal level, but bullying behavior may<br>cross the line into *harassment*, which is a *behavior* which is illegal<br>at the Federal level.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
