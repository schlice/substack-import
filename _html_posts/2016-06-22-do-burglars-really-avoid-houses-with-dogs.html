<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I've written this on other answers regarding home security, but if you<br>can remember this story, you'll remember all you need to know about home<br>security.<br><br>Two hunters were hunting in the African bush when they stumbled on the<br>den of a few lions and lionesses. As the hungry cats started stirring<br>and preparing to capture their next meal, one of the hunters stopped,<br>reached into his bag, and produced a pair of running shoes.<br><br>The second hunter looked incredulously at him and said, "What are you<br>doing??? You can't outrun a lion!"<br><br>The first hunter said, "I don't have to outrun a lion. I only have to<br>outrun *you*."<br><br>The same applies to home security. You don't have to make your home a<br>veritable fortress. You just have to make your home *less attractive* to<br>burglars than your *neighbor*'s home.<br><br>Now, if you live out in the country and your nearest neighbor is miles<br>away, well then, you're on your own.<br><br>But if you're like most people, in a suburban setting, in a community of<br>other houses, you only need to ensure your home is less attractive to<br>burglars than other houses in your neighborhood.<br><br>Burglars, above all, don't want to be seen or heard. They want to do<br>their business and get out without being seen. This means that, for the<br>most part, they will be doing their work at one of two times:<br><br>1.  In broad daylight<br>2.  In the middle of the night<br><br>*In broad daylight? Are you out of your mind? That's when they'd be the<br>most visible!* Yeah, assuming anyone was home, which in most of<br>Suburbia is simply not true during the day. Most people are at work,<br>kids are at school, etc. And with more than one wage earner in a<br>household becoming more and more common, having most people in the home<br>gone during the day leaves your home open for intrusion, and no one<br>around to see what's going on.<br><br>The middle of the night is far more sketchy, because people are home but<br>sleeping. You have to be really stealthy to rob houses while people are<br>home, and most burglars simply aren't interested in the possibility of<br>waking someone up.<br><br>In either case, making your home less of a target is the goal. Clearing<br>away places where burglars can hide, planting pointy bushes beneath<br>windows, adding security lighting to the exterior of the home, **and<br>getting a dog are all part of the *security in layers*** methodology<br>you should be employing when looking at the security of your home. You<br>can add security systems and cameras and panic rooms as your funding<br>allows, but some of these things that you can do without a tremendous<br>cost would be:<br><br>1.  Adding a timer to your exterior lights so they come on at dusk and<br>    go off at dawn. Along with this, replacing the bulbs with<br>    high-efficiency LED or CFL bulbs will negate some of the cost<br>    associated with leaving your exterior lights on all night. In the<br>    long run, this will probably *save* you money, as these bulbs are<br>    far more cost-efficient to run than a traditional incandescent light<br>    bulb.<br>2.  Clear away big shrubs from in front of your home's windows. Any<br>    place a burglar can hide from view while he does his business is a<br>    bad thing for home security. You can also plant pointy shrubs<br>    underneath your exterior windows, making it even tougher for<br>    burglars to get in.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
