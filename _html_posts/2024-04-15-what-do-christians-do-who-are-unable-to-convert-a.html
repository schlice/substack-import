<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As a Christian, you accept the fact that conversion is not your job.<br><br>You see, in God's Conversion Department (which functions very much like<br>a sales team), there are two separate job functions. The first function<br>is the Introduction Team. That's the team that we are all on. It's our<br>job to make the initial contact and get the person interested in hearing<br>more. The second function is the Closing Team. The Closing Team is the<br>one that actually makes the sale. He has the hard job of doing the<br>actual conversion.<br><br>If you haven't realized it by now, there is only One on the Closing<br>Team: God.<br><br>It's our job to bring the person to God. It's God's job to "close the<br>deal," to keep with the analogy. God does conversions; we do not.<br><br>The Bible is pretty clear about this:<br><br>> And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within<br>> you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you<br>> a heart of flesh. --- Ezekiel 36:26 ESV<br><br>We cannot do this ourselves:<br><br>> And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked,<br>> following the course of this world, following the prince of the power<br>> of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of<br>> disobedience---among whom we all once lived in the passions of our<br>> flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by<br>> nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.<br>><br>> But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he<br>> loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive<br>> together with Christ---by grace you have been saved---and raised us up<br>> with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ<br>> Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable<br>> riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. ---<br>> Ephesians 2:1--7 ESV<br><br>You were dead in your sin. Can a dead person save themselves? Can a<br>person raise someone from the dead? Only God can do these things. Only<br>God can "make us alive together with Christ", "even when we were dead in<br>our trespasses." We have no ability to do this ourselves.<br><br>We were dead...But God saved us. The two most powerful words in the<br>Bible: But God.<br><br>\<br><br>It may also be part of God's plan that they are *not* saved. There are<br>plenty of people who had pivotal roles in God's plan who were not saved.<br>We love to hate on Judas (who, as the Bible hints to, was likely not<br>saved), but his actions were crucial to bringing God's plan to fruition.<br>If it weren't for Judas, Jesus may not have been arrested, and God's<br>plan wouldn't have been fulfilled.<br><br>In other words, everything that God does works towards our benefit<br>and for our good, including His choice of who to save, and when.<br><br>\<br><br>And that leads us to the next point: *who says that they won't be saved<br>at some point in the future?* God works in God's time, not ours. We may<br>be impatient and we may want to see them saved now, but that's not<br>how God works. All things work for our good in His time, not in ours.<br><br>\<br><br>TL;DR: Don't try to do God's job. It won't work and you'll just end<br>up frustrated. Know that it is up to God when, how, *and if*, they will<br>be saved.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
