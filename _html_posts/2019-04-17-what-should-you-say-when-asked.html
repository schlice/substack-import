<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What should I do if I\'m pulled over for speeding and the police<br>officer asks if I know why I was pulled over?**<br><br>Just say, "Gee officer, I don't know. Why do *you* think I was pulled<br>over?"<br><br>Officers these days are taught to avoid that question because they don't<br>want to be perceived as trying to trap the motorist into confessing to<br>violating traffic laws.<br><br>Instead, most officers will say something along the lines of, "I stopped<br>you today because I clocked you doing 55 in a 35 mile per hour<br>residential area. Is everything okay? Is there some reason you're in<br>such a big hurry?"<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
