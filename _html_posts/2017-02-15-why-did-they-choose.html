<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Think about the preamble:<br><br>*"We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect<br>union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the<br>common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of<br>liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this<br>Constitution for the United States of America."*<br><br>The first three words indicate who is authoring this document. It<br>indicates where the power in this new nation is vested. It doesn't say,<br>"We, the new government" and it doesn't say, "We, the executive branch."<br>It says "We, the people." "We the people" are the foundation of the new<br>country. We the people are the source of the authority vested in<br>government. Government serves "we the people," not the other way around.<br><br>It is because we the people are at the foundation of this new country<br>that they began the Constitution with "we the people."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
