<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If your HOA has rules which govern late assessments and other violations<br>and your Board failed to follow those procedures, I strongly suggest you<br>retain the services of a real estate attorney in your local area who<br>specializes in HOA law and file a countersuit against the Board for<br>failing to abide by the Governing Documents.<br><br>The Board is required by law to follow the Governing Documents. Period.<br>Any deviation from that must be for extraordinary extenuating<br>circumstances, and always in favor of the homeowner.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
