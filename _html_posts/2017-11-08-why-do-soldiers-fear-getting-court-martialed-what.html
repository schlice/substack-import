<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Court martial is just like trial in civilian courts. Some of the<br>punishments available to the judge in a court martial:<br><br>- Demotion. This is loss of rank, which equates to loss of pay. You are<br>  paid based on your rank.<br>- Confinement. That means jail, but you get sent to a lovely facility in<br>  Leavenworth, Kansas, where they still spend their days turning big<br>  rocks into little rocks. If the crime is severe enough, you can be<br>  sentenced to death.<br>- Garnishment. While you're in confinement, you're still in the<br>  military, earning a paycheck. Your wages will be garnished during that<br>  time, which means you'll be paid, but the military will keep much of<br>  your paycheck.<br>- Discharge. Once your prison sentence is over (if you got one), you can<br>  be discharged from the military. The characterizations of military<br>  discharges are<br>  - Honorable<br>  - General (under honorable conditions)<br>  - Under Other than Honorable Conditions (UOTHC)<br>  - Bad Conduct<br>  - Dishonorable<br><br>The first three are given during non-judicial proceedings (i.e. not in a<br>court-martial). The last two are given as the result of a court-martial.<br><br>Dishonorable discharges from the military are extremely rare. It's like<br>being a convicted felon from the U.S. court system. Dishonorable<br>discharges must be reported to the US legal system for inclusion in the<br>National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and you won't<br>be able to purchase a firearm again. You'll also have a difficult time<br>buying anything of value (house, car, etc), getting a loan, leasing an<br>apartment, getting a job, etc.<br><br>Interestingly, Bad Conduct Discharges (BCDs) do not have to be reported<br>into the US legal system for inclusion in NICS. This is why the Texas<br>church shooter was able to legally buy a gun: he received a BCD from the<br>military, not a dishonorable discharge. This has to do with the<br>differences between the standards of proof and the presumption of<br>innocence between the two systems (the military and civilian legal<br>systems).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
