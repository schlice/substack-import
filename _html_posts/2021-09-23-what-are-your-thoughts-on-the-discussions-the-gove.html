<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>OK, looks like I get the minority opinion today.<br><br>Let's begin with the fact that I am immunocompromised, and I got<br>vaccinated. And I still think that vaccine mandates are a terrible idea.<br><br>Look, I can see where vaccine mandates might be a good idea. I can<br>envision a world where mandates might make sense.<br><br>We are nowhere near those circumstances today.<br><br>Vaccine mandates (and their concomitant passports) are highly coercive,<br>an attempt to restrict the freedom of law-abiding citizens when they<br>don't follow the state's preferences about how they handle their own<br>bodies. They take things that were previously basic rights, like going<br>into public places and flying on airplanes, and turn them into<br>state-granted privileges when you "toe the line." They divide people<br>into those who are "good" (by toeing the state line) and those who are<br>"bad."<br><br>However, I'm old enough to remember "my body, my choice" and the<br>Constitutional decisions from which that phrase grew. Bodily autonomy,<br>as you probably already know, is a crucial right, and is one that should<br>only be restricted in the gravest of circumstances.<br><br>And if you review the numbers, the circumstances are not nearly grave<br>enough to override anyone's bodily autonomy.<br><br>If the unvaccinated placed large numbers of the vaccinated at risk,<br>those might be the grave circumstances we're speaking of. However, the<br>vaccinated are not at risk from the unvaccinated. Vaccines work,<br>according to the CDC. As their effectiveness wanes, perhaps the<br>vaccinated may be susceptible to mild disease, but the vaccine<br>continuously protects against severe COVID, even over time. So<br>literally, the only people at risk from the unvaccinated are the<br>unvaccinated.<br><br>Certainly, there is an argument to be made about people who cannot be<br>vaccinated and those under 12. And this is where we have to go back to<br>weighing the total risk against the damage caused by the deprivation of<br>rights induced by a mandate.<br><br>The risk to children is *ridiculously low*. In the US, there are about<br>74 million people under age 18. Over the last sixteen months, we have<br>had a grand total of 362 deaths from COVID in that age range. Similarly,<br>the numbers of people who can't take the vaccine, or for whom it doesn't<br>work, is exceedingly small.<br><br>Comparatively, the damage done by a deprivation of rights are great.<br>Forcing people to take the vaccine doesn't really make sense. First of<br>all, you're only influencing the small amount of people who haven't<br>taken the vaccine purely out of personal choice. It has no effect on the<br>people who are already vaccinated or are planning on being vaccinated.<br>People with religious exemptions are still not going to get vaccinated.<br>And those who distrust the government already will see this as yet<br>another reason to continue to distrust the government. So you're really<br>only targeting a very small portion of society. And do you really have a<br>greater portion of the population who would get a vaccine instead of<br>forgoing flying? I know that if people really don't want to be<br>vaccinated, they'll cancel their plans or postpone their trips. And then<br>what do we do about emergencies? If my parent is dying, are you really<br>going to prevent me from flying to their deathbed because I haven't<br>completed my shots yet?<br><br>In other words, the political backlash from such mandates will be<br>*long-lasting*. The socioeconomic toll will be huge.<br><br>It also doesn't square with science. If someone had COVID and recovered,<br>vaccines for them only carry a minimal benefit, if any at all. And<br>getting the virus and recovering confers better, longer-lasting<br>protection from future infection than the vaccine, according to [[an<br>excellent Israeli<br>study](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=43e927&url=https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262415v1){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="medrxiv.org"}]{.qlink_container}. I'd feel safer in a room<br>full of people who had COVID and recovered than being in a room full of<br>vaccinated people who never had COVID at all. Additionally, new air<br>handling procedures inside airplanes change the air in the plane more<br>frequently than ever, so it's actually safer to be inside of an airplane<br>than in any other small space.<br><br>If you want to be protected against the virus, get vaccinated. You'll be<br>safe from the vaccinated or the unvaccinated. I continue to hold the<br>position that vaccines work and they are the right *choice* for most<br>people. It certainly was for me.<br><br>But ultimately, they are a *choice*. Mandating vaccines, even to<br>travel on airplanes, is not only bad public health policy, it doesn't<br>really help us much. When you do a risk/reward comparison, I don't<br>really see that the damage done by deprivation of rights outweighs the<br>small benefit in coercing people to get vaccinated.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one. It's simply too contentious a topic,<br>and there are too many vaccine-crazy people who would flood my comments<br>with crap. I just don't have the time or the inclination to argue with<br>you.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for<br>everyone.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
