<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it possible to keep voting in my home state when I can\'t attend<br>jury duty?**<br><br>> I just got a jury summons in a State that I don't live most of the<br>> year. Despite that, I consider it my home state (my family is there, I<br>> go back several weekends a year and every holiday). I'm working most<br>> of the week in the state that I live most of the time because of an<br>> assignment from my company (it'll be another two-three years before I<br>> can move back). I have to explain my situation to the jury summons,<br>> but I don't want to lose my ability to vote in my home state? Will<br>> this affect my ability to vote?<br><br>This is a question of state residency, not a voting question. Which<br>state you can vote in is based on which state is your **state of<br>residence**, while jury duty is based on which state provides your<br>driver's license, which is a secondary function to which state is<br>your state of residence.<br><br>The voting question is the simple one. You vote in your state of<br>residence, pure and simple. If you're not going to be there during the<br>election, you contact your county clerk's office, you advise them you<br>will be out of state during the election, and they send you an *absentee<br>ballot* which will allow you to vote through the mail.<br><br>The residency question is more complicated. It's interesting, because<br>most states use the IRS' determination of state residency to determine<br>whether or not you are a resident of a state. To that end, please allow<br>me to quote from TurboTax's website about moving and state residency<br>(emphasis mine). In your case, you'll want to follow as many of the<br>bullets as you can to prove your permanent residency in your home state<br>despite spending more time in your new state simply for work:<br><br>> The truth is that it\'s often easier to become a permanent resident in<br>> your new state than it is to stop being a permanent resident in your<br>> old state. In most states, even though you are presumed to be a<br>> resident after you\'ve lived there six months, you may have to be gone<br>> from your old state for 18 months before you are considered by the<br>> time test to be a nonresident.<br>><br>> So, **it is often more important to show your intent to leave a state<br>> than it is to show your intent to become a resident in a new one.** If<br>> you end up with both states wanting to claim taxes on your income,<br>> your evidence of intent will be crucial.<br>><br>> If you intend for your move to be temporary, avoid doing the things we<br>> just listed for proving permanent resident status, and do the<br>> following instead:<br>><br>> - Vote by mail in your home state instead of changing your voter<br>>   registration to the new state.<br>> - Keep the registration for your car in your old state, but be sure to<br>>   call your insurer and find out if you need different coverage<br>>   because your car will be in the new state for a temporary period of<br>>   time.<br>> - Keep your driver\'s license from your old state up-to-date.<br>> - Live in rented property in your new state, and maintain your<br>>   household in your old state.<br>> - If you purchase a house to live in while you\'re in your new state,<br>>   don\'t apply for any special property tax exemption that you would<br>>   be entitled to if it were your primary residence. If you\'re only<br>>   there temporarily, then your primary residence is still in your old<br>>   state.<br>> - Don\'t move your family to the new state.<br>> - Open a new bank account in your new state if you need it for your<br>>   convenience, but keep your main bank accounts in your old state.<br>> - If you belong to certain social or business organizations, check<br>>   with the chapter, group or similar organizations in your new state<br>>   to see if you can have temporary visiting membership rights. The<br>>   fact that you made an inquiry about membership rights may be a<br>>   deciding factor if your residency is challenged.<br>><br>> Most important, be sure to move back to your old state when your<br>> temporary period of residence is over.<br><br>So it's less important how long you're in the new state for work. It's<br>more important *where you declare your state of residency*, and that you<br>intend for your home state to *remain* your state of residency. What's<br>most important is what you do to show that you are only *temporarily* in<br>the new state, as opposed to the old state.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.
