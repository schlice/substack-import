<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because the concession wasn't made to Democrats. The concession was made<br>to Republicans from blue states in order to gain *their* votes. Their<br>constituents wanted the concessions. so a compromise was made: allow the<br>SALT deductions *but phase them out over time*. So we get the Republican<br>votes, and we still get the phased-in elimination of SALT deductions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
