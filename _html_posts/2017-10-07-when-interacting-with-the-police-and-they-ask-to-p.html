<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The law comes from the court case *Terry v. Ohio*, in which a police<br>officer patted down the exterior of a suspect's coat for weapons.<br><br>During an aptly-named *Terry* stop, a police officer is allowed to<br>search the exterior of a person for his safety. This means he can "pat<br>down" the person on their exterior garment to check for weapons. He<br>can't reach into pockets and search them for anything at all. He can<br>only pat down the outermost garment.<br><br>You do not have to consent to this search. It makes no difference. As<br>long as the officer has reasonable suspicion to initiate a *Terry* stop,<br>the pat-down incident to the stop is legal and does not require consent.<br>You can even shout, "I DO NOT CONSENT!" at the top of your lungs while<br>they search you, and it won't make a hill of beans worth of difference.<br>They will still conduct the pat-down.<br><br>They ask the ridiculous to make you feel better. And probably because<br>it's just funny, and they are humans (despite our insistence that they<br>be perfect robots all the time).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
