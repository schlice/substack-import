<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I mistakenly parked in a stripped handicap van access area in a<br>private apartment complex to drop off a laundry in the evening (11 PM).<br>Should I challenge the ticket written by the cop if there was no \"no<br>parking\" sign on the private property?**<br><br>If you want to challenge the ticket, you'd have to claim that the<br>stripes were faded and not easily visible, or that it was raining and<br>the stripes blended in with the pavement. Basically, you'd have to claim<br>that you were unable to easily see the stripes. If this is why you were<br>there, then feel free to challenge the ticket in court.<br><br>But if you're just challenging the ticket just because it's your right<br>to challenge the ticket and not because you didn't see the stripes,<br>don't bother. Just pay the ticket, take your lumps, and don't park in<br>striped areas anymore, "even for a minute to drop off laundry." It's not<br>a space. It's like parking on a median, or on the sidewalk.<br><br>That space is left so that people who require ramps to get in and out of<br>their vehicle have space around it (where cars will not park) to do so.<br>It's not a parking space.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
