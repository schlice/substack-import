<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My neighbor has infringed, by erecting a fence, inside my residential<br>property line. What can I do, whom can I contact, to resolve this?**<br><br>You need to contact a lawyer in your area who deals with property law.<br><br>Basically, a survey will be done to determine the actual boundary lines<br>and whether or not (and how much) the neighbor's fence has encroached on<br>your property.<br><br>Your lawyer will present multiple options to the neighbor:<br><br>1.  They can purchase the land they took at fair market value and pay<br>    the legal fees to have the new property lines drawn, approved, and<br>    filed with the appropriate local jurisdiction<br>2.  They can remove the fence, at their expense, and erect it on their<br>    actual property line (depending on how close they are to the actual<br>    property line, this may not be a valid option)<br>3.  If all other means of resolving the dispute fail, you can pay to<br>    remove the portion of the fence which is on your property.<br><br>By the way, this kind of thing happens all the time. Normally, this only<br>happens when a construction project commences which has not been<br>properly surveyed before it was started. Pulling appropriate permits<br>from the regional building department where the properties are situated<br>usually addresses this issue, as the permits require inspectors to<br>ensure that land surveys have been done, property boundaries marked, and<br>construction follows the appropriate marked boundaries. Therefore, it's<br>also quite possible that the neighbor could face additional penalties if<br>he erected his fence without pulling proper permits beforehand.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
