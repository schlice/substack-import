<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Thanks for the A2A.<br><br>Litigation is usually initiated by homeowners. Very rarely does the HOA<br>initiate litigation. The only circumstance I can think of is if, instead<br>of referring a repeat violator to the fines process, they refer the<br>repeat violator to the attorney to initiate litigation to force<br>compliance with the Governing Documents. While it is less common,<br>sometimes an HOA board may choose to pursue litigation instead of fines<br>to force compliance, but usually it doesn't come to that. Normally, the<br>receipt of the first letter from the attorney spurs compliance (where<br>violation letters from the HOA did not), and it generally does so faster<br>and with less headache and expense to the HOA than the fines process.<br><br>Primarily, legal action (not related to litigation) initiated by the HOA<br>is related to paying dues and amounts to placing liens on homeowner<br>property. Similar to the instance listed above, usually the first letter<br>from the attorney advising that a lien will be placed on the property<br>spurs homeowners to begin communications and perhaps initiate a payment<br>plan to pay the back dues.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Who initiates litigation more in residential communities with an HOA,<br>the HOA board, or the homeowners?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
