<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [No. Terror events are a political designation, not an<br>enforcement designation.\<br>\<br>Certain terror events, like the Fort Hood shootings, were incorrectly<br>classified as \"workplace violence,\" or in other words, a disgruntled<br>employee going crazy, to avoid the appearance of more domestic terror<br>events.\<br>\<br>School shootings are most generally caused by persons who are mentally<br>unstable or who have some mental disease or defect. Terrorists are<br>generally of sound mind.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
