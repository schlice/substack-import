<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Has the marijuana black market in Colorado increased since the state<br>repealed its state laws prohibiting it?**<br><br>So quick point of clarification. A state can't make legal what the<br>Federal government has made illegal. What the state *can* do is change<br>the penalty within the state for violating a Federal law. Colorado<br>changed the penalty for violating Federal marijuana laws to nothing.<br>No penalty for violating the possession law.<br><br>Now, to answer the question: has the black market increased? The answer<br>is a resounding yes. The black market has gotten much better quality<br>merchandise, and they move it to market much faster as in most cases,<br>they don't fear repercussions.<br><br>*But if they got rid of possession penalties, why is there still a black<br>market?*<br><br>The state allowed cities and municipalities to enact their own laws<br>regarding how marijuana is to be sold. There are many places within the<br>state which have enacted their own laws prohibiting recreational<br>marijuana sales. Some cities have mandatory store hour limits, and the<br>state has a limit on how much you can buy in a single transaction.<br>Additionally, where it is legal to buy, there are still age<br>restrictions. Finally, we have lots of Federal land in Colorado<br>(National Parks, etc), where possession is still illegal.<br><br>So any time you have restrictions, you will have a black market which<br>defies those restrictions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
