<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Parents cannot kick children out. That's a ridiculous notion. Parents<br>are literally legally responsible for their children until they turn 18.<br>Such parents will be arrested for child abuse and their children will be<br>placed with relatives or placed into the foster system. But I can<br>understand the concern about *abuse* at home for a kid coming out.<br>However, we need to balance that concern with the data, as well as<br>the rights of parents to care for all the needs of their children. If<br>parents are the ones legally responsible for the wellbeing of children,<br>then parents must have access to all the relevant information, despite<br>the risk.<br><br>Depression is much higher amongst LGBTQ youth than it is for<br>heterosexual youth. And "those who felt greater social support from<br>parents tended to have fewer depressive symptoms, whereas those who<br>reported greater psychological control from parents had more depressive<br>symptoms," as explained by Amy McCurdy, postdoctoral scholar at The<br>University of Texas at Austin. "For youth whose parents did not know<br>their LGBTQ identities, having a combination of high psychological<br>control and high social support from parents was linked with greater<br>depressive symptoms."\[1\](#LbeZs){#cite-LbeZs .citation_link}<br><br>In other words, studies show that **support from home decreases<br>depression.**<br><br>The new law you're referring to was introduced in California in March by<br>Rep. Bill Essayli, R-Riverside, and Assemblyman James Gallagher, R-Yuba<br>City. Essayli acknowledged the risk of abuse, but said teachers are<br>mandated reporters who should report abuse.<br><br>The real pull quote that answers the question comes from Essayli<br>himself: "That can't be the default position, that we're going to keep<br>parents in the dark because they might abuse their kids,"<br>\[2\](#Ptnpu){#cite-Ptnpu .citation_link}he told The Sacramento Bee.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-LbeZs){.citation_index} [[Parental support for LGBTQ youth<br>is important, research<br>shows](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=423d6a&url=https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/980558){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="eurekalert.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-Ptnpu){.citation_index}<br>[https://www.sacbee.com/news/poli\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=13d6f5&url=https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article273086670.html%23storylink%3Dcpy){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="sacbee.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
