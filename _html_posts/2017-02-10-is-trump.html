<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>***(PLEASE NOTE: This answer is in relation to President Trump's first<br>term.)***<br><br>The Executive Order on immigration is an order in three parts:<br><br>- A 90-day suspension on immigration from seven terrorist-riddled<br>  nations<br>- A 120-day suspension on refugees<br>- An indefinite suspension on refugees from Syria<br><br>There is also another piece to the order which says that once the bans<br>are lifted, persons who are of "minority religions" in their country of<br>origin who are escaping religious persecution may get priority in their<br>refugee status.<br><br>The Constitution gives the President the power to control foreign<br>relations. The Congress gave the President the power to determine who<br>gets to come into the country, refugee, immigrant and non-immigrant, and<br>to use any characteristic or grouping to do it, be it religion,<br>nationality, country of origin, etc. This was signed into law in 1952.<br><br>However, there are a few laws which at least one part of the executive<br>order may run afoul of. The strongest argument opponents have against<br>the order:<br><br>1.  The immigration order for the seven terrorist nations may violate a<br>    1965 federal statute which says that "No person shall receive any<br>    preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance<br>    of an immigrant visa because of nationality, place of birth, or<br>    place of residence." The 1965 law tightens the controls on the<br>    issuance of visas and says that discrimination based on nationality<br>    in the issuance of visas is illegal. So clearly, the 90-day<br>    suspension on immigrant visas from seven countries violates the 1965<br>    law, and will likely be struck down. As an aside, the Obama<br>    administration's ruling regarding these same seven countries only<br>    attached if you "visited" one of those countries before attempting<br>    to immigrate, which bypassed the 1965 prohibitions.<br><br>There are some Constitutional arguments surrounding the other two<br>provisions, but they are weaker and whether or not the courts uphold<br>those suspensions is questionable:<br><br>1.  At least two states are suing on the basis of a violation of the Due<br>    Process clause of the 14th Amendment, saying that the green card<br>    holders outside of the United States did not receive their due<br>    process before being denied re-entry into the country.\<br>    \<br>    However, the court has said that immigrants who are not citizens or<br>    green card holders have due process rights, if and only if they<br>    are physically present in the United States. If you are outside of<br>    the United States, and you are not a citizen, you do not<br>    automatically have the right to re-enter the United States at any<br>    time, so this argument is a bit shaky Constitutionally. The order<br>    therefore only applied to immigrants and green card holders outside<br>    the United States. Green card holders inside the United States still<br>    had due process rights.<br>2.  The second argument says that the "minority religion" clause<br>    violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the<br>    Constitution. The argument centers around the belief that the<br>    "minority religion" clause would favor Christians over other<br>    religions. The same argument also applies because the opponents<br>    believe that this is a "Muslim ban," a view partly caused by a<br>    mischaracterization of the seven countries as "predominantly Muslim"<br>    or "mostly Muslim," which is not why the countries were chosen in<br>    the first place. Trump's own statements may play against him here,<br>    as he has said on the campaign trail that he would institute a<br>    Muslim ban until we could sort out our immigration issues, and he<br>    also told a group of Christians that he intended to prioritize<br>    Christian refugees.\<br>    \<br>    The only reason that this may not be an issue is because, while it<br>    is true that he made those statements, the Justice Department has<br>    long held that what legislators or executives say about the<br>    motivations behind a law are not controlling. The courts are only<br>    responsible for determining whether or not a law, as it is written,<br>    is constitutional. The court does not make assumptions or<br>    speculations about the motivations behind a law. If the law has an<br>    otherwise bona fide purpose, courts tend to go with that. It is true<br>    that Trump may have held that view on the campaign trail, but courts<br>    do not use words spoken on the campaign trail as material evidence<br>    to reverse laws written while president. Even if Trump held this<br>    view at the time he ordered the law written, his team could still<br>    have come back with a law that is neutral of any specific religion,<br>    and as it is currently written, it is. And it is wholly true that in<br>    a majority non-Muslim nation, Muslims could be the minority<br>    religion, and could be persecuted for their Muslim religion, and<br>    under these criteria, they may be given priority.\<br>    \<br>    And we absolutely have the right to do that. By definition, a<br>    refugee is someone who is fleeing his country of origin and cannot<br>    return because of fear of persecution on the basis of religion (as<br>    well as other factors). So determining whether or not a person is a<br>    refugee includes determining whether or not they are actually in<br>    fear of being persecuted. Someone of minority religious status in<br>    their country of origin may rightly fear persecution.<br><br>It is entirely possible that the courts could strike down the first part<br>of the order (the immigration ban from the seven terrorist nations), but<br>may still leave the refugee suspensions in place, as well as the<br>minority religion clause.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
