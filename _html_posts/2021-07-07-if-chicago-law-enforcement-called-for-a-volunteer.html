<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I am the son and grandson of a police officer. I'm a military veteran.<br>I'm a sharpshooter. I was actually in the Sheriff's academy for a few<br>months preparing to be sworn as a Reserve Deputy (until a family tragedy<br>caused me to drop out and devote the next few years to the work of<br>rebuilding). The Reserve Deputy corps is essentially the modernization<br>of the "Sheriff's posse" from 60 years ago. Walking toward the fire<br>doesn't faze me in the least.<br><br>**And there is no way on God's green earth that I would ever volunteer<br>for something like this, even if we were sworn as deputies before we<br>walked in.**<br><br>Any private gun owner (and especially those who hold concealed carry<br>permits) knows this very famous warning: "every bullet you fire has a<br>lawyer attached to it." This phrase means that as a civilian, any time<br>you discharge a firearm outside of the range, you can virtually bet on<br>the fact that a lawsuit will follow.<br><br>And volunteering to act as a "posse" means that, even if you have the<br>requisite "swearing in" as a deputy (and you may even have the badge to<br>prove it), that alone doesn't make you a qualified law enforcement<br>officer. You can bet that any action undertaken by this "posse" would<br>immediately come under some very intense scrutiny. Lawsuits would<br>abound, and it's not even guaranteed that the swearing-in authority who<br>gave you that shiny badge would be able to defend you. The state has<br>established standards for law enforcement training. **And you haven't<br>met those standards**. It's highly likely that your "authority" as a law<br>enforcement officer would be questioned, and quite possibly rejected, by<br>the very state that you were attempting to help.<br><br>Unless you attended all of the training before you began as a "posse"<br>(which today, we'd call a Reserve officer), you probably wouldn't have<br>the state backing behind your "authority." For context, the Reserves in<br>Colorado (where I have experience) would have had to attend over 300<br>hours of training on all manner of police topics such as firearms<br>training, driving training, arrest control, and a whole ton of classroom<br>hours. Incidentally, all of that training happens on nights and<br>weekends, as Reserve officers already have full time jobs.<br><br>Anyway, back to training. People have ignited entire political movements<br>citing the lack of training of our armed law enforcement officers.<br>***And your answer to that is to gather a group of half-baked civilians,<br>and give them badges and guns, and send them packing into the worst of<br>the worst territories the US has to offer???***<br><br>How does that even make *sense*?<br><br>The problem we have is not that the police are unwilling to go into<br>those "most violent areas" in Chicago.<br><br>The problem is that those police officers have commanders and civic<br>leaders in charge of them **who do not possess the political will to<br>allow them to go in there and do their jobs.**<br><br>A legally-tenuous "volunteer posse" is not the answer.<br><br>Better leaders is.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If Chicago law enforcement called for a volunteer "posse" to help them<br>secure the most violent areas there, would you step up?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
