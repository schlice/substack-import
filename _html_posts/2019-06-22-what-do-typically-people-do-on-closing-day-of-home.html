<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Cramp their hands.<br><br>Closing day means signing all of the required forms to close the sale.<br>You visit the office of the title company, where stacks of papers await<br>your signature. They have to describe each form, what it means, where<br>you need to initial, and where you need to sign. You spend a long time<br>doing this.<br><br>Unless you have agreed to some form of delayed possession (rent-back or<br>other delayed possession), once you are done, the buyer takes possession<br>of the house immediately, and you get the key and a lovely gift basket<br>from your agent. You can go to the house immediately and start moving<br>in. The seller has already vacated the house by closing day.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
