<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should people that block emergency rooms, from people who need<br>immediate treatment, be charged with murder in case of their death?**<br><br>No. Murder is not an appropriate charge. A better charge would be<br>involuntary manslaughter (or criminally negligent homicide, depending on<br>your jurisdiction). This is a crime in which someone acts recklessly or<br>negligently, and someone else dies as a result.<br><br>Intentionally blocking access to an emergency room is both reckless and<br>negligent. If someone dies because they couldn't access that emergency<br>room, the blocker could be charged with involuntary manslaughter.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
