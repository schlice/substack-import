<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, the HOA cannot arrest you. And the things that will cause you<br>trouble in an HOA are unlikely to be things that send you to jail.<br><br>At worst, your house can be foreclosed on by the HOA. I suppose if you<br>refuse to vacate your house after foreclosure, you could be arrested,<br>but the HOA is not "sending you to jail." The HOA merely foreclosed on<br>the house, and you refused to leave.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
