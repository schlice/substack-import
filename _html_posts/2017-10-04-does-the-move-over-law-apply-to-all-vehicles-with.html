<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the US, the answer is "it depends." It depends on local laws, but in<br>most states, emergency vehicles have red and/or blue lights. Yellow<br>lights are "caution" or "slow-moving" vehicles. They may also suddenly<br>stop without warning. They won't be overtaking drivers, and do not have<br>the right-of-way. Usually, you will overtake them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
