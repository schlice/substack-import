<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How might a US Space Force be formed from modern-day elements of the<br>military?**<br><br>In 2018, when President Trump signed the [[John McCain National Defense<br>Authorization<br>Act](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=48fc8b&url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5515/text){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="congress.gov"}]{.qlink_container}, it re-established<br>USSPACECOM as a Unified Combatant Command (UCC). USSPACECOM was merged<br>with USSTRATCOM when USNORTHCOM was established in 2002, because the<br>Unified Command Plan directed that there be no more than ten UCCs. When<br>NORTHCOM was established, one had to go.<br><br>Under the 2018 NDAA, USSPACECOM will be a sub-UCC under USSTRATCOM, run<br>by a 4-star, until it can become a full UCC.<br><br>I suspect that full UCC could easily be re-organized into the US Space<br>Force and assume all of the assets under it, which would suck in all<br>those component command assets. USSPACECOM consists of Air Force Space<br>Command, the largest component, headquartered at Peterson AFB in<br>Colorado, along with Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) out<br>of Redstone, and Navy Space Command out of Dahlgren.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
