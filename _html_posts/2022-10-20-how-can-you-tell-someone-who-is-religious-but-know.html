<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You wouldn't, unless their "religion" is one that actually believes in a<br>god, but the nontheist is part of that religion. In that case, you show<br>them the tenets of the faith in which they purportedly believe, and show<br>them that their religion actually does believe in the existence of a<br>god.<br><br>In other words, there are plenty of religions which are "religious" but<br>don't believe in a god. Collectively, they are called "nontheistic<br>religions." For example, Hinduism does not require strict belief in any<br>one god. Jainism believes that the universe is eternal and uncreated,<br>and therefore there is no omnipotent creator god.<br><br>So maybe the problem is that this person simply believes in the wrong<br>religion. Perhaps they need to believe in a religion which has no god.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How can you tell someone who is religious but knows that god does not<br>exist that he/she should stop being religious?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
