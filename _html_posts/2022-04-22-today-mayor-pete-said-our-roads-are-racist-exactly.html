If the road was intentionally placed<br>in order to favor one neighborhood over the other, it could mean that<br>the placement of that road was done in a racist way.<br><br>I\'m sure Mayor Pete has actual examples of road placement which he<br>believes is racist.<br><br>I don\'t think you can cure a road of its racism. I also don\'t really<br>think you can remedy the situation now that it has happened. It\'s<br>simply another example of what Mayor Pete would call "systemic racism,"<br>or racism that has been designed into the system.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
