title: '"After watching some episodes of air disasters, I have a question in terms
  of punishment towards some ground crews (mechanicals) which in some cases it is
  clearly their fault and they caused the plane to crash. Do mechanics get punished
  and if so, how bad it will be?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In addition to the other answers is the theory of<br>*corporate responsibility.* A mechanic acts as an agent of the<br>corporation, so the ultimate liability is with the corporation.\<br>\<br>The mechanic who does shoddy work will be terminated with prejudice,<br>which means it\'s a bad conduct termination and unless he lies about his<br>past, he\'ll never get another job as an aircraft mechanic.\<br>\<br>The mechanic who *intentionally* causes a part to fail will be held<br>individually criminally responsible. The mechanic who is not criminally<br>negligent but just bad at his job will be fired, and the company will be<br>held financially responsible for the accident.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
