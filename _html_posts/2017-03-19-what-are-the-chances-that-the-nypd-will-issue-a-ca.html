The chances improve depending on how many police<br>reports you have already filed regarding your death threats.<br><br>If you've not filed any reports regarding the threats, you may have a<br>more difficult time getting your permit approved, but if the threats are<br>credible, you have a much better chance of seeing your permit approved.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
