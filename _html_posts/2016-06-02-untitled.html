<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So let's re-word the question the way you think it should be read:<br><br>"Would a cop shoot a kid if they point an air soft pistol at them, the<br>cop identifies the weapon as a toy, but fires anyway?"<br><br>If that's the question, I'd answer, "Yes, if the cop wants to be guilty<br>of murder."<br><br>Generally though, what happens is that the cop DOESN'T realize it's<br>fake until it's too late.<br><br>That's the meaning of the question I addressed.<br><br>Please don't tell me I didn't address the question. Only a brain-dead<br>amoeba or a psychopath would realize the gun is fake and then decide to<br>take a life anyway. I just assumed the question was poorly worded.<br><br>If you want to address the question in the way you think the OP meant<br>it, feel free to click the Answer button and answer it in your own<br>way.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Would-cop-shoot-a-child-who-is-holding-a-toy-gun-even-if-he-is-certain-that-it-is-a-toy-Is-it-a-matter-of-policy/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
