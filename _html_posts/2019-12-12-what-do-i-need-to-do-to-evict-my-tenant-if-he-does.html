<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do you evict someone who is on your lease when they refuse to<br>vacate?**<br><br>First of all, you cannot evict someone if you don't own the property.<br><br>Second, if you agreed to a lease with someone, you can't unilaterally<br>remove them from that lease. They have as much legal right to be there<br>as you do.<br><br>You can *negotiate* with them and ask them to leave, but if they refuse,<br>and the rent continues to get paid, you can't evict them. If you<br>mutually agree, and the landlord agrees, the landlord can remove that<br>person from the remainder of the lease term.<br><br>Your best bet is to wait until the end of the lease period and then<br>vacate. Maybe they'll want to stay on, but they will have to<br>re-negotiate a new lease at that point, one which does not include you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
