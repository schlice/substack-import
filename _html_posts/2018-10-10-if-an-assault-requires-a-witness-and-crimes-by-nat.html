As in any crime, to prove "beyond a<br>reasonable doubt" that the defendant committed the specified crime, you<br>need *evidence.* Witness testimony is great evidence, but so too is<br>DNA evidence, surveillance camera footage, doctor's medical examination<br>reports, credit card receipts, electronic toll records, and many other<br>items of evidence which can show when and where a person was located<br>(and sometimes what they were doing) at any given time. All of the<br>evidence is compiled and is used to reach above that "reasonable doubt"<br>standard.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
