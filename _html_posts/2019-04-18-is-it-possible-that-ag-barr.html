<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it possible that Barr\'s earlier written statements regarding the<br>Mueller probe be construed as obstruction since the now published report<br>contradicts many of his judgements?**<br><br>Obstruction of what? Obstruction of justice is a specific process crime,<br>and usually involves three elements:<br><br>1.  There was a pending federal judicial proceeding;<br>2.  The defendant knew of the proceeding; and<br>3.  The defendant had corrupt intent to interfere with or attempted to<br>    interfere with the proceeding.<br><br>Barr found that there was not enough evidence to even start a federal<br>judicial proceeding, so obstruction simply does not apply.<br><br>If the Mueller report contradicts the DOJ's findings, then that just<br>means you have a bad AG and a poor DOJ. It doesn't mean they committed a<br>crime by failing to prosecute.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
