<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Are you asking if it\'s time for the US Government to turn<br>socialist, and break into the homes of every American and forcefully<br>disarm them, thus making them slaves to the New Amerika? You\'d have to<br>get rid of the Second, Forth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, so in<br>essence, you\'d be throwing the whole Constitution out and starting<br>over.\<br>\<br>You\'ll then abolish all \"states.\" That whole \"state\" thing was so<br>200 years ago. Who needs them? The One Government will tell you what to<br>think, how to act, and what to feel. Don\'t need pesky state governments<br>getting in the way anymore.\<br>\<br>If that\'s not your plan, then until you can repeal the Second<br>Amendment, you can\'t pass a law that would make guns illegal in<br>America.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
