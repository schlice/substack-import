All<br>uniformed law enforcement officers carry them, and will show them to you<br>on demand. Not a badge, but an ID card. Badges can be fairly easily<br>faked; ID cards, less so.<br><br>If the person is not interacting directly with you, feel free to call<br>the police and ask them if there is any activity in your area, and then<br>explain the situation. They will send the real cops to check it out.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
