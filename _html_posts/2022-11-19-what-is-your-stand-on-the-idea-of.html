<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a particular pet peeve of mine, especially when people started<br>saying things like, "I'm speaking my truth."<br><br>No, you're not.<br><br>You may be speaking *your belief about the truth*, but you are not<br>speaking "your truth" as if truth is somehow different for you than it<br>is for me.<br><br>Let's review some truths about truth:<br><br>1.  Truth is *discovered*, not *invented*. Gravity existed before the<br>    apple fell on Newton's head.<br>2.  Truth is transcultural and universal. It is true for all people for<br>    all times and in all places that 2+2=4.<br>3.  Truth is unchanging, even though our *beliefs* about truth may<br>    change. When people started believing that the earth was round<br>    instead of flat, the *truth* about the earth didn't change. Only our<br>    *belief* about the earth changed.<br>4.  Belief cannot change the truth, no matter how sincere your belief<br>    is. Even if you sincerely believe that the earth is flat, this only<br>    makes you sincerely wrong.<br>5.  The attitude of the person doesn't change the truth either. Just<br>    because someone speaks the truth with arrogance doesn't make it<br>    false, and a humble man doesn't make his error any more true.<br>6.  All truths are absolute truths. Even if I say, "I am cold today,"<br>    that is an absolute truth, because for all people in all places at<br>    all times, it is true that I am cold.<br><br>Contrary *beliefs* are possible, but contrary *truths* are not. We can<br>*believe* anything is true, but that doesn't *make* them true.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
