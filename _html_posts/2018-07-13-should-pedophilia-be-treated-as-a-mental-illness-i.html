<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Should pedophilia be treated as a mental illness instead of a crime?<br><br>I hate to break it to you, but pedophilia is not a crime. It is not<br>illegal to sexually desire a child. It is a mental disorder (called<br>pedophilic disorder) in which the patient has sexual attractions to<br>children who have not yet reached puberty.<br><br>There are crimes which pedophiles may commit. In California, such crimes<br>could be Lewd Acts with a Child, Oral Copulation with a Minor,<br>and other Child Pornography offenses, such as distributing or<br>possessing child pornography. The actual crimes vary by state, but all<br>states have one variation or another of these crimes.<br><br>You're getting the mental illness and the crime confused. Pedophilia is<br>the mental disorder which leads the patient to commit various and sundry<br>sex crimes against a child, and not a single one of those crimes is<br>called "pedophilia."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
