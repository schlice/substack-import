<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The only thing decided today was that the ban should remain in place<br>while a federal district court continues to review the legality of the<br>ban.<br><br>The government argued for a stay of that ban. The 9th Circuit did not<br>grant that stay.<br><br>"We hold that the Government has not shown a likelihood of success on<br>the merits of its appeal, nor has it shown that failure to enter a stay<br>would cause irreparable injury," the 3-judge panel stated today.<br><br>It is unknown whether or not the SCOTUS will review the issue. They<br>don't like deadlocking, so they may not even grant certiorari.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
