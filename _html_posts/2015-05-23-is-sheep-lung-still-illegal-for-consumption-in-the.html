<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [TL;DR: yes.\<br>\<br>There is, to this day, a ban on importing haggis into the US because it<br>contains sheep lung, which is banned for import, as well as being banned<br>for use in any food product for human consumption. The US has been<br>considering reversing that ruling for several years, but it has yet to<br>do so.\<br>\<br>While you can\'t *import* traditional Scottish haggis into the US, it<br>can still be *produced* in the US (and this is the product sold in<br>restaurants and in Scottish butcher shops), and is nearly identical to<br>the authentic Scottish product, with two exceptions:\<br>]<br><br>1.  The USDA does not allow sheep lung to be used in any product for<br>    human consumption, so the haggis produced in the US does not have<br>    it.<br>2.  The haggis produced in the US is not encased in a stomach, but in an<br>    artificial casing.<br><br>Other than that, the haggis produced here is identical to the authentic<br>Scottish product.\<br>\<br>McKean\'s is a company that produces \"authentic\" Scottish haggis in<br>the US (following the two rules above).
