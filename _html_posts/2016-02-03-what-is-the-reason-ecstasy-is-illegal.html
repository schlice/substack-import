<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the United States, drugs are classified on the Schedule of Controlled<br>Substances under the Controlled Substances Act. They are generally<br>classified using three categories:<br><br>1.  Accepted medical uses<br>2.  Potential for abuse, or how addictive it is<br>3.  Accepted safety standards for safe use, even under medical<br>    supervision<br><br>For drugs which have no accepted medical uses, have a high potential for<br>abuse, and have no established safety standards for their use, they are<br>classified as Schedule I. They cannot be prescribed by doctors, and they<br>cannot be legally sold. It\'s also illegal to even procure the drug in<br>order to test it to find accepted medical uses (which I never really<br>understood, but that\'s just me). The vast majority of our illegal drugs<br>fall into this category.<br><br>Depending on whether or not a drug meets any of the above standards, it<br>may be placed in a lower schedule, which might allow it to be prescribed<br>by a doctor, or be included in formulations with other drugs.<br><br>MDMA (or Ecstasy) has no accepted medical uses, has a high potential for<br>abuse, and has no accepted safety standards for safe use. Therefore, it<br>has been placed on Schedule I.<br><br>(Cue the people who believe it should be on Schedule III)<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
