<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Needed my daily dose of funny this morning.<br><br>No, the two are not related.<br><br>On its own, a gun is a lump of metal. It does not hurt anyone. It just<br>sits there quietly. It only works with human intention. It take a<br>human holding it, pointing it somewhere, and activating it by<br>consciously, intentionally pulling the trigger.<br><br>COVID-19 is a virus. It works without human intention. Once it<br>infects the body, it causes issues in that body without human intention.<br><br>And now to include the standard COVID-19 mythbusters statement:<br><br>\<br><br>*Masks do not prevent COVID-19. Even CNN said they are nothing more than<br>"facial decoration." Social distancing does not prevent COVID-19. It<br>might make it tougher to get, but you'll still get it. Vaccines don't<br>prevent COVID-19 transmission. They make it so that the vaccinated<br>person doesn't experience the worst symptoms, but you'll still get it.<br>Unvaccinated people do not cause death. Vaccinated people do not cause<br>death. There is no causal relationship between vaccination status and<br>death. There is a much tighter causal relationship between comorbidities<br>and age, and death. Not vaccination status.*<br><br>*Cue all the commenters who are going to show me the studies that masks<br>are marginally effective and infection rates are lower in vaccinated<br>people, you can all go kick rocks, the truth is the truth. Masks,<br>handwashing, vaccines, social distancing, power crystals, healing spells<br>or anything else does not actually* *prevent* *COVID infection, nor<br>does it prevent COVID transmission.*<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If guns don\'t kill people, people kill people, does it follow that<br>Covid-19 doesn\'t kill people, people kill themselves and others by not<br>wearing masks, handwashing, social distancing or getting vaccinated?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
