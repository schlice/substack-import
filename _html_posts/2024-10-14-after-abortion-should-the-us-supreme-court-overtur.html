<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*Roe v. Wade* was overturned because it was based on a flawed<br>Constitutional premise. That flawed premise was that there was an<br>inherent right to privacy written in the "emanations and penumbras"<br>Constitution. *Roe* found that there was a Constitutional right to<br>abortion because there was a right to privacy in the Constitution. The<br>Court rightly concluded that there is no actual right to privacy<br>written in the Constitution. Therefore, *Roe* was overturned because it<br>was based on a flawed premise.<br><br>*Obergefell v. Hodges* was decided based on an *actually-written*<br>Constitutional provision. It said that the 14th Amendment requires<br>states to license same-sex marriage. On that basis alone, that<br>particular ruling is not really in question.<br><br>However, the fallout from *Obergefell* opened the door to many different<br>laws, including transgender surgery on minors, bathroom and shower<br>facility challenges, and collegiate sport participation by transgender<br>individuals.<br><br>Many of these cases are gaining momentum, and *Obergefell*'s foundation<br>isn't quite as steady as some think.<br><br>Personally, I don't think the Court is ready to overturn *Obergefell,*<br>despite the fact that some of these cases may move forward. I think the<br>court will make individual exceptions, but I don't think they are<br>prepared to overturn *Obergefell*. While the claim of *Obergefell*<br>threatening religious rights is out there, I think the Court has been<br>clear that the First Amendment protects the right of religious people to<br>practice their religion, even if that means they choose to not do<br>certain business with some same-sex people on religious grounds. and the<br>Court has upheld that right.<br><br>So as long as they are willing to walk that tightrope, I see<br>*Obergefell* standing for the time being.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
