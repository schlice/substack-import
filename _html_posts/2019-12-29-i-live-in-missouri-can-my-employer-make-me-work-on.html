<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes your employer can make you work on your day off. However, if you<br>work more than 40 hours a week, you must be paid overtime. That\'s under<br>Federal law, not state law. There are some exceptions to the Federal<br>overtime law, but in general, this applies to everyone. For example,<br>some technical jobs are called *exempt* and are not covered by the<br>hourly requirements.<br><br>In Missouri, there is no minimum or maximum amount of time you can be<br>scheduled to work. Missouri follows Federal law when it comes to<br>employment and overtime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
