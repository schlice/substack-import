<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Are you allowed to break the window of a car if you see a child left<br>inside?**<br><br>No. You will likely be liable for any damages you cause to the car.<br><br>Even in California, they only passed a law in 2017 which states that you<br>can break into a car to save an animal's life, and the protections<br>only kick in when breaking into the car is a last resort and you<br>have tried everything else.<br><br>So what do you do if you find a car with an abandoned child inside?<br><br>1.  Call 911. Do what the operator tells you.<br>2.  If the car is parked in front of a business, send another bystander<br>    inside to try to locate the owner of the vehicle.<br>3.  Don't break the window unless the 911 operator tells you to do so.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
