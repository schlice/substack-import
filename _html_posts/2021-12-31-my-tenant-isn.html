I don't even recognize threats. People<br>are going to be upset that you called them out on their shit and they<br>can't put your reputation in jeopardy because they refuse to follow<br>state law.<br><br>Make sure you have your ducks in a row and file for eviction.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>My tenant isn't supposed to live in the attic I've tried to evict her<br>and she threatened me. She isn't supposed to live in an attic according<br>to Illinois state law what can I do?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
