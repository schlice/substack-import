<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**As a pro-lifer, what do you think about a rape victim that wants to<br>have an abortion?**<br><br>As a pro-lifer, it is literally the only time I would be willing to even<br>discuss the possibility of abortion, or when the life of the mother is<br>threatened by a continued pregnancy.<br><br>But we are discussing rape right now, so let's stick with that. Here are<br>a few points to consider:<br><br>1.  Yes, the rape victim (we're assuming it's a woman) is a victim here.<br>    *But so is the baby*. Does it make much logical sense to take<br>    someone else's life because you are the victim of a crime? That baby<br>    is as much of a victim as the woman. And the only thing that allows<br>    you to kill the baby is its location. Let's say (as sick and twisted<br>    as this is) that the rapist brought his 6 month old daughter with<br>    him while he raped that woman. Would it still be okay to kill that 6<br>    month old girl because a woman was raped? Of course not. So why is<br>    it okay to kill one victim because another person was a victim too?<br>2.  The reason why I will compromise my own principles in the case of<br>    rape is because first of all, I know that only about 1% of abortions<br>    are a result of rape (and not every woman who is raped chooses to<br>    abort her baby; it's around 50% of women who are impregnated during<br>    a rape who choose to terminate their pregnancies). In order to get<br>    an abortion then, a woman must report a rape. The police must<br>    investigate, and they must conclude, at the very least, that she's<br>    not lying. So this has the dual effect of correcting the<br>    under-reporting of rape, and saving lots and lots of lives. I'm<br>    willing to compromise my own principles and save 99% of babies<br>    instead of holding fast to my principles and not saving any.<br>3.  I fully understand that if we even entertain the idea of restricting<br>    elective abortions, we must massively change the adoption<br>    infrastructure in this country. We must make it *dead simple* to<br>    both give up a baby for adoption, and also for parents to adopt a<br>    baby. The amount of red tape to adopt an American baby is ludicrous.<br>    Parents know they have a better chance to actually adopt a baby if<br>    they go overseas to do so, to China or Russia or the Philippines.<br>    This must end. However, we still must ensure that we are not<br>    allowing people to merely adopt children so that they can benefit<br>    from tax breaks and other federal assistance. I want adoption to be<br>    safe and easy, and not become a cash cow to unscrupulous foster<br>    parents. We absolutely can do both, and we can do it much faster<br>    than we do now. It will take great efforts on the part of the<br>    federal government, and a whole lot of cash, and we are currently<br>    short on both of those today. Thanks, COVID.<br><br>\<br><br>*This is an emotionally-charged topic, so please, heed this warning<br>before you comment:*<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being<br>isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I<br>wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is<br>un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m<br>wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,<br>not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,<br>you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.<br>Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be<br>followed by a block and a mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this<br>immediately and with no compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
