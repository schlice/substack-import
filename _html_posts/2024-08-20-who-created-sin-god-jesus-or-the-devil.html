<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I guess it's up to me to give you the real answer today...<br><br>Sin isn't a created thing, so no one "created" sin. Sin is an act of<br>disobedience. It's an action, not a thing. It's literally "missing the<br>mark."<br><br>God created humans with the *capacity* to sin, which we call "free<br>will." Humans can use that free will to either follow Him or reject Him,<br>and that disobedience is what we call "sin." He sets the rules, we break<br>the rules. That's sin.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
