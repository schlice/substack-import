A nose-high stall does not meet this criteria,<br>because for at least a part of it, it is uncontrolled. Granted, you<br>regain control pretty quickly once you start getting airflow over the<br>wings again, but it begins with an altitude-gaining maneuver before<br>airflow over the wings ceases, and that's like going south to go north.<br><br>if the point is a fast, controlled descent, your best bet is a<br>simultaneous *reduction* of throttle and forward pressure on the control<br>yoke.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
