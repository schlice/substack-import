<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It looks like they gave you what you were asking for: an<br>accounting of the debt they believe you owe. From here depends on a few<br>factors:\<br>]<br><br>1.  Did you ever have an account with them? If you never had an account<br>    with them, that is the basis for your reply.\<br>2.  Assuming you had an account with them, did you actually accrue the<br>    charges listed on their photocopy? If you didn\'t actually accrue<br>    the charges, then you are contesting their accounting of your<br>    service.\<br>3.  Assuming you did accrue the charges they showed you, did you pay the<br>    charges? If you did, you should be easily able to show them dates<br>    and amounts of your remissions.<br><br>I\'d probably show them whatever proof I had and then tell them to cease<br>and desist with further attempts to collect from you unless they choose<br>to pursue the matter in court.\<br>\<br>If they continue to attempt to collect after you have provided your<br>proof, you will have to fight them in court, and add harassment to the<br>list of charges. At this point, a lawyer\'s assistance will be needed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
