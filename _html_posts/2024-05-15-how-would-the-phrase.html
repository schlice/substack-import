<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>An excellent question. A bit of a loaded question, but still an<br>excellent one. Why is it loaded? Because anyone can go to Google<br>Translate and translate "the word was a god" from English to Greek and<br>then delete the "a" and see what happens. The reason the question is<br>being asked at all is more about Christ's deity than about a Greek<br>translation.<br><br>Allow me to explain. There are no indefinite articles in Greek. The<br>articles "a" or "an" do not exist in Greek. Therefore, John 1:1 would<br>look exactly the same if it was translated as "the Word was a God" or<br>"the Word was God." The indefinite articles are *added* by<br>translators when translating from Greek to English. However, the<br>addition of the indefinite article "a" makes a *massive* difference:<br>one says that Jesus was a created being, and the other says that Jesus<br>is God. There are no other choices.<br><br>This leads us to the \$64,000 question (yes, I did just date myself):<br>*which translation is correct?*<br><br>So since there are no indefinite articles in Greek, you have to<br>determine the correct understanding of the sentence from context.<br>Let's do that then.<br><br>There's lots of scholarly work discussing why John 1:1 is translated as<br>"The Word was God," but in order to discuss those intelligently, one<br>would have to possess a mastery of Koine Greek, which I do not.<br>Therefore, let's discuss what we do know which is not related to Greek<br>translation.<br><br>The easiest and most compelling statement is John 1:3.<br><br>> All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing<br>> made that was made. (ESV)<br><br>This verse is crucial to interpreting John 1:1, because it says very<br>clearly that if it had a beginning at all, Jesus made it. Therefore, can<br>Jesus be a created being? No, because He would have to exist before He<br>existed. If everything that was created was created through Him,<br>then He must have existed before everything which was created. If that's<br>true, then Jesus was not created; He must be eternal. And if Jesus is<br>eternal, then Jesus is God. There is literally no other option. Either<br>Jesus is a created being, or Jesus is God.<br><br>John 1:1, read in the context of John 1:3, is therefore properly<br>translated as "the Word was God."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
