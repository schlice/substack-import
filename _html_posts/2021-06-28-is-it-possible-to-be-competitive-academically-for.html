<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(NOTE: My answer is specific to the Air Force Academy, but because<br>these programs are governed under Federal law, the answer will be<br>similar for any of the US service academies)*<br><br>Yes, it is possible to be *very* competitive academically with a 3.5 GPA<br>from a foreign high school and a 4.0 from a US online high school, and<br>good SAT scores.<br><br>The problem will likely be that you are not an American citizen, and you<br>must be an American citizen in order to be accepted at the Air Force<br>Academy. We do host foreign exchange cadets at USAFA, but International<br>students cannot apply directly to the Air Force Academy. They must apply<br>through their government, usually their ministry of defense. Only a<br>select number of countries can nominate students. The home country may<br>also require a commitment to serve in the home country's military.<br>Students should check with their home country's government for more<br>information on the country's eligibility to nominate and the country's<br>nomination procedures. Additionally, Federal law only allows us to have<br>60 foreign cadets at any one time, which means we only allow 15 cadets<br>per class year to attend USAFA, so the slots for international students<br>are extremely limited.<br><br>If you are a US citizen studying abroad with your parents, your entrance<br>requirements are the same as any stateside candidate. You already have<br>the high academic scores, but it will be the other things the Admissions<br>Board will be looking for, namely athletics and leadership potential.<br>Visit the [[Academy<br>Admissions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=60e33c&url=https://www.academyadmissions.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} website for more<br>information on everything you need to do in order to be competitive, and<br>to meet the requirements for entrance.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it possible to be competitive academically for a service academy with<br>a 3.5 GPA from a foreign high school transcript but 4.0 at an American<br>online high school, with a very high SAT score?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
