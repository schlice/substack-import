<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is a different reason for this. There has to be; why would you<br>stop a program which is, arguably, the most successful government<br>program ever?<br><br>Groups like Black Lives Matter and the attitudes they spawn have made<br>the job of the police officer all the more difficult. Heather MacDonald<br>said about the new phenomenon:<br><br>"Police operating in inner-city neighborhoods now find themselves<br>routinely surrounded by cursing, jeering crowds when they make a<br>pedestrian stop or try to arrest a suspect. Sometimes bottles and rocks<br>are thrown. Bystanders stick cell phones in the officers' faces, daring<br>them to proceed with their duties. Officers are worried about becoming<br>the next racist cop of the week and possibly losing their livelihood<br>thanks to an incomplete cell phone video that inevitably fails to show<br>the antecedents to their use of force. Officer use of force is never<br>pretty, but the public is clueless about how hard it is to subdue a<br>suspect who is determined to resist arrest.<br><br>"As a result of the anti-cop campaign of the last two years and the<br>resulting push-back in the streets, officers in urban areas are cutting<br>back on precisely the kind of policing that led to the crime decline of<br>the 1990s and 2000s. Arrests and summons are down, particularly for<br>low-level offenses. Police officers continue to rush to 911 calls when<br>there is already a victim. But when it comes to making discretionary<br>stops---such as getting out of their cars and questioning people hanging<br>out on drug corners at 1:00 a.m.---many cops worry that doing so could<br>put their careers on the line. Police officers are, after all, human.<br>When they are repeatedly called racist for stopping and questioning<br>suspicious individuals in high-crime areas, they will perform less of<br>those stops. That is not only understandable---in a sense, it is how<br>things *should* work. Policing is political. If a powerful political<br>bloc has denied the legitimacy of assertive policing, we will get less<br>of it."<br><br>So DeBlasio is scaling back proactive, data-driven policing, because<br>the public is demanding it. A powerful political bloc (blacks) has<br>demanded that assertive policing cease, and so DeBlasio complied. Right<br>or wrong, it's what they are demanding, and so the police oblige.<br><br>MacDonald continues:<br><br>"Unfortunately, when officers back off in high crime neighborhoods,<br>crime shoots through the roof. Our country is in the midst of the first<br>sustained violent crime spike in two decades. Murders rose nearly 17<br>percent in the nation's 50 largest cities in 2015, and it was in cities<br>with large black populations where the violence increased the most.<br>Baltimore's per capita homicide rate last year was the highest in its<br>history. Milwaukee had its deadliest year in a decade, with a 72 percent<br>increase in homicides. Homicides in Cleveland increased 90 percent over<br>the previous year. Murders rose 83 percent in Nashville, 54 percent in<br>Washington, D.C., and 61 percent in Minneapolis. In Chicago, where<br>pedestrian stops are down by 90 percent, shootings were up 80 percent<br>through March 2016."<br><br>The fact of the matter is: Compstat worked. While still in use, scaling<br>back Compstat enforcement causes crime to spike. One final though from<br>MacDonald:<br><br>"In New York City, businesses that had shunned previously drug-infested<br>areas now set up shop there, offering residents a choice in shopping and<br>creating a demand for workers. Senior citizens felt safe to go to the<br>store or to the post office to pick up their Social Security checks.<br>Children could ride their bikes on city sidewalks without their mothers<br>worrying that they would be shot. But the crime victories of the last<br>two decades, and the moral support on which law and order depends, are<br>now in jeopardy thanks to the falsehoods of the Black Lives Matter<br>movement."<br><br>We have to find a way to reverse this trend. The only way to stop it is<br>a top-down attitude adjustment. Seeing BLM for exactly what it is, a<br>hate group, will most definitely chill their actions. We shall see how<br>the new administration responds.<br><br>[[The Danger of the "Black Lives Matter"<br>Movement](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3fecc7&url=https://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/the-danger-of-the-black-lives-matter-movement){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="hillsdale.edu"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-broken-windows-theory-apply-to-urban-crime-And-how-does-the-land-use-theory-apply-to-rural-suburban-crime/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
