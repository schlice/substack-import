<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yep.<br><br>Did you know that in baseball, the team which gets the most hits is not<br>the team that wins? That's because *hits* is not what is counted for<br>winning the game. It's the number of players who end up safe at home<br>plate.<br><br>Did you know that in hockey, the team with the most O-Zone time is not<br>the team that wins? That's because O Zone time is not what is counted<br>for winning the game. It's the number of times the puck completely<br>crosses the goal line that is countred.<br><br>See where I'm going with this?<br><br>It's not the popular vote that is counted. If that were the case, the<br>Presidential election would be nothing more than a popularity contest<br>rather than picking the best leader for the country. Presidents would<br>campaign only in the states with the largest populations, and most of<br>the country would be summarily ignored.<br><br>The founders wanted *all* of the country to be represented, and<br>population is only one part of that. Is it fair that states with smaller<br>populations would be underrepresented if we had a popular vote system?<br>The founders didn't think so.<br><br>So they devised a system whereby the size of the state has a role in<br>deciding how much influence the state has, along with its population.<br>The system they devised assigns a certain number of *electoral votes* to<br>a state based on both its population, and its size. Thus, large<br>states with small populations have a somewhat equal representation with<br>small states and large populations.<br><br>It's the same system which is used to determine how many representatives<br>a state gets in Congress. The House of Representatives uses the same<br>formula to determine how many Representatives represent that state.<br>Thus, the House is the representative of the *people.*<br><br>The Senate, on the other hand, treats all states as sovereign equals,<br>and all states send two Senators to Congress. The Senate, therefore, is<br>the representative of the *state*.<br><br>In this way, the *state* and the *people* are equally represented.¹<br><br>Similarly, for Presidential elections, the number of electoral votes<br>given to a state equals the number of Representatives plus the number of<br>Senators.<br><br>But to appease the likes of you, who want to be able to popularly vote<br>for President², states went to a "winner takes all" system whereby the<br>winner of the state's popular election gets all of the state's electoral<br>votes.<br><br>So you do have a popular election for President, but it's confined to<br>each state.<br><br>And that brings up the final point: there is no "national" election.<br>There are 51 separate popular elections for President. Each state holds<br>its own election and divvies up its electoral votes as it sees fit. This<br>is why we have a few states which divide their electoral votes, but we<br>have most states use the "winner take all" method.<br><br>\<br><br>¹ This system, though, was basically removed by the 17th Amendment in<br>1913, when Senators were converted to direct popular election, rather<br>than being appointed by the state. Why did this happen?From the Senate<br>website:<br><br>> Following the Civil War, disputes among state legislators over Senate<br>> elections resulted in numerous deadlocks, leaving some Senate seats<br>> vacant for long periods of time. The Delaware legislature reached a<br>> stalemate in 1895, taking 217 ballots over a period of 114 days.<br>> Delaware remained without representation in the U.S. Senate for two<br>> years. In light of such problems, reformers in many states began<br>> calling for a change to the system of electing senators. In Oregon,<br>> for example, a number of measures were enacted in the early 20th<br>> century allowing voters to express their choice for senator. Other<br>> states followed this "Oregon Plan" and instituted their own version of<br>> election reform.<br>><br>> A turning point came in 1906, when publisher William Randolph Hearst,<br>> a proponent of direct election, hired novelist David Graham Phillips<br>> to write a number of articles on the subject. Published in<br>> Cosmopolitan magazine in 1906, Phillips' series, "The Treason of the<br>> Senate," offered an unsympathetic (and largely fictionalized) account<br>> of senators as pawns of industrialists and financiers. The articles<br>> further galvanized public support for<br>> reform.\[1\](#nEPaL){#cite-nEPaL .citation_link}<br><br>This change to the Constitution weakened the power of the state by<br>removing the balance between the voice of the people and the voice of<br>the state. We essentially have "two Houses of Representatives" with<br>unclear terms but similar missions.<br><br>² "Winner take all" wasn't just to have popular elections for President.<br>States wanted their elections to hold more weight versus other states,<br>so they started awarding all of the electoral votes to the one candidate<br>who won the popular vote in their state. But in order to not water down<br>the vote of their own state, other states quickly joined in, and today,<br>48 states use a winner-takes-all method to award their electoral votes.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-nEPaL){.citation_index} [[Landmark Legislation: The<br>Seventeenth Amendment to the<br>Constitution](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9b2a55&url=https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/senate-and-constitution/seventeenth-amendment.htm){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="senate.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
