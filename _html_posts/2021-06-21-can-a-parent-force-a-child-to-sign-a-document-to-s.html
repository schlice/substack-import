<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sure! A parent can also force a child to sign a document which shows<br>that the Tooth Fairy is real and that the Moon is made of Swiss cheese.<br><br>They all have exactly the same weight.<br><br>In other words, parents are responsible for children. Parents transfer<br>students, whether they want to go or not.<br><br>Sounds like the document may be something that the parent is using to<br>have in their back pocket to show the child at some point down the road<br>that they agreed to this transfer.<br><br>It's "parental leverage." It has no other meaning other than that.<br><br>If it was coerced when you signed it, it will still be coerced when they<br>try to use it against you in the future.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can a parent force a child to sign a document to show they agree to<br>transfer to a school against their will?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
