<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>An interesting question.<br><br>The Machiavellian quip of "the end justifies the means" implies that<br>"the end" is a moral good, but "the means" is not. Therefore, according<br>to Machiavelli, because "the end" is good, "the means" to achieve the<br>good end *become* good, whatever they are.<br><br>Sin does not work this way. Even if the end is good, sin is never<br>justified. The person who steals bread to feed his family is still<br>stealing, and it is still sinful.<br><br>But because this question is being asked, then "the flood" and "Jesus'<br>crucifixion" must obviously *appear* sinful. So we'll have to review<br>both of them to determine if they were.<br><br>First, while God is omnipotent, there are a few things that God cannot<br>do. For example, God cannot violate His own nature. Since sin is<br>"missing the mark," and the mark is God, God cannot sin. So if God does<br>something or ordains something, it is *de facto* not sinful.<br><br>Therefore, since God caused the Flood and He ordained Jesus' death and<br>resurrection, those things must not be sinful.<br><br>Therefore, the question becomes, "How are the flood and the crucifixion<br>not sinful?"<br><br>Let's begin with The Flood. It does have the appearance of being sinful.<br>So many "innocent" people were killed in the Flood, right? Didn't they<br>deserve to not die?<br><br>First, nowhere in the Bible does it say that the people who died in the<br>Flood were "innocent." Everyone is a sinner. Everyone deserves death<br>when compared to God's goodness. God is completely within His rights to<br>destroy each and every one of us. It is only His grace which prevents<br>Him from doing so.<br><br>Second, God already judged the whole world and found it lacking:<br><br>> *The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and<br>> that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil<br>> continually. \-- Genesis 6:5 ESV*<br><br>Therefore, killing everyone was justified because God already judged<br>them.<br><br>Now let's look at the crucifixion. Certainly, Jesus was sinless. He was<br>not judged by God as being evil; He did not deserve death. How could His<br>crucifixion be anything but sinful?<br><br>Jesus' death was a sacrifice. A sacrifice is specifically an<br>offering made to a deity. In this case, Jesus Himself was the sacrifice.<br>He offered Himself *because* He was sinless. He offered to take on<br>the sin of the world in order to be a propitiation for us.<br><br>Perhaps if Jesus was unwilling, His death would have been sinful. But in<br>this case, Jesus Himself was offered as a sacrifice for our sins, and<br>God saw it as good.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
