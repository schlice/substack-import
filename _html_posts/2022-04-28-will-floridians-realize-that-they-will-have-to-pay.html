<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So I'm guessing you didn't read the legislation that Florida actually<br>passed.<br><br>Here's what they passed:<br><br><br><pre class="linenums codehilite"><code class="language-prettyprint">                        A bill to be entitled                      <br>         An act relating to independent special districts;<br>         amending s. 189.0311, F.S.; dissolving certain<br>         independent special districts; authorizing the<br>         reestablishment of certain independent special<br>         districts; providing an effective date.<br><br>Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida:<br><br>       Section 1. Section 189.0311, Florida Statutes, is amended<br>to read:<br>       189.0311 Independent special districts; charter<br>requirements.—<br>       (1) Notwithstanding any general law, special act, or<br>ordinance of a local government to the contrary, any independent<br>special district charter enacted after September 30, 1989, shall<br>contain the information required by s. 189.031(3). Recognizing<br>that the exclusive charter for a community development district<br>is the statutory charter contained in ss. 190.006-190.041,<br>community development districts established after July 1, 1980,<br>pursuant to the provisions of chapter 190 shall be deemed in<br>compliance with this requirement.<br>       (2) Notwithstanding s. 189.072(2), any independent special<br>district established by a special act prior to the date of<br>ratification of the Florida Constitution on November 5, 1968,<br>and which was not reestablished, re-ratified, or otherwise<br>reconstituted by a special act or general law after November 5,<br>1968, is dissolved effective June 1, 2023. An independent<br>special district affected by this subsection may be<br>reestablished on or after June 1, 2023, pursuant to the<br>requirements and limitations of this chapter.<br>       Section 2. This act shall take effect July 1, 2022.<br></code></pre><br><br><br><br>So a few observations:<br><br>1.  The special districts in question (one of which is Reedy Creek) will<br>    be dissolved effective June 1, 2023. So a little over a year from<br>    now.<br>2.  Notice what it says right after that: **An independent special<br>    district affected by this subsection may be reestablished on or<br>    after June 1, 2023, pursuant to the requirements and limitations of<br>    this chapter.**<br><br>Therefore, what the law specifically says is that "you have a year to<br>fix your special district, and the new version will take effect<br>immediately following the dissolution of the old one."<br><br>And even if Disney doesn't work with Florida to re-establish RCID,<br>Orange and Osceola counties will do it without them.<br><br>So one way or another, Disney's special district will remain.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Will Floridians realize that they will have to pay more taxes as a<br>result of DeSantis' childish feud with Disney? Will it impact who they<br>vote for?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
