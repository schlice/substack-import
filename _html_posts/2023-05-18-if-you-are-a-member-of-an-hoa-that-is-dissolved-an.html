<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is "it depends."<br><br>However, if you signed a document indicating that the old HOA is<br>dissolving, the HOA is gone. You are no longer under an HOA. You would<br>have to sign a new document to form a new HOA.<br><br>An HOA is a legal entity. You can only create a mandatory HOA with 100%<br>of the homeowners agreeing to it. It is done by the developer because<br>they own 100% of the properties, so it makes it easy for them to do it.<br>But trying to create a new mandatory HOA would require 100% of the<br>homeowners to agree to it, or it's not mandatory.<br><br>The benefit of a "new" HOA after the old one dissolves is that you have<br>to agree to form it. If you do not, the HOA cannot be mandatory but<br>voluntary. You join if you want, you leave when you want.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
