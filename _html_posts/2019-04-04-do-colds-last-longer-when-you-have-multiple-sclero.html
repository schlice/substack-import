<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do colds last longer when you have multiple sclerosis?<br><br>No, there is no mechanism in the disease that makes you get sicker or<br>stay sicker for longer.<br><br>However, many of the medications for MS are *immunosuppressants*, which<br>mean they depress your immune system. If you're on one of these<br>medicines, you will get colds easier, and it will take you longer to get<br>over them if you do catch one.<br><br>So while MS itself does not make colds last longer, some of the<br>medications you may take for MS may make a cold last longer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
