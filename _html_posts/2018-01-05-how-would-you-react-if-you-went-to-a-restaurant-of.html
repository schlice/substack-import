<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How would you react if you went to a restaurant of a nationality<br>different from yours and after you\'ve sat down, the manager says to you<br>\"sorry, but we do not wish to serve you in our restaurant.\"?**<br><br>1.  I would leave.<br>2.  I would write a *scathing* review on Yelp. One of those "I'd<br>    give it 0 stars if I could" reviews.<br>3.  I'd call my local news agency's "Call For Action" line and give them<br>    the scoop of the week.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
