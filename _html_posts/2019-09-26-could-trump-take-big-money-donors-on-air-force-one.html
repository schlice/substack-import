The RNC can certainly<br>pick up that tab if they choose, but that fare will not be paid for by<br>taxpayers.<br><br>He can't just put the plane in the air, circle it around for a while and<br>then land it. That would be a waste of money and wouldn't be tolerated<br>by internal or external watchdog groups.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
