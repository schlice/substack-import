<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> ***I have spent 7 years with multiple sclerosis and I am all OK. Can I<br>> expect the rest of my life to be the same?***<br>><br>> *I am having MS since March 2010 and today I complete 7 years. Till<br>> now I have gone through 3 episodes, but currently I do not have any<br>> physical or mental problem with grace of God. Can I expect my rest of<br>> the life would go smoothly?*<br><br>You didn't indicate whether or not you are on a disease-modifying drug<br>(DMD), but you did indicate that you have regular disease activity<br>(three relapses in seven years would likely be considered regular<br>disease activity). I would assume that with this rate of relapse, you<br>have relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and are not using one of the DMDs we<br>have available.<br><br>On average, for people who are not using a disease modifying drug, it<br>takes 10 years for RRMS to progress to secondary-progressive MS (SPMS).<br><br>So can I expect the rest of your life to go smoothly? Based on<br>statistics and averages for people not on a DMD, I would have to say<br>no. If you are not taking a DMD, I would say you're likely just a<br>few years away from having a relapse that doesn't go away.<br><br>If you're not taking a DMD, you need to start. Basically, all of the<br>DMDs do the same thing:<br><br>- slow the rate of relapses<br>- reduce the severity of relapses<br>- extend the amount of time between relapses<br><br>Basically, the DMDs slow the progression of the disease. Nothing can<br>completely stop the progression of the disease, but even when you are<br>"all OK," the disease silently progresses in the background. It is<br>fallacy to think that because you are currently symptom-free that your<br>MS is not silently progressing.<br><br>Perhaps it's time to talk to a neurologist about getting on a DMD. If<br>you're on one and you've had three relapses in seven years, you should<br>probably think about getting on a new one because this one has only had<br>questionable efficacy.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
