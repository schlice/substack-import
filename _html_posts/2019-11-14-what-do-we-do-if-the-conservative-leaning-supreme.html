Work within your state to pass solid abortion<br>protection measures. Maybe work to amend your state Constitution to<br>explicitly allow abortion on demand from conception to birth.<br><br>Heck, maybe you even work to pass an Amendment to the Constitution that<br>grants women the right to abortion, or grants all Americans the right to<br>privacy which would then make the previous SCOTUS reasoning valid.
