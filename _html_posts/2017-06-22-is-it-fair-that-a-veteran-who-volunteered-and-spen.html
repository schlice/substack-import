<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I didn't have a choice in my non-combat role. I wanted to be a pilot.<br>But thanks to Desert Storm (and its subsequent drawdown), my class of<br>over 1000 pilot-qualified cadets was given...ready?....225 pilot slots.<br>So literally less than 1/4 of the pilot qualified cadets were going to<br>go into pilot slots, and the rest of us would be sorted into career<br>fields based on the needs of the Air Force. Sure, we had our dream<br>sheets, but those weren't guaranteed. I didn't get *any* of the choices<br>on my dream sheet, and I put in for a few combat-forward positions.<br><br>I was given a career field where the Air Force needed me. So that's<br>where I went.<br><br>And I learned everything about it, and I served with distinction. And I<br>served with honor. And I served to the best of my ability.<br><br>You see, the military isn't just about shooting bad guys. Of course<br>there's that, but it takes *a lot* to support the warfighter.<br><br>Also, we are military members *first*, and career fields *second*.<br><br>Finally, I need to take personal exception to one statement in your<br>question:<br><br>> *Is it fair that a veteran who volunteered and spent all his or her<br>> time in a non-combatant role get all the* *adoration* *and<br>> benefits of combat soldiers?*<br><br>*Adoration*? Are you kidding me? You mean, like girls are *fawning all<br>over me* because I was in the military??? Please tell me where this<br>happens so I can see it for myself.<br><br>Adoration. Sheesh. Nobody gives a *rat's ass* that I was in the<br>military. Well, nowadays, I have seen a return to at least *some*<br>gratitude for military members. When they ask me about my Academy ring<br>and I tell them that I'm a disabled veteran, they usually say "thank you<br>for your service" or some similar platitude, and most mean it.<br><br>Oh, there's another good point. I wasn't wounded in combat, but I'm<br>still a disabled veteran. I am permanently disabled due to my military<br>service. Should I be simply discarded because I wasn't disabled *in<br>combat*?<br><br>No one owes me anything. But the military promised us that if we were<br>disabled due to military service, we would be cared for. They have kept<br>that promise. That's all we ask for. Wounded in combat, or developed a<br>lifelong incurable disease, because of military service, and you are<br>cared for. Period.<br><br>I think that anyone who has taken the oath and agreed to put their life<br>on the line for their country, ***whether they had the opportunity to do<br>so or not***, is owed a debt of gratitude that this nation is<br>ill-equipped to repay. And that's just fine, we don't mind.<br><br>*Because that's not why we put the uniform on in the first place.* ***We<br>did it because we love this country and what it stands for, and we want<br>you and your kids to still be able to enjoy the freedoms we had.***<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
