<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should Trump voters lose the right to vote for displaying gross<br>incompetence as citizens and irresponsibility in electing a fraud,<br>idiot, and Russian agent?**<br><br>The remedies for being "a fraud, idiot, and Russian agent" are not to<br>remove the right to vote from citizens.<br><br>If Trump is a fraud and an idiot, the Constitutional remedy is to not<br>re-elect him.<br><br>If Trump is a Russian agent, the Constitutional remedy is to impeach<br>him.<br><br>But he was a legal, valid choice on the ballot, and voters who voted for<br>him did so legally.<br><br>Voters have been incompetent for all time. This is why, originally,<br>there were minimum requirements needed to be a voter. You had to be a<br>*landowner* before you could vote. This meant you had some modicum of<br>intelligence and could exercise critical thinking skills.<br><br>But this particular bar on voting rights was rightly removed, because<br>equality. All citizens, by the very nature of their citizenship, have<br>the right to vote. It's not a privilege insofar as privilege vs right,<br>and only a privilege can be revoked.<br><br>So no, you can't lose your right to vote for voting for someone who was<br>a valid candidate at the time he was elected. This makes simply no<br>sense.<br><br>You calling voters incompetent means nothing, because there is no<br>competency test before you can vote.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
