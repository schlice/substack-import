<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can my sister file a lawsuit against her employer if one of her<br>managers was sexually harassing her, black mailing her, and threatening<br>her safety? The employer took action, but can she still receive<br>compensation for pain & suffering?**<br><br>The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends."<br><br>It sounds like the company already took action, and what she can<br>continue to do is therefore going to be governed by the details of the<br>settlement that the company reached. There is a better than average<br>chance that she signed a settlement agreement (or an agreement which<br>settles the matter, regardless of what it may be called), and both sides<br>agreed that the matter was settled. This means that a certain result was<br>reached. It may not have been the most agreeable, but there it is.<br><br>Such agreements may include a phrase that by accepting the settlement,<br>you agree that the matter is settled, and you will not pursue any<br>further legal action, either against the company, or against the alleged<br>aggressor. This is important, because when a company settles with all<br>parties involved, it is at least partially because they don't want to<br>have to go through anything public. They don't want to risk their image<br>by a sex harassment suit going public, so they will do their utmost to<br>prevent it from doing so.<br><br>To that end, she should check anything she signed with regards to the<br>settlement. She should check for clauses which would prevent her from<br>taking further action. She will most likely be prevented from further<br>suing the company, but she *may* still be able to bring private action<br>against the aggressor. Again, this will all depend on what is in the<br>settlement agreement.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is legal information, not legal advice.
