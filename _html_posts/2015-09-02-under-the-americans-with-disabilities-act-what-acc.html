<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The presence or absence of security at the entrance to a<br>building does not alter the requirements under ADA. Businesses must<br>still provide access to disabled persons at any public accommodation.\<br>\<br>So the key to whether or not the business needs to provide<br>accommodations to customers is whether or not the business is considered<br>a \"public accommodation.\" If it is a business, and the business<br>receives customers at their business location, it is likely that they<br>fall under ADA guidelines and must provide accommodations. You will need<br>to consult with the Disability office in your state to determine if the<br>business is considered a public accommodation and is bound by ADA.\<br>\<br>That doesn\'t relieve the business from providing exactly the same<br>accommodations to employees.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
