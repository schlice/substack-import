<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The neighbor is still responsible even if he doesn't do it.<br><br>Hopefully, you made the wise decision to live an a community with an<br>HOA. Bring the dirty yard to their attention, and their trashy yard will<br>begin to directly cost them money. In most places, having trash in your<br>yard is not illegal, so the city or the town won't even touch it. Sure,<br>some towns and cities may have some ordinances for excessive trash or<br>unkempt yards which you might be able to fight to get them to enforce,<br>but every HOA will ensure that your yard is clean and your lawn is<br>mowed, and it will hit that homeowner directly in their wallet.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
