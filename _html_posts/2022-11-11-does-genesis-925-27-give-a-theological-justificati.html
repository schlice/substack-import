<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not at all. That would be an incorrect interpretation of a prophesy.<br><br>First of all, the passage, for reference:<br><br>> he said,<br>><br>> "Cursed be Canaan!\<br>> The lowest of slaves\<br>> will he be to his brothers."<br>><br>> He also said,<br>><br>> "Praise be to the Lord, the God of Shem!\<br>> May Canaan be the slave of Shem.\<br>> May God extend Japheth's territory;\<br>> may Japheth live in the tents of Shem,\<br>> and may Canaan be the slave of Japheth." --- Genesis 9:25--27 NIV<br><br>Many commentators over the years have equated the curse on Ham to be<br>analogous to the slavery of African peoples, but this is incorrect. In<br>actuality, it was the Egyptians (which were descendants of Ham) who<br>enslaved the Israelites. So equating this to African slavery is<br>incorrect.<br><br>This curse, issued by Noah, was actually to be served by their<br>descendents. That's why, instead of addressing the punishment on Ham, he<br>says "Cursed be Canaan," who is a son of Ham.<br><br>The NIV translates the next line as "the lowest of slaves," while other<br>translations list it as "the slave of slaves." This is imagery seen<br>throughout the BIble: "King of Kings," "Holy of Holies," etc. It is an<br>indication of a *superlative*.<br><br>And when he says "will he be to his brothers," he is predicting that the<br>Canaanites will become the slaves of the Israelites, which did come to<br>pass.<br><br>This verse is all in figurative language; none of it was actually<br>addressing Shem, Ham, or Japheth, but their *descendants*. And it is in<br>no way giving *justification* or *permission* for any of the actions; it<br>merely provides a *prediction* about what is to come due to Ham's<br>treachery.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
