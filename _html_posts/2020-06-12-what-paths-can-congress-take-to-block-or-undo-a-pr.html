<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What paths can Congress take to block or undo a presidential executive<br>order?**<br><br>Congress can do what Congress does: write law.<br><br>Executive Orders are orders for Executive Branch departments which<br>advise them how to execute laws. Note that Executive Orders are not *new<br>law*, but they are interpretations of existing law.<br><br>So if Congress wrote a law and it was vague, or it allowed the Executive<br>Branch to use its discretion in how to do something, an Executive Order<br>can direct Federal agencies to act, within the law, a certain way.<br>For example, if the law provides for prosecutorial discretion, a<br>president may tell the Justice Department to not prosecute certain types<br>of criminals, within the bounds of prosecutorial discretion.<br><br>Let's say that Congress doesn't like what the Executive Branch is doing<br>with its discretion, or maybe what they are doing is not what lawmakers<br>intended. It would be up to Congress to re-write the law on<br>prosecutorial discretion to make the thing they didn't like unlawful.<br><br>It is important to note that this is where Congressional investigations<br>come from. Congress has the authority to investigate the Executive<br>Branch to gauge how they are implementing the laws they write, so that<br>they can change those laws.<br><br>At least, this is the way it's supposed to work.<br><br>What routinely happens is Congress goes to the courts to try to get an<br>injunction against the Executive from doing what they are doing, instead<br>of re-writing their own laws. The Executive often uses Executive Orders<br>to create new law outside of what Congress has given them. So as usual,<br>not everything works exactly the way it is supposed to work.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen. You ruined it for<br>everyone.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
