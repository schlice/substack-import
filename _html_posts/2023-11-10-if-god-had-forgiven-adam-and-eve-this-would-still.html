<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If God had wanted Adam and Eve to never have the choice to sin, He never<br>would have put the trees in the Garden from which they could not eat.<br><br>Therefore, if you're following along logically, *the trees must have<br>been there for a reason.*<br><br>That reason was so that Adam and Eve had the free choice to sin or not.<br><br>Turns out, they chose to sin.<br><br>But "all-loving" doesn't mean that God doesn't punish sin. God punishes<br>sin *because He loves us.*<br><br>Don't parents punish their children when they misbehave? Do they do this<br>because they hate their children? Hardly. It's because they love their<br>children and they want them to be better.<br><br>The problem with Adam and Eve was that once they disobeyed God, they<br>were now *sinners*. Sin had entered the human condition, and God cannot<br>abide sin. God is perfect, and His standard is perfection. Nothing less<br>is acceptable to Him.<br><br>Therefore, Adam and Eve had to leave the Garden and live with their new<br>sin nature.<br><br>God does this because He loves perfectly and He hates perfectly. He<br>loves completely, but He hates sin completely.<br><br>God could not "forgive" Adam and Eve, because to do so would mean to<br>*ignore their sin.* A loving, holy, and just God cannot ignore sin.<br>If He ignored sin, He would not be just. There must be payment for sin.<br>God demonstrated this time and time again, and He demonstrated that<br>blood atonement is how He covers sin.<br><br>It was first demonstrated by God in Genesis 3:<br><br>> The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed<br>> them. (v. 21 NIV)<br><br>Think about that. *God shed innocent blood to cover the sins of Adam and<br>Eve.* He literally demonstrated blood atonement.<br><br>And in a not-at-all-surprising turn of events, *Jesus Christ shed His<br>innocent blood to cover the sins of the world: past, present, and<br>future.* *Jesus died once, for all.*<br><br>See the connection there? Cool stuff once you start looking at it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
