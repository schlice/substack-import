<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I don't think it's either illegal or unethical. I just think if the<br>officer is not on official department business, it's just a bad idea.<br><br>Department policies vary widely, and there are almost as many policies<br>as there are departments. However, one thing is generally accepted among<br>most major departments in most cities with more than a few thousand<br>people in them: everything you do in uniform is a reflection of the<br>department. Everything. From stopping by the grocery store on the way<br>home to filling up your car at the gas station on the way in, everything<br>you do in uniform is a reflection of the department. Any time you wear<br>the uniform, you represent the department.<br><br>This is why, in most major departments, you don't wear your (full)<br>uniform while you travel. I know some guys who just wear their pants and<br>boots. They usually either wear a T-shirt or some other top, and<br>depending on the season, a jacket or coat. Other guys I know won't wear<br>any of their uniform components at all to and from the office. Once they<br>get to the office, they change into their full uniform to go on shift,<br>and then change again before leaving.<br><br>The goal, again, is to make sure that there is a clear delineation<br>between when you are on duty and representing the department, to when<br>you are off-duty and not representing the department.<br><br>Some small towns may not hold their officers or deputies to this rule,<br>as most people know who they are regardless of what they wear.<br><br>However, I'd say that wearing your uniform to an AA meeting, if you're<br>not there on official business, is a poor idea. The idea that someone<br>might be there who could act on your identity, especially while it is<br>supposed to be *anonymous*, would have a fairly chilling influence on<br>the meeting.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
