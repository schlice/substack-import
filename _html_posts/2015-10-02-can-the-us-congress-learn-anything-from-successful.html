<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The only thing \"successful\" about the gun laws passed by<br>Australia and the UK is that they reduced private gun ownership.\<br>\<br>They did *nothing* to change the rate of gun homicides. They did<br>*nothing* to change the rate of homicides in general.\<br>\<br>]<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-10ba707c3d4242c841e7dfa5ea45be9a){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-10ba707c3d4242c841e7dfa5ea45be9a" master_w="610"<br>master_h="256"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br>Here, you can see the rate of gun homicide continued unchanged through<br>the Australian gun ban. You can also see the \"total homicide\" rate<br>continued unchanged for at least five years following the ban. So<br>effectively, the ban had no impact.\<br>\<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-5d9a6a4a446bd21b7bb40c75ec0dedd0){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-5d9a6a4a446bd21b7bb40c75ec0dedd0" master_w="578"<br>master_h="280"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>You can see here that around the time of the ban (which is at the first<br>I in suicide) that again, there was no change to the trend of gun<br>suicides, which was already on the decline. The rate of non-gun<br>suicides, however, did climb.\<br>\<br>\<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-8a8d93f309fe9a3939f6881687f87dc3){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-8a8d93f309fe9a3939f6881687f87dc3" master_w="788"<br>master_h="514"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br>As you can see here, the rate of homicides in England and Wales<br>continued on its upward trend, despite the handgun ban.\<br>\<br>The only thing Congress can learn from these statistics is \"gun bans<br>don\'t stop homicides.\"\<br>\<br>Not to mention, there\'s that pesky Second Amendment that prevents them<br>from enacting a gun ban anyway.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
