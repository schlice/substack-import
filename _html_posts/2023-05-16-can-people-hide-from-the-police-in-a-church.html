<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sure! I bet there are a lot of great hiding places in a church.<br><br>But I think the question you wanted to ask was "Are criminals immune to<br>arrest inside a church?"<br><br>> A church can play a role as sanctuary in a wide range of<br>> circumstances, including protecting victims of domestic violence,<br>> shielding minors from abusers, and simply providing a warm place to<br>> sleep during freezing weather. But a church is not, as a general rule,<br>> a place where suspected criminals can successfully hide. The law does<br>> not prevent police, including immigration enforcement and other<br>> specialized units, from entering church grounds to arrest a criminal<br>> suspect who has claimed religious<br>> sanctuary.\[1\](#rdXQf){#cite-rdXQf .citation_link}<br><br>So the answer to that question is no.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-rdXQf){.citation_index} [[Dispelling Myths About Churches<br>as Sanctuaries from the<br>Law](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1262aa&url=https://www.churchlawcenter.com/church-law/churches-as-sanctuaries/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="churchlawcenter.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
