<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Since a military member's sexual preferences have absolutely positively<br>zero to do with their ability to accomplish the mission, it won't make<br>the military a more efficient fighting force.<br><br>So will it change how the military accomplishes the mission?<br><br>Nope, won't change a thing.<br><br>Although I'd hate to be the woman who identifies as a man try to take a<br>shower with the whole team watching her/him. There's paltry little<br>privacy in the military, and if you're transgender, you don't get extra<br>privacy. You do what the team does.<br><br>I simply can't imagine that this would be preferable to showering with<br>members of your biological gender, uncomfortable as it may be. But I'm<br>not transgender so I can't answer that question.<br><br>Also, would the transgender service member get issued uniform items<br>corresponding to their biological gender, or their identified gender?<br>The uniforms simply aren't "cut" to fit the opposite gender. How will<br>that work? Will they have to get new uniform items made? So an already<br>cash-strapped military which can barely keep its tanks rolling and<br>planes flying now has to spend a boatload of money making new uniforms?<br>This is beneficial to the military *how?*<br><br>Remember, what's most important is the needs of the service, not the<br>needs of the member. Yes, you need to keep your military members happy<br>(fed, clothed, healthy, paid, etc), but catering to their sexual<br>orientation doesn't make a more efficient fighting force.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
