<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is it assault when an adult attacks an adult, but it\'s not<br>considered assault when a kid attacks another kid?**<br><br>Assault is a crime under the adult justice system. It requires an *actus<br>reus* (the guilty act) and *mens rea* (the guilty mind). Mens rea is<br>"the mental element of a person\'s intention to commit a crime; or<br>knowledge that one\'s action or lack of action would cause a crime to be<br>committed."\[1\](#inJnL){#cite-inJnL .citation_link}<br><br>Children cannot form *mens rea*. Their minds are not yet developed<br>enough to be able to determine that their action or lack of action would<br>cause a crime to be committed.<br><br>Therefore, we have a *juvenile justice system* in the United States.<br>Assaults that are actually referred to the juvenile justice system are<br>not handled in the same way as assaults in adult courts. If an assault<br>were to actually be brought to a juvenile court, it would be called a<br>"delinquent act" which is essentially anything that could be charged as<br>a crime in an adult court. Proceedings are generally not open to the<br>public, as juvenile records are normally sealed from public disclosure.<br><br>They may not have to have formal charges pressed at all. Factors that<br>may affect a court\'s treatment of a juvenile offender and the<br>disposition of the case include:<br><br>1.  The severity of the offense. A serious crime is more likely to<br>    result in the filing of a petition than a less severe crime.<br>2.  The minor\'s age. Petitions are more likely to be filed in cases<br>    involving older children.<br>3.  The minor\'s past record. Formal charges are more likely when a<br>    minor has been previously involved with juvenile court.<br>4.  The strength of the evidence that the minor committed a crime.<br>    Obviously, stronger evidence leads to a greater likelihood of formal<br>    charges.<br>5.  The minor\'s sex. Formal charges are more likely to be filed against<br>    boys than against girls.<br>6.  The minor\'s social history. Petitions are more likely to be filed<br>    when children have a history of problems at home or school.<br>7.  The parent\'s or guardian\'s apparent ability to control the minor.<br>    The greater the lack of parental control, the more likely the intake<br>    officer is to file a petition.\[2\](#bfBND){#cite-bfBND<br>    .citation_link}<br><br>Unofficially, courts can also be swayed by factors like:<br><br>1.  The minor\'s attitude. Formal proceedings are less likely to occur<br>    when a child shows remorse for committing a crime.<br>2.  The minor\'s appearance. If the young person is polite, dressed<br>    well, and neatly groomed, then the intake personnel are more likely<br>    to handle the case informally.<br>3.  Whether the minor has family or community support. The more support<br>    the young person has, the more likely the intake officer is to deal<br>    with the case informally.<br>4.  Whether the minor has an attorney. Disposing of a case informally<br>    may be less likely when a child has a lawyer.<br><br>When a case is decided in juvenile court, there are generally three<br>possible outcomes:<br><br>1.  Informal supervision: The court informally monitors a child and<br>    automatically dismisses charges if there is no further troublesome<br>    activity<br>2.  Formal supervision: Similar to adult probation, the court requires<br>    the child to stay out of trouble and report periodically to a<br>    juvenile probation officer.<br>3.  Incarceration: The child is referred to a juvenile detention<br>    facility.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-inJnL){.citation_index} [[Mens rea -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4d38f5&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_rea){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-bfBND){.citation_index} [[Juvenile court -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=911979&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_court%23United_States){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
