<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We know that Vitamin D has a prophylactic effect against MS. We don\'t<br>have to know the cause of MS to know that it works, we have proven this<br>through *epidemiological* studies, which is the study of disease<br>patterns.<br><br>We know that above 40 degrees latitude there is a much higher prevalence<br>of MS, and researchers believe this may be caused by a decrease in<br>exposure to direct sunlight, which is a major cause for vitamin D<br>deficiency. Studies have also shown us that the vast majority of people<br>who develop MS are deficient in Vitamin D.<br><br>We know that vitamin D has a prophylactic effect, but we do not know to<br>what extent, how it works, or what level of vitamin D is enough.<br><br>We also do not know at what age you have to start fixing your vitamin D<br>levels. We do know through epidemiological studies that when you move to<br>a new region, you take on the risk factors of that new region. If you<br>move before age 15, the effects of the new region are seen in the<br>current generation. If you move after age 15, the effects are seen in<br>the next generation. So there is some evidence that if you are not<br>exposed to the positive benefits of a new region before age 15, you<br>retain the same risk factors with which you grew up.<br><br>This may mean that a person who was vitamin D deficient their entire<br>life (up to age 15) may not benefit from correcting vitamin D levels<br>now. Again, there is much we do not know.<br><br>WARNING: DO NOT alter your vitamin D intake on your own! Work with your<br>doctor if you feel that vitamin D therapy might be right for you. If you<br>take too much vitamin D, it may be detrimental.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
