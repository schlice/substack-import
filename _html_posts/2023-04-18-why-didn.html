<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Because bad things happen to good people, all the time. The fact that<br>you think God *should have* prevented it is your problem, not<br>His.**<br><br>Seriously, where do non-Christians get this idea that God is responsible<br>for preventing all the bad things in your life? Like He skips ahead of<br>us through our life's journey with his great cosmic leaf-blower, blowing<br>away all of our troubles. Where did this idea even come from?<br><br>Best I can tell, your reasoning (or at least the reasoning of people who<br>think like you) is something like this:<br><br>> Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not<br>> omnipotent.\<br>> Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent.\<br>> Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil?\<br>> Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God? --- Epicurus<br><br>You've assigned God to these arbitrary categories based on your own<br>feelings. God is certainly able to prevent evil, but He has not done it<br>yet.<br><br>You: (stomping feet like a petulant child): *Why why why why? I want it<br>NOW!*<br><br>Yeah, stomping your feet and screaming like a child are good looks<br>before the All-Powerful Creator of the Universe.<br><br>We know two other things: God has good plans for us, even if we can't<br>see them, and God has never broken a promise He has made, ever.<br><br>God has promised that He will destroy evil, in His time, not ours.<br>Humanity has absolutely zero patience. God *will* destroy evil, and<br>every knee *will* bow, and every tongue *will* confess that Jesus is<br>Lord on that day, when everyone sees God destroy evil.<br><br>But good luck to those who did so unwillingly.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
