<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [To be brutally honest with you, this is why CCSVI is not<br/>an approved treatment for MS. The studies which have shown promise are<br/>not clearly usable studies across the board. Clinical trials are still<br/>in progress.\<br/>\<br/>Also, as with any treatment, it is not 100% guaranteed to produce<br/>results. This is especially true for MS, in which no one\'s MS is<br/>exactly like anyone else\'s MS. What you respond to may be completely<br/>different from what someone else responded to.\<br/>\<br/>I responded successfully to Copaxone for six years. Then it stopped<br/>working. Don\'t know why. I was exactly as faithful in taking my<br/>medicine in year one as I was in year six. That\'s just it; no one knows<br/>exactly why.\<br/>\<br/>So, I did what anyone in my position would have done: tried the next<br/>medicine in the list. Yes, my neurologist and I have a list. We looked<br/>at all the choices and made the best one, in our collective opinion.\<br/>\<br/>I suggest you do the same.]<br/><br/>*Disclaimer:*<br/><br/>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br/>substitute for professional medical advice.
