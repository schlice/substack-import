<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why would someone call the police over something as trivial and<br>nonthreatening as her senior photo?**<br><br>The woman in question, "called the police" by posting a tweet. So first<br>of all, there's no emergency if you're using Twitter. Secondly, she<br>asked the police to "weigh in" because apparently the girl took the<br>photo at a location where the tweeter believes guns were disallowed by<br>the establishment. Her reasoning? When an establishment posts a sign<br>that says "no guns," carrying one is "irresponsible, reckless, and<br>potentially dangerous."<br><br>This sounds more like a case of virtue signaling to me than anything<br>else. First of all, Brenna Spencer was *outside* of the location which<br>did not allow guns *inside*. Secondly, how is it "okay" to carry a gun<br>outside, but once you go inside, it's "irresponsible, reckless, and<br>potentially dangerous?" The difference between the interior and the<br>exterior of a building makes the difference between "okay" and<br>"irresponsible, reckless, and potentially dangerous?" Hardly. All it<br>shows is that the tweeter, Victoria Silva (@Victoria\_\_Silva), is<br>[ammophobic(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=204c60&url=https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term%3Dammophobic){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="urbandictionary.com"}]{.qlink_container}. Carrying a gun<br>properly (as Brenna was, in a belly band) is no more dangerous than<br>carrying a lighter. Actually, it's safer than carrying a lighter. But a<br>lighter can't protect you from a bad guy. It's certainly not "reckless,"<br>as there is no evidence that Brenna is improperly carrying her gun, or<br>waving it about in a reckless manner. And the only person in the picture<br>taking any responsibility for her own safety is Brenna. So it appears<br>that Ms. Silva is 100% off base. Her comments only reveal her own<br>dislike of firearms and her desire to control *others'* behavior in<br>order to control *her own* issues.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
