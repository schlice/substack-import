<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How do you send data from one phone to another?<br><br>This is a challenging question to answer, because much of the answer<br>will depend on the type of data as well as the platform, and whether you<br>own both of the phones (i.e. they're logged in to the same accounts) or<br>not.<br><br>I'd like a little more information before I can answer the question<br>correctly. Use the "Comment" button (the bubble just underneath the<br>question) to add some more detail so we can help:<br><br>- What phones are we talking about (i.e. model of phone: two iPhones, an<br>  iPhone and an Android, etc)?<br>- Do you own both phones (i.e. are they logged in to the same accounts)?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
