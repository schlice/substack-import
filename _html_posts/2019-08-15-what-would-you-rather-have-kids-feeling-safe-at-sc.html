<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What would you rather have: kids feeling safe at school or allow<br>anyone to buy a gun?**<br><br>You have committed the logical fallacy of the [[false<br>dilemma](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7bb497&url=https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/94/False-Dilemma){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="logicallyfallacious.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>Why is this a logical fallacy? You have presented the two choices as if<br>they were the only two choices available: either kids feel safe at<br>school or anyone can buy a gun, and you can only pick one.<br><br>However, this is not true at all. An entire spectrum of choices exists<br>here; there are far more than just two choices. Anyone *except for<br>violent felons or the mentally ill* can purchase guns, and kids can feel<br>safe at school *while still being vigilant and watching out for suspect<br>behavior*. There are far more choices here than you let on.<br><br>And that's why this is a terrible comparison.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
