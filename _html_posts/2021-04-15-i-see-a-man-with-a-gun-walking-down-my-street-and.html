<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I see a man with a gun walking down my street and there\'s a kid<br>playing outside. What should I do?**<br><br>Depends on the law in your locality. We're presuming you live in the US.<br><br>If your state does not permit open carry of firearms, call the police<br>and tell them someone is open carrying a firearm. Let the police handle<br>it. The cost of disallowing open carry needs to be passed back to the<br>government, and if they find its enforcement to be too expensive, they<br>will either change it or increase funding to the police.<br><br>If your state does permit open carry of firearms, then you have not<br>provided enough information to determine whether or not you should be<br>worried. Is the firearm being carried incorrectly? If it is a handgun,<br>is it in a holster? If it is a rifle, is it on a sling? Is it being<br>carried correctly? Is the person being threatening with it? You have a<br>lot of questions to answer before you can determine what to do.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
