<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**At what age does it become inappropriate for a little girl to run<br>around topless?**<br><br>Most people couch this issue as an equal rights issue. If men can do it,<br>so can women.<br><br>However, it's not that simple. We have one other problem. Like it or<br>not, agree with it or not, in the United States (and in many other<br>countries as well), the female breast is not just viewed as a device<br>which feeds babies. The female breast is viewed as a sex object.<br><br>Clearly, there will be much haranguing about why this is, and whether or<br>not this should be in the first place. **But women are just as guilty of<br>objectifying the breast as men are of enjoying the look of objectified<br>breasts.** You can't simultaneously objectify your own breasts (and<br>unless you dress like an 1800's school teacher, you do) and at the same<br>time declare "Free the nipple!" It's an incongruent position.<br><br>So if the breast is, at all, objectified as a sex object, then it should<br>be treated as any other anatomical sex object (the penis or the vagina),<br>Remember, both of those organs are dual-use as well (elimination of<br>waste and sex objects), so it's not unreasonable that the breast is also<br>dual-use (feeding babies and sex objects).<br><br>If it is at all a dual-use organ, it must fall under the same rules as<br>any other sex object.<br><br>So what age is it inappropriate for a little girl to run around topless?<br>Experts say that children begin to distinguish gender differences around<br>age 3 or 4, and not long after that, they usually begin to feel<br>modesty.\[1\](#MWVlP){#cite-MWVlP .citation_link} So if there is an<br>age when children should start being clothed in public, it's around 3 or<br>4.<br><br>Additionally, societal norms play a large role in determining when you<br>should no longer allow children to spend time naked. In the United<br>States, people have a sense that the body is very private. The<br>sexualization of nudity, **and a perfectly reasonable fear of pedophiles<br>taking an unhealthy interest in a nude child,** is yet another reason<br>why children should not run around naked.<br><br>Experts also agree that parents would be wise to teach their children<br>that different situations call for different behaviors. It's not at all<br>inappropriate to teach your children to consider the feelings of others<br>before they act. So while it may be reasonable to let a child run around<br>naked *at home*, when guests come over, it is reasonable to teach your<br>child that consideration of the feelings of the guest should dictate<br>that clothes go back on. A similar attitude should prevail in public.<br><br>You can disagree until the cows come home whether or not this *should*<br>*be*. But you cannot disagree that this is how it *is.*<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously. My mental well-being<br>isn\'t worth your harassing, inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I<br>wrote, tough shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is<br>un-cited opinion masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m<br>wrong, write your own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site,<br>not a debate site. If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,<br>you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.<br>Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be<br>followed by a block and a mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this<br>immediately and with no compunction. You have been warned.
