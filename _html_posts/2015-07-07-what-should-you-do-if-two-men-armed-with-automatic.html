<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Depends on where you live.\<br>\<br>If you live in a state with an active and well-tested *Castle Doctrine*,<br>then by all means, defend yourself and your family by all means<br>necessary, using all force available to you, up to and including deadly<br>force.\<br>\<br>If you do not live in a strong Castle Doctrine state, I still suggest<br>you defend yourself and your family by all means necessary, using all<br>force available to you, up to and including deadly force. After you stop<br>them, however, you may be facing some tough legal challenges to your own<br>defense of your own family in your own home. But your family will be<br>safe.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
