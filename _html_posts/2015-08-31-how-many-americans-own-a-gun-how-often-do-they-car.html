<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Since permitting rules vary by state, the percentage of<br>people in any population that might be armed at any one time similarly<br>varies by state. But if you want to generalize, in 2014 it is estimated<br>that there are about 14 million concealed carry permit holders in the<br>United States. Out of about 300 million people, that means that about<br>4.6% of people in the United States holds a concealed carry permit. That<br>means, on average, out of every 100 people, there are 4 or 5 of them who<br>could be legally armed. There is no telling how many of them are<br>illegally armed (i.e. armed without a permit).\<br>\<br>This assumes a lot of things, such as whether or not concealed handguns<br>are permitted in the location where you are (law-abiding citizens will<br>not carry where they are not permitted by law, which implies that in<br>those areas, only criminals will be armed).\<br>\<br>In states with \"shall issue\" permitting guidelines, rates of concealed<br>carry would be higher.\<br>\<br>Also, as a permit holder, I don\'t look at a situation and say, \"should<br>I carry today,\" I look at a particular day and say, \"is there any<br>reason that I shouldn\'t carry today?\" I have yet to find a day,<br>unless I\'m travelling by air, that I say no. Even if I go someplace<br>that I know I can\'t carry in, I will lock my gun in my car. I have a<br>gun safe in my car so that I can securely lock my handgun inside my car.<br>They\'re very common and very inexpensive. So I can carry all day, but<br>then if I have to run into my child\'s school for something, I can lock<br>my handgun in my car (which is legal in Colorado \-- leaving your gun in<br>your car on school property).]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
