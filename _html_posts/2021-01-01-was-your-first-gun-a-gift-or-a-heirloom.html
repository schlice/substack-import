<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Was your first gun a gift or a heirloom?<br><br>If we presume that a "gift" is a gift of a new or previously unowned<br>gun, and an "heirloom" is a gun which was previously owned by someone<br>and then *gifted* to someone else, my first two guns were heirlooms.<br><br>My dad was a police officer in New York. After he retired, he gave me<br>two of his firearms: a Sig Sauer P228 DAO (it was New York's first foray<br>into semi autos, and they wanted it to be as "revolver-like" as<br>possible), and the gun it replaced, the Smith & Wesson Model 66,<br>standard barrel (4.25â€³).<br><br>After I started buying my own guns, I gave the two "heirloom" guns to my<br>brother. Within one week, the Sig was stolen from the house he was<br>renting. The Smith was in the range box in the basement; the Sig was in<br>a nightstand. We still have the Smith in my family.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
