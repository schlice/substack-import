<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Certainly! They can absolutely have morals, ethics and values, and they<br>can consider those things "right" and the opposite of those things<br>"wrong."<br><br>***But without a universal standard of right and wrong which applies to<br>all people at all times,* *then what* *they*** *consider to be<br>"right" or "wrong" may not be what* *everyone else* *considers to be<br>"right" or "wrong."*<br><br>For example, said atheist may believe that it is morally right to kill<br>you and take all of your stuff, because they believe that "survival of<br>the fittest" is the ethically correct way to live. Morally speaking, if<br>everyone makes their own morals, and it's okay for everyone to make<br>their own morals, then this person would be acting "morally right," as<br>far as he was concerned.<br><br>If you're the one they are killing, however, then it's likely that you<br>wouldn't believe that their morals are very "right," now would you.<br><br>I know, killing is a poor example to use, because everyone knows that<br>it's wrong to kill.<br><br>Huh, that's interesting. *Everyone knows that it's wrong to kill*. **How<br>is that possible**? I mean, if there is no God, if there is no<br>*overarching* moral authority to which every human is accountable, how<br>is it possible that killing is wrong for everyone, everywhere?<br><br>Something to think about.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
