<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [By default, it\'s because there is no tactile feedback<br>that you\'ve taken a picture, so the phone makes a sound to let you know<br>that it did what you asked it to do.\<br>\<br>Thankfully, once you\'ve rooted your Android phone, you can remove the<br>shutter sound from your camera. I think some later iOS versions allow<br>you to change or mute the camera sound, but I could be mistaken<br>there.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
