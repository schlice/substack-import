<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes. I was on natalizumab for 18 months, and it was the only time in my<br>MS journey that I had lesions *shrink*. In other words, we were<br>suppressing MS so well, that my body was beginning to heal itself. As<br>far as MS goes, Tysabri has one of the highest *efficacies* of any MS<br>drug.<br><br>But you can't really stay on natalizumab (brand name is Tysabri) for too<br>long. There is a very dangerous risk which comes along with Tysabri. It<br>is a disease called **progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy<br>(PML)**, which can be fatal. PML is caused by the activation of the [[JC<br>Virus](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4ede7e&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_polyomavirus_2){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} in the body. The immune<br>system normally suppresses the virus, but on Tysabri, that suppression<br>is weakened. The JC virus can activate, and it can induce PML. This<br>virus is common; estimates say anywhere between 70 to 90% of the<br>population has been exposed at some point, likely in childhood or early<br>adolescence.<br><br>While you are on Tysabri, you will routinely be checked for JC. If you<br>are JC Positive, you can still take Tysabri, but you will have to be<br>closely monitored. There will be special onboarding and offboarding<br>procedures so as to avoid having two MS medicines in your bloodstream at<br>the same time, a major factor in determining whether or not JC will<br>activate.<br><br>I was fortunate in that during my entire treatment with Tysabri, I<br>remained (and am to this day) JC Negative.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is natalizumab a good treatment for multiple sclerosis?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
