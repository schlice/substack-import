<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Which amendment guarantees the right to a lawyer even if a person<br>can\'t afford one?**<br><br>The 6th Amendment:<br><br>> In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a<br>> speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and<br>> district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district<br>> shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of<br>> the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the<br>> witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining<br>> witnesses in his favor, **and to have the assistance of counsel for<br>> his defense.**<br><br>That last part of that last sentence codifies the *right* to an attorney<br>for criminal cases. The right exists whether or not the person can<br>afford an attorney, as rights are not purchase-able. The court will<br>determine if you are poor enough to require appointed counsel. You may<br>have to gather financial records to prove to the court that you lack the<br>funds to hire a private lawyer. Some courts will take you at your word,<br>especially if you are homeless and don't have access to the required<br>documents.<br><br>Notice too that it doesn't say that you get the assistance of counsel<br>"at trial" or "in the courtroom," but "for his defense." This defense<br>begins, according to the court, the moment you are in custody *and*<br>being questioned. This is why you can remain silent when police begin to<br>question you (you don't have to answer their questions) until you've had<br>the chance to get "the assistance of counsel."<br><br>By the way, I strongly suggest you do this if you are arrested for a<br>crime.<br><br>[[Bill Stein\'s answer to You are mistakenly arrested in the U.S. as a<br>suspect in a serious crime. Are you wiser to say nothing (except name<br>and address with ID as required) until you get a lawyer or cooperate<br>fully with the police and answer all their<br>questions?](https://www.quora.com/You-are-mistakenly-arrested-in-the-U-S-as-a-suspect-in-a-serious-crime-Are-you-wiser-to-say-nothing-except-name-and-address-with-ID-as-required-until-you-get-a-lawyer-or-cooperate-fully-with-the-police-and-answer/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
