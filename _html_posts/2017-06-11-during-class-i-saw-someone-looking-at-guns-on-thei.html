<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The only thing you have determined through your screen peeking is that<br>you found someone who:<br><br>- perhaps likes guns<br>- perhaps is in the market for a new gun.<br>- perhaps is an artist and he wants to draw a gun.<br>- perhaps is an author and he needs facts for his story.<br><br>See all those bullets that start with "perhaps?" That means there is<br>*so much about this man that you know nothing about*, that there is<br>no way you can form an opinion with any certainty, let alone have any<br>actionable knowledge that the man has done anything wrong.<br><br>At all.<br><br>If you like guns (which I'm going to go out on a limb and say that you<br>don't), maybe you can strike up a conversation with him and talk about<br>that new bullpup rifle that was just released.<br><br>If you don't like guns (which is my guess), it's probably best to simply<br>ignore it.<br><br>And stop looking at other people's screens.<br><br>It's rude.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
