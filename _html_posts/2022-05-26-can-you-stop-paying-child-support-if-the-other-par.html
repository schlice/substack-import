<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes!<br><br>There is a process, however. You can't just, on your own, stop paying<br>child support.<br><br>The process goes like this:<br><br>- Contact your lawyer<br>- Petition the court to award you sole physical custody, using the fact<br>  that the other parent is not taking care of the child as your<br>  reasoning. The clearest reason to seek sole custody is to protect your<br>  child from physical harm. The other parent can still have supervised<br>  visits with the child, but you become the one who makes all the<br>  decisions for the child.<br><br>Then you don't have to pay anyone child support! You have the money, you<br>support the child!<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can you stop paying child support if the other parent is not taking care<br>of the child?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
