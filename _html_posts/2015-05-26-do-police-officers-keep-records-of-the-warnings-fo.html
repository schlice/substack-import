<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Now that there are electronic records of stops, a warning<br>can be recorded without a ticket being issued. And they are almost never<br>kept against a specific vehicle (i.e. a subsequent stop revealing<br>previous warnings). For most departments, records of warnings are not<br>kept.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
