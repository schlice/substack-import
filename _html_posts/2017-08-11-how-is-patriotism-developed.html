<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: you can't.<br><br>You can't develop patriotism through a "patriotism development plan."<br>You can't force somebody to be proud of their country to such a degree<br>that they would be willing to fight and die for that country, to ensure<br>that the ideals on which it was founded will endure.<br><br>What you can do is **build a country worthy of the patriotism of its<br>people.**<br><br>You can build a system of government that people will look to and will<br>want to continue. You can build a system whereby each man is guaranteed<br>the freedom to live his life in the way in which he sees fit. You can<br>build in the guarantee that basic, natural rights will never be violated<br>by the government. You can make a system which has the capability to<br>change if everyone agrees, but is strong enough to be the timeless<br>foundation on which the rest of the nation can be built.<br><br>Once you've done that, then you *live out the example*. You fight<br>and die for that country. You believe *so strongly* that your nation<br>should endure that you become willing to give your own life in defense<br>of that way of life.<br><br>That heritage of sacrifice shows future generations that there are<br>enough people who believe that the experiment in your nation should<br>continue that they would sacrifice themselves to see it happen. And they<br>begin to feel the same.<br><br>And patriotism develops all on its own.<br><br>You can't just develop a love of country. It develops on its own when<br>you have a country worthy of such love.<br><br>I want to disambiguate something before the trolls come along looking<br>for treats. *Patriotism* is different from *nationalism*.<br><br>> *Patriotism is fundamental to liberty because pride in one's<br>> nation-state, and a willingness to defend it if necessary, is the<br>> basis of national independence. Patriotism is the courage of national<br>> self-determination.*<br>><br>> *By contrast, nationalism is patriotism transformed into a sentiment<br>> of superiority and aggression toward other countries. Nationalism is<br>> the poisonous idea that one's country is superior to somebody else's.<br>> Nationalism is intrinsically a cause of war and<br>> imperialism.*\[1\](#HRlut){#cite-HRlut .citation_link}<br><br>Nationalism is patriotism run amok. Patriotism is vital to national<br>independence; nationalism is the zealous desire to force that plan on<br>others. Once you believe that your system is *superior* to others, not<br>just different, and then you choose to aggressively export that system<br>whether others want it or not, you have moved from patriotism into<br>nationalism.<br><br>Instead, show others that your system is better by being better, not by<br>forcing others to adopt what you believe is better. You can still<br>believe your system is the best, but let others adopt it on their own<br>because they believe it is better. Forcing others to adopt your system<br>is toxic and is the underlying cause of imperialism.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-HRlut){.citation_index} [[Nationalism vs.<br>patriotism](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c109d2&url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/nationalism-vs-patriotism/2014/02/23/9129d43a-9afc-11e3-8112-52fdf646027b_story.html?utm_term%3D.ca651501b0e0){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="washingtonpost.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
