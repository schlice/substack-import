<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In 1993 I got a 1989 Ford Thunderbird SC as a gift. It was purchased<br>from auction.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-a0e8e314735a8d9f58c7dff5b75bee99){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-a0e8e314735a8d9f58c7dff5b75bee99" master_w="688"<br>master_h="337"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(This is not my car, but it looked exactly like this, just in black.<br>Image courtesy* [[*Greg Gjerdingen from Willmar, USA, CC BY<br>2.0*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cff51a&url=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="creativecommons.org"}]{.qlink_container}*, via Wikimedia<br>Commons).*<br><br>This car had the supercharged and intercooled version of the Essex 3.8L<br>OHV V-6. Mine had the M5R2 5-speed gearbox, and was *Motor Trend's Car<br>of the Year* for 1989.<br><br>I was home on leave at the time (late November 1992), and so we decided<br>to take the car out for a speed test. We went down to Ocean Parkway,<br>which runs the length of the barrier beaches along Long Island's south<br>shore.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-8f1e0a77ef31f4d971467d6e04a7bb26){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-8f1e0a77ef31f4d971467d6e04a7bb26" master_w="313"<br>master_h="374"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(Image from*<br>[*Wikipedia*(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=88544f&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Parkway_(Long_Island)){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br>As you can see, it's pretty straight, pretty flat, and in the cold of<br>November, no one was expected to be on that stretch of road. So we took<br>the car down there, and opened it up.<br><br>At the same time, I was testing a used secondhand radar detector that<br>clipped over your rear view mirror.<br><br>When we were pulled over, the officer said he clocked us at 147 mph. The<br>radar detector didn't even blink. The officer even took his handheld<br>radar gun out of his car and blasted it directly at our rear view<br>mirror, and we got nothing. Oh well. I guess that detector was<br>secondhand for a reason.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
