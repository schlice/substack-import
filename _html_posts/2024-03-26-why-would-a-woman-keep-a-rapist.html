<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Some believe that enough trauma has been done, and compounding the<br>trauma of a rape with the trauma of an abortion is unnecessary.<br><br>Some believe that the baby is an innocent third-party and is not the<br>perpetrator of a rape. They believe the baby is as much a victim as the<br>mother, and no one is suggesting we kill the rape victim, so why kill<br>another victim?<br><br>Some women understand that abortion isn't a treatment for rape. It<br>doesn't change what happened. It only creates more pain and more<br>suffering, and it actually kills a human being.<br><br>Some women believe that by bringing the baby to term (and optionally<br>keeping the baby), they can bring *some* good out of the tragedy that is<br>a criminal rape.<br><br>\<br><br>So before you angrily type out a comment, I'm not advocating for any<br>position. I'm 100% against rape in all forms. I'm not trying to tell<br>women what to do. I'm not angling to force women to become mothers. I am<br>aware that pregnancy changes a woman, permanently, for the rest of her<br>life. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it is just a thing.<br><br>On the flip side, I believe that killing babies is wrong. I also know<br>that Safe Haven laws exist in all 50 states, and state-funded prenatal<br>care also exists, along with options for no or low-cost care for the<br>remainder of a pregnancy. Pregnancy Resource Centers (PRCs) do exist,<br>despite the best efforts of some to shut them down. They would have all<br>the information on prenatal health care available as well as funding<br>sources to help with that care. They also have information and supplies<br>for post-natal support (if the woman chooses to keep the baby, as some<br>do).<br><br>EDIT: If you comment and you have me blocked so that I cannot respond, I<br>automatically, and with no thought or compunction at all, delete your<br>comment. If you want your comment to remain, make sure you don't have me<br>blocked.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
