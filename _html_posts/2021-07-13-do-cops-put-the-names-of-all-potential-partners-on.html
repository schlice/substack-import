<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, not all cops misuse the various criminal records<br>databases. Secondly, while the search itself is logged, we have no way<br>of knowing why the officer searched that particular person, or license<br>plate, or address or phone number. Finally, not all police departments<br>track this data, and others track some of the data but not others (i.e.<br>Florida reported that there were hundreds of unauthorized database<br>searches but did not report on whether or not the officers were<br>disciplined).<br><br>That said, we know that cops do misuse criminal records databases,<br>because FOIA requests for disciplinary actions against officers who<br>misused databases produced results. Without consistent record-keeping<br>and reporting of disciplinary actions across the more than 13,000 law<br>enforcement agencies across the United States, we probably won't get<br>very good answers as to how often and to what degree it<br>occurs.\[1\](#fGrCB){#cite-fGrCB .citation_link}<br><br>\<br><br>Original Question:<br><br>Do cops put the names of all potential partners on the criminal database<br>to see if they have a criminal record?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-fGrCB){.citation_index} [[AP: Across US, police officers<br>abuse confidential<br>databases](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fc49b4&url=https://apnews.com/article/699236946e3140659fff8a2362e16f43?utm_campaign%3Dsocialflow%26utm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dap){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="apnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
