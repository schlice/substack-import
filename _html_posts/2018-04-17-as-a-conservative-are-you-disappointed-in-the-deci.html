<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, I'm disappointed that we couldn't deport this specific alleged<br>criminal alien. I'm not disappointed in the ruling.<br><br>For reference, the case we are discussing is *Sessions v. Dimaya,* for<br>which SCOTUS rendered a decision on April 17, 2018.<br><br>Conservatives are thrilled that we have a strict constructionist on the<br>bench. Gorsuch sided with the liberals today because they're right. The<br>wording in the previous court's ruling regarding what constitutes a<br>"violent felony" was unconstitutionally vague and was thrown out. So was<br>this. The court is, remarkably, consistent.<br><br>As a conservative, I want Congress to do its job and write good laws.<br>The sad fact is that when Congress writes poor laws, no one benefits,<br>and yes, criminals end up remaining in country because we can't<br>correctly deport them. Clearly, we want criminal aliens deported. But in<br>order to protect everyone, our laws must be iron-clad.<br><br>Gorsuch did not vote on party lines; instead, he actually comported<br>himself as a *jurist*, which is more than I can say for half the court.<br>The Constitution should come before the wishes of the majority of the<br>political party with whom you identify.<br><br>\<br><br>Hi readers!
