Is the<br>rapist liable for child support, as the father?**<br><br>Yes, because child support isn't about protecting the mother or<br>punishing the father (or the other way round, as the situation may be).<br><br>Child support is about supporting the child.<br><br>Since you made the child, and it can be proven that you are the<br>biological father, you are financially responsible for that child until<br>it turns 18.<br><br>If the mother chooses to keep it (and many rape victims do), the father<br>is responsible for child support.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
