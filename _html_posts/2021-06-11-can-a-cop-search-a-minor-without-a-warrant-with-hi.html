<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Generally, yes.<br><br>Parental consent is permissible to allow a search of a minor. Without<br>consent, probable cause would be next required. What constitutes<br>probable cause is an area of Fourth Amendment law that is continuously<br>evolving and being refined by case law.<br><br>Without parental consent or probable cause, the police would need a<br>warrant to conduct a search.<br><br>If the minor is in a school, the lesser standard of reasonable suspicion<br>is applied, in order to maintain a safe and orderly school environment,<br>and with the additional understanding that the school acts *in loco<br>parentis*. Like probable cause, what constitutes reasonable suspicion is<br>continuously evolving. For instance, in a landmark SCOTUS case, it was<br>held that an assistant principal's search of a student's purse was<br>reasonable where that student was observed smoking in violation of<br>school rules.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice. This answer is for GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. If<br>you ignore this warning and convey confidential information in a private<br>message or comment, there is no duty to keep that information<br>confidential or to forego representation adverse to your interests. Seek<br>the advice of a licensed attorney in the appropriate jurisdiction before<br>taking any action that may affect your rights. If you believe you have a<br>claim against someone, consult an attorney immediately, otherwise there<br>is a risk that the time allotted to bring your claim may expire.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to legal questions are intended third<br>party beneficiaries under Quora\'s* [[*Terms of<br>Service.*](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can a cop search a minor without a warrant with his or her parent\'s<br>consent in the USA?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
