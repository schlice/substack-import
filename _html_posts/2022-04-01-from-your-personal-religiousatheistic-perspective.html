<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So you removed "religion" from the question, but it was asked in the<br>"Christians and Christianity" forum. So even though I answer Christian<br>questions and am a creationist and not an evolutionist, I'll do my best<br>to answer the question from a non-religious perspective.<br><br>The problem for evolutionists is not so much explaining how all life<br>forms are related (even though this still has some serious issues). The<br>big problem with macroevolution as the source of human life is the<br>first life.<br><br>Evolutionists, as well as creationists, tend to speak as if they know<br>how the first life came into existence. Both cannot be right; either the<br>first life was created by some kind of intelligence, or it arose<br>spontaneously from nonliving chemicals. But the truth is that *no one<br>was there to see the creation of the first life, so no one knows for<br>sure.*<br><br>So the \$64,000 question is: *how can we tell?* What scientific<br>principles can we use to help us understand what caused the first life?<br><br>*Forensics*.<br><br>The central principle in forensic science is the [[Principle of<br>Uniformity](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=34723a&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformitarianism){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. It basically says that<br>causes in the past are the same as causes today. In other words, we<br>assume that the world worked the same in the past as it does today. If a<br>message requires intelligence to produce today, then a message in the<br>past also required intelligence to produce.<br><br>For example, look at the Grand Canyon. Was anyone around to see it being<br>formed? No, but we know from the Principle of Uniformity that water<br>erosion can cause canyons, because we see it happen today. Compare that<br>with Mount Rushmore. What caused that? No one would ever suggest that<br>natural forces caused presidents' faces to appear in rocks. Since we<br>have never observed natural laws carving faces in rocks today, we can<br>presume that natural laws have never done so in the past either.<br>Therefore, we conclude that intelligent creatures (sculptors) carved the<br>faces in the rocks.<br><br>In the same way, when we look at the first single-celled life, we can<br>presume that natural forces did not create the DNA which contains the<br>equivalent of 1,000 encyclopedias of specific messages. Natural laws<br>have never been known to create even simple messages today, much less a<br>message 1,000 encyclopedias long.<br><br>So why do evolutionists still tell us that the first life spontaneously<br>generated from nonliving chemicals? Nonliving chemicals have never<br>produced life today, and we cannot *apply intelligence* to make them do<br>so. Spontaneous generation of life has never been observed. What we have<br>observed is that all life arises only from similar existing life. And<br>even if they could create life in the lab, it would prove creation,<br>because it would prove that it takes *a lot of intelligence* to create<br>life.<br><br>TL;DR: Make sure you're looking at the correct question. The<br>question isn't whether or not evolution could have occured. The question<br>is how the first life came to be.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>From your personal perspective, what are your thoughts on the evolution<br>of life? edit: removed Religious/Atheistic from the question to better<br>reflect the purpose of the question<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
