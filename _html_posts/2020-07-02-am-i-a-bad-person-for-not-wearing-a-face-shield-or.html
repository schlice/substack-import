Wearing a cloth face covering will help<br>> protect people around you, including those at higher risk of severe<br>> illness from COVID-19 and workers who frequently come into close<br>> contact with other people (e.g., in stores and restaurants). Cloth<br>> face coverings are most likely to reduce the spread of COVID-19 when<br>> they are widely used by people in public settings. The spread of<br>> COVID-19 can be reduced when cloth face coverings are used along with<br>> other preventive measures, including social distancing, frequent<br>> handwashing, and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched<br>> surfaces.\[1\](#QONsP){#cite-QONsP .citation_link}<br><br>Just remember the three W's:<br><br>- Wash your hands.<br>- Wear a mask. Even a cloth face covering helps protect others.<br>- Watch your spacing.
