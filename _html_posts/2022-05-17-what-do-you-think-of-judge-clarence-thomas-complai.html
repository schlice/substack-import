<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What he specifically said was the following:<br><br>> As a society, \"we are becoming addicted to wanting particular<br>> outcomes, not living with the outcomes we don\'t like,\" Thomas said.<br>><br>> \"We can\'t be an institution that can be bullied into giving you just<br>> the outcomes you want. The events from earlier this week are a symptom<br>> of that.\"\[1\](#jCmbp){#cite-jCmbp .citation_link}<br><br>The Supreme Court specifically is an organization which is designed to<br>be *outside* of the influence of people. That's one of the reasons the<br>Justices are appointed for life. They don't ever have to worry about<br>appeasing the public in order to be re-elected. They can focus their<br>attention on the Constitutionality of the laws, even if the decisions<br>may be unpopular.<br><br>What people need to realize is that while they are indeed allowed to<br>freely express their opinion, there is no requirement for the government<br>to respond, or to alter what they are doing because of it. In 1984, the<br>court said, "Nothing in the First Amendment or in this Court\'s case law<br>interpreting it suggests that the rights to speak, associate, and<br>petition require government policymakers to listen or respond to<br>communications of members of the public on public<br>issues."\[2\](#jHjwQ){#cite-jHjwQ .citation_link} This is especially<br>true of the courts, which are designed to be free from public pressure.<br><br>Thomas is basically saying that people need to realize that these<br>protests are more about expressing your opinion than they are pressuring<br>a Justice to change his vote, as the latter encroaches dangerously close<br>to some violations of federal law.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What do you think of Judge Clarence Thomas complaining about the<br>nationwide protests against the leaked draft overturning Roe v.
