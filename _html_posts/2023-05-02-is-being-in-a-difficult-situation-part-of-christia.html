<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>They are not part and parcel of Christianity (in other words, belief in<br>Christ does not cause them), but we are indeed told that we should<br>expect them to come:<br><br>> "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In<br>> this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the<br>> world." --- John 16:33 NIV<br><br>Note that Christ doesn't say "in this world you *might occasionally*<br>have trouble." He doesn't say "in this world you *could* have trouble."<br>He says, "In this world you will have trouble." In other words, we<br>should expect trouble.<br><br>Paul wrote:<br><br>> In all our troubles my joy knows no bounds. For when we came into<br>> Macedonia, this body of ours had no rest, but we were harassed at<br>> every turn---conflicts on the outside, fears within ---2 Cor. 7:4-5<br><br>Peter wrote:<br><br>> Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are<br>> suffering, as though something strange were happening to you. But<br>> rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you<br>> may be overjoyed when His glory is revealed ---1 Pet. 4:12-13.<br><br>The important point to note from these references is **the coexistence<br>of both joy and pain.** This is the consistent, unequivocal expectation<br>we have been given by the biblical writers, and yet we don't want to<br>accept that joy and pain will both come to believers.<br><br>But, as the question seemingly asks, does this mean we as Christians are<br>*destined* to be depressed and victimized by the circumstances of our<br>lives? Certainly not. Paul said we are "more than conquerors." He wrote:<br><br>> Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Let your<br>> gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. Do not be anxious<br>> about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with<br>> thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God,<br>> which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds<br>> in Christ Jesus. --- Philippians 4:4-7<br><br>Clearly, what we have found here in Scripture is a paradox: this<br>coexistence of joy and pain. On the one hand we are told to<br>expect suffering and hardship that could even cost us our lives. On the<br>other hand, we are encouraged to be thankful and joyful. How can we<br>rejoice and be under intense pressure at the same time? How can we be<br>secure when surrounded by insecurity?<br><br>That is a mystery, which, according to Paul, "transcends all<br>understanding." But we are to expect confusing experiences to occur, and<br>to not be dismayed when they arrive. Welcome them as opportunities for<br>your faith to grow. "Lean into the pain" when your time to suffer comes<br>around (and don't forget, we should expect those times of suffering to<br>occur). Never give in to feelings of self-pity or victimization, which<br>you can be certain that Satan will use against us, as they are some of<br>his most effective tools. Instead, store away your questions for a<br>lengthy conversation in eternity, and then keep moving forward.<br><br>TL;DR: We should expect trouble to occur, but we should trust in the<br>Lord and "lean not on our own understanding."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
