Her case was<br>remanded back to the lower court, and her sentence was adjusted<br>properly.<br><br>While appeals were still in progress for Todd, Julie and Todd Chrisley<br>were pardoned by President Trump last week. So at this point, both the<br>conviction and the prison sentences were "thrown out."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
