<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>\"Well-regulated\" does not mean \"an abundance of good laws and<br>regulation.\"<br><br>Think of regulation in terms of a grandfather clock. A<br>\"well-regulated\" grandfather clock will keep time accurately for<br>years.<br><br>Similarly, a \"well-regulated\" militia has all of the proper equipment,<br>in good working order, ready to be used at any time. The Virginia Plan<br>originally called for inspections of militias on a regular basis to<br>ensure their equipment (i.e. their guns) were \"well-regulated.\" This<br>means \"in good regulation\" or \"in good working order.\"<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
