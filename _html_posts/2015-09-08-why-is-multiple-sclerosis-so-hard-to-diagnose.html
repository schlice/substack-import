<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Every sign and/or symptom of MS can be presented by some<br>other disease or condition. Every. single. one. There is no sign or<br>symptom of MS that is unique to MS.\<br>\<br>So in order to diagnose MS, you have to basically exclude every possible<br>condition which can cause the symptoms and signs exhibited. And all of<br>the symptoms and/or signs exhibited must point to MS. This is where it<br>gets tricky, and it requires a lot of research into the signs and<br>symptoms. A full neurological exam, MRIs, evoked potential tests, lumbar<br>punctures, etc. can all contribute to the body of evidence that will<br>point away from any other disease or condition which can cause the signs<br>and symptoms and will point towards MS.\<br>\<br>MS is also know as \"the Great Imitator\" for this reason, and a<br>diagnosis of MS is a diagnosis of \"exclusion\" for the same reason.\<br>\<br>Previously, because of this, a positive diagnosis of MS could only be<br>made after two symptoms of the disease were present, disseminated by<br>space and time. This is known as the **McDonald MS Diagnostic<br>Criteria.** Dissemination of space meant in two separate bodily systems,<br>and dissemination of time meant a minimum of six months between<br>symptoms. This means an MS patient must have had two unique symptoms and<br>they had to have appeared more than six months apart from each other.\<br>\<br>Thankfully, the introduction of the MRI as a diagnostic tool allowed the<br>McDonald criteria to be updated, and in 2010, the criteria was updated<br>to allow for a single symptom along with a positive MRI to present a<br>positive diagnosis. So as of five years ago, positive MS diagnosis is<br>now faster and more accurate.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
