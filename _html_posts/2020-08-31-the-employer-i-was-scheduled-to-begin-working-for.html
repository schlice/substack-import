<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**The employer I was scheduled to begin working for req\'d online<br>training prior to starting. The training itself said we were to be paid<br>0.5 hours for it. They are refusing to pay claiming training is part of<br>onboarding and thus no pay. Is this legal?**<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>Since you are discussing being paid in hours, I will assume you are an<br>hourly employee (these days, called "non-exempt" employees). I will also<br>assume you are in the United States.<br><br>If this is true, your employer is mistaken.<br><br>If you work, you get paid. Hourly employees must be paid for everything<br>they do, including training. There is no "pre-work" and there is no<br>"post-work" and there is no "onboarding" and there is no "offboarding"<br>for which you are not paid. If you are working, you are paid.<br><br>According to the Departmet of Labor, attendance at lectures, meetings,<br>training programs and similar activities do not need to be counted as<br>working time only if all four of the following criteria are met:<br><br>- Attendance is outside normal hours.<br>- Attendance is voluntary.<br>- The event is not job-related.<br>- No other work is concurrently performed.<br><br>If you are required to attend (as in your case), you are working, and<br>you must be paid.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
