<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The responsibilities of the stated rights have never been written in the<br>Constitution. When the Constitution was written, the idea was that we<br>had to safeguard our rights. No one has to safeguard responsibilities,<br>as they are an integral part of exercising a right.<br><br>The Second Amendment has two clauses, a prefatory clause and an<br>operative clause. The prefatory clause \"announces a purpose\"<br>(*Heller* law syllabus, p.1) for the operative clause, but does not<br>limit or expand the scope of the operative clause. The prefatory clause<br>is \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free<br>State\".<br><br>The operative clause is the actual protected right. \"The right of the<br>people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" That phrase,<br>\"the right of the people\" was used three times in the Bill of Rights,<br>and in each case, they enumerate individual rights, not collective<br>rights that may be exercised only when participating in some form of<br>collective activity.<br><br>The Court found that it didn\'t make sense to read the Second Amendment<br>would only apply if you served in a military. \"Reading the Second<br>Amendment as protecting only the right to \'keep and bear Arms\' in an<br>organized militia therefore fits poorly with the operative clause\'s<br>description of the holder of that right as \'the people\'.\" (p. 7)<br><br>The Court interpreted the meaning of \"the militia\" as all of the<br>people being armed.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
