How and why is that justified?**<br><br>All of them. But why is this unjustified?<br><br>Is it similarly unjustified when military members leave their parents,<br>spouses, and children for months at a time for the protection of the<br>state?<br><br>Is it similarly unjustified when some workers take business trips and<br>leave their parents, spouses, and children and fly overseas for months<br>at a time for the betterment of their company?<br><br>So while the apostles may have been away for longer (estimates say<br>anywhere from two to three years), is it not the same?<br><br>I know, I'm being argumentative. Sorry, I'm feeling a little on guard<br>today, that's my fault. Actually, if you're talking specifically about<br>spouses (maybe not parents) and children, there is biblical evidence<br>that the spouses traveled with the apostles.<br><br>> *Don\'t we have the right to take a believing wife along with us, as<br>> do the other apostles and the Lord\'s brothers and Cephas?\<br>> - 1 Corinthians 9:5*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
