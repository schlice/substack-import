<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*That such outrages are contained (for the time being, and forseeable<br>future) to a given region, or that there is little support for them<br>beyond those regions is not really the point. What is the point is that<br>within these regions (allegedly protected by that same Constitution, to<br>little discernable effect), through popular, duly enacted acts of<br>democratic legislation, the meaningful exercise of a substantial,<br>fundamental right is effectively suppressed.*<br><br>Actually, that *is* the point. We're talking about repeal of the Second<br>Amendment, not local repression of rights. Local laws will remain until<br>someone challenges the constitutionality, and such a challenge makes it<br>all the way to SCOTUS assuming they actually deign to look at it. Don't<br>say that this is hopeless, because it happened twice in recent times,<br>and to great effect: *Heller v. District of Columbia* and *McDonald v.<br>Chicago* have both overturned repressive local ordinances. Now, we need<br>more test cases in places like New York and California to challenge<br>their laws on the grounds laid by those two cases.<br><br>Nevertheless, to your point, we were talking about repeal of the Second<br>Amendment, not local issues. Repeal of the Second Amendment would<br>require a plurality of states and a supermajority in Congress, and there<br>just isn't that kind of support out there.<br><br>*If one takes the position that fundamental rights are entirely subject<br>to duly enacted democratic process, then all bets are off, and we're<br>always a majority vote and pariamentary \sic\ procedure away from any<br>conceivable outrage.*<br><br>Fundamental rights are not subject to laws. However, the democratic<br>position is that rights can be managed, controlled, and regulated. You<br>should know by now the classic example: you can't shout "Fire!" in a<br>crowded theater and then claim that your right to free speech is<br>absolute. This example shows that rights are not absolute, because for<br>every right, there is a requisite responsibility. We have the<br>responsibility to exercise our rights prudently, and with the safety of<br>our fellows in mind. This is exactly the purpose of law: to ensure that<br>your free exercise of rights does not impinge on others' free exercise<br>of rights, and vice versa.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Will-gun-owners-fight-a-civil-war-if-the-second-amendment-was-repealed/answer/Chris-Everett<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
