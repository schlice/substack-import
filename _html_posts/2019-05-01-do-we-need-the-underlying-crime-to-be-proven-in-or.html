<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Thanks for the A2A, [[Hazel<br>Adkins](https://www.quora.com/profile/Hazel-Adkins-1)]{.qlink_container}.<br>I'm not sure what more I can add to the other answers here, but I'll<br>give it a crack since you asked.<br><br>**Does the underlying crime need to be proven in order to be guilty of<br>obstruction? No,** it does not. Obstruction charges will stand on their<br>own regardless of whether or not the underlying crime, the investigation<br>of which the person is attempting to obstruct, is actually proven.<br><br>However, t*he presence or absence of the underlying crime* does indeed<br>make a difference, as it speaks to *intent*.<br><br>One of the elements of obstruction of justice, which must be proven<br>beyond a reasonable doubt, is that the alleged obstructor must have<br>acted with corrupt intent. This means that the alleged obstructor<br>knew that a crime was committed, and corruptly attempted to stop,<br>confound, confuse, or obfuscate the investigation into that crime. The<br>lack of an underlying crime implies that the alleged obstructor could<br>not have acted with corrupt intent, since there was no underlying crime<br>into which he was obstructing an investigation.<br><br>In other words, you can't intend to stop the investigation into a<br>non-crime, because a non-crime never happened.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
