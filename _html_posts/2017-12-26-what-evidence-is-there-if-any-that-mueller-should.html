<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Where are any details of substantive proof or even probability in<br>Republicans screaming that the FBI is crooked and Mueller should be<br>impeached?**<br><br>There is much substantive proof, but it's not that the FBI is "crooked."<br>It's that the FBI has more than just "bias." It's that the FBI has<br>*impeachable bias*. Now, "impeachment" in this term is not the<br>impeachment we are discussing where Congress removes an elected official<br>from their position. It's the impeachment that we talk about when we use<br>evidence to refute the character of a witness. It's called "impeachment<br>evidence."<br><br>And in the case of the Mueller probe, there's *a lot* of it. He has more<br>than just "bias" on his team against Trump. He has lawyers who have<br>actually represented members of the Clinton team. He has tweets from<br>lead investigators expressing extreme anti-Trump sentiments and implying<br>that they might use their position on the investigation team as an<br>"insurance policy" against a continued Trump presidency. He has people<br>with close ties (i.e. spouses who directly worked for) the opposition<br>research firm which wrote the mostly false anti-Trump dossier.<br><br>And Mueller's investigation, and how it has been handled, is very<br>suspect, despite his "well-known" reputation for thoroughness. Besides<br>his poor choice of investigators, he obtained government emails without<br>a warrant. Could he legally do this? Potentially, but it just offers<br>another line item the opposition can use against him. It's easy for him<br>to obtain warrants; why not do this? It just gives the opposition<br>something more to use in court: attacking the legality of the email<br>seizure.<br><br>However, the most important misstep in the whole Mueller probe<br>essentially means that there won't be any substantive indictments coming<br>from this investigation. Why? Back to that "impeachment evidence," which<br>the opposition gets to see during the discovery phase of the<br>investigation, and which the Mueller team is required by law to<br>disclose. This means that the FBI will be forced to air all of its dirty<br>laundry, and because you had an agent like Peter Strzok as the primary<br>interrogator during both the Clinton investigation and the Flynn<br>investigation, lots of things about the FBI and the credibility of its<br>agents will come to light, and the FBI doesn't want that. As the "the<br>great bastion of fairness and impartiality" in America, as the FBI likes<br>to bill itself, it doesn't want to be seen holding biases against the<br>people it is investigating. It would be very damaging to the credibility<br>of the FBI for Mueller to bring charges against anyone and have all of<br>this evidence come to light.<br><br>Finally, Mueller can't be "impeached," he's not an elected official.<br>He's an appointed official who can be fired. Trump *could* legally fire<br>Mueller, but he won't. Trump has Mueller right where he wants him. The<br>Mueller probe was uncharacteristically sloppily handled, its credibility<br>is paper-thin and fairly easily impeachable, and it is extremely<br>unlikely to produce anything of substance. It's best to just let it die.<br>Let the Democrats hang on to the false Russia collusion narrative,<br>because the longer they do, the more irrelevant they make themselves<br>look, and the more good things Republicans can continue to get done<br>while they're distracted from opposing them.<br><br>*(EDIT: I'm surprised that Quora users haven't figured this out yet, but<br>I'm not here to argue with you. Before you leave a comment, make sure<br>that your comment actually contributes to the discussion, and is a<br>comment on my answer. If you want to spout your own points, feel free to<br>answer the question yourself.
