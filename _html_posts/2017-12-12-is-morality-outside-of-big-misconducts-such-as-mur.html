<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is that it depends on the source of your morality.<br><br>**Is morality (outside of big misconducts such as murder or stealing<br>which are obviously wrong) just subjective reasoning?**<br><br>You claim that "big misconducts" are "obviously wrong." I would ask you:<br>by whose standards? From where do you get the "line" that must not be<br>crossed? You said it's "obviously" wrong, as in any living person should<br>understand that line. So are you "born" with that line? How do you get<br>it? Murder is illegal, so do you use the law to draw that line?<br><br>To answer your question, morality is always derived from somewhere.<br>Usually, you get your "moral compass" from your parents. If your parents<br>were okay with theft, for example, you will usually be, too. Usually.<br>Many people derive their morals from an *ultimate moral authority*, such<br>as a religion. The Christian God imparts morals onto all of the humans<br>he has created. Your morals, therefore, are derived from an ultimate<br>moral authority.<br><br>The problem arises from those who do not have an ultimate moral<br>authority. From where do their morals originate? Most (as you have<br>hinted at) believe that humans "just know" what is right and wrong. But<br>where does this moral compass come from? If the child of a thief<br>believes that theft is okay, is that not moral to him? If you are a<br>Darwinist, then "survival of the fittest" is the law of the land, and if<br>that involves killing you so that I survive, this would also be moral,<br>would it not? Anyway, this moral "imprinting" that you are apparently<br>born with must come from somewhere. So where is that source? Nature? The<br>universe?<br><br>The truth is that for those who don't have an ultimate moral authority,<br>they are simply inferring a moral authority into their own lives. So<br>basically, you're right, for those who have no ultimate moral authority,<br>they make it up on their own.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
