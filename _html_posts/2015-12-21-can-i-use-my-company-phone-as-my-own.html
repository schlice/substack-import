<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It\'s entirely up to the company you work for.<br><br>I have seen government employees being required to print out their<br>itemized call lists monthly, highlight the personal calls, and then<br>submit a check at a fixed rate per minute for using the phone for<br>personal use. Part of that reason was because those phones are paid for<br>using taxpayer dollars.<br><br>Most non-governmental companies, however, understand that there will be<br>a mix of personal and business use of a mobile phone, and as long as<br>charges are not excessive, they allow it.<br><br>However, each company that provides mobile phones to their employees has<br>their own policies and procedures; there is no standard across the<br>industry. Normally, mobile phones are managed by the IT organization, so<br>check with them or with your HR department to get the current policies<br>and procedures around your company\'s mobile phones.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
