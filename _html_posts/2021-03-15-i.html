<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I'm worried that I have blasphemed the HS because I still have desire<br>of sin but I force myself not to, and if anyone has the HS they have no<br>desires of sin and I thought, is this the D-vil?**<br><br>I had to read through this a few times to find the issue, and I finally<br>found it:<br><br>*if anyone has the HS they have no desires of sin*<br><br>Wow, really? I had no idea that when the Holy Spirit indwells a person<br>that they magically are no longer human! Man, I have no idea what's<br>wrong with me, because sadly I'm still human. My human body still wants<br>to do what it wants to do. It is still flawed.<br><br>But here's the good news: *the blood of Jesus has cleansed us of our<br>sin.*<br><br>Does this mean that the *desire* to sin has disappeared? Not at all. We<br>are still human, and we still desire to sin. Even Jesus, who was without<br>sin, was not without human desire. He felt everything that we feel. He<br>knows exactly what it's like to be human, because he humbled himself to<br>take on human form.<br><br>***His death and resurrection paid for our sins; past, present, and<br>future.***<br><br>Yes, we will sin again. We are human. We will desire to sin. But in our<br>sanctification, that desire to sin will be lessened, over time, as God<br>works to perfect us. It is a gradual process which *improves* our human<br>nature; it does not *supplant* it.<br><br>Keep working at it. It pleases God to see you trying your best. Even if<br>you fail sometimes, he understands. Keep talking to him about it (some<br>people call it "praying"). He wants to know all about you (even though<br>he already knows everything you know before you even think it). It's not<br>that he doesn't know it; he just wants to hear it from you. He wants you<br>to admit it to yourself and he wants you to turn it over to him.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
