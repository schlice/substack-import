<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Several things in your comment differ from the question:<br><br>1.  High-speed chase. In a chase, the officers do not expect the vehicle<br>    to stop, so officers are not generally looking for that. They expect<br>    the motorcycle to gain some distance (using the aforementioned<br>    acceleration) and for the driver to bail. They're not expecting him<br>    to stop, and they're certainly not expecting him to stop hard.<br>2.  Better braking. A motorcycle can definitely stop in a much shorter<br>    distance than a car.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/If-a-police-car-lights-you-up-and-you-immediately-stop-and-the-police-car-hits-you-who-is-at-fault/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
