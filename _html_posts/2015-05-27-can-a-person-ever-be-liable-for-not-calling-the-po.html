<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You are talking about several different topics: the duty<br>to report a crime, and the duty to render assistance, and if there is<br>any liability for failing to do either.\<br>\<br>Duty to Render Assistance\<br>\<br>There are very few times when you would be required to render<br>assistance. There are a few states that I am aware of (Minnesota and<br>Vermont) that require you to render assistance, and failing to do so<br>(which includes something as simple as calling 911) is a misdemeanor in<br>Minnesota and carries a \$100 fine in Vermont. There are at least five<br>other states that are considering adding \"duty-to-assist\" clauses to<br>their Good Samaritan laws.\<br>\<br>However, in most cases, most notably in states where Good Samaritan laws<br>exist, there is no duty to actually render assistance except for those<br>people for whom it is their job to do so (i.e. EMTs, fire crews, etc).<br>Some states require those with First Aid / CPR training to assist, and<br>in these states, someone without training who acts incorrectly can be<br>held liable. Some states such as Colorado protect anyone stopping to<br>render aid, whether they have training or not, and whether or not they<br>use it correctly. They can only be held liable if they intentionally<br>misuse their training or act in a way that is intentionally negligent.\<br>\<br>Duty to Report Crime\<br>\<br>As with the duty to render assistance, the duty to report crime is not<br>universal across the states. Under English common law, misprision of<br>felony was a misdemeanor. Many states retained this law, but most have<br>removed it today. Misprision of felony is still a crime under US federal<br>law, but it requires active concealment of a felony, rather than just<br>failing to report it.\<br>\<br>Five states have laws which require passersby to report certain crimes.<br>Three require reporting crimes in progress (Hawaii, Massachusetts, and<br>Ohio), while two (Florida and Washington) require reporting some sex<br>crimes. These laws are seldom used and the penalties for violating them<br>are minor, but they support the idea that, particularly in those states,<br>indifference to a person's need for help is against public policy. \1\<br>\2\\<br>\<br>\1\ Haw. Rev. Stat. § 663-1.6 (failure to report crime in progress is<br>misdemeanor); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 268, § 40 (fine for failure to report<br>violent crime in progress); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 2921.22 (failure to<br>report felony that has been or is being committed); Fla. Stat. Ann. §<br>794.027 (failure to report sexual battery is misdemeanor); Wash. Rev.<br>Code Ann. § 9.69.100 (failure to report violent crime or sexual crime or<br>assault against child is misdemeanor).\<br>\<br>\2\ [[Call 911? by Lisa J.<br>Steele](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5ed751&url=http://www.aware.org/resources/legal-articles/8-content/157-call-911-by-lisa-j-steele){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="aware.org"}]{.qlink_container}]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
