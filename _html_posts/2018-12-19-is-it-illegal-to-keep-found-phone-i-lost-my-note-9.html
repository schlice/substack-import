A guy 2 months later says he has it. He bought a charger for it<br>the day he found it. He said he had my number but it would do no good<br>since he had my phone. Is this criminal?**<br><br>In the United States, this is most definitely criminal.<br><br>Before you can keep something you've found, you must make a good faith<br>effort to return it to its rightful owner. In some states, you must get<br>the police involved if the item is over a certain dollar amount; check<br>with your local laws before you just keep something you've found.<br><br>In this case, the "finder" knows he is not the rightful owner, did not<br>make a good faith effort to return the item, and has actually informed<br>the rightful owner that his philosophy is "finders keepers, losers<br>weepers." This is called *theft*.<br><br>**You need to contact your mobile phone carrier and report the handset<br>as stolen.** Not lost, stolen. The carrier will block the IMEI number of<br>the handset (basically the identification number of the hardware). That<br>way, even if the finder tries to apply a new SIM card or program the<br>handset to be used on another network, the IMEI will still be flagged as<br>stolen and the handset will be useless. He won't be able to sell it<br>to someone else to use on another network (unless he scams them too). He<br>won't be able to use it as a phone anymore. Best he could do would be to<br>sell it for parts.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
