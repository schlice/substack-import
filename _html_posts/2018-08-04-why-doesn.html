<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why doesn\'t every state have specific laws against (with suitable<br>punishments for) \"upskirt\" and similar photography?**<br><br>The law, like most other things, moves at the speed of government. And<br>this law lags behind the technology.<br><br>When the "public place" photography laws were passed, no one expected<br>cameras to be so tiny as to be able to take photographs and videos up<br>someone's skirt (and, so as to not be sexist, up someone's kilt).<br>Therefore, some jurisdictions which have not passed specific laws<br>banning the practice have found that the victims were "in a public<br>place" and thus did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Some<br>states have found that a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy<br>underneath a skirt or kilt, but most states, to date, have found that<br>the public place rule overrides much upskirt photography, and have had<br>to pass specific legislation banning the practice. For example, in<br>California, their disorderly conduct statute protects people from<br>someone who would use electronic devices to "view through or under a<br>person's clothing without his or her consent."<br><br>But states still face difficulty passing such laws, even though it seems<br>clear that they should be able to. Texas struck down their own statute<br>against "improper photography or visual recording" because it was overly<br>broad. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals said, "Protecting someone who<br>appears in public from being the object of sexual thoughts seems to be<br>the sort of 'paternalistic interest in regulating the defendant's mind'<br>that the First Amendment was designed to guard<br>against."\[1\](#csVfZ){#cite-csVfZ .citation_link} The Massachusetts<br>Supreme Court struck down a lower court conviction under their "Peeping<br>Tom" laws, stating that the law only protected people against those who<br>would photograph them "nude or partially nude," such as in locker rooms<br>or in bathrooms, but it doesn't protect clothed people in public<br>areas\[2\](#NbPnU){#cite-NbPnU .citation_link} (Massachusetts went on<br>to craft a new law banning upskirt photography).<br><br>But as the linked article shows, while you may not face criminal<br>penalties for upskirt photography, you may face a good, solid beating,<br>and subsequent public shaming.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-csVfZ){.citation_index} [[Texas court upholds right to<br>take \'upskirt\'<br>pictures](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8c2ec8&url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/19/texas-court-upholds-right-to-take-upskirt-photos){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="theguardian.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-NbPnU){.citation_index} [[Top Massachusetts court rules<br>\'upskirt\' photos to be<br>legal](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9a1685&url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/05/massachusetts-upskirt-court-legal){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="theguardian.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
