<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [This isn\'t a question we can yet answer. It\'s like<br>asking \"is it true that white lab coats causes cancer in laboratory<br>animals?\" It\'s not a question we can answer because it simply hasn\'t<br>been discovered yet.\<br>\<br>We don\'t yet know the cause of Multiple Sclerosis, althogh there are<br>some good ideas. We know that women get MS at a rate of two to three<br>times that of men, so we know that there is some hormonology involved.<br>To what extent, and how, that works, is still being investigated.\<br>\<br>There are other factors as well: ethnicity, geography of childhood,<br>genetics, and that all-important and as-of-yet undiscovered<br>environmental trigger (likely a virus) that all play into whether or not<br>someone will develop MS.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
