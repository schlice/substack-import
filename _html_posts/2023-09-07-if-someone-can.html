<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>That's not quite how it works.<br><br>What would actually happen:<br><br>1.  You lapse on a dues payment.<br>2.  The HOA charges you late fees on top of what you owe.<br>3.  When you owe enough, your account gets turned over to the<br>    association attorney. The attorney tacks on attorney's fees on top<br>    of your late fees and the dues you owe.<br>4.  When your balance lapses unpaid for long enough (as determined by<br>    state law), the attorney files to put a lien on your property to<br>    cover the money owed.<br>5.  When enough time has passed, or when your amount due gets high<br>    enough, they will foreclose on the lien, selling your house to cover<br>    what you owe.<br><br>So you will be "kicked out of the HOA" by being kicked out of your home.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
