<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What would you classify as a "modern" disease?<br><br>Type 2 Diabetes, which is most commonly a lifestyle disease caused<br>specifically by our modern diets affecting certain at-risk people.<br><br>We used to call it "adult-onset diabetes" since it generally only<br>affected adults with poor nutritional habits, usually linked to excess<br>sugar intake, sedentary lifestyle, and obesity. However, since<br>"adult-onset diabetes" began affecting adolescents and teens, they<br>really couldn't call it "adult-onset diabetes" any longer, so they<br>changed it to "Type 1" and "Type 2" diabetes.<br><br>Type 1 diabetes is diagnosed in children from a very young age through<br>the 30s and is caused by an autoimmune response where the immune system<br>destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes<br>is more closely tied to age, obesity, genetic predisposition, and a<br>sedentary lifestyle, but the cause is not yet fully understood. While<br>Type 2 diabetics do produce insulin, their bodies do not use it well.<br><br>The only way to treat Type 1 diabetes is by supplementing insulin, since<br>their pancreases do not produce it at all. Type 2 diabetes can usually<br>be managed using some combination of diet, exercise, and medication.<br>However, it is a progressive disease, and within five to 10 years, the<br>Type 2 patient will likely also have to start supplementing insulin.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
