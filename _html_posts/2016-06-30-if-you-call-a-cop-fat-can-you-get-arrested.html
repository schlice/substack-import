<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can't get arrested in the US for calling a cop fat.<br><br>What you *will get* is a lot of attention from the police that you<br>probably didn't want in the first place.<br><br>And they may find something that they *can* write you a ticket on, which<br>will piss you off more than the cop's weight.<br><br>So unless you like irritating yourself, I'd keep the comments to a<br>minimum around the cops.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
