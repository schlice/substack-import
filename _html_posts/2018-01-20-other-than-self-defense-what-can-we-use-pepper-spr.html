<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In theory, pepper spray is nothing more than the oil from hot peppers<br>and propylene glycol (a food additive that helps to make the oil into an<br>aerosol), so in theory, you should be able to add it to your food.<br>However, the concentrations and the flavor are all wrong, so I wouldn't<br>advise doing this. Check YouTube for some Darwin Award nominees and<br>probably a few winners who have attempted this.<br><br>In practice, pepper spray is only useful for self-defense.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
