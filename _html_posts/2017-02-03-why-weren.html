<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There were very few school shootings before 1980. Actually, there were<br>very few school shootings before 1999. It just wasn't a problem.<br><br>So what's changed?<br><br>Have guns suddenly become "more accessible?" No, we've had roughly the<br>same access to guns then as we do now.<br><br>Have schools become less secure? Hardly. Schools used to be open<br>campuses. They're now tightly-controlled mini-fortresses.<br><br>So again, what's changed?<br><br>*People have changed. Society has changed.*<br><br>It's not the guns. It's not the schools. The only thing left is the<br>people, and the society in which the people live.<br><br>The way the nation has treated mental illness changed dramatically<br>starting with a program called<br>[deinstitutionalization(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e44a9c&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinstitutionalisation){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. The process started in<br>the 60s, moving away from mental hospitals and moving more towards<br>community mental health clinics and heavier reliance on medications.<br>While this trend has been good for some, it has left others with nowhere<br>to go and no treatment options. It also changed the laws surrounding<br>when someone can be hospitalized for mental issues, setting the bar much<br>higher for judges and law enforcement to intervene and recommend a<br>person be examined. This has led to far more people refusing care<br>(mostly blinded by their mental issues) and more mentally challenged<br>individuals walking free but untreated.<br><br>While some may see this as a good thing (those darned mental hospitals<br>were torture chambers), it set in motion a series of events that left<br>many people who desperately needed mental care with nowhere to go and no<br>one who could force them to go. It basically takes a mentally challenged<br>person to commit a crime before mental treatment can be mandated in many<br>cases. Fixing our nation's very broken mental health system is going to<br>be a massive undertaking, but if we want to stop the shooters, we have<br>to help them get better before they break. Our current mental health<br>system won't do that any time soon.<br><br>Improvements in technology and advances in the Internet brought many<br>together, but isolated some as well. It has only gotten worse as people<br>have become more connected and more networked all the time. It was bad<br>enough in 1999, but it's even worse now. The technology itself is not to<br>blame. The technology is not responsible for isolating those who are<br>usually considered to be on the "outskirts" of the social order. But the<br>technology has indeed magnified and further isolated those people.<br>Additionally, the same technology allows those "outsiders" to network<br>with other outsiders in an echo chamber of sorts, where their radical<br>ideas for revenge against those who have "wronged" them can be fomented.<br><br>Let's be clear. Shooters pick schools for several reasons: they have<br>"perceived injustices" and the chief perpetrators of these injustices<br>are usually found in schools. Schools are also what we tactically call<br>"soft targets." They are target-rich environments with little to no<br>security (and the security measures they do have are easily defeated by<br>someone with a little bit of time and effort). If we're honest, we see<br>mass shooters picking largely soft targets (schools, malls, movie<br>theaters, etc). You don't ever see mass shooters target a police<br>station, or a gun range. Those would be considered "hard targets," as<br>they would meet active resistance. Even so, most shooters know that they<br>are going in and probably not coming out. So they pick soft targets so<br>that they get the most "bang for the buck," so to speak. They can take<br>out as many targets as possible before they go down. Soft targets are<br>the best places to do just that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
