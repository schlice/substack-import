<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [First off, you\'re asking whether or not it\'s \"fair,\"<br>which is a judgment call by someone who looks at a set of objective<br>facts and makes a pronouncement. Each person will consider for<br>themselves whether or not something is \"fair.\"\<br>\<br>In our legal system, a judge/jury has a \"range\" of sentences which are<br>available when a defendant is convicted of a crime. Forr example, a<br>domestic violence conviction could carry a sentence of \"5 to 20 years\"<br>in prison (just an example with made-up numbers). Who decides, and how<br>is it decided, whether you get the minimum or the maximum sentence? In<br>the sentencing phase of trial, defendants are allowed to present<br>\"extenuating circumstances\" which may have contributed to the<br>commission of a crime. The judge and/or jury are allowed to use these<br>circumstances when determining severity of sentencing. If we didn\'t<br>allow extenuating circumstances, then there would be no sentencing phase<br>of trial, and all sentences would be legally prescribed based on the<br>crime. If you were convicted of the crime, you would automatically<br>receive the prescribed sentence for that crime. Without flexibility in<br>sentencing, there can be no allowance for extenuating circumstances at<br>all. Our legal system says that we can take extenuating circumstances<br>into account when determining sentencing.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
