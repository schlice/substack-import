<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The police must have a warrant to search your car. Otherwise, the<br>general rule is that an officer must have at least an objectively<br>reasonable basis for suspecting criminal activity is afoot before<br>conducting a warrantless search. This is called *probable cause.* The<br>reason is because the 4th Amendment says that the government is not<br>permitted to conduct *unreasonable* searches of your person or<br>property. Probable cause makes the search *reasonable*.<br><br>There are a very few exceptions to the requirements of the 4th<br>Amendment, under which the police can search your vehicle without a<br>warrant. Here's a few:<br><br>- Search incident to an arrest. If you've been arrested, the police can<br>  search the area in and around you without a warrant. This generally<br>  means your car.<br>- Exigent circumstances. If the police hear noise coming from your<br>  trunk, they can presume that someone in there needs help, and can<br>  search your car.<br>- The plain sight exception. If the police see illegal items in your car<br>  without moving or touching anything, this is called "plain sight."<br>  - The corollary to this is the "plain smell" exception. If the police<br>    smell weed, for example, outside of your car, this is usually enough<br>    to permit them warrantless access to search your car.\<br>    \<br>    This, however, is changing, as marijuana laws are relaxed around the<br>    country. In places where marijuana is legal, the smell of marijuana<br>    alone may not be enough to permit a warrantless search of your<br>    vehicle.<br>  - Additionally, the police can still use a K-9 to search the exterior<br>    of your vehicle. However, the police cannot detain you beyond the<br>    natural conclusion of the traffic stop in order to wait for a K-9 to<br>    arrive. This means that the police cannot unnaturally alter the<br>    length of the stop to wait for a K-9, nor can they extend the end of<br>    the stop to do so, either.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can police search your car without probable cause?
