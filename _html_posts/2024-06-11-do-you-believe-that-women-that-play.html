<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>***While I may have moral and religious objections to certain facets of<br>IVF, it is patently not "creating life."***<br><br>That's like plugging your computer into your router and claiming you<br>"created" the Internet.<br><br>Creating a life is immensely more complex than just sticking a<br>pre-fertilized egg into a uterus and hoping it attaches. Only God<br>creates life.<br><br>Again, don't get me wrong, there are indeed facets of IVF which any<br>Christian should rightly find objectionable; namely, what is done with<br>all of the remaining embryos which are not implanted. But let's not<br>throw the baby out with the bathwater...er...yeah. Anyway, the point is<br>that IVF should not be confused with the massive amount of knowledge it<br>would take to create life. Humans absolutely cannot create life, despite<br>how hard evolutionists have tried. And IVF doesn't "create life" any<br>more than connecting your router and your computer "creates" the<br>Internet.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
