Lady<br>Justice is the personification of the moral force of the justice system.<br><br>She is holding scales in one hand and a sword in the other. She uses the<br>scales to balance the strength of the arguments in the case. She uses<br>the sword to mete out punishments, indicating that justice can be swift,<br>and final. Finally, she is blindfolded (which has only been a thing on<br>Lady Justice since the 16th century), which indicates *impartiality*. It<br>conveys the idea that justice is equal to all, not influenced by wealth,<br>power, or any other status.<br><br>It is the *idea* of justice being blind that we are trying to convey;<br>the idea that justice is impartial, not that people in the justice<br>system need to be *actually* blind. The purveyors of justice (judges,<br>lawyers, etc) do not gain any value by being actually blind. This<br>doesn't mean that we can't have an actually blind judge or lawyer. It<br>simply means that someone who actually has no sight doesn't administer<br>justice any better. It's an idea, not a condition of employment or a<br>feature of the workplace.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
