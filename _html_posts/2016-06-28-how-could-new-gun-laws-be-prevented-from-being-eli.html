<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'll skip "laws which are elitist" because "elitist" is an opinion.<br>We'll focus on laws which may "reduce access to guns for the poor."<br><br>Any gun law that requires any outlay of money in order to access guns<br>reduces access to guns for the poor.<br><br>For example, let's say you make a law that says you have to have a<br>permit to own a gun. But to get that permit, you need to pay a permit<br>fee, an administrative fee, a background check fee, and you need a<br>training class (which you also pay for). "No big deal," you think, "guns<br>are pretty dang expensive; if you can afford a gun, you can afford the<br>administrative fees to get the permit."<br><br>What if your gun is gifted to you? You would now have to lay out all<br>that money (which many not seem like a big deal to you), which may be<br>too much for a poor person to lay out. Therefore, you are *de facto*<br>restricting guns from the poor. The 14th Amendment says that laws must<br>apply equally to all citizens. If a law favors the rich, it's in<br>violation of the 14th.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
