<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Laws should be clarified.<br><br>We should not be punishing the mother for getting an abortion from a<br>licensed abortion provider. The appropriate target is the licensed<br>medical professional who engages in unlawful medical practice. If<br>abortion is illegal in that area and someone licensed to perform<br>abortion performs one even thought the law says you may not, that is the<br>person to whom we should be directing our efforts, not the mother.<br><br>The laws should be made very clear that the mother is never the person<br>who should face prosecution for terminating a pregnancy through an<br>abortion.ยน<br><br>\<br><br>ยน This assumes that the mother got an abortion from a licensed abortion<br>provider. If she got a "back-alley abortion" or engaged in a "self-help<br>abortion" where such activity is illegal, she could face charges<br>herself.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
