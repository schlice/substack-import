<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Depends on the equipment you are referring to.<br><br>Most of the "gear" in the "leather" is waterproof. Handcuffs, batons,<br>pepper spray, firearms and bullets, and Tasers are generally not<br>affected by water. They do need to dry completely or some components may<br>risk rusting. Most flashlights are also water resistant, though some<br>models may have some issues in the water.<br><br>The "leather" is not waterproof. If the officer is wearing true leather<br>"leathers" then it is not waterproof and will be irreparably damaged<br>from being submersed. Even the fake leather that some leather gear is<br>made from is not water resistant and will also be damaged by submersion.<br><br>Some ballistic vests don't take kindly to water either, so that could be<br>an issue.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
