<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why doesn\'t the DMV have to follow a court ruling?<br><br>Without more context, it's really hard to answer.<br><br>But the DMV is part of the Execuutive Branch of government, a<br>*co-equal* branch of government to the Judicial Branch. The<br>Executive Branch is not run by the Judicial Branch. They are not<br>beholden to the courts. They can make their own decisions, so long as<br>those decisions are legal. Court decisions are not necessarily binding<br>unless they are injunctions of law while constitutionality is being<br>debated.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
