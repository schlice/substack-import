<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Unless you know the actual aircraft (model, manufacturer, etc), it would<br>be challenging to distinguish a military aircraft from a civilian<br>aircraft while in flight.<br><br>If the aircraft is close enough for you to see markings, you might be<br>able to make out military designations. For example, Air Force aircraft<br>will usually say "USAF" on them somewhere. You may also see this image<br>on the aircraft:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-a8d817ad59ead70ce4a8ea1497062da7){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-a8d817ad59ead70ce4a8ea1497062da7" master_w="512"<br>master_h="271"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>This is called a *roundel.* Military aircraft used these for quick<br>visual identification, allowing others to see quickly which nation or<br>alliance the aircraft belonged or was aligned with. The image above is<br>the current roundel in use by the Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine<br>Corps. We have been using roundels on aircraft since the early 1900's.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-64d03d60e16ccebcc67a8335b6a4188b){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-64d03d60e16ccebcc67a8335b6a4188b" master_w="550"<br>master_h="384"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>This Curtiss JN-3 "Jenny" has a red star on the tail, and this image is<br>from 1915. The first recorded use of roundels was the red star on the<br>vertical stab, used during the [[Pancho Villa<br>Expedition](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a1a876&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancho_Villa_Expedition){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, which was approximately<br>a year before the US joined World War I.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-62e73951b6f5c8f1dc3c0e12d4a96c79){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-62e73951b6f5c8f1dc3c0e12d4a96c79"<br>master_w="1689" master_h="1216"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>You can see this A-10 has a *subdued* roundel on the side. There's<br>little doubt who flies this pig, so the roundel is more of a marking of<br>historical and traditional significance rather than identification of a<br>US Armed Forces aircraft. Note that this roundel will also be present on<br>the top and bottom sides of the wings, for easy visual identification.<br><br>Interesting USAFA side note: during our freshman year, when we were<br>being filled with knowledge (รก la drinking from a firehose), we used to<br>do *aircraft identification*. At the time, they would use an overhead<br>projector and flick it on and off, or rapidly display and cover an<br>aircraft silhouette. We would have to identify the manufacturer, the<br>model, and the primary mission designation. So for example, if we saw<br>this:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-de1e984576a354941b024a6f00c82978){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-de1e984576a354941b024a6f00c82978" master_w="400"<br>master_h="720"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>we would say, "Rockwell International B-1B Lancer/Excalibur, primary<br>mission: low altitude penetration bombing."<br><br>Fun.<br><br>But now I can look up at an aircraft in flight and almost always say<br>exactly what it is.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
