No other consumable substance on the face<br>of the earth has been studied more than aspartame. Over 30 years and<br>over 200 peer-reviewed, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized<br>scientific studies have proven, re-proven, and reaffirmed, that<br>aspartame is safe.<br><br>Researchers have spent a great deal of time reviewing every claim by<br>people who believe that aspartame causes everything from MS and autism<br>to migraines and bulging eyes. Not a single claim of any cause has<br>panned out under true scientific scrutiny. If you do have \"proof\" that<br>aspartame causes any sort of disorder, look through your proof and see<br>if there are any scientific studies that were done. Scientific studies<br>are peer-reviewed, randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blind.<br>Those tenets of a true scientific study ensure that there is no bias in<br>the group and that the substance is tested against a \"placebo,\" or a<br>control substance. In essence, if there is no difference between the<br>group which took the tested substance and the group which took a<br>placebo, you can say that the substance did not appreciably contribute<br>to those people developing the symptom in question.<br><br>Now, to more of the scientific detail. Aspartame is a compound made of<br>two ingredients: aspartic acid, and phenylalanine. When aspartame is<br>consumed, it is broken down in the body into three components: aspartic<br>acid, phenylalanine, and methanol. These three substances are then<br>absorbed by the body and used in natural body processes, the same way<br>your body uses those three substances when they are derived from food.<br>None of the components of aspartame, nor aspartame itself, builds up in<br>the body. The amounts of the three substances derived from aspartame are<br>far smaller than you would get from food as well. For example, if you<br>were to have a glass of tomato juice, you\'d get about six times the<br>methanol than you\'d get from an aspartame-sweetened drink of roughly<br>the same size. A glass of skim milk would give you six times the<br>phenylalanine and thirteen times the aspartic acid you\'d get from an<br>equivalent aspartame-sweetened drink.<br><br>There is a sensitivity that is out there which could be triggered by<br>aspartame. It\'s called \"phenylketonuria,\" also known as PKU. This<br>condition is an inability to metabolize phenylalanine in the body into<br>the amino acid tyrosine. For these people, phenylalanine accumulates and<br>is converted into phenylpyruvate, also known as phenylketone. This<br>buildup of phenylketone in the body can lead to serious medical<br>problems, like seizures and mental retardation. Since PKU is a genetic<br>disorder, there is no cure, and the only treatment option currently<br>available is a strict diet restricting anything with phenylalanine, or<br>anything that can break down into phenylalanine. So anything made with<br>aspartame has a warning on the label: \"PHENYLKETONURICS: CONTAINS<br>PHENYLALANINE\".<br><br>Let me caution you: don\'t take my word for it. Don\'t take anyone<br>else\'s word for it either. Do the work yourself; look it up yourself.<br>But when you read the websites that tell you all the diseases that<br>aspartame \"causes,\" look for the proof. Look for the true scientific<br>studies, and then go look those studies up yourself. Do they exist? Were<br>they done to scientific standards? Were the results duplicated in other<br>studies? Were the results published in any scientific journals so that<br>the scientific community in general could review and analyze the<br>results? Did a doctor see this in 150 of his patients? That\'s not a<br>scientific study. Was a study done on all the people in the Memphis area<br>who drank Diet Coke? Also not a scientific study. The actual scientific<br>studies that are out there prove that the substance is safe. The CDC<br>researched 517 of these claims in 1984, and reported the following:<br>\"\T\he majority of frequently reported symptoms were mild and are<br>symptoms that are common in the general populace.\" This means that<br>there is no greater risk of any of these symptoms in someone who<br>consumes aspartame as there is in the general population in people who<br>do not consume aspartame.<br><br>Here\'s a few resources to get you started on your own scientific<br>journey:<br><br>[[Urban<br>Legends](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2b19ae&url=http://urbanlegends.about.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="about.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>[[Aspartame --- Sweet<br>Poison?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c6066a&url=http://www.snopes.com/medical/toxins/aspartame.asp){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="snopes.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>[[Aspartame \| Separating Fact From Fiction about<br>Aspartame](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=dda391&url=http://www.aspartame.org){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="aspartame.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>[[Aspartame Information answers your<br>questions](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b2b854&url=http://www.aspartame.net){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="aspartame.net"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>[[About Nutrition: Healthy Diet, Weight Loss, and<br>More](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9c7759&url=http://nutrition.about.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="about.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
