<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>"High-end" describes the technology, and "flagship" describes a<br>marketing strategy.<br><br>"High-end" devices have some of the newest technology in them, and<br>generally some of the priciest. Most postpaid customers will be provided<br>with high-end devices. Devices which are not "high-end" devices may have<br>older, previous-generation, or lower-quality technology in them, built<br>for a lower price-point. MVNO devices or pre-paid devices often fall<br>into this "not-high-end" category.<br><br>"Flagship" devices showcase a carrier's technology offerings. When a<br>carrier decides on a "flagship" device, they devote marketing dollars<br>(advertising, signage, commercials, etc) to the sale of that device.<br><br>Note that a "flagship" device will virtually always be a "high-end"<br>device, but not all "high-end" devices are a carrier's "flagship"<br>device. Carriers may carry a number of "high-end" devices, but generally<br>only one from each manufacturer will be the "flagship" device.<br><br>Example: Samsung invested heavily in making the Note 7 the "flagship"<br>device for their GALAXY line of phones. While the GALAXY S7 is still a<br>high-end device, the Note 7 was the flagship device. Until it started<br>exploding.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
