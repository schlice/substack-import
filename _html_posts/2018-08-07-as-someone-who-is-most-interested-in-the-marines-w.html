<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**As someone who is most interested in the Marines, what are some<br>benefits to the Air Force, disregarding pay?**<br><br>I want to add something here. Most of my esteemed colleagues have<br>pointed out the differences between the Air Force and the Marines. And<br>they're not far off the mark as far as quality of life goes in either<br>service. No one will argue that your quality of life will be better in<br>the Air Force than it would be in the Marines.<br><br>But no one explained why that is. I mean, there has to be a reason<br>that one is better than the other. Is it simply because one is a bunch<br>of pansies and the other is where the real men go? It can't be that<br>simplistic.<br><br>Of course, it's not.<br><br>It has *everything* to do with the mission.<br><br>One sentence should tell you most of what you need to know when trying<br>to figure out why the Air Force and the Marines look so different.<br><br>*In the Marine Corps, everyone is a rifleman first, and a MOS second. In<br>the Air Force, only 13% of the personnel actually fly planes (although<br>that number is changing with RPA). Everyone else performs some other<br>support function.*<br><br>When 87% of your entire service performs support functions, you can see<br>why they spend their time ensuring that they are comfortable, as this is<br>all they do.<br><br>[User-13052520144601813314(https://www.quora.com/profile/User-13052520144601813314)]{.qlink_container}<br>is absolutely correct that the one thing that the Marines can offer you<br>is that you are a Marine. Once a Marine, always a Marine. No one is ever<br>an "ex-Marine" or a "retired Marine." You're always and forever a<br>Marine. I know Marines in my area who are in their 70s now, and they are<br>still high and tight, just as sharp as when they were 30, although maybe<br>not quite as quick as they were before. If that's the military<br>experience you're looking for, then the Marines is for you.<br><br>If you're looking to hone your skills in some of the most highly<br>technical and intellectually demanding career fields in the entire<br>military, be on the bleeding edge of technology and lead the charge into<br>space, then the Air Force is where you want to be. If you want skills<br>that are virtually guaranteed to be transferrable to a well-paying<br>civilian career once you're done on Active Duty, the Air Force is the<br>place for you.<br><br>Is one or the other an "advantage?" It solely depends on what you want<br>to do.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
