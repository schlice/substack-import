<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's take this a step at a time, shall we?<br><br>> Barrons reports that Biden's Covid 2.0 plan could possibly the<br>> beginning of the end at last.<br><br>The beginning of the end of *what*, exactly? Maybe the beginning of the<br>end of the government interfering in our lives and livelihoods because<br>of a virus, but certainly not the end of the virus itself. To wit, we<br>answer the next question:<br><br>> How long would it take for Covid to completely go out of society once<br>> everyone has been vaccinated?<br><br>You simply can't vaccinate everyone. It goes against good scientific<br>rigor and completely invalidates the idea of individualized healthcare<br>and individual choice, which is a hallmark of American society. There<br>are significant questions about how safe it is to vaccinate someone who<br>has already had Covid and survived. And if you exempt them, you also<br>have to exempt people with sincerely-held religious objections, and<br>others who may develop complications to vaccines in general. Therefore,<br>you will never get everyone vaccinated.<br><br>Secondly, government scientists tell us that fully-vaccinated people can<br>both contract Covid, and spread it, so vaccination will not stop the<br>virus from spreading.<br><br>Finally, if you believe the government's scientists, Covid *will always<br>be around*. That's right, Covid will never go away. It will become<br>*endemic*, which essentially means that it will continue to evolve and<br>mutate endlessly, exactly like the flu. It will become more *virulent*,<br>which means it's easier to catch, but it will become less *deadly*.<br>Remember, the virus only wants to live (note: I know the virus doesn't<br>have a desire. We're talking about the evolution of viruses here, and<br>why a virus mutates. It is not ideal for a virus to kill its host, so<br>each new variant will be less deadly). This means that as new variants<br>evolve, they will do just that: they will become easier to catch, but<br>will become less deadly.<br><br>To that end, when you get your flu shot, you'll also have to get your<br>Covid shot, every year, if you want to not catch that year's flu or<br>Covid.<br><br>So the grand question: *when will this government intrusion stop?* When<br>hospitalization and death rates from the virus fall to the same levels<br>as influenza. Then we treat it just like influenza, with yearly<br>vaccination. And just like the flu vaccine, you get it if you want it.<br>As it should be.<br><br>> What part will the booster shots have in the mandates?<br><br>Boosters will still be a thing during the time of high hospitalization<br>rates from these initial variants of the virus, so it's likely that for<br>those who can get a booster, they will be highly recommended. I think<br>the hurdle for the government will be to find the *balance point*<br>between making sure everyone has *access* to the vaccine, protecting the<br>most vulnerable in society, and determining that people have a right to<br>declare that they simply *don't want* the vaccine. The government will<br>have to come to grips with the fact that they made pariahs out of honest<br>people who had legitimate concerns about the early vaccines. And if they<br>hope to regain the trust of the American people, they will have to lay<br>partisanship aside and do just that. And of course, this will happen at<br>the exact time that we see the pigs with wings flying around the<br>neighborhood.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
