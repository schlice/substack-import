<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Free will is crucial to God's plan for our salvation.<br><br>Human beings absolutely have free will, which means that we are able to<br>make choices which genuinely affect our destiny. The current fallen,<br>sinful state of the world is directly related to free choices made by<br>Adam and Eve, so we know that free will exists and God gave it to us.<br><br>Free will does not, however, mean that we can do *anything.* It means<br>that we can do anything which we are able to do; we can only do the<br>things in keeping with our nature. For example, I can choose to walk<br>across a bridge, or skip across a bridge, or run across a bridge. But I<br>cannot choose to *fly* across a bridge. My nature as a creature with no<br>wings means I cannot fly. In the same way, man cannot choose to make<br>himself righteous. Bottom line: free will is limited by nature.<br><br>That said, this limitation does not mitigate our accountability. We have<br>the *ability* to choose, but we have the *responsibility* to choose<br>wisely. In the Bible, Jesus says that the only way to salvation is to<br>"repent" and "believe." Taking those two actions is a *choice*. You<br>freely choose to repent and believe.<br><br>God loves you and He desperately wants you to be with Him. But He will<br>only interact with people who freely choose to love Him. That's where<br>the free will comes into play. He will forever seek you, but you need to<br>choose Him.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
