<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why does Colorado law allow multiple murder charges for the killing of<br>one person under different theories?**<br><br>It's more than just Colorado.<br><br>Most states allow multiple murder charges under different murder<br>theories, or different mental states which can comprise a murder. These<br>separate mental states include such charges as intentional murder,<br>murder through actions that one knows (or should know) will likely<br>result in death, felony murder where a victim dies during the<br>defendant\'s commission of a different felony, etc.<br><br>The prosecutor will generally charge any mental state which might<br>potentially apply as a separate count. If the defendant is found guilty<br>of multiple counts, they will be merged together into one conviction for<br>judgement and sentencing purposes.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
