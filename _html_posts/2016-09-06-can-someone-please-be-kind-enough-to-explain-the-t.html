<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, don't panic. MS is not the end of the world. It's also not<br>fatal, so for the most part, lifespans of people with MS these days<br>nearly match lifespans of people without the disease. And yes, there is<br>no cure for MS. We have some ideas, but we still don't even know what<br>causes it. MS commonly strikes people between ages 20 and 50, and hits<br>women two to three times more frequently than men.<br><br>The easy way to think of MS is to look at an electrical cord on a lamp.<br>If you were to scrape the insulation off of the cord, the electricity<br>wouldn't flow as well through that part of the cord. The wall sent the<br>same voltage, but by the time the voltage got to the lamp, it would be<br>less.<br><br>That's MS. It's an autoimmune disease which means the immune system is<br>attacking its own body. The immune system attacks the insulation on<br>nerve fibers, which we call myelin. We develop plaques, or "scars" on<br>those areas of demyelination. This is where the name comes from:<br>multiple sclerosis means "many scars." Signals don't flow as well<br>through those areas of demyelination, and it is that signal attenuation<br>which causes the physical symptoms you live with. For example, your<br>brain may tell your hand to grab something with a certain amount of<br>force, and by the time the signal reached your hand, it had degraded and<br>is now a weaker signal, so you drop things. Or with your feet, you trip<br>over nothing because you didn't pick your foot up as high as you<br>intended to.<br><br>MS is like that little "niggle" you have to live with every day. It's<br>not incredibly disruptive to your day, but it's annoying enough that you<br>never forget you have it.<br><br>There are two basic types of MS:<br><br>Relapsing/Remitting MS (RRMS): The majority of people diagnosed have<br>this type of MS. The disease course includes periods of worsening of the<br>disease (relapses) followed by long stretches of no disease activity<br>(remission). In fact, the approved MS drugs shrink the periods of<br>relapse, make their effects less, and lengthen the periods of time of<br>remission.<br><br>Progressive MS (PPMS/SPMS): Few people are initially diagnosed with<br>this form of the disease. This form of the disease may include periods<br>of relapse and remission, but usually does not. It's usually just a<br>steady worsening of symptoms with no periods of remission. There are a<br>scant few drugs which can actually work on progressive forms of the<br>disease. If the disease is untreated, 75% of RRMS patients will<br>transition to Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS) within 10 years. With<br>treatment, we are pushing that transition off by decades at a time.<br><br>If you've already seen a neurologist, that's good. If not, find a good<br>neurologist in your area and make an appointment. You're going to want<br>to get on one of the approved MS therapy drugs as soon as possible, in<br>my opinion. I believe the "conservative" approach is to "conserve" as<br>much brain matter as is humanly possible, so starting one of the<br>approved MS therapy drugs will be crucial.<br><br>There are a lot of drugs out there, but basically they all do the same<br>thing: reduce the amount of new lesions on the brain, shorten the time<br>and severity of relapses, and lengthen the time of remissions. The drugs<br>have different modes of operation (what they do to control the disease),<br>efficacies (effectiveness, or how well they work), and they have<br>different administration methods (oral, injection, or infusion). They<br>also all have different side effects. If you can't stand needles at all,<br>then perhaps an oral drug might be the way to go, but it works<br>differently and carries with it a whole set of side effects to deal<br>with. If you can stand a needle inside a pen-like device called an<br>auto-injector, perhaps the injectable is the way to go. There are fewer<br>long-term disruptive side effects with injectables. Ultimately, you want<br>to find a drug that's going to work for you and get on it, sooner rather<br>than later. There is mounting evidence that early treatment is more<br>beneficial, so the earlier you can start, the better.<br><br>And you have to consider yourself too. You are now more than a husband,<br>you are a caregiver. It sounds a little frightening (and maybe not<br>exactly what you signed up for), but you are the core of her support<br>system. Along with friends and family, and your medical team, you will<br>all face the MonSter together.<br><br>Let us know if you have more questions, and good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
