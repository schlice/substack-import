<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No.<br><br>There is also no indication in the Bible that the disciples believed<br>that the bread and the wine were transformed into Jesus' body and blood.<br>Consider that right after He broke the bread and passed the cup, He<br>said:<br><br>> I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on<br>> until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.<br>> --- Matthew 26:29 NIV<br><br>Jesus called it "the fruit of the vine," not "blood." Was He confused,<br>or did He really not believe that the wine changed to blood? The Bible<br>evidence is clear that it is the latter.<br><br>There is also no indication that the disciples worshipped the elements.<br>The Church says, "Moreover, the Catholic Church has held firm to this<br>belief that Christ's Body and Blood in the Eucharist not only in her<br>teaching but in her life as well since she has at all times paid this<br>great Sacrament the worship known as 'latria,' which may be given to God<br>alone."\[1\](#ligme){#cite-ligme .citation_link} Where is the worship<br>given the Sacrament by the disciples anywhere in the New Testament? It<br>is not there.<br><br>What is clear from the Bible is that the disciples believed, as we do,<br>that Jesus was speaking in parables, and using literary devices to teach<br>lessons, as He did so often throughout His earthly ministry. He did not<br>mean that the bread would become His literal body, or that the wine<br>would become His literal blood. And He did not mean for people to become<br>cannibals and eat flesh, or violate Levitical law and drink blood.<br><br>> \T\he life of every creature is its blood. That is why I have said<br>> to the Israelites, "You must not eat the blood of any creature,<br>> because the life of every creature is its blood; anyone who eats it<br>> must be cut off." --- Leviticus 17:14 NIV<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ligme){.citation_index} [[Mysterium Fidei (September 3,<br>1965)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=663863&url=https://www.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_03091965_mysterium.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="vatican.va"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
