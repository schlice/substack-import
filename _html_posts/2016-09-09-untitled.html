<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As I mentioned, employers *can* discriminate against felons. They are<br>*not required* to do so. So while their options for employment are<br>limited, they are not completely zero. There are also support groups<br>which exist to help convicted felons get re-integrated into society,<br>matching them up with organizations who do choose to work with them.<br><br>I can\'t speak for the whole of society, I can only tell you what<br>society as a whole has decided. Society has decided that there are some<br>things a felon should not be allowed to do, even after being<br>re-integrated. This is the cost of that felony. If people thought this<br>was unjust, they would change these laws. Some states have, and some<br>rights can be restored after a time. I know of at least one state which<br>restores gun rights after 10 years post-release. Some states restrict<br>rights for only *violent* felonies.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-thing-that-has-ever-happened-to-you-for-being-nice/answer/Alison-Mallard<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
