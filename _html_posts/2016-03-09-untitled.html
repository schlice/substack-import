<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The circumstances Rick recounted are the exceptions. They are the<br>exceptions that allow an officer to enter a home without a warrant and<br>without permission of the occupants. Those exceptions include<br><br>1.  Exigent Circumstances. If I know (or can reasonably discern) that a<br>    person\'s life may be in jeopardy, I may legally enter a home or any<br>    other private property within my jurisdiction, over the objections<br>    of the homeowner/tenant/occupant.<br>2.  Hot Pursuit: If I am chasing a suspect and that suspect enters a<br>    private residence, private property, or other location where I would<br>    normally need a warrant to enter uninvited, I can legally enter that<br>    property to catch the suspect, again over the objections of the<br>    homeowner/tenant/occupant/suspect.<br><br>There may be others in some jurisdictions, but these two are relatively<br>constant amongst all jurisdictions in the US, and in most of the modern<br>world as well (see some of the UK answers). In all other circumstances,<br>an officer must be invited in to a home, or must have a warrant to<br>enter.<br><br>That said, even if the officer is legally not allowed to enter your<br>home, it is illegal for you to interfere with an officer who is<br>performing his job.<br><br>Let me say that again: it is a crime to interfere with the discharge of<br>an officer\'s official duty, ***even if you believe, or even if you<br>KNOW, the officer is acting illegally.***<br><br>The reason for this is very simple. Whether or not the officer was<br>acting legally is a matter of fact to be decided by the court,<br>*NOT* a matter for you to decide at the scene. Therefore, until<br>a court rules on the legality of the officer\'s actions, you have no<br>right or authority under the law to deny him the ability to do his job.<br>You would be doing so without having received a ruling from a competent<br>court in your jurisdiction. This is a crime. Interfering with the<br>discharge of an officer\'s official duties is a crime for which you can<br>be arrested and charged, *even if the officer is later found to have<br>acted unlawfully*. This is why groups such as \"Cop Block\" are so<br>dangerous; their protagonists will be arrested and charged, even if it<br>is later determined that the officer was not acting legally.<br><br>Remember that if the officer enters your home illegally and finds<br>something incriminating and then arrests you, once your lawyer shows up,<br>the entire arrest gets thrown out and you walk. Then you sue the<br>department and buy a new car. Or two.<br><br>The officer is also under no obligation to detail for you the reasons<br>under which he is allowed to enter your home. If an officer enters your<br>home without your consent, your only recourse is to remind the officer<br>that you have not given him permission to enter your home, and you have<br>not consented to a search. If you are recording the interaction, make<br>sure your denial to consent to search is recorded. Once the officer<br>leaves, contact a lawyer. As Rick said, the place to fight them is in<br>court. If you try to physically interfere with a police officer, you<br>will lose. Every time. It\'s tough to be right and still be in jail,<br>maybe even a little worse for wear. Don\'t do it.<br><br>And as many of us have said over the years on Quora, you have many forms<br>of redress for your grievances that you can exercise. *NOT ONE* of<br>them takes place at the scene.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/If-a-cop-enters-your-home-without-a-warrant-after-you-deny-him-permission-what-can-you-do-Can-you-sue-the-officer-or-can-he-be-fired/answer/Rick-Bruno-1<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
