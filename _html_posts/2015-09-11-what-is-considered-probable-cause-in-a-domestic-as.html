<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In Massachusetts, the standard for probable cause in a<br>domestic assault scenario is the same as in any other crime.<br>Uncorroborated statements by a victim can constitute probable cause that<br>the crime occurred.\<br>\<br>The decision to arrest must be based on whether probable cause exists<br>that the crime occurred, not on whether the victim wishes to seek<br>complaints or wishes to testify at a future date.\<br>\<br>It is important for officers to determine who is the dominant aggressor.<br>The dominant aggressor is not who struck first, but who has a pattern of<br>domination and control.\<br>\<br>Officers will arrest anyone who has violated an emergency, temporary, or<br>permanent vacate, refrain from abuse, stay away or no-contact order, a<br>suspension and surrender order, or protection order issued by any<br>jurisdiction. If none of those exist, arrest shall be preferred whenever<br>officers witness or have probable cause to believe that a person has<br>committed a felony or has committed a misdemeanor involving abuse under<br>Massachusetts law, or has committed assault and battery on the elderly<br>or disabled.\<br>\<br>Officers are discouraged from performing dual arrests. Officers should<br>try to identify the dominant aggressor, and take action based on that<br>determination. They next should look for offensive vs defensive<br>injuries. Barring that, or if there really were two aggressors (no one<br>was acting in self-defense), the officer should determine who is the<br>dominant aggressor, and then take action based on the totality of the<br>circumstances, including\<br>]<br><br>- the relative severity of injuries and fear inflicted in this incident<br>- the relative use of force and intimidation in this incident<br>- Information available to the officers regarding prior incidents<br>  involving either party, or<br>- The likelihood of either party to commit domestic violence in the near<br>  future.<br><br>(Information taken from [[MA Domestic Violence Law Enforcement<br>Guidelines,<br>2009](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6233a2&url=http://www.mass.gov/eopss/docs/programs/fjj/vawa/dv-guidelines-2009.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="mass.gov"}]{.qlink_container})<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
