<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [On the positive side, the people who are promoted are the<br/>ones who have earned it.\<br/>\<br/>On the negative side, implementing such a system would be problematic at<br/>best, and next to impossible at worst. Every specialty in the military<br/>requires a different type of person. Not all persons who perform all<br/>specialties can be so easily \"tested\" to progress on in their ranks.\<br/>\<br/>That\'s why, in the US military, we use a combination of performance<br/>reviews, time in grade, and successful completion of required training<br/>(whatever that may be) to determine whether or not someone can advance<br/>to the next higher grade. Switching to a completely merit-based<br/>advancement system would not be a benefit to the<br/>military.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
