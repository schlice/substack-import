<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Short answer: not much.\<br>\<br>Longer answer: In order for you to have a claim, you have to show some<br>harm was caused by the expired drink. Without harm caused, you might be<br>able to bring the receipt and the bottle back to Walmart, and they may<br>credit you for the drink.\<br>\<br>If there was harm caused, you might be able to make a claim for damages.<br>So using a very hypothetical example, if you drank an expired<br>dairy-based drink and you develop a Salmonella or E. Coli infection, you<br>should save the bottle and the receipt. Put the bottle in the<br>refrigerator to preserve it at the same state it was when you finished<br>drinking it. Bring the bottle to the doctor so they can test the<br>remaining contents (if you didn\'t rinse it out, then there is still<br>residue inside the bottle).\<br>\<br>If the contents contain the bacteria, and it\'s the same bacteria with<br>which you were infected, you would have to prove that the bottle was the<br>same one you bought, and you were infected by that drink.\<br>\<br>There are lots of problems here, though:\<br>]<br><br>- There\'s little proof that you were infected by that specific drink,<br>  although the fact that the bottle and you are infected by the same<br>  bacteria is probably close enough.\<br>- There\'s no way to prove that you didn\'t introduce the bacteria into<br>  the open bottle\<br>- There\'s no proof that the bottle and the receipt match other than the<br>  UPC code, which is the same for all of that product. In other words,<br>  you could have bought the product twice: once a month before, and once<br>  currently (when your register receipt shows you did), and you\'re<br>  holding the old product bottle and the new receipt.<br><br>So is it likely that you can successfully bring a claim from nothing<br>more than an expired drink bottle? No, not very likely. But if you can<br>show harm was caused by the expired drink, you might have a claim.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
