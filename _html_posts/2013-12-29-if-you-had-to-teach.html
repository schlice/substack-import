<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [I think you can describe computers in the same way that<br/>they were described to me; using analogs for input, processing, and<br/>output. Compare a computer to a dishwasher. \"Input\" is dirty dishes.<br/>\"Processing\" is the cleaning cycle. \"Output\" is clean dishes.\<br/>\<br/>Once they have a grasp of I/O, you can start to talk about how we give<br/>computers directions.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
