<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's make sure we understand what we're talking about.<br><br>Judges do not "enact" law. Legislators do that. Appellate and Supreme<br>Court judges only determine if laws are Constitutional or not.<br><br>So if a state has a right to privacy written into its constitution, and<br>that state enacts a law (like the one analyzed in the *Roe* case) which<br>says that a woman has the right to an abortion because of the state's<br>right to privacy, then a local judge could find that under the state<br>constitution, that law would be constitutional.<br><br>If *Roe* is overturned, then it is because it was found to not have a<br>valid Constitutional basis. And that's the last word on that. New laws<br>could be written, but laws could no longer use *Roe* as their basis,<br>because *Roe* was decided to be unconstitutional. So *Roe*, as it was,<br>becomes part of history. A state, or Congress, would have to write new<br>laws providing structure around abortion in that state, or in the US.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is it possible that local judges may enact ROE versus on a lesser level<br>in their particular areas of influence?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
