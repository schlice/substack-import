<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can a company with established race-neutral grooming standards fire<br>someone who violates those standards? Yes, absolutely. This is perfectly<br>legal. So can someone be fired because they wear dreadlocks? Short<br>answer: yes.<br><br>However, the petitioner claimed that her dreadlocks were<br>characteristically African-American, and so the firing violated **racial<br>discrimination** laws.<br><br>The facts in this case are as follows:<br><br>> CMS, a claims processing company located in Mobile, Alabama, provides<br>> customer service support to insurance companies. In 2010, CMS<br>> announced that it was seeking candidates with basic computer knowledge<br>> and professional phone skills to work as customer service<br>> representatives. CMS' customer representatives do not have contact<br>> with the public, as they handle telephone calls in a large call room.<br>><br>> Ms. Jones, who is black, completed an online employment application<br>> for the customer service position in May of 2010, and was selected for<br>> an in-person interview. She arrived at CMS for her interview several<br>> days later dressed in a blue business suit and wearing her hair in<br>> short dreadlocks.<br>><br>> After waiting with a number of other applicants, Ms. Jones interviewed<br>> with a company representative to discuss the requirements of the<br>> position. A short time later, Ms. Jones and other selected applicants<br>> were brought into a room as a group.<br>><br>> CMS' human resources manager, Jeannie Wilson---who is white---informed<br>> the applicants in the room, including Ms. Jones, that they had been<br>> hired. Ms. Wilson also told the successful applicants that they would<br>> have to complete scheduled lab tests and other paperwork before<br>> beginning their employment, and she offered to meet privately with<br>> anyone who had a conflict with CMS' schedule. As of this time no one<br>> had commented on Ms. Jones' hair.<br>><br>> Following the meeting, Ms. Jones met with Ms. Wilson privately to<br>> discuss a scheduling conflict she had and to request to change her lab<br>> test date. Ms. Wilson told Ms. Jones that she could return at a<br>> different time for the lab test.<br>><br>> Before Ms. Jones got up to leave, Ms. Wilson asked her whether she had<br>> her hair in dreadlocks. Ms. Jones said yes, and Ms. Wilson replied<br>> that CMS could not hire her "with the dreadlocks." When Ms. Jones<br>> asked what the problem was, Ms. Wilson said "they tend to get messy,<br>> although I'm not saying yours are, but you know what I'm talking<br>> about." Ms. Wilson told Ms. Jones about a male applicant who was asked<br>> to cut off his dreadlocks in order to obtain a job with CMS.<br>><br>> When Ms. Jones said that she would not cut her hair, Ms. Wilson told<br>> her that CMS could not hire her, and asked her to return the paperwork<br>> she had been given. Ms. Jones did as requested and left.<br>><br>> At the time, CMS had a race-neutral grooming policy which read as<br>> follows: "All personnel are expected to be dressed and groomed in a<br>> manner that projects a professional and businesslike image while<br>> adhering to company and industry standards and/or guidelines. . . .<br>> \H\airstyle should reflect a business/professional image. No<br>> excessive hairstyles or unusual colors are acceptable\.\"<br><br>The petitioner claimed that dreadlocks are a racially-connected<br>hairstyle, and thus CMS was firing her because she wore a<br>characteristically African-American hairstyle, which would be racial<br>discrimination.<br><br>Both the lower court, and the court of appeals, found that dreadlocks<br>are not an immutable characteristic of a person, and therefore do not<br>fall under one of the protected characteristics in Title VII (the Civil<br>Rights Act). The district court dismissed the complaint because "Title<br>VII prohibits discrimination on the basis of immutable characteristics,<br>such as race, color, or natural origin," and "\a\ hairstyle, even one<br>more closely associated with a particular ethnic group, is a mutable<br>characteristic." In other words, it's not racial discrimination to be<br>fired because of a hairstyle, even if it is a characteristically<br>African-American hairstyle. The Court of Appeals concurred.<br><br>Because the company's grooming standards are race-neutral, and the<br>company found that dreadlocks are in violation of that standard, the<br>termination is lawful.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
