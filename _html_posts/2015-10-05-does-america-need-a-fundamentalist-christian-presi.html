<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The country needs a president who can put the Constitution<br>before his religion.\<br>\<br>I don\'t really care what religion the president is. He is a<br>representative of all the people, and thus is called to place the<br>Constitution above his own personal religion.\<br>\<br>We don\'t need a president that is empowered by his faith. We need a<br>steadfast supporter of the Constitution, not one who does his level best<br>to work around it, as if it is some roadblock to his success. Governance<br>by Executive Order is a dictatorship, not a Constitutional Republic.<br>Similarly, a president led by his faith is inappropriate, as a president<br>should be guided by the Constitution, not a religion.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
