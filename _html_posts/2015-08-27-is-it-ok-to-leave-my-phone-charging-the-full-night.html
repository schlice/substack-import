<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [For the most part, batteries aren\'t as susceptible to<br>memory effect as they used to be. I\'ve killed many a Ni-Cd battery with<br>memory effect.\<br>\<br>Most of today\'s cell phones use Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) batteries, while<br>some may be switching to Lithium-Polymer (Li-Po or LiPo) batteries.<br>These are very good at deterring memory effect, with the notable side<br>effect that they are not great at recovering from completely drained<br>cells. Much like the old Lead-Acid batteries we used in cars, Li-Ion<br>batteries do not like to be completely drained. It decreases their<br>useful life (i.e. the number of charge/discharge cycles the battery can<br>sustain). It\'s not a tremendous reduction, but it is a reduction<br>nonetheless.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
