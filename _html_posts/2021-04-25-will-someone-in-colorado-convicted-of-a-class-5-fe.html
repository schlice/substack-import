<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In this instance, Google is your friend.<br><br>> Stalking is both a Colorado felony and an "extraordinary risk" crime.<br>><br>> First time stalking penalties in Colorado can include:<br>><br>> - 1-4 years in Colorado prison (with mandatory 2-year parole), and/or<br>> - A fine of \$1,000-\$100,000.<br>><br>> If, however, you stalked in violation of a protective order, or it is<br>> a second or subsequent stalking offense, penalties can increase to:<br>><br>> - 2-8 years in Colorado prison (with mandatory 3-year parole), and/or<br>> - A fine of \$2,000-\$500,000.<br>><br>> You may also serve time for a separate misdemeanor if you violated a<br>> Colorado protective order -- a sentence that will be served<br>> *consecutively and in addition to* your sentence for<br>> stalking\[1\](#ANSDR){#cite-ANSDR .citation_link}.<br><br>So this means that for a first time offender, depending on the<br>aggravating factors in the case, they will probably face the low end of<br>the spectrum, but that\'s still a minimum of one year and a minimum fine<br>of \$1000.<br><br>Because stalking is also an extraordinary risk crime, he may face less<br>leniency and harsher penalties. Make sure you have a good defense<br>attorney.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ANSDR){.citation_index} [[18-3-602 - Colorado Stalking<br>Laws - Definition And<br>Penalties](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=53ac1a&url=https://www.shouselaw.com/co/defense/laws/stalking/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="shouselaw.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
