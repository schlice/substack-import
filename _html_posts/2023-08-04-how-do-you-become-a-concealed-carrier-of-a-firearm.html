<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You take a firearm, place it someplace on your body or on your carried<br>objects in which it cannot be seen, and you leave your house. BOOM,<br>you're a concealed carrier! People do this every single day in the<br>United States, and it's not difficult at all.<br><br>Oh, were you asking how to become a *legal* concealed carrier of a<br>firearm in the United States? Well, that's a far different question. The<br>answer depends on what state you are living in. In some states, you need<br>no special certification or license to conceal a firearm. If you are not<br>prohibited from owning a firearm, you can conceal one in public. These<br>states are called "permitless carry" states. Not all permitless carry<br>states also allow *open carry* (unconcealed carry, such as a pistol in a<br>visible holster on your belt). Permitless carry states which also permit<br>open carry as well as concealed carry are known as "Constitutional<br>Carry" states. Some states require you to get a Concealed Carry Permit<br>(CCP) or a Concealed Weapons Permit (CWP) before you may conceal a<br>firearm. These states are called "permit carry" states. "Permit carry"<br>states may or may not permit open carry, whether or not you have a CCP<br>or CWP. As of the *NYRPA v. Breun* case, there are no more "no carry"<br>states. There used to be a number of states which were either "may<br>issue" (and it was really hard to do so) or "no issue" but that was<br>found to be unconstitutional.<br><br>Therefore, it is up to you to check the laws in the state in which you<br>live to determine what you must do in order to conceal a firearm on your<br>person. In states which require you to get a concealed weapons permit,<br>you may have to take classes and demonstrate proficiency with a firearm<br>before the state will grant you a permit.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
