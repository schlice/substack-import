<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How was Trump able to appoint so many Federal judges?<br><br>Answer: Democrats.<br><br>In 2013, then Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid used "the nuclear<br>option" to eliminate the 60-vote rule for most Executive nominations,<br>which required that the number of votes needed to stop a filibuster of<br>Presidential nominees and Federal court judges (not Supreme Court<br>justices) be 60. With that rule gone, nominees for cabinet-level and<br>executive branch positions and Federal court judges need only a 51-vote<br>simple majority to move for cloture (i.e. stop the filibuster). Reid and<br>the Democrats were warned that once that genie is out of the bottle, it<br>will work both ways if there is a swing in power in the Senate.<br><br>And then the 2016 elections happened, and the Senate was once again in<br>the control of Republicans.<br><br>In April 2017, Senate Republicans added SCOTUS justices to the list of<br>Executive nominees which no longer needed 60 votes to end a filibuster.<br>This allowed the nomination of Neal Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.<br><br>And with the minority party unable to slow down Presidential nominees to<br>Federal court vacancies, Trump and the Republicans in the Senate have<br>been pumping out those nominations and Senate confirmations. Trump has<br>appointed four times as many Federal appeals judges in his first year as<br>Obama did.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
