<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Hardware keyloggers can be used in many instances. The key<br>is whether or not you intend on introducing the evidence obtained by the<br>keylogger in court. If you have no intention of using the information in<br>a legal case, then the permissibility of the evidence is irrelevant.\<br>\<br>First off, you should be cautious. Hardware keyloggers log every<br>keystroke, including usernames and passwords (which is what a keylogger<br>is ideal for capturing). If you\'re using a hardware keylogger to obtain<br>passwords to accounts that you do not control, and then you access those<br>accounts later using the information obtained through the keylogger,<br>this is most definitely illegal.\<br>\<br>In order to use a keylogger completely legally, you must\<br>]<br><br>- own the equipment and the network being logged<br>- fully notify any user using that equipment that their activities are<br>  being monitored and that by continuing to use that system, they<br>  consent to such monitoring. Usually, this is done through a \"login<br>  banner\" whereby the above information is displayed. Then, when the<br>  user clicks OK acknowledging the banner, they have agreed to consent<br>  to monitoring.\<br>- safeguard the logged keystrokes so that inadvertent release of<br>  username/password combinations does not occur. You\'re dealing with<br>  people\'s private information; by you performing monitoring, you<br>  shoulder the burden of protecting their account information equally as<br>  much as they do.\<br><br>Now, some flaws with your plan.\<br>\<br>You highlighted several reasons to use a keylogger. You wanted to:\<br><br>- See if your wife is cheating on you<br>- Monitor your children\'s activity to protect them from child abusers<br>- Gain top secret information<br>- Perform data mining<br><br>\<br>Let\'s break those down.\<br><br>- *Seeing if your wife is cheating* or *Monitoring your kids*: I put<br>  these two together because, as a general rule, keyloggers are not<br>  useful for this purpose. You are much better served installing<br>  \"parental monitoring software\" on your computer. Microsoft includes<br>  Family Safety products in their Windows software. You have to have a<br>  Microsoft account, as does each of your family members, but you alreay<br>  know that if you use Windows 8 or higher. If it is a Windows computer,<br>  this might be your best, easiest, and cheapest bet, since it is<br>  included. Check out [[this<br>  site](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a0c78e&url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/set-up-family%23set-up-family%3Dwindows-10){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="microsoft.com"}]{.qlink_container} for more information.<br>  If you\'d like a different, software-based solution, or if you\'re not<br>  using Windows, search for \"parental monitoring software\" on Google.<br>  These softwares log every website visited, how long the visits were,<br>  and in some cases will capture screenshots or allow you to remotely<br>  view the screen that your child/spouse is viewing. Much more in-depth<br>  analysis than a simple keylogger can provide.<br>- *Gaining top secret information:* I don\'t even think I need to<br>  address this one. Highly illegal, will likely land you in jail for the<br>  rest of your life. Don\'t bother.<br>- *Data mining*: Keyloggers are virtually useless for data mining, as<br>  the data that comes out of a keylogger is *unstructured* data. It\'s<br>  nothing more than a text file which captured the keystrokes on the<br>  keyboard. You need *structured* data to perform any sort of data<br>  mining. There are entire industries set up around data mining; they<br>  wouldn\'t have much of a business model if a \$20 keylogger could do<br>  it as effectively. If you need to do data mining for your business,<br>  check out some commercial solutions for data mining.

Not that I\'m biased or anything\...oh wait, I am.<br><br>\<br>Hope this helps.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
