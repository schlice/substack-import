<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there any scientific proof that pornography is bad for the human<br>brain, or can objections only be made from an ethical perspective? Does<br>this differ for children\'s brain development?**<br><br>Pornography is not "bad for the human brain" in that viewing it will<br>cause the brain to fail to grow properly or to fail to process, in<br>either the adult or child brain. So physically, pornography will not<br>"hurt" you.<br><br>That said, viewing pornography does cause psychological changes. I'm not<br>sure you would call that "harm" to the brain physiologically, but it can<br>objectively cause "harm" to the habitual user. I have included citations<br>to all of the relevant research. Some of these findings have already<br>been presented to Congress.<br><br>> Users tend to become desensitized to and bored with the type of<br>> pornography they use, seeking more perverse forms of sexual imagery.<br>> Pornography changes the habits of the mind, and its use can easily<br>> become habitual, leading to desensitization, boredom, distorted views<br>> of reality, and an objectification of women (and of men). A greater<br>> amount of sexual stimuli becomes necessary to arouse habitual users,<br>> leading them to pursue more deviant forms of pornography to fulfill<br>> their sexual desires, e.g., watching \"depictions of group sex,<br>> sadomasochistic practices, and sexual contact with animals.\"\1\<br>> (*this research was presented before the Subcommittee on Science,<br>> Technology, and Space of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science,<br>> and Transportation, Washington, D.C., November 18, 2004*)<br>><br>> Men who view pornography regularly have a higher tolerance for<br>> abnormal sexuality, including rape, sexual aggression, and sexual<br>> promiscuity.\2\<br>><br>> Prolonged consumption of pornography by men produces notions of women<br>> as commodities or as \"sex objects.\" \3\<br>><br>> Pornography engenders greater sexual permissiveness, leading to a<br>> greater risk of out-of-wedlock births and STDs. \4\<br>><br>> Child-sex offenders are more likely to view pornography regularly or<br>> to be involved in its distribution. \5\<br><br>So while viewing pornography does not physically "hurt" you, that does<br>not mean that there isn't a risk of objective harm to the user.<br><br>These are not moral or religious objections; they are psychological<br>objections, as pornography abuse can produce undesirable effects on the<br>user. There are no statistics to show how many users are affected. It's<br>clear that everyone is affected differently (i.e. it's clear that not<br>everyone will be affected in these ways), but it is just as clear that<br>some may tend toward these outcomes.<br><br>\<br><br>\1\ Dolf Zillman, \"Influence of Unrestrained Access to Erotica on<br>Adolescents\' and Young Adults\' Dispositions toward Sexuality,\"<br>*Journal of Adolescent Health 27S (2000): 41.*<br><br>\2\ Vanessa Vega and Neil M.
