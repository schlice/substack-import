<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Mostly it's to soothe their aching conscience. But they have to do it in<br>a very specific way and then convince themselves that Christians have<br>failed to meet their standard. Then they can continue to justify their<br>disbelief.<br><br>How this works is that they demand *scientific proof* of the<br>existence of God. Some kind of scientific test, like some postulate<br>using the scientific method, which affirmatively proves the existence of<br>God.<br><br>But of course, if God actually does exist, He is necessarily<br>*immaterial* because He created the universe and all of the material in<br>it. Thus, He cannot be material; He cannot be a part of the universe, or<br>made of the same stuff as the universe, as He created it and can't come<br>from it.<br><br>Therefore, no scientific inquiry we could ever undertake could prove the<br>existence of God, because science cannot detect the immaterial. It's not<br>that we haven't found Him *yet*, it's that it is *impossible* to do so.<br>It's like using an X-ray machine to find a plastic cup. It's simply the<br>wrong tool.<br><br>But that's the point. If science can't prove the existence of God,<br>the atheists say, then I can safely deny He exists, and I can feel good<br>about my choice.<br><br>But just because there isn't *scientific* evidence of God's existence,<br>there is *philosophical* evidence of it. And there is just enough of<br>that to convince anyone willing to believe. But that lack of<br>physical evidence provides just enough ambiguity so as to not coerce the<br>unwilling.<br><br>So ultimately, it comes down to a matter of *faith*. If you are willing<br>to believe, then the evidence we do have is sufficient to fill the gaps.<br>Faith spans the gap between the *undeniable* and the *unknowable*.<br><br>Without that faith, you can't make the leap from the undeniable to the<br>unknowable, and you reside in disbelief.<br><br>God permits this because of His great desire for us to exercise our<br>*free will*. He would never force us to believe in Him, and any proof of<br>His existence beyond what we have today would coerce the unwilling to<br>believe, and He doesn't want that. He only wants those in His presence<br>who are willing to be there. For love can only ever be freely given; it<br>can never be coerced.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
