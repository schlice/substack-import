<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In most cities and municipalities, there exist *leash laws*. The purpose<br>of the leash law is, in actuality, for situations like this, where<br>unleashed animals become provocative because they are not under proper<br>leash control.<br><br>It\'s very cut and dried. The unleashed dog is always at most fault,<br>because it is always in violation of the law. The owner cannot extract<br>much payment from you, because you were not in violation of the law. The<br>owner could not positively control her dog (i.e. her dog was not under<br>positive control) and it provoked your dog into defending itself.<br><br>In fault-finding, she is going to hold the lion\'s share of the fault<br>because her dog was off-leash. However, you knew your dog was aggressive<br>and you still chose to walk it in an area where it might come into<br>contact with other dogs. Other things that may come into play are the<br>overall aggressiveness of your dog\'s breed, other bite incidents you<br>may have had, etc. That said, you took all reasonable precautions to<br>protect your dog and other dogs, so your share of the liability will be<br>greatly limited.<br><br>A simple letter from your attorney to hers pointing out the share of<br>liability held by each party may be enough to ward her off. If she does<br>proceed with a suit, I think you\'ll be in a decent position.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
