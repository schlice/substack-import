<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: Yes.<br><br>Longer answer: Not every one of these businesses is run by a remote<br>corporate office in some other city or state. Many of these \"chains of<br>huge businesses\" are what we call *franchises*. A franchise is a<br>local business, owned by a local owner, which signs a *franchise<br>agreement* with the franchisee, the owner of the franchise. The<br>business can then operate as the franchise, even though the business is<br>locally owned and operated. The McDonald\'s locations in my city are all<br>franchises, none of them are owned by McDonald\'s corporate. However,<br>the Taco Bueno locations here are all owned by Taco Bueno Corporate in<br>Texas.<br><br>Regardless of where the business is owned, or where the ownership is<br>located, the local business must follow all state and local business<br>regulations in order to be licensed by that state to do business in that<br>state. This includes all state and local laws surrounding employment,<br>and, of course, anti-discrimination.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
