<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My \"loving, caring, Christian\" family is incredibly xenophobic,<br>racist and homophobic; how do I address their hypocrisy?**<br><br>1.  Kindly call them out when they talk/act this way. As in, "Wow, that<br>    was just a little bit racist, don't you think?"<br>2.  If you can't take their crap any more, it's time to distance<br>    yourself from them. Yeah, I had to do this.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
