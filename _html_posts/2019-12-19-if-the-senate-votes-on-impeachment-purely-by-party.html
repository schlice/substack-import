<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If the Senate votes on impeachment purely by party, how can the<br>American people ever trust the process?**<br><br>The process was broken when the House passed purely partisan Articles of<br>Impeachment without performing a full and complete investigation.<br><br>They did not vote on a full investigative panel, as other impeachments<br>have. They did it all in subcommittees, controlled by partisans.<br><br>They did not compel the Executive to comply with Congressional<br>subpoenas. They simply ignored exculpatory evidence which may have been<br>presented by those witnesses, and proceeded along hoping you wouldn't<br>notice.<br><br>They did not conduct all investigations and all interviews in full and<br>open sessions, available to all members, and with transcripts available<br>to the full House.<br><br>The process was an unprecedented partisan dog-and-pony show,<br>masquerading as an impeachment inquiry.<br><br>And if the House can send partisan Articles to the Senate, the Senate<br>can vote on them in a partisan way, too.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
