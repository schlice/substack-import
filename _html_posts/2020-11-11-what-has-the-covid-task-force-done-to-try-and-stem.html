<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What has the COVID task force done to try and stem the ten days of<br>100,000 plus new cases and hospitalizations at record levels across the<br>United States?**<br><br>What they should have been doing: *change your manner of thinking*.<br><br>We shouldn't be trying to prevent every infection, because not every<br>case is the same. And we know that the infection is far worse for<br>certain members of the population: those over 70 years old. For<br>everyone else, the virus is no more deadly than the flu. For children,<br>the flu is actually *more* dangerous than COVID.<br><br>> It still seems to be a common perception that COVID is equally<br>> dangerous to everybody, but this couldn't be further from the truth.<br>> There is a thousand-fold difference between the mortality rate in<br>> older people, 70 and up, and the mortality rate in children. In some<br>> sense, this is a great blessing. If it was a disease that killed<br>> children preferentially, I for one would react very differently. But<br>> the fact is that for young children, this disease is less dangerous<br>> than the seasonal flu. This year, in the United States, more children<br>> have died from the seasonal flu than from COVID by a factor of two or<br>> three.<br>><br>> Whereas COVID is not deadly for children, for older people it is<br>> *much* more deadly than the seasonal flu. If you look at studies<br>> worldwide, the COVID fatality rate for people 70 and up is about four<br>> percent---four in 100 among those 70 and older, as opposed to two in<br>> 1,000 in the overall population.<br>><br>> Again, this huge difference between the danger of COVID to the young<br>> and the danger of COVID to the old is the most important fact about<br>> the virus. Yet it has not been sufficiently emphasized in public<br>> health messaging or taken into account by most<br>> policymakers.\[1\](#cVQqJ){#cite-cVQqJ .citation_link}<br><br>Remember "flatten the curve?" That was our goal. Not long into the<br>progression of the disease around the country, we pretty quickly<br>realized that we were never going to overrun our ICU capacity, and using<br>ventilators as treatment has long since been abandoned for all but the<br>most critical cases. So we have indeed "flattened the curve." We have<br>indeed ensured that we will not be overwhelming the ability of our<br>medical community to respond to the disease.<br><br>Additionally, our therapies, our treatments, and our approach to helping<br>those infected have improved dramatically. Visiting the ICU with COVID<br>now gives you a 9 out of 10 chance of going home, whereas in the early<br>stages of the virus, that chance was 2 out of 10.<br><br>Finally, you absolutely cannot ignore the catastrophic impacts of the<br>lockdown, and I'm not talking about the economic impact.<br><br>> \T\he U.N. has estimated that 130 million additional people will<br>> starve this year as a result of the economic damage resulting from the<br>> lockdowns.<br>><br>> In the last 20 years we've lifted one billion people worldwide out of<br>> poverty. This year we are reversing that progress to the extent---it<br>> bears repeating---that an estimated 130 million more people will<br>> starve.<br>><br>> Another result of the lockdowns is that people stopped bringing their<br>> children in for immunizations against diseases like diphtheria,<br>> pertussis (whooping cough), and polio, because they had been led to<br>> fear COVID more than they feared these more deadly diseases. This<br>> wasn't only true in the U.S. Eighty million children worldwide are now<br>> at risk of these diseases. We had made substantial progress in slowing<br>> them down, but now they are going to come back.<br>><br>> Large numbers of Americans, even though they had cancer and needed<br>> chemotherapy, didn't come in for treatment because they were more<br>> afraid of COVID than cancer. Others have skipped recommended cancer<br>> screenings. We're going to see a rise in cancer and cancer death rates<br>> as a consequence. Indeed, this is already starting to show up in the<br>> data. We're also going to see a higher number of deaths from diabetes<br>> due to people missing their diabetic monitoring.<br>><br>> Mental health problems are in a way the most shocking thing. In June<br>> of this year, a CDC survey found that one in four young adults between<br>> 18 and 24 had seriously considered suicide. Human beings are not,<br>> after all, designed to live alone. We're meant to be in company with<br>> one another. It is unsurprising that the lockdowns have had the<br>> psychological effects that they've had, especially among young adults<br>> and children, who have been denied much-needed socialization.<br>><br>> In effect, what we've been doing is requiring young people to bear the<br>> burden of controlling a disease from which they face little to no<br>> risk. This is entirely backward from the right approach.<br><br>We need to focus on protecting the most vulnerable, but then allowing<br>everyone else to resume their lives.<br><br>So what should we be doing? Re-educating the public about the true<br>dangers of COVID.<br><br>\<br><br>*Sorry, no comments on this one.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you were simply<br>going to comment to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" then you're<br>the reason why I disable comments. Well done, Karen.
