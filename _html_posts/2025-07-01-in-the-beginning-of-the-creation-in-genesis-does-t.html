<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **In the beginning of the creation in Genesis, does the heavens<br>> represent a head and ten fingers and the Earth a body and ten toes?**<br><br>Some symbolism does equate heaven and earth as head and body. In the<br>creation account of Genesis, the phrase \"heaven and earth\" is a way of<br>referring to all of creation. While heaven is the space of God and earth<br>is the space of humanity, these spaces are not always separate, and<br>there\'s a biblical theme of God bringing them back together. Some<br>interpretations see a connection between Christ being \"the head of the<br>body\" (referring to humanity) and the idea of \"new heaven\" as the<br>head and \"new earth\" as the body united in Christ.<br><br>> **Isn\'t Eve already present in the beginning as she exists inside<br>> Adam yet to be born out from him?**<br><br>No.<br><br>Eve is a created being, just as Adam was a created being. This means<br>they have absolute beginnings. So no, Eve did not "exist" as Christ<br>existed before He took on flesh.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
