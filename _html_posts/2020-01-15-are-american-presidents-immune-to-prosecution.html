<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Are American presidents immune to prosecution?<br><br>The short answer is no.<br><br>The longer answer is that *while a President is seated in office*,<br>as a matter of practicality and as a matter of Constitutionality, it is<br>unlikely that he can be prosecuted.<br><br>The Framers understood that such matters would be highly disruptive to<br>the good functioning of government, and that the will of the people was<br>the highest will to be followed. Therefore, it's simply impractical to<br>indict a President and subject him to the legal system while he's trying<br>to uphold his duties to which the people have elected him. To that end,<br>the framers devised a process by which some elected officials (and the<br>President) could be impeached and removed from office for crimes that<br>they committed while in office. This allows for the proper functioning<br>of government, while still reserving the possibility of criminal<br>indictment for after the President is removed from office.<br><br>Additionally, the structure of the government is such that *the entirety<br>of the Executive's power is vested in the President* *alone**.* It<br>is not vested in the President and the Congress, or the President and<br>the Supreme Court. It is the President alone who is the chief<br>executive. The power of indictment *flows from the President* to any of<br>the Federal prosecutors who may seek to bring an indictment against him.<br>To that end, at least from a Constitutional standpoint, indicting a<br>President would be like a President using his prosecutorial authority to<br>indict himself. And while some may be bold enough to do so, I posit that<br>most presidents would not indict themselves. Therefore, since there<br>isn't a president who would consent to his prosecutorial power being<br>used against him, it's unlikely that any prosecutor has the actual<br>authority to indict the President while he is the Chief Executive.<br><br>There's a lot of "likely" and "possibly" answers here, because *it has<br>never happened before*. No president has ever been indicted while they<br>have been in office. This may be because the legal opinions tend towards<br>the opinion that I've spelled out here; that it is most likely<br>Constitutionally improbable that a President can be indicted while<br>President. To *fully* answer the question, it would have to happen, and<br>then the Constitutional question would have to be answered by the<br>Supreme Court.<br><br>*Once they are removed from office,* they can then be a party to<br>lawsuits or criminal indictments. There are no protections against<br>lawless behavior for former Presidents.<br><br>Therefore, when a President commits a crime, the correct remedy is<br>impeachment and removal from office, and once the government is<br>functioning in its new configuration without that person, then<br>indictment for that crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
