<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If the President is head of the Executive Branch, which includes the<br>Justice Department, why is the Justice Department arresting people who<br>work for the President\'s personal lawyer?**<br><br>The Department of Justice works for the Executive Branch. However, the<br>Department of Justice is not Trump's personal attorneys.<br><br>If people who work for the President's personal lawyer commit crimes (in<br>this case, campaign finance related crimes), the Department of Justice<br>is right to pursue charges against those men. They are alleged to have<br>set up a fake nonprofit to funnel money to the America First Action<br>super PAC as well as a \$15,000 donation to a super PAC supporting<br>Patrick Morrisey, West Virginia's Republican attorney general. It<br>appears that their illegal activity is unrelated to Giuliani or the<br>Ukraine investigation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
