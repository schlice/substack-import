<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Have you ever used a credit card? You make a purchase today with the<br>promise of paying off that debt in the future.<br><br>Before Christ died to repay our sins, Jews burnt offerings to God, and<br>on the Day of Atonement, we placed our hands on a lamb and transferred<br>our sins into that lamb, which was sacrificed to "atone" for our sins.<br>These burnt offerings and sacrificing of lambs were like putting a<br>charge on a credit card. It's forgiveness now, while we wait for that<br>debt to be paid. Those actions were not sufficient for all time; they<br>had to repeat the process every year. That atonement was not lasting,<br>because the debt for our sin had not yet been fully paid.<br><br>Once Christ died on the cross, taking on our sin as He did so, our sin<br>debt was fully and completely paid. And in order to take the sins of the<br>world, and in order to take all sin debt (past, present, and future), He<br>had to be God. Only God could take on Himself all of our sins, for all<br>time. Only God can forgive sin, because of His great mercy. But that sin<br>debt must still be *paid*, because of His justice. So only God could<br>take onto Himself all of our sins at the time He was crucified.<br><br>Including all of the pending charges which were waiting for that moment.<br><br>Interestingly, it was at that moment when *God the Father turned away<br>from God the Son*. At that moment, Jesus called out to God, saying, "My<br>God, my God, why have you forsaken Me?" God had "forsaken" Jesus,<br>because Jesus bore the world's sin, and God cannot abide sin. Abiding<br>sin violates His perfect nature.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
