<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My roommate is leaving the lease 5 months early and already submitted<br>her 30 day notice. Our landlord says she's not legally obligated to pay<br>for rent after her 30 days. Is this legal?**<br><br>Most leases in the United States have a clause called "joint and<br>several" when it comes to multiple renters. This means that the whole<br>group, or each person on the lease, is fully responsible for the entire<br>lease, and if one person does not pay, then the other person is<br>responsible for the remainder of the bill, or they can all be evicted<br>together or separately.<br><br>If the landlord is allowing your roommate to leave the lease early, and<br>you are not able to pay the whole amount of the lease on your own, you<br>have two options:<br><br>1.  Get a new roommate really quickly<br>2.  Talk to the landlord yourself and leave the lease.<br><br>But under most circumstances, yes this is legal, and you'll be<br>responsible for the full lease payment for the remainder of your term.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
