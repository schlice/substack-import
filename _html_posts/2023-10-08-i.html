<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ooo, an excellent question!<br><br>You're absolutely right, the clich√© "love the sinner, hate the sin" is<br>not a quote from the Bible. But it is sort of reflected in some other<br>verses. Jude 1:22--23 comes to mind:<br><br>> Be merciful to those who doubt; save others by snatching them from the<br>> fire; to others show mercy, mixed with fear---hating even the clothing<br>> stained by corrupted flesh. (NIV)<br><br>So here, we're told that mercy for the sinner and a healthy loathing of<br>sin and its consequences should be the defining characteristics of our<br>evangelism.<br><br>As part of what James 1:27 refers to as \"pure and faultless\" religion,<br>we are to feel compassion on those for whom Christ died and keep<br>ourselves \"from being polluted by the world.\" But we also understand<br>that we are flawed human beings, and that there is a huge gap between us<br>and God in terms of loving and hating. Even as Christians, we are not<br>capable of perfect love or perfect hatred (i.e., without ill will). But<br>because He is God, God is able to perform both of these things<br>flawlessly. Without any desire to sin, God can hate. Because of this, He<br>is able to despise both the sin and the sinner in a completely holy way,<br>while also forgiving the sinner in love at the point of repentance and<br>faith.<br><br>The Bible clearly teaches that God is love.<br><br>> Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. This is<br>> how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into<br>> the world that we might live through him.--- 1 John 4:8--9 NIV<br><br>While we can't comprehend it, it is nonetheless true that God can<br>perfectly love and hate a person at the same time. This means He can<br>love him as someone He created and can redeem, as well as hate him for<br>his unbelief and sinful lifestyle.<br><br>We, as imperfect human beings, cannot do this; thus, we must remind<br>ourselves to "love the sinner; hate the sin." But how do we do that? We<br>demonstrate our love for sinners by treating them with respect (1 Peter<br>2:17), praying for them (1 Timothy 2:1), and sharing the gospel with<br>them. We demonstrate our hatred for sin by identifying sin for what it<br>is, abstaining from it, and decrying it as incompatible with God\'s<br>character. Sin should not be tolerated or dismissed; it should be hated.<br><br>**It is a true act of love to treat someone with respect and kindness<br>even though you do not approve of his or her lifestyle or sinful<br>choices.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
