<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because God has given us the greatest gift of all (besides his son,<br>which was a pretty great gift): *free will*.<br><br>Free will is that ability to question everything, even the existence of<br>God. The ability to make choices, *even the ability to reject truth*, is<br>what makes us moral creatures, and allows us to choose our own destiny.<br><br>God has given us the choice to either accept or reject him. And in order<br>to make sure that our choice is truly free, he has placed us in a<br>world filled with evidence of his existence, *but without his direct<br>presence*, which would be so overwhelming and powerful as to override<br>our free will and force us to believe in him.<br><br>In other words, *God has given us enough evidence to convince anyone<br>willing to believe, but has left enough ambiguity so as to not compel<br>the unwilling.*<br><br>In this way, God gives us the choice to love him or reject him, without<br>violating our free will. Because if we would truly love him, that love<br>must be freely given; it cannot be coerced.<br><br>**TL;DR: If God didn't allow us to doubt him, we wouldn't truly have<br>free will.**<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If God exists then why does he allow humans to doubt Him?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
