<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>While adolescents have authority to consent to a variety of medical<br>treatments without parental consent, they do not yet have independent<br>authority to consent to vaccinations. States are working to change that<br>through legislation:<br><br>> Bills have been proposed in at least two jurisdictions in 2019 to<br>> grant adolescents independent authority to consent to vaccination. New<br>> York's bill would allow anyone 14 or older to consent to any vaccine<br>> required for school or day care entry (measles--mumps--rubella,<br>> diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, varicella,<br>> and meningitis vaccines). A bill in Washington, D.C., would permit any<br>> minor deemed by a clinician to be capable of meeting informed-consent<br>> standards for care to consent to any vaccine recommended by the<br>> Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which includes HPV and<br>> annual influenza vaccines along with those covered in New York's<br>> bill.\[1\](#oYFUP){#cite-oYFUP .citation_link}<br><br>Absent this, if a child wanted to make the case that the home is<br>dangerous, he or she would have to report the danger to Child Protective<br>Services (CPS) for the state or region, and they would have to make an<br>independent assessment of household safety.<br><br>And as always, this too varies by state. Some states specifically filter<br>out CPS cases of vaccine refusal, like Michigan. Some states have<br>specifically written in their CPS law that refusal of vaccines does not<br>constitute medical neglect.<br><br>And even if vaccine refusal does amount to medical neglect, it's not<br>clear among the states whether or not this amounts to a situation in<br>which CPS must intervene.\[2\](#Xmpvm){#cite-Xmpvm .citation_link}<br><br>There have been several court cases in which vaccine refusal amounting<br>to child neglect was decided, and results are varied.<br><br>A final alternative would be for a minor child to become *emancipated*<br>and make all decisions for himself or herself, but this is a very<br>drastic step and requires many more findings of independence than just<br>the ability or desire to make vaccination decisions, and so is likely<br>not the direction to take.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Could a child, not yet eligible for the vaccine, make a legal case in<br>their state that their anti-vaccine home is endangering them?<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice.
