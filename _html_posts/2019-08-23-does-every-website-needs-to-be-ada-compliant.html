<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Does my site need to be ADA compliant?<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>Currently, the law is a little bit murky when it comes to ADA compliance<br>on a website. Courts have been interpreting ADA in various ways when it<br>comes to website compliance. Some courts have stated that any US<br>business must have an ADA-compliant website. Some courts have said that<br>the website must have a "nexus" to a physical location which must be ADA<br>compliant before their website must also be compliant. This is why<br>Facebook was able to dismiss a 2011 ADA case in California, but Home<br>Depot was not. Finally, some courts have stated that ADA simply does not<br>apply to websites.<br><br>While the law is still all over the map right now, it's worth noting<br>that in a personal ADA lawsuit, the only remedies available are<br>injunctions which force you to bring the website into ADA compliance,<br>and attorney's fees. If it becomes a Federal case and the DOJ becomes<br>involved, they may invoke other civil penalties and/or fines.<br><br>Your best bet is to get ahead of the law and make your website<br>ADA-compliant.
