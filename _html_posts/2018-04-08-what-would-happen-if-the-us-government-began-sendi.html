The military cannot enforce state law.<br><br>Additionally, martial law only involves the suspension of habeas corpus,<br>which is the process by which someone arrested by the police be brought<br>before a judge to determine if the arrest is legal and valid. Martial<br>law suspends habeas corpus, and you can be arrested and detained<br>indefinitely by the local police.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
