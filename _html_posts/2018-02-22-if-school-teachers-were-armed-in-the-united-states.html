<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If school teachers were armed in the United States, what kind of<br>training would they need to stop a shooter in a school?**<br><br>First, they would need the required training by the county or city to<br>obtain a concealed carry permit. This includes background checks,<br>fingerprinting, and specialized concealed carry training. There are many<br>private institutions which offer concealed carry training, and each<br>state and county has different requirements for training. My county<br>accepted my DD-214 as proof of weapons training (discharge from military<br>service). Your DD-214 must have been from within five years. My county<br>also accepts your military ID card if you're active. Our county also<br>requires knowledge of liability laws, the "Make My Day" law, and others.<br><br>So depending on where you live, your concealed carry permit requirements<br>may cover most of the things you would need to know.<br><br>See [[John<br>B.](https://www.quora.com/profile/John-B-2083)]{.qlink_container}'s<br>answer for more details about which specific things you should know as a<br>teacher getting a permit. If your concealed carry training doesn't cover<br>all of those items, you should separately seek those trainings.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
