<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think the question we would need to answer is why.<br><br>If you intend to be married and to stay together, why not have a<br>ceremony? Sure, there may be situations where a ceremony is either<br>impractical or some other legal or social situation keeps people from<br>actually getting married. I would strongly suggest you fix that issue<br>first, and then get married.<br><br>The truth of the matter is that you make a vow *not only* before God,<br>but you make that vow *in front of family and friends*. Why are family<br>and friends important to be present at a wedding? If you have only made<br>a private commitment but not a public one, it can appear as an ungodly<br>relationship to others.<br><br>> The wedding ceremony served many purposes, including letting people<br>> know who was married to whom, avoiding appearances of evil and<br>> accusations of adultery (2 Sam. 3:7 and 8), maintaining proper order<br>> and behavior in society, providing a time for the relatives to get to<br>> know each other (which was very important since many marriages were<br>> really about power and economics--1 Kings 3:1), and providing memories<br>> that would be a blessing throughout the marriage, especially for the<br>> bride (Jer. 2:32). These things are still important in our modern<br>> society\[1\](#nfzPv){#cite-nfzPv .citation_link}<br><br>People also reject Christianity because they think Christians are<br>hypocrites, but the marriage ceremony lets everyone know publicly of<br>your intent to live together as husband and wife, and that you are also<br>honoring God's instructions on the sanctity of the marriage union<br>between a man and his wife.<br><br>There are several other reasons I can think of:<br><br>- Accountability. While I don't doubt your sincerity, it is<br>  certainly true that couples who are not formally married can walk away<br>  from that vow much more easily. A couple who is not formally married<br>  has an "easy out" and they usually take it.<br>- Legal issues. If you are not legally married, there are issues<br>  related to government functions which may not be resolved, such as<br>  taxes, spousal privilege with relation to healthcare decisions, and<br>  transfer of real property.<br>- Generational issues. There could be some legal issues regarding<br>  generativity (determining the "family tree" of children) if you don't<br>  have a legal marriage in place.<br><br>It is for these reasons that I think private ceremonies are unwise.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-nfzPv){.citation_index} [[Do Christians need to be married<br>by a minister? \| Spirit &<br>Truth](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3dea97&url=https://spiritandtruthonline.org/do-christians-need-to-be-married-by-a-minister-or-can-we-just-commit-to-each-other-privately-in-gods-sight/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="spiritandtruthonline.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
