<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Does a high IQ score stop you from being a police officer?<br><br>Think logically about this for a second. If you found out that your<br>local police department was giving simple IQ tests to candidates (not<br>police entrance exams) and were summarily rejecting anyone who scored<br>over some arbitrarily high score, would you be happy with the employment<br>practices of your local police department? Would you not complain to<br>City Hall?<br><br>I know I certainly would.<br><br>I want my police department to hire the smartest people they can get,<br>who can exercise the most sound judgement when it comes to all manner of<br>activity they must perform.<br><br>In fact, police departments have no idea what your IQ is. They don't<br>give an IQ test to join the department. They give a state-standardized<br>general knowledge test. Each state's standardized police entrance exam<br>is different, but all states give one.<br><br>You can ace that test and you are moved on in the selection process just<br>as easily as someone who barely passes.<br><br>The selection process is more than just a test. Much, much more.<br><br>And yes, it is true that one small department in Connecticut more than<br>20 years ago was sued because they disqualified a candidate using a high<br>IQ as the reason. But this case has never been repeated in any other of<br>the over 18,000 police agencies across the country in any of the<br>intervening years since. This case is the exception rather than the<br>rule.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
