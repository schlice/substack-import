<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*We\'ve seen recent video that leaves the reasonable citizen to question<br>Police reason*<br><br>First of all, you've only seen a video, which is usually a little<br>snippet of time. It usually doesn't show the extent of the interaction.<br>It rarely shows the lead-up to the officer making the decision that<br>deadly force is authorized. The video is not the end-all, be-all of<br>evidence. The camera does not "see" everything, it only sees what is<br>right in front of the officer. There are still things that happen on the<br>sides, or behind, that you never see. Generally, you only see an officer<br>applying deadly force. That's it. You don't see anything that happened<br>before. Essentially, the camera does not tell the whole story.<br><br>*We were lucky to see these videos; Police certainly have shown no<br>initiative to turn over this type of evidence in asking for public<br>critique.*<br><br>Yes, you were lucky. Normally, that video is what we call evidence<br>and the only people who are *required* to see that video, who are<br>*supposed* to see that video, are a judge and a jury. Unless you're<br>sitting on the jury, **you have no right to see that video. YOU ARE NOT<br>THE JUDGE, NOR ARE YOU THE JURY!** While you may think that the "court<br>of public opinion" is a valid place to try an officer for his actions,<br>while this nation is still a nation of laws (barely), everyone in this<br>country, including police officers, is still afforded a trial by a jury<br>of their peers, not a trial by YouTube comments and upvotes.<br><br>Someone wanted their 15 seconds of fame, so they posted a snippet of a<br>video on YouTube. In the grand scheme of things, that video is<br>completely and totally irrelevant. It might get submitted as<br>evidence, but a defense attorney would have a field day tearing the<br>authenticity of the video apart. We don't know if it had been edited; we<br>don't know what parts of that video had been cut out to make it look<br>like the cop shot someone without provocation. That video could be<br>highly inflammatory, and may never be shown to a jury. But again, it's<br>irrelevant. All it does is spin people like you up, and goad them into<br>thinking that police are mindless killers that we've loosed onto an<br>unsuspecting society, while statistics tell us otherwise.<br><br>What's more important is that the district attorney has enough evidence<br>to review to make a decision about whether or not the officer committed<br>a crime. The video speaks to *a very small part* of that body of<br>evidence that the prosecutor uses to determine whether or not a crime<br>has been committed and whether or not he would seek to charge the<br>officer with one.<br><br>It's also clear that you believe officers are somehow above the law and<br>never face scrutiny for their actions. If you shot someone, your actions<br>would be reviewed by the District Attorney who would determine whether<br>or not you committed a crime. If a police officer shoots someone, not<br>only will his actions face the same scrutiny by the DA, the department<br>will conduct a "Use of Force Review" (UOF Review), as they do for<br>*every* use of force by a police officer. Use of force could be<br>anything from application of hands to pepper spray, baton, TASER, or<br>deadly force applications such as baton or firearm. That UOF Review<br>panel is made up of department senior staff, the officer's chain of<br>command, the department's legal team, and the department's training<br>staff. The review will focus on the officer's use of force and determine<br>if it was correctly employed, and whether or not it met department<br>policy for application of force. If not, they will determine if the<br>officer needs re-training in any area of employment of force, or if the<br>officer should face disciplinary actions, up to and including<br>termination. Depending on department, there can be civilians present in<br>UOF Review Boards to observe the proceedings, or there may be a civilian<br>oversight committee appointed by the Mayor which reviews the facts and<br>determinations of the department's UOF Reviews, to ensure that<br>departments are conducting them fairly and not allowing officers to "get<br>away with murder," so to speak. Finally, officers may now face a third<br>avenue of investigations, which are becoming more and more common these<br>days: the US Department of Justice may also conduct an independent<br>review of officer actions to determine whether or not the suspect's<br>civil rights were violated.<br><br>So as you can see, not only are officers *highly* scrutinized any<br>time they employ force, but there are civilians present at every level<br>of that investigation (the DA, the civilians overseeing the UOF Review<br>Board, and the lawyers at the DOJ) who ensure that the police are not<br>ignoring bad officers or summarily excusing their actions.<br><br>It appears, based on the differences in investigations between civilians<br>and police, that many people have asked the same questions as you, over<br>many years. The high level of scrutiny applied to police officers, and<br>the presence of civilians at every level of those investigations, would<br>lead the "reasonable man" to believe that police actions are very well<br>reviewed, and police officers can get away with very little in today's<br>society. If officers lack the required training, they get re-trained. If<br>they willingly abuse the law, they are either arrested and charged, or<br>they are fired, or both.<br><br>*\N\ot only has this citizen seen these practices play out<br>\'unreasonably\' in real time, most troubling of all, he\'s seen Police<br>continuously absolve their own of \*wrongdoing (\*another vague and<br>highly subject concept).*<br><br>There are over 17,000 police departments in the United States, at both<br>the state and local level. Most departments have their shit together and<br>conduct themselves ethically. But there have been plenty of examples of<br>police departments that have grown so large and unwieldy that corruption<br>has seeped in, and they end up with two modes of operation: "the way<br>things are supposed to be done" and "the way things are done in real<br>life" and those two don't match up. Your own anecdotal evidence aside, I<br>don't find it surprising at all that some departments have issues.<br><br>But rather than me trying to tell you what *should* be done, I want you<br>to go fix it. How? I want you to take your issues to the civilian<br>governmental body which oversees that police department. If it's a city<br>police department, go to City Council or the Mayor. If it's a County, go<br>to the Board of Commissioners. If it's a state police department, speak<br>to your representative in your state's Congress. Get yourself on the<br>citizen review boards which review UOF cases. If they don't have one,<br>force them to make one. Get involved. ***Be the change you want to see<br>in the world.*** Don't just go out and prattle on about what needs to<br>change; that accomplishes little. Go out and *be the change!*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-police-made-their-first-three-shots-non-lethal-and-loaded-them-with-rubber-bullets-It-seems-like-most-bad-shootings-are-one-or-two-shots-In-cases-where-police-have-to-actually-stop-a-threat-they-just-keep-firing-anyways/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
