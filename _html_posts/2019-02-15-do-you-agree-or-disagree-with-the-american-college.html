<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you agree or disagree with the American College of Pediatricians<br>when they say that human life starts at conception?**<br><br>Yes.<br><br>But that doesn't mean that we can't destroy it.<br><br>If we are all going to be honest with ourselves, then we must all also<br>be hones about the fact that a zygote is the *beginning* of a phase in a<br>human life. It is a unique human life form.<br><br>But we must also be honest with ourselves about the fact that it cannot<br>survive outside of the mother's womb.<br><br>Therefore, it is asinine silliness when we start talking about death<br>certificates for miscarriages and criminal charges for unlawful disposal<br>of a body after a miscarriage, or inability to do IVF because the zygote<br>is "legally alive" before it is inserted into the uterus.<br><br>We can say that the zygote represents a fully-realized life form *while<br>at the same time* recognizing that it is fully unviable outside of a<br>woman's womb and can't be protected as a human life until it is viable<br>outside of the womb.<br><br>We've shown that fetuses as young as 24 weeks are viable outside of the<br>womb.<br><br>Destroying life after that point should not be done lightly. Or out of<br>convenience.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
