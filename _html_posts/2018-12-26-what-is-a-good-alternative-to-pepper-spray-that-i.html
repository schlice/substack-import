<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is a good alternative to pepper spray that I can take to school<br>(high school)?**<br><br>Thank you for clarifying that you mean high school.<br><br>The answer is "whatever your high school does not already prohibit." And<br>it's a fair bet that they prohibit quite a lot.<br><br>Take a look through the list of items that [[Bryan<br>Potratz](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-good-alternative-to-pepper-spray-that-I-a-17-y-o-4-10-girl-can-take-to-school-high-school/answer/BP-397)]{.qlink_container}<br>posted and see if there is anything in there you might be able to use.<br>Part of the problem is that any time you use a "something" to defend<br>yourself, you face civil charges based on your own use of force, even if<br>you were justified in doing so. So if you spray someone in the eyes with<br>ammonia cleaner and they go blind, you could be sued for excessive use<br>of force. You must be really, really careful when using anything to<br>defend yourself. That's why pepper spray is such a good alternative: it<br>provides very good stopping power without causing permanent damage to<br>the target.<br><br>But as some of the other answerers hinted to, the fact that you have to<br>ask this question in the first place is worrisome at best. You're<br>essentially saying that you do not feel safe in your school, and that's<br>a problem.<br><br>What you *really* need to be doing is taking this feeling to your<br>school's administration. When the school does not provide a "safe and<br>nurturing" environment for their students, they have essentially failed<br>at their mission. It can't just be an environment in which you are<br>physically safe, but one in which you feel safe.<br><br>Talk to your parents and bring this up with the school. If you get no<br>joy with the school, have your parents help you to take this above the<br>school's head to the District level. Go as high as you need to in order<br>to make sure someone addresses your concerns about safety.<br><br>If you tried to get relief from the school and they refused to help, my<br>next best advice is to break the rules and bring pepper spray with you<br>anyway. That's right, I'm advising you to break the rules. If you are<br>going to use a self-defense spray, pepper spray is the one to use. It's<br>powerful enough to stop a high schooler without causing permanent<br>damage. And rather than facing legal trouble from excessive use of<br>force, you'll only be facing school disciplinary trouble for bringing a<br>pepper spray to school. Meh, if the school can't help you feel safe, I'm<br>sure their punishments are anemic too. Make sure your parents are fully<br>on board with this, so that when the school calls and says you were<br>given two weeks of out-of-school suspension for bringing a pepper spray<br>to school, they won't freak out. But remember, this is only after you've<br>tried to get the school to fix their problems first and they didn't<br>listen.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
