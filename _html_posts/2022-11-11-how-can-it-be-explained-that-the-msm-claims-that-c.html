Assaults were up as well, by almost 10%. And the<br>increases were even across both red and blue states. The number of<br>murders was also up:<br><br>> Relative to 2019, the number of murders jumped by more than 30 percent<br>> in the largest cities and by 20 percent in places designated by the<br>> FBI as "suburban" --- cities with fewer than 50,000 inhabitants that<br>> are within a Metropolitan Statistical Area. Murders rose by comparable<br>> levels in rural areas too --- an important fact that is only now<br>> beginning to receive press attention.\[1\](#lsDxe){#cite-lsDxe<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>However, other types of crime were *down*. Property crimes reached a<br>record *low* in 2020. There could be many reasons for this, but<br>lockdowns and people losing their jobs (thus spending more time at home)<br>could be a contributing factor.<br><br>None of this changes the fact that *overall crime has been declining for<br>the past decade.*<br><br>TL;DR: ¿Por qué no los dos? Overall crime is indeed down over the<br>last decade, while murders are up almost 30% in 2020.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-lsDxe){.citation_index} [[Myths and Realities:<br>Understanding Recent Trends in Violent<br>Crime](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a37252&url=https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/myths-and-realities-understanding-recent-trends-violent-crime){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="brennancenter.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
