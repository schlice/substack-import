<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If Trump is pardoned by Pence, can the State of New York prosecute him<br>for crimes committed there?**<br><br>Currently, yes they can.<br><br>However, there is a case that is going to be heard by SCOTUS during this<br>term. In *Gamble v. United States*, the Supreme Court is considering<br>whether the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which<br>prohibits any person from being prosecuted for the same offense more<br>than once, bars a federal prosecution for a criminal offense when the<br>defendant has already been prosecuted for the same offense in state<br>court.\[1\](#AbljU){#cite-AbljU .citation_link}<br><br>Currently, the theory of *dual sovereignty* governs the federal vs state<br>exemption to double jeopardy. The Federal government and the state, as<br>sovereign entities, can both define a crime separately, and even if it<br>refers to the exact same occurrence, can both prosecute that crime<br>separately, and it does not violate the double jeopardy clause.<br><br>If SCOTUS rules in favor of Gamble, the dual sovereignty rule would be<br>overturned. If a crime is prosecuted in a state court, the Federal<br>government could not prosecute that person for the same crime at a<br>Federal level. If a crime is prosecuted at the Federal level, a state<br>could not prosecute for that same crime. And if the military prosecutes<br>a crime under UCMJ, the Federal government would not be able to<br>prosecute the same crime when the military is done.<br><br>Now, back to the question. We're assuming that Trump is impeached,<br>removed from office, subsequently indicted in a Federal court, and<br>convicted, and President Pence pardons him. If dual sovereignty is ruled<br>unconstitutional, then the pardon would prevent New York from<br>prosecuting Trump for the same crime. Just because it's illegal under<br>both Federal and state law would not allow New York to prosecute for the<br>same crime. If dual sovereignty remains in effect, then a Federal pardon<br>would not prevent New York from filing charges for the same crime under<br>New York law.<br><br>One conspiracy theory alleges that this is why Republicans pushed so<br>hard to get Kavanaugh on the court: because he'd be the tipping point<br>ruling for Gamble, and then this very chain of events would take place.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-AbljU){.citation_index} [[Gamble v.
