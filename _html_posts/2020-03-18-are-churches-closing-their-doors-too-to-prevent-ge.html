At least one church in most towns has had their Sunday<br>services televised for quite a long time.<br><br>These days, most churches already offer online recordings of their<br>services, and have been doing so for some time now. Some even live<br>stream their entire service. Therefore, in most cases, it was quite a<br>simple thing to just hold Sunday services virtually instead of<br>physically.<br><br>This past Sunday, we attended services online. No one was in the worship<br>center except the worship team themselves.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
