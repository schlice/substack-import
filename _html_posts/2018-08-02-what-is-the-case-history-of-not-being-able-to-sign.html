<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the case history of not being able to sign away your<br>constitutional rights?**<br><br>I think what you're referring to is "unalienable rights," which are not<br>mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. They are listed in the<br>Declaration of Independence:<br><br>> We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created<br>> equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable<br>> Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of<br>> Happiness....<br><br>This understanding is part of what led to the formation of the Bill of<br>Rights: a guarantee that the government would never infringe on these<br>"unalienable rights."<br><br>Also part of that understanding is what "unalienable" means vs<br>"inalienable."<br><br>Inalienable means a right which you cannot be compelled to alienate.<br>It's a right which is "not subject to alienation," but could potentially<br>be signed away yourself.<br><br>Unalienable means *even if you wanted to*, you cannot alienate yourself<br>of that right.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
