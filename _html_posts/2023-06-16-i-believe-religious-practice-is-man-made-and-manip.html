<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So here's a question. Do you believe in the Bible?<br><br>If so, you are a Protestant. The Protestants separated from the Roman<br>Catholic Church in the 16th century. Protestants have five core beliefs:<br><br>1.  *Sola Scriptura*. Scripture alone.<br>2.  *Solus Christus.* Christ alone.<br>3.  *Sola fide*. Faith alone.<br>4.  *Sola gratia.* Grace alone.<br>5.  *Soli Deo gloria.* Glory to God alone.<br><br>The description of these distinctives, from our friends at The Gospel<br>Coalition:<br><br>> *Sola scriptura* is the belief that because Scripture is God's<br>> inspired Word, it is the only inerrant, sufficient, and final<br>> authority for the church. *Solus Christus* is the assertion that<br>> Christ alone is the basis on which the ungodly are justified in God's<br>> sight. *Sola fide* maintains that the believer receives the redemption<br>> Christ has accomplished only through faith. *Sola gratia* proclaims<br>> that *all* of our salvation, from beginning to end, is by grace and<br>> grace alone. Because of these things, the Reformers held fast to the<br>> phrase s*oli Deo gloria,* that only God receives glory for our<br>> salvation.\[1\](#YoSgd){#cite-YoSgd .citation_link}<br><br>We believe that other religions, which may share some of these core<br>beliefs, have "gone off the rails" somewhere in their journey, and have<br>abandoned some of these for other beliefs. We believe those faiths are<br>therefore practicing an unbiblical version of Christianity.<br><br>Welcome to the club. We have donuts and coffee.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-YoSgd){.citation_index} [[The Five Solas - The Gospel<br>Coalition](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=581ff0&url=https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/essay/the-five-solas/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="thegospelcoalition.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
