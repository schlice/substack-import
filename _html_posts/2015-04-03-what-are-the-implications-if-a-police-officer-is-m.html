<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [This is also why EVERY member of a tactical entry team<br>will be sounding off with \"Police! Search warrant!\" during a warranted<br>entry. Their entry is very loud, and it is generally very difficult to<br>prove that you didn\'t know that it was the police entering, as all of<br>them were yelling \"Police! Search warrant!\"\<br>\<br>The only time this does not happen is during a \"no-knock warrant\" and<br>those are very judiciously granted, knowing the significant danger that<br>it puts everyone involved in. \"No-knock warrants\" are the ones in<br>which the police do not do what I said in the last paragraph. They enter<br>without announcing their presence first. No knocking, no announcing<br>their presence, no identifying. No-knock warrants are used in situations<br>where the police are attempting to stop someone from fleeing or<br>destroying evidence, so stealth and rapid forced entry are key.\<br>\<br>The intersection of the no-knock warrant and the castle doctrine is a<br>dangerous intersection, indeed.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
