This means it can be "accurate"<br>while still having factual inconsistencies. Both of those can be true.<br><br>Finally, can the President lie to Congress? Unless he's under oath in a<br>court of law, yes he can.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
