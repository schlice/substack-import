<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Will Lindsey Graham support articles of impeachment based off of his<br>argument that it's about restoring honor and integrity to the office and<br>it's not based off of committing any specific crime?**<br><br>Only if he's keen on turning the impeachment process into little more<br>than a Congressional censure.<br><br>Weaken impeachments by impeaching actions which are not "high crimes and<br>misdemeanors" and impeachments become meaningless. The Senate would<br>never vote to remove a president from office in order to "maintain the<br>honor and integrity of the office" even if it was fully controlled by<br>the opposing party.<br><br>We don't impeach presidents because we don't like them. We already have<br>a Constitutional process to remove presidents we don't like: **don't<br>re-elect them**. Every four or eight years, the political power in this<br>country changes hands seamlessly and without bloodshed. We've been doing<br>it for hundreds of years.<br><br>Impeaching someone because you don't think he's "honorable" or upholds<br>the integrity which you (unilaterally) have decided the office *should*<br>hold is not a valid use of the impeachment process. You either don't<br>elect him, or you don't re-elect him.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
