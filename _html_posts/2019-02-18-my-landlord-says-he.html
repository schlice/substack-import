<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My landlord says he's charging me extra next month because I often<br>bring guests over to my apartment. Could he do this if it wasn't on the<br>lease?**<br><br>In general, a landlord can't change the amount of your lease payment<br>without signing a new lease with you, or a *lease addendum* which again,<br>you both must agree to.<br><br>Unless there is some clause in your lease agreement which allows the<br>landlord to charge you for guests, then usually he can't change the<br>monthly rent amount without changing the lease itself.<br><br>If you have a month-to-month rental agreement instead of a full lease,<br>the landlord can change the rent every month.<br><br>You might advise your landlord that he probably can't charge you more<br>without amending your lease. Assuming you're a good tenant (you always<br>pay on time, you don't break things, you don't cause other trouble,<br>etc), you should be able to use that to your advantage when you talk to<br>your landlord.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
