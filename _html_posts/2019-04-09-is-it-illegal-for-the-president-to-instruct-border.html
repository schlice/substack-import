<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it illegal for the President to instruct Border Patrol Agents to<br>break the law?**<br><br>No, it's not illegal to tell someone to break the law.<br><br>In fact, go rob a bank. Right now, go rob a bank.<br><br>See? I just told you to break the law. Was that illegal for me to do?<br>No, certainly not.<br><br>But would it still be illegal for you to rob a bank? Indeed it would,<br>even if I told you to do it.<br><br>If you read the article (and not just the headline), you'd see that the<br>President was expressing his frustration with the problems at our<br>southern border. While he'd "like" for agents to just unilaterally close<br>the border and change immigration policy, they know they can't do that.<br>They know they have to follow the law, which they continue to do.<br><br>Trump expresses the things that we all think. But not even he can order<br>someone to break the law.<br><br>We in the military know this as well. You are under no obligation to<br>obey an illegal order. If my commander told me to go into that village<br>and kill everyone, including the women and children, I could rightly<br>refuse to follow that order, and I wouldn't be insubordinate in doing<br>so.<br><br>There's no penalty for the officer issuing the illegal order. But<br>there's also no penalty for me in not following it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
