<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can the GOP officially exclude Trump from the party and deny him the<br>party affiliation for future purposes, so that he would have to run as<br>an independent or for another party in the future?**<br><br>They can\'t declare that Trump is not allowed to run again as a<br>Republican.<br><br>They *can* refuse to nominate him as the party\'s nominee for president.<br><br>Anyone can run, and seek the party\'s nomination. The party can choose<br>who they are going to nominate. There is no mandatory process which any<br>one party must follow in order to nominate a candidate. The parties are<br>private entities, they are not governmental agencies. They can decide,<br>on their own, what their process is by which they will select a<br>candidate.<br><br>Usually, the parties do this using primary elections. But not all states<br>hold primary elections.<br><br>Regardless, anyone who meets the qualifications can seek the party\'s<br>nomination. The party can simply choose to nominate somebody else.<br><br>So long as there is someone else with a pulse who is running in the<br>Republican primary, I suspect that the party will nominate someone else.<br><br>And to be fair, there are a few Republicans who have presented<br>themselves as pretty decent candidates to replace Trump. And as I\'ve<br>said before numerous times, if Nikki Haley runs, I would vote for that<br>woman in a heartbeat. There are a few other Republicans who have<br>positioned themselves as potential candidates for 2024.<br><br>So I\'m not worried at all about the fact that Trump may want to run<br>again in 2024. Let him run. There\'s no way he\'ll get the nomination.<br><br>And if the GOP actually does nominate him? They get exactly what they<br>deserve. Maybe what that results in is conservatives leaving the party<br>and creating a new Conservative Party. But as many people have already<br>noted, splitting the GOP will essentially result in no Republican or<br>conservative ever winning any major office ever again.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
