How do I do it without making others uncomfortable or<br>should I just do it unapologetically?**<br><br>You can live by faith without having to ever say a single word about it.<br><br>Mahatma Gandhi said, "Be the example you want to see in the world." So<br>instead of proselytizing, you can instead live the life that is an<br>example of the kind of behavior that does work.<br><br>You don't have to accuse anyone of anything. You don't have to open any<br>religious text. You don't have to quote verses from the Bible. You<br>simply have to live the example taught by your faith in a gentle, loving<br>way. That's it.<br><br>Being unapologetic and "preachy" just makes you come off like a jerk,<br>and turns people away from your faith instead of guiding them towards<br>it.<br><br>Remember too that when it comes to witnessing and bringing people to the<br>faith, it is God that does the real work of conversion. You simply guide<br>people to the right place and get them in the right frame of mind to be<br>receptive to such work. You don't actually convert people or change<br>their hearts. Only God has that kind of power.<br><br>The best way you can get people into the right frame of mind is by using<br>your own life as an example. Live your life in a way that people will<br>want to know what makes you so hopeful for the future. Be the example<br>you want to see in the world.<br><br>Then when people ask you what your source of hope is, *then* can you<br>start to discuss your faith.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
