<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I know this is an absolutely ridiculous troll question, but let's<br>remember the three requirements for a legal contract:<br><br>1.  An offer<br>2.  An acceptance<br>3.  A consideration.<br><br>An offer happens when one party makes a promise to enter into a<br>contract under certain conditions. The offer must be specific, complete,<br>and made with the intention of being bound by acceptance.<br><br>An acceptance happens when the other party agrees to be bound by the<br>offer.<br><br>A consideration means each party exchanges something of value to<br>their detriment. This can be payment for goods or services, a promise to<br>do something, or a promise not to do something. For example, if one<br>party sells a bicycle to another party for \$100, the bicycle is the<br>consideration and the \$100 is the consideration.<br><br>In this case, if you had a valid contract, you would have approached<br>your neighbor and you would have told him that you wanted to install<br>solar panels on his rooftop and connected them to his "generator" (or<br>whatever that thing is called that takes power in off of the grid...most<br>people call it a "meter"), and in exchange he would permit you access to<br>his roof (at your own risk of injury) and he would agree to pay for the<br>panels.<br><br>As it stands in this question, you trespassed on your neighbor's<br>property, you gave away expensive solar panels with no written<br>agreement as to how you were going to be reimbursed for them, you<br>unlawfully connected solar panels to the electrical grid without a<br>permit, you acted as an electrician without a license, and somehow<br>you expect your *neighbor* to be *legally bound* by your unlawful<br>actions?<br><br>This question would be laughable if it weren't so stupid. Try harder if<br>you're going to make up troll questions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
