<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, the HOA can indeed repair the damage to the common area and invoice<br>the homeowner for the repairs. The homeowner can claim that he or she is<br>not responsible for the damage and can sue the HOA, so if the HOA is<br>going to pass the costs of the repairs on to the homeowner, they had<br>better be certain that the homeowner's negligence is what caused the<br>damage to the common area.<br><br>For example, if a homeowner's negligence in the clubhouse caused damage,<br>and the HOA has video surveillance footage of the homeowner in question,<br>they can absolutely repair the damage and then invoice the homeowner to<br>pay. They can add the amount of the damages to the homeowner's dues<br>account, add late fees if the homeowner does not pay, put a lien on the<br>homeowner's property if they still refuse to pay, and eventually<br>foreclose on the lien to be reimbursed for the damage.<br><br>However, for one reason or another, the HOA may choose to not seek<br>redress from the homeowner in question. If the HOA does not seek<br>repayment from the homeowner, they will have to do one of several things<br>to pay for the damage:<br><br>- Take out a small business loan<br>- Levy a special assessment to all the homeowners<br>- Use any available funds to pay for the repairs<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
