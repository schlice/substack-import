<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**According to Warren v. District of Columbia, how can I protect myself<br>when the police won\'t if guns are banned?**<br><br>According to another decision, *District of Columbia v. Heller*, 554<br>U.S. 570 (2008), the gun ban was unconstitutional, so you can protect<br>yourself with a firearm in your home in the District of Columbia. You<br>should check city laws to see how exactly this shook out in practice. To<br>be honest, I'm unsure how it ended up, but we do know that the gun ban<br>for guns in the home was unconstitutional.<br><br>*Warren* held that the police are not under any legal obligation to<br>protect you personally. Police have a general responsibility to<br>protect *the public at large*, they just don't have a specific<br>responsibility to protect you.<br><br>That means that ultimately, you are responsible for your own personal<br>safety. Within the confines of the law, you should ensure that you are<br>sufficiently protected, and that you have taken steps to protect<br>yourself and your family. What you choose to do and what you are legally<br>permitted to do will vary wildly. Please talk to a lawyer in your area<br>to find out what is legal and what is not.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
