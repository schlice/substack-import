<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Nah, 99.4% of statistics are made up on the spot anyway.\<br>\<br>See, statistics can say exactly what you want them to say.\<br>\<br>That\'s the point.\<br>\<br>Statistics are useless. Relying on statistics to get your information<br>will only get you in trouble. Remember the global warming hockey stick<br>chart? Totally bogus. But based on real statistics. Just a very, very<br>small view of them. Statistics can say whatever you want them to say,<br>either prove, or disprove your assertions.\<br>\<br>Ultimately, I\'m going to believe what I want to believe, and you\'re<br>going to believe what you want to believe, and we\'ll find whatever<br>\"experts\" we can to back us up.\<br>\<br>I\'m not here to try to convince you of anythnig. Nor am I here to try<br>to change you. You certainly can\'t change me.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-statistic-that-African-Americans-have-a-higher-chance-of-getting-pulled-over-by-police/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
