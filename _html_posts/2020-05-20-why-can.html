Your phone may be incapable of accessing email.<br><br>Not to worry though. Your phone carrier has a well trained customer<br>service group who can help you set up email on your phone. They may even<br>have some online tutorials you can walk through to do the same.<br><br>Alternatively, your email provider may also have directions for setting<br>up access to email on your particular device.
