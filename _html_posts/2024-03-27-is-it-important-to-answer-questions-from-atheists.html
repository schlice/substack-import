<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer to this question is related to the reason why we engage in<br>the practice called *apologetics* in the first place*.*<br><br>The word *apologetics*, derived from the Greek word *apologia*, means<br>"speaking in defense." Apologetics is therefore the discipline of<br>defending a position through systematic argumentative discourse.<br>**Christian apologetics is the rational defense of the Christian<br>worldview as *objectively true, rationally compelling* and**<br>*existentially or subjectively engaging*.<br><br>But *why* do we do it? Do we participate in apologetics because we want<br>to win arguments against atheists? Do we want to *prove those darn<br>atheists wrong?* No, exactly the opposite. We actually participate in<br>apologetics because it helps us *prove ourselves right.*<br><br>Apologetics helps us to prove to ourselves why we believe what we do.<br>Being able to articulate our beliefs in a rational and logical way helps<br>us to understand what we believe, and why, which can only strengthen our<br>faith.<br><br>The justification comes straight from Jesus:<br><br>> One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing<br>> that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, "Of all the<br>> commandments, which is the most important?"<br>><br>> "The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this: 'Hear, O Israel:<br>> The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all<br>> your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all<br>> your strength.' The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'<br>> There is no commandment greater than these." --- Mark 12:28--31 NIV<br><br>How exactly do you love God with all your mind? You engage your mind in<br>the practice of understanding what we believe and why. This is one way<br>in which we can love God with all our mind.<br><br>The fact that all Scripture is God-breathed underscores that God expects<br>us to be ready to defend our faith and articulate why we believe what we<br>do:<br><br>> All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking,<br>> correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God<br>> may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. --- 2 Tim 3:16--17 NIV<br><br>The study of apologetics helps a believer be "thoroughly equipped" to<br>uphold and defend the faith.<br><br>\<br><br>So it doesn't really matter that you can't change the mind of the<br>atheist. In fact, it's not your place to do so. It is only God who can<br>give them a heart receptive to the message of Christianity. Remember the<br>following:<br><br>> As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which<br>> you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the<br>> ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in<br>> those who are disobedient. --- Ephesians 2:1--2 NIV<br><br>The atheist is *dead* in his or her transgressions and sins. Can a dead<br>person save themselves? Can they decide to believe in Christ on their<br>own? No, only God can make them alive again, and *then* they can accept<br>Christ. So you, answering a Quora question from an atheist, will not<br>accomplish that. Unless God has already softened their heart, they will<br>not be receptive to your answer.<br><br>But that's okay, because your answer really isn't for them. Your answer<br>is more for the third-party reader who is investigating the same<br>question that they heard some other atheist ask once, and then they<br>stumble upon your answer. You deftly defended the faith, as is your<br>calling. The atheist who posed the question (and his ilk) will<br>derisively dismiss you, and even mock you for your belief. And that's<br>okay, because I drink atheist tears alongside my morning cereal. Part of<br>a good breakfast.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-bf89a09c0319044bbc223e7d41b40002){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-bf89a09c0319044bbc223e7d41b40002" master_w="527"<br>master_h="530"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*haha lol jk*<br><br>But the person who was genuinely seeking an answer to your question<br>will find it. And maybe, just maybe, that answer will touch their heart<br>and will spark further investigation.<br><br>That is our great hope.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
