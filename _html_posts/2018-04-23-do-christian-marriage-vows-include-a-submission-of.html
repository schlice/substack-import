<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do Christian marriage vows include a submission of free will (when it<br>comes to moral decisions) from the woman to the man?**<br><br>I see you're caught up in the wording in Ephesians 5:22--24. Let me give<br>you the Worldwide English translation of that passage:<br><br>> Wives, obey your husbands as you obey the Lord.<br>><br>> The husband is the head of the wife, just as Christ is the head of the<br>> church people. The church is his body and he saved it.<br>><br>> Wives should obey their husbands in everything, just as the church<br>> people obey Christ.<br>><br>> Ephesians 5:22--24 (WE)<br><br>That word "obey" tends to invoke images of a superior/subordinate<br>relationship, when that was never the intent of the passage. A more<br>appropriate phrase would be "follow the lead of" instead of "obey." The<br>New International Version says "submit yourselves to," and I think in<br>modern English, that still sounds too "submissive" for what the passage<br>intended. The New International Reader's Version is closer to what the<br>writer intended:<br><br>> Wives, follow the lead of your own husbands as you follow the Lord.<br>><br>> The husband is the head of the wife, just as Christ is the head of the<br>> church. The church is Christ's body. He is its Savior.<br>><br>> The church follows the lead of Christ. In the same way, wives should<br>> follow the lead of their husbands in everything.<br>><br>> Ephesians 5:22--24 (NIRV)<br><br>Note the rest of the passage discusses Christ as the head of the church.<br>The Church is the "body of Christ," and He is its savior. The church<br>follows the lead of Christ, as Christ is the head of the Church.<br><br>In biblical times, the man was the head of the household. The Bible<br>teaches that the man is still the head of the household, and indeed, a<br>husband and a father has an obligation to his family to lead his family<br>in the way God intended. He is to teach them what the Bible commands,<br>and model right behavior. This doesn't obviate free will; it simply<br>means that the bible has ordained that a man has an obligation to guide<br>his family in the teachings of the bible, both in word and in deed.<br><br>Wives are exhorted to understand that special calling, and allow the man<br>to do his appointed duty.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
