<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Every builder, when designing a community, will choose a level of<br>*amenities* that he is going to offer, and each level of amenities will<br>cater to a particular type of homebuyer.<br><br>Will it have open space? Will it have a playground? Will it have a<br>swimming pool? Will it have a community hall with meeting spaces? Will<br>it have a workout facility? And the big one, will the community be<br>gated? Will there be a security guard checking access?<br><br>The HOA dues will directly correlate to the level of amenities offered<br>by the HOA and the number of homes in the community. In other words,<br>more amenities + fewer homes = high HOA dues. Fewer amenities + more<br>homes = lower HOA dues.<br><br>**TL;DR: There is a direct correlation between number of homes plus<br>level of amenities, and how much a homeowner will pay in dues, in any<br>one HOA.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
