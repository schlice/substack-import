<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It depends on the jurisdiction, but in most jurisdictions, yes, simply<br>showing up and checking in on the morning you\'ve been summoned counts<br>as serving. If you are chosen for the jury pool but then are not chosen<br>for the jury, you have fulfilled your service. And of course, if you are<br>selected for a jury, this also counts as service.<br><br>In my jurisdiction, we can\'t be called for jury duty more than one time<br>per calendar year. So showing up, clocking in, and never being called<br>counts as jury service for the year.<br><br>Also, in my jurisdiction, if you are called and placed on the standby<br>list, and then advised that you do not need to appear, **this still<br>counts as your service** and you won\'t be called again for the<br>remainder of the calendar year. That was my service this year. Easy<br>peesey.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
