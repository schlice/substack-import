<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It\'s time to let her go.<br><br>Seriously, if she\'s telling you that she finds another guy in<br>particular more attractive than you, don\'t hold her back! Give her the<br>opportunity to see if she\'ll enjoy time with that guy more than you.<br>She\'s not your possession, you guys aren\'t married, so let her go!<br><br>But don\'t wait around for her. Shake the dust off your feet, and move<br>on. Here\'s the hard part: if it doesn\'t work out between her and this<br>guy who she found more attractive than you, don\'t be surprised if she<br>comes crawling back.<br><br>Don\'t take her back.<br><br>If she left you once for somebody more attractive, she\'ll do it again.<br>Yes, this will not be easy. But you are worth it, not just guys who she<br>finds more attractive. You. You are worth it. Don\'t sell yourself<br>short. When you cut her loose, don\'t carry a torch for her. Seriously,<br>move on.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What\'s your response when your girlfriend openly admits that she finds<br>that other guys or a particular guy more attractive than you?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
