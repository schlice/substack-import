Let me answer them:<br><br>> When will we outgrow religion?<br><br>When we figure out where we came from. Because we certainly didn't<br>spontaneously generate from goo in the ocean. In other words, the<br>universe didn't create us, because it makes no sense how a purposeless,<br>meaningless, random universe would birth creatures (us) filled with<br>purpose and meaning and with an inbuilt sense of right and wrong. The<br>Law of Causation says that this is simply impossible. Our DNA is<br>"specified complexity," meaning it is complex, but it is specifically<br>tailored to deliver a message, and only intelligence creates messages.<br>Nature, in all of its randomness, never produces messages.<br><br>So until we find our creator (assuming our creator is not the God of the<br>Bible), there will always be a place for religion.<br><br>> I understand that, for some, belief in the divine acts as a crutch<br>> (whatever gets you through the night, right?) but religion has caused<br>> untold grief and misery on this planet and continues to do so.<br><br>So let's address the first part, how belief in the divine acts as a<br>crutch. It seems like you believe in the "god of the gaps" theory of<br>religion, wherein God just fills the space of "things we don't yet know"<br>until we know them.<br><br>So let's turn this back on you: your religion is what is called<br>*Scienceism* (I'd call it Scientology, but someone took that name<br>already). You have *faith*, just as the theists do. You, however, have<br>faith that *someday*, science will answer all those tricky unknown<br>questions of the universe, like how did we form here, where did we come<br>from, and how did nature create specified complexity when it has never<br>done so ever, with anything else.<br><br>To me, that's a lot of faith. You really have to have a ton of faith to<br>believe that non-life produces life, randomness produces fine-tuning,<br>chaos produces order, unconsciousness produces consciousness; and<br>non-reason produces reason. Those leaps of faith are certainly too big<br>for me to take, especially in light of the affirmative case for God\'s<br>existence.<br><br>In other words, in my assessment the Christian worldview accounts for<br>the totality of the evidence much better than the atheistic worldview.<br><br>Now, let's address the second part of your statement: "Religion has<br>caused untold grief and misery on this planet and continues to do so." I<br>wonder if you can illuminate exactly the grief and misery you're talking<br>about, especially since you said that religion has caused "untold"<br>amounts of it.<br><br>I won't say that all religions are good. I also will not say that all<br>religions are right. That makes no sense. We can't *all* be right.<br>Christianity teaches that Jesus raised from the dead. Islam teaches that<br>Jesus never died. We can't both be right. One of us has to be wrong. So<br>the whole "all religions are right in their own way" is BS. In the<br>analogy of the blind men and the elephant, it is said that no one has<br>the full view of the elephant. They all see their little piece and<br>presume they're looking at something not an elephant. Except for one<br>small problem: there is one person who has the full view: *the<br>narrator*. Someone always has *the one right answer*. Someone has the<br>correct box top that will allow us to solve the puzzle of life. But only<br>one religion has that.<br><br>Is it because religion promotes *tribalism*? Either you're in, or you're<br>out. You're either saved, or you're damned. Is that why? I'd agree with<br>you, except for that belief is your choice. No one is forcing you to<br>believe. God *wants it that way.* I mean, if he descended from the<br>heavens and raised the dead and healed the sick and zapped the bad guys<br>and killed Satan and made all wars cease, you would have *no choice*<br>but to believe in him, right? Because if you spoke out against him, he'd<br>zap you away, too. But that's exactly the opposite of free will. God<br>wants you to see what he's offering, put it up against what Satan is<br>offering, and freely choose him. No pressure, no demands, just choose<br>him. That's what he wants. You're never going to be forced to be a<br>Christian. God does the hard work of conversion, not man.<br><br>But atheism has a fatal flaw. *What if there really is a God?*<br><br>What if there really is an afterlife? And what if it is eternal? The<br>truth is, eternity is an awfully long time to be wrong.<br><br>I'll leave you with this: all world religions require some task of the<br>believer so that they can earn their salvation...<br><br>...except one. Only one religion teaches that God has given us our<br>salvation as a gift, through his grace, and by his mercy. All we have to<br>do is *accept that gift.*<br><br>Yes, that religion is Christianity. And I believe that the Christian<br>worldview fits the evidence better than any other worldview, including<br>the atheistic worldview.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
