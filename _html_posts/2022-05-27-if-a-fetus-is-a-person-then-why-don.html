<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Some mothers do hold funerals for their stillborn children, or children<br>they lose in pregnancy due to miscarriage or other causes. They remember<br>them either on the day they were supposed to be born, or on the day they<br>were stillborn. One of my friends lost a child due to miscarriage and<br>she says she now has an "angel baby" and she remembers her angel baby<br>all the time. It's a very painful thing to have to go through.<br><br>The census, on the other hand, is a count of living people, not a count<br>of all people who have ever existed. The census counts "every resident<br>in the United States," as mandated by the Constitution.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If a fetus is a person, then why don\'t they get funerals or recorded in<br>the census?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
