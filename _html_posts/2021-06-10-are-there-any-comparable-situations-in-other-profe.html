<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Of course, there are many comparable situations not in employment.<br><br>- Schools require students to be vaccinated<br>- The US military actually performs the vaccination themselves, so in<br>  addition to requiring troops to be vaccinated, they actually provide<br>  them as well.<br><br>I'm sure there are more, but I can't think of them off the top of my<br>head.<br><br>But I must interject a specific exception when it comes to the current<br>(as of 10 June 2021) COVID-19 vaccines:<br><br>**They are not yet fully approved by the FDA, so they cannot be<br>mandatory.** The military cannot force servicemembers to take them.<br>Schools cannot force students to be vaccinated with the COVID-19<br>vaccines.<br><br>The current COVID-19 vaccines are only approved under an Emergency Use<br>Authorization (EUA). When Congress created EUAs, they built into that<br>law the requirement that taking any drug approved under that law<br>must be voluntary. You cannot force someone to take the vaccine;<br>doing so would be a violation of federal law.<br><br>Therefore, currently, employers cannot legally force employees to take<br>the vaccine. They also cannot legally predicate your continued<br>employment upon taking the vaccine because this would constitute<br>retaliation wherein the employer takes an employment action based on<br>an employee's failure to violate federal law.<br><br>Don't misunderstand: they can *not hire* you if you are not vaccinated,<br>but they cannot *fire* you for failing to take the vaccine. They can<br>*strongly encourage* you to get the vaccine; indeed, many employers<br>today are *paying* employees to get the vaccine. But they cannot<br>*condition your continued employment* on your vaccination status.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Are there any comparable situations in other professions to an employer<br>requiring healthcare workers to be vaccinated?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
