<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What would you do if you believe your significant other has a mental<br>illness but refuses to seek help?**<br><br>***NOTE: This is a tough answer to read, and it's even tougher to<br>suggest. But sometimes, tough love is exactly what is needed. I could<br>have used some tough love about ten years ago, and I didn't get it. I<br>nearly destroyed my family and myself because I didn't. Hopefully you<br>read and understand this in the context in which it was intended.***<br><br>*If the person will not help themselves, be prepared to help yourself.*<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that you abandon your SO because they<br>won't seek help. Far from it. You should still do everything you can to<br>get them the help they need.<br><br>But<br><br>Current laws in the United States do not provide a mechanism to get<br>someone the help they may need, but refuse to get on their own,<br>unless they become a danger to themselves or to other people. That's<br>a fairly high bar to cross.<br><br>*If this does happen*, be prepared to call 911 to get that assistance.<br>Police officers and emergency room physicians can involuntarily commit a<br>person to 48 or 72 hour psychiatric holds (depending on your state), if<br>they feel it is necessary to assess the mental state of a patient, if<br>they become a danger to themselves or others.<br><br>*Short of this* (which is fairly extreme by any measure), what can you<br>do?<br><br>The answer: nothing.<br><br>You can do nothing to convince someone to get the help they need if they<br>choose not to (and they're not a danger to themselves or to others).<br><br>So in that scenario, the only thing you can do is to take care of<br>yourself. Be prepared to do what you need to do in order to take care of<br>yourself and your family members. Move out if you must. But if it comes<br>down to your own quality of life and your family's quality of life, you<br>may have to make the hard choice and leave if it becomes necessary. Your<br>safety and your family's safety is related to the first part, but you<br>must also be concerned with your own quality of life and that which you<br>may be providing for your children.<br><br>Let me leave you with some personal experience to answer the next<br>question: *your SO may not feel like he/she needs help*. I can attest to<br>this from personal experience. I needed help, but I couldn't see it. It<br>was only through what others told me that I realized that I was being<br>negatively affected by a particular combination of medications (even<br>though everything felt perfectly normal to me), and I needed to make a<br>change. I did it for their sakes, even though I didn't feel like I<br>needed to. It is true that sometimes, the chemical imbalance that drives<br>our mood isn't something we can personally sense. We may feel perfectly<br>normal, but others see our mood change, sometimes drastically.<br><br>Sometimes, it's up to us to emphatically say that they need help, even<br>if they can't tell themselves. And if they won't do what's necessary to<br>help themselves, it's up to us to do what's necessary to help<br>*ourselves*, and our families.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
