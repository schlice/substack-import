<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is a really good question, because everyone who believes in a<br>religion believes that *all other religions* are wrong. If I'm a<br>Catholic, I believe that others who are not Catholic are not going to<br>Heaven. If I am a Muslim, I believe that others who are not Muslim are<br>not going to Heaven. This is a necessity of most religious belief: the<br>belief that you are right, and others are wrong.<br><br>So if we're simply basing our response to this question on what we<br>*believe*, then there is no right answer, because **everyone believes<br>their religion is the right one.**<br><br>But is there anything about Christianity that distinguishes it from all<br>of the other major world religions? That's what we should focus on.<br><br>So here's a few things which differentiate Christianity from all other<br>world religions, and which might make you consider the truth of<br>Christianity over all the others:<br><br>- In Christianity, God is understood to be both *just* and *merciful* at<br>  the same time. While this paradox seems at an initial reading to be<br>  insurmountable, the Christian God manages it. Other world religions<br>  show their god *dismisses* justice in order to show mercy (therefore,<br>  their gods are not just), but the Christian God does not. Justice<br>  should demand that you pay a price for your sin, but mercy should<br>  demand that you do not. How does the Christian God pull this off? He<br>  uses what we call a *penal substitution*. Someone else pays for your<br>  sin. He does. That's right, God pays for your sin. In no other<br>  religion in the world do you find God paying the price for your sin.<br>  God sent his son Jesus to be the blood offering which pays for your<br>  sin. Jesus took the penalty for your sin, which allows God to admit<br>  you into Heaven. *By His wounds, we are healed.*<br>- In other world religions, you must *do something* in order to gain<br>  access to a higher plane of existence, or into their afterlife. In<br>  other words, you must *earn* the blessing of that god. Christianity is<br>  the only world religion in which the something *has already been done<br>  for you*. Christ died on the cross to atone for your sin. That debt<br>  has been paid. He died *once*, for *all*. That gift rests at your<br>  feet. All you need to do is *accept it*. This is where the phrase *You<br>  were bought at a price* comes from.\<br>  \<br>  "Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is<br>  in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you<br>  were bought at a price. Therefore glorify God with your body." --- 1<br>  Cor 6:19--20 NIV\<br>  \<br>  In other words, in all other world religions, *you* search for *God*.<br>  In Christianity, *God* searches for *you*.<br><br>These are just a few of the major distinctions between Christianity and<br>all other world religions. There's a reason we're so different, and that<br>reason is worth investigating.<br><br>So how can we be sure that our religion is the right one? It's the one<br>that makes the most sense, and it's the one that fits the totality of<br>the evidence the best.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What makes our religion the right one?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
