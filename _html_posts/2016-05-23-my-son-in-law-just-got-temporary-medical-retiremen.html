<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think he should visit the nearest MPF (Military Personnel Facility) on<br>the nearest Air Force installation he can find so that he can confirm<br>his status, and if it's wrong, get it corrected.<br><br>There's only a number of statuses he can currently be in. He could be<br>out processing, which means he's in the process of (but has not yet<br>completed) out-processing. Usually this is done with a checklist which<br>must be signed by every organization that you may still have business<br>with on active duty. You turn this in to the personnel specialist in the<br>MPF, who will complete your out-processing and provide you with a DD214.<br><br>If he is not out-processing at all (or has not done any out-processing),<br>he could be in transit between duty stations. He could be in transit to<br>a TDY. Whatever the case may be, MPF can help him determine his current<br>status. He should be on orders and have a copy of those orders in hand<br>in order to facilitate the transition into the new location. And he'd<br>probably know about it, too.<br><br>If he is not out-processing and is not on orders to or from<br>somewhere, then he must be either at a duty station, on leave (with<br>orders), or at the clinic. If he does not fit any of the above<br>categories, he is AWOL. The longer he stays AWOL, the more trouble he<br>will be in.<br><br>Best advice: get down to the nearest MPF at the nearest Air Force<br>installation he can find. They will help him sort it out. Have him bring<br>whatever paperwork he has with him, as this will help him prove what he<br>thinks he should be doing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
