<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can it be proven that a police officer neglected to turn their body<br>camera on before shooting someone in a court of law?**<br><br>No, in general it cannot be proven that a police officer neglected to<br>turn their body-worn camera (BWC) on before a shooting, at least not<br>beyond a reasonable doubt. And most cameras are very simplistic in their<br>feedback to the user, so while there may be a hard switch to turn it on<br>and off, there is really very little to indicate that it is actually<br>recording something. You'll really only know this for sure when you plug<br>it in at the end of your shift and attempt to download the video.<br>Therefore, it is very easy to produce reasonable doubt, and very<br>difficult to prove that an officer willfully neglected to turn the<br>camera on, or even accidentally neglected to do so.<br><br>Are and should there be any laws forbidding this?<br><br>In general, there should not be law surrounding this. Generally, there<br>are department policies that require camera use in certain situations in<br>departments that currently field BWCs to their officers, and this is<br>rightly where the policy should be maintained. These policies are<br>greatly dependent on the amount of storage space available to the<br>department to maintain the video footage, as this is the largest cost to<br>the department. Camera maintenance and upkeep will be a factor, but not<br>nearly as much of a factor as video storage.<br><br>When law is involved, it mandates monetary expenditures, and most often,<br>the law itself doesn't come with money attached to it. It's what we call<br>an "unfunded mandate," and if funding is not provided, it can chew up a<br>significant portion of a department's budget just to keep up with the<br>new laws, which will mean taking funding from other areas of the<br>department.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
