<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's not really that simple though.<br><br>Just looking at today's poll numbers, one poll conducted by Research<br>America of 1000 likely voters in Virginia has the race at a dead heat.<br>But according to 538, she has a 6 point lead, and according to RCP, she<br>has a 4.8 point lead. Rasmussen gives her a three point lead.<br><br>*So it sounds like what you're saying is that on average, she's leading.<br>So she's going to win, right?*<br><br>Not so fast. Joe Biden won the state by a *double-digit margin* just<br>four years ago. This means that her current performance in Virginia is<br>*abysmal*. In fact, Biden's double-digit win in Virginia was the best<br>performance for the Democrats in Virginia since *1944*. Hillary<br>Clinton won Virginia by 5.3 points, even considering she ran with Tim<br>Kaine on her ticket, a representative from Virginia.<br><br>And in comparison, in every state in the country, she is polling<br>way below where Joe Biden was just four years ago.<br><br>The "seven" swing states are Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan,<br>Pennsylvania, Georgia, and North Carolina. But given what I just said<br>about Virginia, I'd argue that Virginia is also going to be very<br>competitive. Don't forget that Virginia experienced its own "red wave"<br>electing Younkin by just under 2 points, and that was the first time<br>Republicans won a state race since 2009. Before he dropped out of the<br>running, Biden was *losing* to Trump by 0.4 points average. In a state<br>where Republicans rarely win, Trump is polling really well.<br><br>*Yeah, but she's still leading Virginia by three points.*<br><br>Right, but that's no guarantee she's actually going to win in November.<br>Joe Biden was polling 8 points higher than Trump right up until the<br>election in Wisconsin, but then ended up winning the state by just **0.6<br>points.** This is just one illustration of how polling overestimates<br>Democrats.<br><br>Trump was doing much worse in polling in 2016 and 2020, and those<br>polling numbers were not borne out on election day.<br><br>So as for the swing states, Trump is likely to win NC, GA, AZ, and NV.<br>The former Blue Wall states WI, MI, and PA are currently leaning Trump<br>in the polls ("lean" states are states which a candidate will win by<br>between 2 and 6 points). Given that Biden won them by such slim margins<br>in 2020, and given that Harris is less popular than Biden was, and given<br>that conditions were ripe for a Democrat to win (recession plus COVID)<br>and those same conditions are not in play now, it's likely that Trump<br>will win the former Blue Wall by anywhere from 2 to 6 points.<br><br>And that's it, we really don't need to talk about much else, because if<br>Harris doesn't win the ENTIRE former Blue Wall states, she has no chance<br>of winning the election. Pennsylvania is the most desired of the Blue<br>Wall states with its 19 electoral votes, which is why they are both<br>campaigning so hard there, and are pouring buckets full of money into<br>campaign ads.<br><br>**TL;DR: Some nebulous social media slogan someone made up isn't going<br>to win multiple hundreds of thousands of voters across all of the swing<br>states.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
