<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **What sin did the Russians commit in the past, which rule of God did<br>> they violate that made the entire West unite against them?**<br><br>Russians are no more or less sinners than we are. Humans all have<br>imputed sin from Adam. But sometimes, our national identity and our<br>politics make it really easy to see those who are different from us as<br>"evil."<br><br>Russians have been "the big bad enemy" since World War II. The two<br>nations (the USSR and the US) grew to be world powers. The race for<br>superior military power put us at ideological odds; the presence of<br>communism was an "existential threat" which needed to be contained, and<br>the Soviets made no bones about desiring to spread communism beyond its<br>borders. In contrast, the US's view is that we *liberate* countries and<br>allow them to "live free." We don't "install" democracy; we enable them<br>to have a democratic government and free elections. That is our end<br>goal, because to us, that is the "freest" form of government. See the<br>ideological difference there?<br><br>When you start to think that you are *ideologically correct* and your<br>enemy is *ideologically incorrect*, you can easily allow that feeling to<br>turn into "I am good, they are evil."<br><br>So while their form of government is *different* from ours, and we<br>clearly do not desire that form of government (well, at least in the<br>Republican party), they aren't any more sinful than we are.<br><br>> **Does God eventually take revenge on behalf of people, and will it be<br>> America\'s and Israel\'s turn as well?**<br><br>No, God does not take revenge on behalf of people. God only looks at the<br>individual and their righteousness. Because even we who have been<br>wronged are also sinners.<br><br>Christianity was never meant to be a political movement. Instead, God<br>chooses to work in people *individually*, changing and saving them, and<br>those saved, changed people go on to change families and communities and<br>eventually nations.<br><br>Eventually, America, Russia, and indeed, every country in the world will<br>be eliminated, and the new Kingdom of God will be established with Jesus<br>as its ruler, and the people of Israel will lead as the chosen people.<br>Evil will be destroyed, Satan and his minions will be cast into the lake<br>of fire, and the new Kingdom will live for a thousand years.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
