<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I was a little sleepy when I wrote my original answer, but in thinking<br>about it, I think I have a better understanding. I was thinking of clubs<br>that are membership-based but open to the general public.<br><br>If you have a club that is *truly* private (i.e. not open to the<br>general public, facilities open to members only, true selectivity in the<br>membership process, etc), you are not subject to Title III of the ADA.<br><br>> Many organizations that meet the criteria of a private membership club<br>> may hold events that are open to the general public. Clubs may hold<br>> such events to promote their views, raise funds for a charitable<br>> cause, or recruit potential members. A club may lose its exemption on<br>> a temporary basis; for example, if an organization holds a charitable<br>> fundraiser, opening its facility and selling foods and beverages to<br>> the general public for one evening every five years, it may only be<br>> subject to Title III for the purposes of that specific event.<br><br>It's interesting though, your requirements under Title III would be to<br>make your club accessible to everyone; however, the people you are<br>excluding do not need accommodations. So even if you do open your club<br>temporarily to the general public (like to do a fundraiser), there<br>wouldn't be anything special you would need to do to bring your club<br>into Title III compliance. Your club would already be *de facto* Title<br>III compliant.<br><br>**TL;DR: Private membership clubs do not have to comply with the ADA as<br>they are not "places of public<br>accommodation."**\[1\](#ihEcN){#cite-ihEcN .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ihEcN){.citation_index} [[Private Clubs Under the<br>Americans With Disabilities<br>Act](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=747efd&url=https://adata.org/factsheet/private-clubs-under-americans-disabilities-act){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="adata.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
