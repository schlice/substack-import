<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I don\'t think so. The iCar would only be able to be charged from<br>Apple\'s proprietary charging station, and while there are many of them<br>around (people install them out in front of their houses just to look<br>cool), you only get 30 minutes of charge for free each day. You have to<br>buy a \"power subscription\" to be able to use more power than that from<br>the charger, so it will only have limited usefulness.<br><br>The iCar will work well, and will work consistently, but it will only<br>appeal to a certain market. Car enthusiasts will not like it because it<br>won\'t be able to drive faster than 80, even though its electric motors<br>are capable of about 120. And you won\'t be able to service the vehicle;<br>the hood will be factory sealed and you can only get it serviced at an<br>authorized iCar repair facility or you void your warranty.<br><br>You won\'t be able to customize the interior of your car very much. Want<br>to install a Kenwood or Pioneer head unit? Not allowed. Want to put<br>colored floormats in it? The iCar will not allow them in the door. And<br>the car will only come in three colors, only one of which people will<br>actually want to drive.<br><br>But everyone will have them, and they will all unequivocally state that<br>Apple revolutionized the automotive industry.<br><br>Yeah, I don\'t think [[Elon<br>Musk](https://www.quora.com/topic/Elon-Musk)]{.qlink_container} is<br>quaking in his boots over an Apple car.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
