<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Isn\'t \"how are you doing today?\" an inappropriate question to ask<br>an emergency room patient? Shouldn't hospitals train staff NOT to do<br>this?**<br><br>I can't see how it is an inappropriate question at all.<br><br>Patient self-assessment is a vital component to understanding where<br>medical attention needs to be focused. All care starts and ends with the<br>needs of the patient.<br><br>Asking the patient how they are doing (or words to that effect) give the<br>patient the opportunity to verbalize what they are experiencing. Some<br>can do it better than others, but all who are conscious and can move can<br>at least point to the area where it hurts.<br><br>Perhaps if you can explain why you feel that asking someone how they are<br>doing is inappropriate and must be legislated out of existence, we can<br>better answer your question.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
