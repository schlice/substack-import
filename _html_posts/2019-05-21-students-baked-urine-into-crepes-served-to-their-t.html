I agree that this is disgusting,<br>but legally how can this be considered assault? Is it based on a written<br>statute or case law?**<br><br>Written statute.<br><br>Nearly every assault statute involves the crime of intentional harm<br>inflicted on one person by another. Normally, simple assaults are<br>misdemeanors.<br><br>But as you know, all states are different. In Ohio, when an assault<br>happens in this manner, it is a fifth degree felony:<br><br>> The victim of the offense is a school teacher or administrator or a<br>> school bus operator, and the offense occurs in a school, on school<br>> premises, in a school building, on a school bus, or while the victim<br>> is outside of school premises or a school bus and is engaged in duties<br>> or official responsibilities associated with the victim\'s employment<br>> or position as a school teacher or administrator or a school bus<br>> operator, including, but not limited to, driving, accompanying, or<br>> chaperoning students at or on class or field trips, athletic events,<br>> or other school extracurricular activities or functions outside of<br>> school premises.
