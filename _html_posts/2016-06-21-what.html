<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A<br><br>In some forms, we already have this. They are called **Auxiliary Police<br>Officers and Reserve Deputies**.<br><br>I will comment about Reserve Deputies since I have some experience in<br>the field. I was in my county's Reserve Deputy Academy in 2013, but a<br>medical issue forced me out. I intend on re-entering the Academy in<br>2017. The information I share about Reserve Deputies is probably unique<br>to my county (no two departments operate similarly, even in our own<br>state), but I believe we have the best Reserve program in the country,<br>and I'd put one of our Reservists up against any peace officer in the<br>nation any day.<br><br>Think of a Reserve Deputy in the same way you think of a volunteer<br>firefighter. Now you know what Reserve Deputies do. The official job<br>description for a Reserve Deputy begins, "Highly trained<br>community-minded volunteers" which pretty much sums up the entire<br>program.<br><br>They are fully-trained, POST-certified Reserve peace officers. They work<br>alongside full-time deputies and provide force augmentation services;<br>they are a *force multiplier*. They also perform *additional duties*<br>which cannot be filled by full-time deputies. Additionally, they are<br>*volunteers,* which means *unpaid,* saving the county money. They<br>receive over 300 hours of training in a Reserve Academy which meets two<br>nights a week and one weekend day for 22 weeks (since these folks all<br>have day jobs). They receive 50 hours of firearms training, 40 hours of<br>driving training, 40 hours of arrest control, and the remainder of the<br>time is spent in classroom-style learning. They also provide and pay for<br>all of their own uniforms and equipment, except for firearms, Tasers,<br>radios, and body armor, which are supplied by the county.<br><br>After graduating from the Academy and receiving their deputy's badges,<br>they progress through an OJT certification program, allowing them to<br>perform greater and more independent functions, until they can perform<br>any activity that any full-time deputy in the county can perform.<br><br>We also have Citizen's Patrol in the county, and **Community<br>Assistance Officers** in the city. They have a much shorter academy as<br>they are unarmed citizens, not sworn deputies. They are dispatched when<br>disabled motorists need assistance, or when a street needs to be closed.<br>It is the "step-down" from the Reserve Deputy or the Auxiliary Police<br>Officer.<br><br>Between these two volunteer functions, we probably already have<br>something akin to what you're asking for. But we need to *expand*<br>these programs. Federal dollars could do that. De-emphasizing the "war<br>on drugs" would provide a source for those additional Federal dollars.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
