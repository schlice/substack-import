<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should it be legal for a homeowner\'s association to require that<br>residents be Christian?**<br><br>The US Fair Housing Act prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of<br>race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or familial<br>status. These housing protections apply to discrimination in the sale or<br>rental of housing, and also apply to the \"terms and conditions\" of the<br>sale or rental of housing.<br><br>The question is: *should it not be illegal?*<br><br>I can't see a valid reason to do so. Because opening the door to allow<br>small communities to discriminate based on religion opens the door to<br>*other communities* to also discriminate based on religion, and also<br>opens the door to *individuals* to harass their neighbors based on their<br>religion. Some cases which sound like harassment cases are actually Fair<br>Housing Act cases, so it's not true that all cases like this will be<br>tried as pure harassment cases.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
