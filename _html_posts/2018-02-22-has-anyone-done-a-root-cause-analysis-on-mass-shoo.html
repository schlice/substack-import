<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Has anyone done a root cause analysis on mass shootings?<br><br>No, because each shooting is different, it would be pointless to RCA all<br>mass shootings.<br><br>If the shooters all belonged to a country, a faction, or a group, then<br>RCA might be warranted. But shooters are all individual citizens, and<br>they all have different motivations.<br><br>You might be able to RCA each individual shooting, which Federal, state,<br>and local law enforcement do for each individual incident. You can<br>probably look up the results of that RCA by searching for details for<br>the individual incident you're curious about.<br><br>But there is no one cause for all mass shootings.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
