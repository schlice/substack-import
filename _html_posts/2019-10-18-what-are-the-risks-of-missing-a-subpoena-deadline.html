<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What are the risks of missing a subpoena deadline?<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>If you missed a "subpoena to appear" issued by a court, and you fail to<br>appear, the judge can issue a bench warrant for your arrest. The Sheriff<br>can then arrest you and deliver you to the judge.<br><br>If you have been subpoenaed to provide sworn testimony, the agency<br>issuing the subpoena can bring it before a judge and if it is found to<br>be valid and the requirement for the information is found to be<br>necessary, the judge can issue that same bench warrant for your arrest.<br><br>Note that the warrants for your arrest come from the judge, not the<br>agency issuing the subpoena.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
