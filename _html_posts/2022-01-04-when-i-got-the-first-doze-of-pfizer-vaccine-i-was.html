<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I guess I'm curious why you shouldn't have taken Panadol to control your<br>fever.<br><br>The CDC says that taking OTC pain medications is perfectly fine after<br>your vaccination. If you got your vaccine and you're running a fever,<br>you can absolutely take OTC meds like acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or<br>paracetamol to help control it .<br><br>However, taking them *before* your vaccination may reduce the<br>effectiveness of the vaccine. This is because the vaccines use a process<br>known as "controlled inflammation" to create antibodies against the<br>virus. If you take OTC pain medications *before* you are vaccinated,<br>this may dampen the body's natural immune response, resulting in a less<br>vigorous response, and an overall lower<br>efficacy.\[1\](#agtSh){#cite-agtSh .citation_link}<br><br>So take pain medications *after* you get your vaccine and if you start<br>running a fever, and you'll be just fine. Just don't take pain meds<br>*before* you get your vaccine. If you do, make sure your pain meds have<br>worn off completely before you get your vaccine.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>When I got the first doze of Pfizer vaccine, I was running a fever the<br>next day. I took two Panadol which I shouldn\'t have and my fever went<br>away. What should I do to fix my mistake?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-agtSh){.citation_index} [[Yes, you can take OTC pain meds<br>after getting the Covid vaccine, says CDC --- plus other tips for<br>dealing with side<br>effects](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=80149c&url=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/cdc-safe-to-take-tylenol-or-otc-pain-medications-after-covid-vaccine.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cnbc.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
