<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is the US Supreme Court too Catholic?<br><br>LOL<br><br>Seriously, I just got finished laughing. On the other hand, is that a<br>bad thing? I mean, I don't even think the Catholic Church is *Catholic<br>enough!*<br><br>In any case, the question asks a factually flawed question. Supreme<br>Court justices are not selected based on their religion; it is<br>specifically prohibited in the Constitution. Article VI, Paragraph 3<br>(emphasis mine):<br><br>> *The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of<br>> the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial<br>> Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall<br>> be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution;* ***but<br>> no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any<br>> Office or public Trust under the United States.***<br><br>So the SCOTUS can never be *too Catholic*, since no religious test is<br>authorized.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
