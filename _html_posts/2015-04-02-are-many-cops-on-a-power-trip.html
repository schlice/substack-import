<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [No, most cops are not on a power trip.\<br>\<br>Some cops do act this way, it\'s true. Some cops are jerks. Some grocery<br>store clerks are jerks. Some garbage collectors are jerks. There\'s<br>jerks everywhere in society, and since police come from society,<br>sometimes police are jerks.\<br>\<br>Some cops think like they\'re God\'s Gift to Law Enforcement. News<br>flash: they\'re not. This sometimes happens with younger officers, less<br>so with older veterans. And generally it takes a few incidents to knock<br>them down a peg or two.\<br>\<br>If a police officer is ever abusive to you, or is rude or arrogant,<br>please take the time to go down to the station and report that officer.<br>You may not be able to prove your report, but 20 \"unprovable\" reports<br>still says something to a supervisor. If you don\'t take the time to<br>report inappropriate conduct, who will?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
