<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [I read what you said. However, you have no idea what<br>you\'re talking about.\<br>\<br>You expect the police policy to take into account the fact that people<br>are too stupid to understand that when they are outnumbered they<br>shouldn\'t resist. Yet you insist that this is a normal response and the<br>police should, what, slap him with a wet noodle? Tickle him with feather<br>dusters?\<br>\<br>The police are there to enforce the law. Someone can go to jail<br>compliantly or non-compliantly. There\'s not much in-between there. You<br>presume too much. And you have no idea what you\'re talking about.\<br>\<br>The local police department is hiring. Why don\'t you put your money<br>where your mouth is and join up and make a difference?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-likelihood-that-the-next-time-an-arrestee-says-I-cant-breathe-the-police-will-listen/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
