<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [A normal toilet is a gravity toilet. It uses water<br/>pressure to draw the water through the drain pipe and into the sewer<br/>line. On an airplane, this configuration is impractical because of the<br/>motion of the aircraft. Therefore, airplanes use a powered vacuum to<br/>suck the contents out of the toilet. These toilets are therefore known<br/>as vacuum toilets. Because a vacuum does all the work and not<br/>gravity, vacuum toilets are far more efficient than gravity toilets;<br/>they require far less water to transport contents and to clean the bowl<br/>for the next use. They use just 1/3 the water of a traditional<br/>water-saving toilet (2L vs 6L per flush). Also, the pipes can be<br/>smaller, and they work in any direction. This means that in tricky<br/>installations where holes cannot be cut into the floor, a vacuum toilet<br/>can do the job.\<br/>\<br/>But you\'re right, the vacuum is noisy.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
