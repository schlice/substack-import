<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do I convince my parents to get me an emotional support dog. I<br>have serious anxiety, and I have thoughts of suicide constantly. My dad<br>says I can't get one because he lives in an apartment. I'm only with him<br>on weekends. It has to go everywhere?**<br><br>Work the angle a different way.<br><br>First, get help. If you are not seeking counseling, tell your<br>parents you want to talk to someone. If they won't help you, check the<br>box on this page that says "There is Help," find a resource in your area<br>and reach out.<br><br>Hopefully you are either talking to someone or you are going to talk to<br>someone. In your talks with that person, maybe see if they think that an<br>emotional support animal would be helpful. They might be able to help<br>convince your parents that you would benefit from one.<br><br>Be aware, however, **emotional support animals are not service<br>animals.** They are not legally protected like service animals are.<br>Businesses and landlords *can* restrict emotional support animals,<br>where they cannot restrict service animals. **The Americans with<br>Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Act do not protect emotional<br>support animals.**<br><br>This is why it is critical you get help for yourself first, and worry<br>about the emotional support animal later.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
