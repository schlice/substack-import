<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should the names of everyone who is issued a permit to carry a<br>concealed firearm be published each year so that everyone knows whom to<br>avoid?**<br><br>I have a better idea.<br><br>If you think that so many people agree with you, you should easily be<br>able to lobby your state's representatives (who, clearly, must also<br>agree with you) to make open carry legal.<br><br>Then, you don't need to waste your time publishing anything. You can<br>tell who is carrying, because you can see their gun, right there on<br>their hip. Then you can avoid that person.<br><br>Simple.<br><br>So with that in mind, ask yourself this question: *why don't more states<br>allow open carry?*<br><br>I mean, just look at Florida. Concealed carry permits are cheap and easy<br>to get, but open carry is 100% illegal. Why is that? Perhaps because<br>Florida allows people to *conceal* the fact that they are carrying?<br>Perhaps because some people are uncomfortable around firearms?<br>***Perhaps because people not breaking the law have not given up their<br>right to privacy?***<br><br>You may be willing to give up other people's right to privacy, but they<br>are not.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
