<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Huh, nobody touched the "artillery gun" section?<br><br>You mean a cannon or a Howitzer?<br><br>Actually...wait for it...the Second Amendment doesn't ban those,<br>historically citizens have owned weapons of mass destruction, and if you<br>want, you can own one today.<br><br>*WHAT????????*<br><br>Yep, it's true. If you want a Howitzer or a cannon, you can own one. The<br>Constitution does not forbid it.<br><br>However, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives<br>(formerly and still colloquially known as the ATF) may have something to<br>say about that. See, they've put a whole slew of *regulations* on what<br>kinds of guns you can own and what you have to do in order to own one of<br>those guns.<br><br>The cannon, surprisingly, is *not* one of them. Muzzle-loading<br>cannons are *not* considered firearms in the US and are therefore not<br>regulated by the 1934 National Firearms Act (NFA). The *shells*,<br>however, are regulated by the ATF. Cannon shells are classed as<br>destructive devices in the U.S. under the NFA. They must be registered<br>with the ATF and, though legal under federal law, are prohibited from<br>being owned by civilians in certain states.<br><br>Howitzers are *breech-loading* cannons, and are subject to much heavier<br>state restrictions. The shells are similarly regulated between the<br>cannon and the Howitzer. At a Federal level, the Howitzer is classified<br>as a destructive device under the NFA, so it would require a Federal<br>Firearms License, at a minimum, to own one, along with the tax stamp.<br>However, as I understand it, most states restrict breech-loading cannons<br>from citizen ownership. There are a few states where you can own a<br>firing Howitzer, but only a few.<br><br>As an aside, if either weapon were demilled (i.e. rendered inoperable),<br>it would be free to own without regulation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
