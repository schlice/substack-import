<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Question details:*<br>><br>> *I kind of understand the logic behind it, but not really. This girl<br>> was trying to justify the actions of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold by<br>> saying they were victims and that their families lost a loved one.<br>> Their families did lose someone they loved a lot but I feel like we<br>> still shouldn\'t look at them as victims because of their actions. Why<br>> do people try to justify this?*<br><br>If that were the case (that suspects couldn\'t actually also be<br>victims), then there would be no need for defense in our legal system.<br>If the facts were present, you go straight to jail. Suspects can have<br>mitigating circumstances that cause them to do what they do. Just<br>because they are a suspect doesn\'t mean that they aren\'t a victim of<br>another set of circumstances as well.<br><br>If we want to focus only on punishment, then your sentiment is<br>correct: they are criminals, they get punished, end of story.<br><br>If, however, we also want to try to prevent future crimes, we have<br>to try to figure out why they did what they did. What we discovered was<br>a \"bullying\" culture in some schools that led to the creation of<br>killers like Klebold and Harris. As a society, that we allowed this to<br>happen is *our* failure.<br><br>Since then, schools have adopted zero-tolerance policies on bullying and<br>bullying behavior. Teachers have been trained to recognize and put an<br>end to bullying behavior. It\'s much much better than it was 15 years<br>ago in Littleton. It\'s certainly not perfect, but it\'s much much<br>better.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
