<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Question Details:*<br>><br>> *In most countries the military would fall under the direct command of<br>> the president/prime minister, in other words would not have the<br>> supreme power to overthrow the government. Then how do they obtain the<br>> power and authority to take over the country under their rule.*<br><br>You are correct, in most countries, the military falls under the<br>president in terms of legitimate authority.<br><br>So the military can take over the government in only one way: illegally,<br>*by force*.<br><br>A military commander decides that the government is corrupt and that<br>there is only one way to deal with that corrupt government: oust them<br>from office at the end of a gun barrel. Literally. Walk into his office<br>and place him in military detention. Do the same for all of the other<br>governmental officials. Literally take over the operations of the<br>government by force.<br><br>It is, indeed, an illegitimate usurpation of power in most countries,<br>but if it is done by force, at the end of a gun barrel, who will stop<br>them?<br><br>The only people who can stop them are people with bigger/more guns, or<br>when they decide to turn the power back over to a civilian government<br>that they install or one that they allow to take over.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
