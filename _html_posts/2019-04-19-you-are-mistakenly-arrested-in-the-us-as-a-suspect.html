Are you<br>wiser to say nothing (except name and address with ID as required) until<br>you get a lawyer or cooperate fully with the police and answer all their<br>questions?**<br><br>You are never "mistakenly arrested" until after a police officer says,<br>"We didn't mean to arrest you, you're free to go" or a judge says<br>"there's not enough evidence to support this arrest, you're free to go."<br><br>You are under arrest, and the police are working hard to ensure that you<br>go to jail for the crime, otherwise they wouldn't have wasted their time<br>arresting you.<br><br>You are arrested, and you are a suspect. Period.<br><br>IF YOU HAVE BEEN ARRESTED, SAY NOTHING UNTIL YOU TALK TO A LAWYER.<br><br>The police are not there to get you coffee and BS with you and be your<br>friend. Not that they are nefarious, just that they are not there to<br>hang out and chit-chat.<br><br>The police are there to find the person who did the crime, and you're<br>under arrest because they have reasonable suspicion that you're the<br>person who did it. You must be clear on this fact. And the police are<br>expert at making cases. Sometimes they make mistakes, but by and large,<br>they are really good at what they do, and they will find a suspect and<br>enough evidence to convict that suspect. To that end, you need an expert<br>to help you, otherwise you may find yourself on the wrong side of the<br>bars.<br><br>Once you get that shiny new pair of silver bracelets and a one way trip<br>to the Gray Bar Inn, your mouth closes. You say nothing until you have a<br>lawyer. Period.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
