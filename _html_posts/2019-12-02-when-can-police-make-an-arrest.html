<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What does it actually take for the police to arrest someone?<br><br>The answer is a burden of proof called probable cause.<br><br>This is a lower standard than "beyond a reasonable doubt" and it is a<br>higher standard than "reasonable suspicion." Reasonable suspicion<br>requires specific, articulable, and individualized suspicion that crime<br>is afoot. A mere guess or \"hunch\" is not enough to constitute<br>reasonable suspicion (*Terry v. Ohio*). Probable cause means, in<br>practical terms, 51% or more certainty that a crime has been committed.<br>Beyond a reasonable doubt means that there is no doubt as to the<br>defendant's guilt, or that any doubts that remain are unreasonable.<br><br>The burden of proof is always on the government. The Latin: *semper<br>necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit*, which means \"the necessity<br>of proof always lies with the person who lays charges.\"<br><br>Reasonable suspicion allows the police to detain someone and question<br>them. Since this does amount to a 4th Amendment taking of liberty, the<br>police must be able to justify the specific suspicion that led them to<br>believe that crime was afoot. Probable cause is the standard by which<br>police can arrest someone.<br><br>Remember, police use reasonable suspicion to stop, probable cause to<br>arrest, and courts use beyond a reasonable doubt to convict.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
