<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Of course it is!<br><br>And the greatest example of this is none other than Mr. Crazy Hair<br>himself, Albert Einstein.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-7ed3b271a66465d58b09d78017ac9f87){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-7ed3b271a66465d58b09d78017ac9f87" master_w="530"<br>master_h="356"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>In 1916, Einstein (an atheist at the time) was confronted with a<br>troubling implication of his theory of General Relativity. If correct,<br>the theory suggested that the universe had not always existed but had a<br>starting point. This was a stark contrast to his previous conviction<br>that the universe was unchanging and eternal. His own calculations were<br>pointing to an absolute beginning of all time, matter, and space, and he<br>was troubled.<br><br>Einstein would later go on to describe his discovery as \"irritating.\"<br>He had hoped for a universe that was self-sustaining, not dependent on<br>an external cause, yet it seemed to be one massive effect. Indeed,<br>Einstein was so troubled by the consequences of General Relativity---a<br>theory now verified to five decimal places---that he inserted a<br>*cosmological constant* (later termed by some as a \"fudge factor\")<br>into his equations to depict the universe as static and circumvent an<br>absolute beginning.<br><br>But Einstein's fudge factor didn't fudge for long. In 1919, British<br>cosmologist Arthur Eddington carried out an experiment during a solar<br>eclipse that confirmed the validity of General Relativity, revealing<br>that the universe was not static but had a beginning. Similar to<br>Einstein, Eddington was troubled by the implications. He expressed his<br>discomfort by writing, \"Philosophically, the idea of a beginning to the<br>current order of nature is distasteful to me. \\...\ I would like to<br>find a genuine loophole.\"<br><br>By 1922, Russian mathematician Alexander Friedmann had officially<br>revealed Einstein\'s "fudge factor" to be an algebraic mistake<br>(astonishingly, in his effort to preclude a beginning, Einstein had<br>divided by zero). Concurrently, Dutch astronomer Willem de Sitter had<br>determined that General Relativity necessitated an expanding universe.<br>Furthermore, in 1927, the expansion of the universe was empirically<br>observed by astronomer Edwin Hubble, after whom the space telescope is<br>named. Using the 100-inch telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory in<br>California, Hubble observed a \"red shift\" in the light from every<br>visible galaxy, indicating that these galaxies were moving away from<br>Earth. This discovery provided further confirmation of General<br>Relativity, suggesting that the universe is expanding from an initial<br>point in the distant past.<br><br>In 1929, Einstein visited Mount Wilson to personally observe the "red<br>shift" through Hubble\'s telescope. The irrefutable observations<br>confirmed that the universe was expanding, as predicted by General<br>Relativity. This evidence rendered Einstein\'s cosmological constant<br>totally and completely obsolete, leading him to abandon his preference<br>for a static universe. He famously called the cosmological constant<br>\"the greatest blunder of my life\" and shifted his focus to unraveling<br>the mysteries of life. Einstein expressed his desire to understand the<br>Creator\'s blueprint, stating, \"I want to know how God created the<br>world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon, in the spectrum<br>of this or that element. I want to know His thoughts; the rest are<br>details.\"<br><br>Although Einstein said that he believed in a pantheistic God (a god that<br>*is* the universe), his comments admitting creation and divine thought<br>better describe a theistic God. And as "irritating" as it may be, his<br>theory of General Relativity stands today as one of the strongest lines<br>of evidence supporting the existence of a theistic God.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
