<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Peace officers are empowered by their commission to<br>enforce the law. They are given broad authority to keep the peace. In<br>the course of performing their duties, they may require you to do<br>certain things. These things may not be directly codified in law, but<br>may be required in order to keep the peace. In all these circumstances,<br>an officer acting with prudence and sound judgment can order you to do<br>something and you are required by law to do it. The officer is not<br>required to stop and explain his reasoning before you are required to<br>comply.\<br>\<br>There are many examples that illustrate this. Let\'s say you are<br>photographer for a newspaper. You are waiting outside a hotel for a<br>celebrity to appear. Perfectly legal. An officer does not have authority<br>to tell you to vacate that area, so dojng so would not be a lawful<br>order. Or would it? What if there was a gas leak and a fire/explosion<br>hazard existed? In that case, he can tell you to leave the area and if<br>you refuse, you can be arrested. What if there was a large crowd of<br>reporters blocking passage on the sidewalk? Because of the quantity of<br>people congregating they can tell you to move, especially if you are<br>blocking a public thoroughfare or an exit. You are there lawfully but<br>the police can still order you to move and you still must comply. The<br>law does not give you the right to interfere with the officer while in<br>the commission of his duties nor does it allow you to argue with him.<br>Feel free to argue with the judge after you are arrested.\<br>\<br>And it\'s possible that you didn\'t break any laws, and neither did the<br>officer, and so the judge just sends everyone home. But again, that\'s<br>why the judge is the arbiter of the law.\<br>\<br>What if you are on the side of the road in a traffic stop and you get<br>out of your car? Can the officer tell you to get back in your car? It\'s<br>not illegal for you to be outside of a car. But the officer may feel<br>that it is too unsafe, for you and for him, for you to be outside of the<br>car. In such a case, he can order you in the car and you must comply or<br>face arrest.\<br>\<br>Basically, if the officer can justify his order to a judge (not to you),<br>and it furthers the commission of his duties under the law, it is lawful<br>for him to give it, and mandatory for you to obey it.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
