You tell us its illegal to<br>discriminate, yet you do it? How can you make a law, turn around and<br>break it?**<br><br>Remember there is not one "government." There are 52 governments, and<br>only one of them is a Federal government.<br><br>I mention this because the rules are different in every state. In some<br>states, gun rights are never denied to felons (example: Alaska.<br>Convicted felons cannot *conceal* firearms). In some states, non-violent<br>felons can get their rights reinstated after a period of time following<br>their release. Depending on what rights are reinstated will determine<br>whether or not the Federal rights are reinstated as well. If, in your<br>state, *all* rights are reinstated, then the Federal prohibition on guns<br>is also lifted. However, if only your *gun rights* are reinstated at the<br>state level, but not your other citizen's rights (such as the right to<br>vote and the right to serve on a jury), then the Federal ban is still<br>intact and possession of a gun would still be a Federal crime.<br><br>Denying guns to any class of people (mentally defective, violent felons,<br>etc) would be a *Constitutional* violation, if it was a violation at<br>all. However, you must know that there are competing interests in the<br>Constitution. Yes, there is a Second Amendment which says that the right<br>to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. But there is also the<br>admonition that the State provide for the common defense and promote the<br>general welfare. States have decided that violent felons and people who<br>are mentally defective should not own guns, in furtherance of the<br>"general welfare." Is that an *infringement* in the words of the Second<br>Amendment? You may think so, but the Supreme Court has said that it is<br>not.<br><br>In general, a Constitutional right can be *restricted* so long as it<br>furthers a compelling state interest, and it is done in the least<br>restrictive way to the holders of that right. Doing so does not<br>constitute *infringement* as far as the Constitution is concerned.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
