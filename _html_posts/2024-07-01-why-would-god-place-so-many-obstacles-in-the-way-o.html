<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What is your evidence of this? You claim that God is *actively making it<br>harder* for people to do good thigs, while He is *actively making it<br>easier* for people to do bad things. What makes you think God is doing<br>it?<br><br>First of all, you must realize that in order to make this assertion, you<br>must assume that God exists. Not sure if that's what you wanted to<br>assert here, but in order to make the argument, you must make the<br>assumption. Second, in order to know that something is good or<br>bad, there must be an eternal standard of good which applies to<br>all people everywhere. Therefore, you also assume that moral absolutes<br>exist, and that God is the source of these absolutes.<br><br>God isn't the source of "good" because He created a rule. God is the<br>source of "good" because *He is the rule.* Since "good" is following<br>God's Word, and "bad" is doing the opposite, the fact that "good" and<br>"bad" exist are because God (the source of all that is good) exists.<br><br>In addition, God (whether you believe in Him or not) is necessarily (by<br>definition) *omnipotent*, which means "all-powerful." This omnipotence<br>is basically a motive force; it means that God has unlimited power to do<br>things. *If it is capable of being done, God has the power to do it.*<br>But this also implies that there are certain things that God cannot do:<br>He cannot do something which is impossible to do.<br><br>One of the things that God cannot do is actively deny His nature. We<br>know this because we are designed in God's image, and we too are capable<br>of doing anything which we are capable of doing; we cannot do things<br>which we are not capable of doing. For example, I can walk across a<br>bridge, run across a bridge, or skip across a bridge. But I am unable to<br>fly across a bridge, because as a human, I am unable to fly. Therefore,<br>what I can do (and what God has the capability to do) is limited by our<br>very natures.<br><br>So what does all of that mean?<br><br>- God is the definition of good.<br>- God cannot deny His own nature.<br>- Therefore, God can never actively do bad, or actively deny doing good,<br>  because it is in opposition to His nature.<br><br>\<br><br>So what does all of this mean? It means that what appears to be<br>obstacles to doing good, or enablement of doing bad, **must have another<br>source.** *It cannot, by definition, be God.*<br><br>So is there another force in the universe which is *actively* trying to<br>deny God and His will? Indeed there is. It is the one who God kicked out<br>of Heaven for trying to take all the glory. It is the one who (along<br>with his minions) actively encourages people to deny God. It is the one<br>who actively puts obstacles in the way of you connecting with God and<br>doing God's will.<br><br>That's right: it's Satan and his demons. It is Satan who actively is<br>trying to separate you from God. It is Satan who actively puts obstacles<br>in your path to doing God's will, trying to get you to question God and<br>His promises. It is Satan who actively assists those who choose evil in<br>the conduction of that evil, "greasing the skids," as it were, to do<br>those evil things, *because the more you do evil, the more you are<br>separated from God.*<br><br>It simply makes more logical sense to presume that God cannot be the<br>source of the obstacles to doing His will; it must be Satan and His<br>minions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
