Even<br>though the placard is no longer there, the sentiment remains. People<br>associate the president with the current economy.<br><br>But Biden didn't get us into this mess. Granted, he is not really doing<br>anything which will help get us out (and in many ways, he directly did<br>things which have made it worse), but if you're asking specifically<br>about the supply-chain issues which are driving up the cost of beef,<br>Biden didn't do that himself.<br><br>The COVID economic crisis and subsequent supply issues really explains<br>exactly what is happening right now:<br><br>- COVID closed a number of meatpacking plants, and when they re-opened,<br>  social distancing requirements made them work less efficiently,<br>  reducing their output.<br>- Drought has ravaged the grazing land for cows. The droughts across the<br>  west in both 2020 and 2021 have been tough for ranchers, reducing the<br>  number of heads of cattle, and reducing the size per cow by an average<br>  of 15 pounds. Nearly 1/3 of US head of cattle have been grazing in<br>  drought conditions over the past two years.<br>- That same drought, and the supply chain issues, have caused feed grain<br>  prices to skyrocket. While cows spend their early days grazing, they<br>  are eventually sent to a feed lot where they graze on corn and other<br>  grains. If the price of the grain goes up, the rancher makes less per<br>  head.<br><br>All of this means that ranchers earn less, which ultimately means that<br>beef costs more.<br><br>If supply-side economics works, then the right approach is to do<br>nothing. Higher prices mean that ranchers will raise more cattle,<br>meatpackers will expand operations, and consumers will buy more pork and<br>chicken to make up for the increases in beef prices. Eventually, the<br>market will equalize, and beef prices will come back down.<br><br>But the Biden administration has as its goal improving the resiliency of<br>the beef marketplace, noting that only four major meatpackers dominate<br>the meatpacking portion of the domestic beef operation. He wants to<br>encourage small packers to go up against the Big Four, as they are<br>known, and he wants to contribute about \$500 million in loans to do it.<br><br>Except that's not going to help us out in the near term. It takes years<br>to get a meatpacking operation built out and approved to start<br>processing beef. One of these large sized plants, all in, from concept<br>to full operations, can take well over a year and \$200 million to<br>start, so \$500 million isn't going to buy a lot of resiliency.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>The price of beef is skyrocketing and soon to be an expensive luxury<br>that few can afford. Do Republicans blame Biden for this?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
