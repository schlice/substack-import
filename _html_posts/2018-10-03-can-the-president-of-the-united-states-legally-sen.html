<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can the president of the United States, legally, send everyone any<br>message he wants using the Emergency Alert System?**<br><br>In general, no.<br><br>The Emergency Alert System has been designed to be used in the event of<br>national emergency. Broadcasters work in cooperation with FEMA, the FCC<br>and NOAA to broadcast messages related to national or regional<br>emergencies.<br><br>The important point to remember: **the EAS is a "last-ditch" method to<br>get the word out if the President is unable to get to the media.** For<br>example, during the September 11, 2001 attacks against the United<br>States, the government opted not to use the EAS because the media was<br>fully engaged and was adequately getting the word out.<br><br>In short, so long as the President still has access to Twitter, it's<br>unlikely he'd be able to use the EAS.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
