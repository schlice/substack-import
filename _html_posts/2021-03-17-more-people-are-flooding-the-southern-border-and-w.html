<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**More people are flooding the southern border and watch list terrorists<br>are coming across. How is this Biden\'s fault?**<br><br>Biden campaigned on loosening immigration controls. He also indicated<br>that he would halt construction of the border wall, would end Trump's<br>policy of "wait in Mexico" for asylum, and would halt all deportations.<br>Since he has been elected, he offered an immigration bill that would<br>give them a path to citizenship, which has only exacerbated the problem.<br><br>Predictably, this signaled to many migrants that it would be easier to<br>get in to the United States if he were elected, and they would be less<br>likely to be deported and would be more likely to be able to stay<br>permanently now that he has been.<br><br>Doing this **without addressing the need for increased security at the<br>border** has, again predictably, led to a border crisis. Yes, many<br>voters wanted a better approach than what Trump offered. But trying to<br>placate his base while ignoring the need for more enforcement, without a<br>solid plan for the (predictable) increase in migrant activity at the<br>border has only made this problem worse. More migrants are now<br>attempting riskier desert crossings, placing more people at risk.<br><br>Surges in immigration tend to be coupled with hope. Biden gave hope of a<br>kinder, gentler immigration process, without addressing what to do when<br>the surge actually took place.<br><br>**TL;DR: The current crisis at the border is 100% caused by Biden's<br>campaigning promises and subsequent policy initiatives.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
