<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Are businesses with \"Mandatory Face Mask\" policies violating Title<br>III of the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA")?**<br><br>In general, no.<br><br>Businesses are required to provide reasonable accommodations to<br>persons with disabilities.<br><br>Most businesses have determined that allowing anyone to enter without a<br>face mask is an unreasonable risk to everyone else in the store.<br><br>Instead the business provides *other, more reasonable* accommodations,<br>which don't include coming into the store without a mask: curbside<br>delivery, car-side delivery, free home delivery, etc. Most businesses<br>are extremely willing to work with anyone who cannot wear a mask, so<br>long as they don't come in to the store.<br><br>Additionally, it is generally accepted that a person who cannot wear a<br>face mask can instead wear a face shield and it will provide reasonable<br>protection against their droplets. Not all businesses allow this<br>workaround, though.<br><br>So long as the business provides reasonable accommodations, they do not<br>have to provide *every* accommodation requested by the disabled<br>person.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
