<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [\"Hate speech\" is actually a crime in the United States.<br>\"Hate groups\" are not.\<br>\<br>Speech that \"incites riots\" is illegal in this country, and we have<br>recently passed \"hate speech\" laws which attempts to determine what<br>the speaker was thinking at the time he spoke, and if we determine that<br>the person was speaking with an animosity to a specific protected class<br>in society, we can add the qualifier \"hate speech\" to any crime<br>involving speech, which increases penalties.\<br>\<br>Since free association is still legal under the First Amendment, any<br>group is free to associate. We do not ban any particular group from<br>associating. Many incidents of Nazi impersonators are documented where<br>local authorities requested that these people remove their swastikas for<br>fear of inciting riots.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
