<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Don\'t you think Trump should be investigated for claiming there\'s<br>voter fraud in vote by mail? He seems to know something about it or he<br>maybe contemplating to do it.**<br><br>No.<br><br>Last I checked, the First Amendment was still a thing. If you have<br>evidence that Trump has committed a crime, or will be committing a<br>crime, bring it to a Federal prosecutor. Otherwise, "contemplating" a<br>crime is not illegal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
