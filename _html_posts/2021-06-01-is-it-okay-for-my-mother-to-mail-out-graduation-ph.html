Okay, in this context, has a few<br>meanings.<br><br>If you mean "okay" as in "is it legal," the answer is yes in the US<br>anyway. Your mother is still your legal guardian and makes decisions on<br>your behalf until the day you turn 18.<br><br>If you mean "okay" as in "is it good parenting to ignore your wishes"<br>then the answer is probably not. At your age, you're going to remember<br>this as you go off and start your life, and there's a good chance that<br>this incident will weigh heavily on how much interaction you have with<br>your mother after you're out on your own.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**Is it okay for my mother to mail out graduation photos even though I<br>specifically asked her not to; and even when I compromised and told her<br>what photos were okay to send, she still chose my least favorite (I made<br>a point that I hated it)?**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
