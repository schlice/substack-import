<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Where does the US Constitution specifically call out the<br>responsibility of Congress to oversee the Executive branch of<br>government?**<br><br>As with many things in the Constitution, it may not necessarily contain<br>those words, but it contains those ideas. We can also look at the<br>thoughts of the people who wrote the Constitution. A collection of<br>documents known as *The Federalist Papers* details what the framers of<br>the Constitution were thinking when they wrote what they did. Federalist<br>number 51 defines the principles we're discussing: *checks and<br>balances.*<br><br>Checks and balances has a full Constitutional tradition, even though<br>those words were never listed in the Constitution. Each one of the three<br>branches of government is *co-equal*; that is, no one branch is more<br>powerful than the others. The powers of each branch are carefully<br>defined, and in each case, the power to *oversee the other branches* is<br>also clearly defined.
