It's always the next<br>thing that's going to "destroy Trump."<br><br>They just don't get it.<br><br>Trump is Republican Clinton. He's the new Teflon President. We all said<br>that Clinton should be called "Slick Willie" because "nothing sticks to<br>him." And it was true. Nothing stuck to him, really.<br><br>Trump is exactly the same. Nothing sticks to him. They can literally<br>throw anything they want at him. Felony conviction? Check. Sex abuse<br>scandal? Check. Bullets? Check. Epstein's list? Check. *Nothing sticks<br>to this man.* And nothing will.<br><br>And he's *still* fixing the country *despite* their desire to not do so.<br><br>You know, if Dems had *an actual platform* to run on, they might have<br>something better to do than trying to "destroy Trump," but alas, they<br>have nothing better to offer besides *more of the same*, and it's clear<br>that more than half of the country doesn't want *more of the same*.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
