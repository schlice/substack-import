<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If you travel internationally, you should always record in your phone<br>the direct-dial number to your local emergency services back home. In<br>America, you actually reach the same 911 operator, but you use a<br>"non-emergency" line to do it. Being that you are actually out of the<br>country, I think that the operator would give you a pass for reporting<br>an emergency on the non-emergency line.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
