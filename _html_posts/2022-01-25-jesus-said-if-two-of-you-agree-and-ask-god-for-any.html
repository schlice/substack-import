<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'm going to question your very premise.<br><br>You said, "Jesus said if two of you agree and ask God for anything, God<br>would do it." So are you sure about that? Because I really want laser<br>beam eyes. I mean really, really want laser beam eyes. So if I find a<br>buddy who also wants me to have laser beam eyes, if we get together and<br>ask God for it, he will do it?<br><br>Woohoo, here comes laser beam eyes!<br><br>So clearly, I'm questioning your assertion. Because last time I checked,<br>God did what *he* wanted to do. He's not a spiritual vending machine.<br>You don't get to walk up to him and if you push the right buttons you<br>get out what you want. It doesn't work that way.<br><br>God is already working in your life. A *better, more useful* prayer<br>would be to have God teach you what he's doing in your life, and to<br>bring you up to speed so that you can be a part of his plan. Ask God to<br>show you his plan for your life, and to allow you to participate.<br><br>Secondly, evil has no power unless people give it power. Evil has no<br>power over you. Evil only has the power you give it. If you give evil<br>form, and substance, and effort, it will flourish. If you ignore evil,<br>it will vanish. It has no substance on its own. Evil is simply the<br>perversion of the good things God has for you. For example, adultery is<br>simply the perversion of God's provision of marriage. If you don't give<br>evil an audience, it can have no control over your life.<br><br>Third, God allows evil in the world because we have free will, and he<br>wants us to be able to freely choose him, *or the alternative*. There<br>has to be an alternative, and it has to be at least somewhat attractive,<br>in order for our choice to be truly free. Because if God comes in and<br>obliterates evil, we would have no choice but to follow him, and that is<br>a perversion of free will, which God also does not desire for us.<br><br>I truly don't know where Christians got this idea that being Christian<br>meant God would make an easy life for you, as if God would skip ahead of<br>us with his cosmic leaf blower, sweeping away all evil from our paths.<br>Last I checked, even the greats of the Bible had some very hard lives.<br><br>So instead of asking God to sweep away evil, how about instead *you*<br>banish evil from your own heart and your own mind, and teach others to<br>do it too? This will diminish evil's power over you, and will ultimately<br>allow people to triumph over evil.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Jesus said if two of you agree and ask God for anything, God would do<br>it. I pray God diminish the power of evil until they are incredibly weak<br>and powerless. If God would do it would you pray with me or refuse to?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
