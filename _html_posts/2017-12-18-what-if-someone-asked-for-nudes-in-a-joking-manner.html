<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As long as the people are "of age," where is a "report" going to be<br>filed? Asking a question is not a crime, unless you are asking a<br>prostitute to have sex for money, but even in that circumstance, the<br>question is not the crime; the exchange of money for sex is the crime.<br><br>Nevertheless, there is no law in the United States that prevents people<br>who are not minors from asking for nudes.<br><br>However, if you're at work, it might be a different story. The person<br>being asked might consider it harassment to have been asked for nudes,<br>and report you to HR, in which case the worst that could happen is you<br>lose your job.<br><br>If you're at school, there is a good chance that one or both of you are<br>underage. If either the asker or the asked person are underage, and you<br>are at school, you have likely violated one of your school rules (check<br>your Student Handbook to be sure) and the worst that could happen is<br>that you get expelled. If your School Resource Officer gets involved,<br>you could be found guilty of solicitation of, or distribution of, child<br>pornography, which is a whole bucket of nope that you don't want to be<br>involved in. If either the asker or the asked party is under 18 in the<br>United States, don't.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
