<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Former CIA Director Michael Hayden lied about torture to keep people<br>in Guantanamo and claimed Muslim immigration would destabilise Europe.<br>How does he have any moral authority to compare Trump\'s family<br>separations at the border with Auschwitz?**<br><br>Let's break this down.<br><br>The first sentence is irrelevant. It has nothing to do with the question<br>you asked.<br><br>So let's focus on the question instead:<br><br>**How does he have any moral authority to compare Trump\'s family<br>separations at the border with Auschwitz?**<br><br>No one has any moral authority to compare treatment of illegal<br>immigrants to anything, nor is moral authority required to make a<br>comparison.<br><br>As to the comparison, it's always a losing argument when you compare<br>anything to Hitler, Nazism, or the Holocaust. Once you feel like you<br>have to invoke Hitler, you've already lost the argument.<br><br>But in any case, on any *objective, fact-based analysis*, **enforcing US<br>immigration law is light years away from the Holocaust.**<br><br>Read a book, for crying out loud. These incessant cries of "Trump is<br>Hitler," "The Southern Border is Auschwitz" are really just plain<br>stupid. People entering this country illegally have broken US<br>immigration law and are treated as criminals (as opposed to previous<br>administrations who simply let them go in a practice called "catch and<br>release", which this president's policy stopped). The Jews did nothing<br>illegal. I mean, the sheer audacity of someone comparing enforcing<br>legally-passed and court-reviewed immigration law at a nation's border<br>to the systematic killing of Jews simply because they are Jewish is<br>literally just staggering.<br><br>It's a lazy argument at best; it's insulting and morally reprehensible<br>at worst.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
