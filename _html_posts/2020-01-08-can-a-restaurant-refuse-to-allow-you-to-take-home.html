<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can a restaurant refuse to allow you to take home the leftovers?<br><br>Yes they can; however, they run into an issue with what food was paid<br>for. And we're not talking about buffets here, which clearly can post<br>signs saying eat as much as you want while you're here but you don't get<br>to take leftovers home.<br><br>If the restaurant serves the food to the customer, they cannot re-use<br>that food. Per health codes in the US, if it hits the customer's table,<br>it is spent. It cannot be re-used. So anything that doesn't get eaten<br>gets thrown away.<br><br>The issue arises if the customer wants to take the leftovers home (which<br>they've already paid for) and the restaurant refuses. In that<br>circumstance, the restaurant would need to pro-rate the meal based on<br>what portion the restaurant would rather throw away than allow the<br>customer to take. I'm not paying for \$20 worth of food and only getting<br>\$10 worth, and allowing the restaurant to throw away \$10 worth. If I<br>eat half of the meal and the restaurant doesn't allow me to take the<br>rest of it home, I won't pay for the half they wouldn't allow me to<br>keep.<br><br>The only exception would be if this policy were clearly posted somewhere<br>(no leftovers, no pro-rata) and it were clearly articulated and you<br>agreed before you ordered. I have never encountered a restaurant where<br>this was a thing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
