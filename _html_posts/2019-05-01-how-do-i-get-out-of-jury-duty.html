<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How is one to get out of jury duty legally?<br><br>Before we get started, let's be clear. If you have a driver's license,<br>you can be selected for jury duty. Jury duty is one of your civic<br>responsibilities. That means, if you're a citizen, it's one of your<br>responsibilities to participate in the justice system.<br><br>Here's the important point to remember: Don't forget **the Golden<br>Rule**. If you'd want a jury of your peers should you end up behind the<br>defendant's table, then you have to do your part and serve as a "peer"<br>for someone else. The system only works when we all participate.<br><br>OK, now that the duty part is out of the way, how do you legally get out<br>of jury duty? There are a few methods you can use.<br><br>1.  Get a doctor's note. I'm not telling you to lie, but some<br>    medical conditions are disqualifying for jury duty. Check with the<br>    county or city where you've been summoned and see what is a<br>    disqualifying condition. If you have one of those conditions, you<br>    may not need to serve.<br>2.  Go back to school. In some cities, full-time students don't need<br>    to serve on a jury. But make sure this is an exemption where you<br>    live before you start enrolling in college courses just to get out<br>    of jury duty.<br>3.  Plead hardship. While you do receive a stipend for sitting on a<br>    jury, it's not your usual paycheck. If you're the sole provider in<br>    your household and you get paid hourly, the stipend may not cover<br>    your family's needs, and you can rightly claim a hardship because<br>    you'd be unable to work.<br>4.  Request a postponement. You can legally request to postpone your<br>    duty until another time. Generally, there is a limit to the number<br>    of postponements you can request in a single calendar year, but if<br>    it's simply inconvenient to be on a jury at your scheduled time (or<br>    you actually have a conflict, like travel you've already arranged,<br>    or a function you can't miss, like a wedding), you can request to<br>    postpone your service.<br>5.  Be honest during jury selection. If you can't be impartial, or<br>    if you hate cops, or whatever might make you a bad choice for a<br>    juror, make sure you tell them. Being honest is important. If you<br>    truly can't be an impartial juror, you'll naturally be removed.<br><br>In summary, *try* to attend jury duty if you can. But if you can't, this<br>may help. Check the website for the jurisdiction in which you're<br>scheduled to serve. They have listings of all of the disqualifications<br>for duty. You may meet one or more of those criteria already. Many<br>jurisdictions even allow you to request an excusal or a postponement<br>online.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
