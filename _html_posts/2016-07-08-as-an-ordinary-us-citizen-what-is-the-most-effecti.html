<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Education. This is the most important thing you can do.<br><br>If you don't own a gun, go down to your local gun range and take an<br>"introduction to firearms" course. Almost every gun range I know offers<br>one. It's inexpensive and gives you a comprehensive introduction to what<br>firearms are, what they do, and what they feel like when you fire them.<br>In this way, you too can separate the facts from the hype when it comes<br>to what you're told.<br><br>If you do own a gun, store it safely. There are numerous gun safes<br>which, using technology, allow you almost instantaneous access to your<br>gun while keeping it out of the hands of bad guys or curious visitors to<br>your home.<br><br>Once you're educated, teach others about gun safety. Teach them that<br>law-abiding gun owners are not the enemy. Law-abiding gun owners are the<br>safest group in this country, as they tend to also follow other laws<br>just as carefully.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
