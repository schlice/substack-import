Life's value is not determined by your financial solvency.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Should those who have a fetus in the womb that is inflicted with an<br>ailment such as Anencephaly be required to go through a financial<br>background check so that if they fail to pass the test then doctors<br>would immediately abort the fetus?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
