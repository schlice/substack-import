<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In most states, the state's attorney can prosecute a case even without<br>the victim's cooperation or permission.<br><br>First, the crime is against the *state*, not against an individual. Yes,<br>there is a physical victim, but the case in court is called *People*<br>*v. Joe Schmuckatelli.* The crime is against *the state*, not against<br>the victim. Therefore, the state's attorney does not need the<br>cooperation or the permission of the victim in order to prosecute, if<br>sufficient evidence of the crime is available without the victim's<br>(willing)ยน testimony.<br><br>This will particularly happen in cases of domestic violence. In a<br>disproportionate number of DV cases, the victim is too afraid to press<br>charges, and the state has a strong interest in protecting potential<br>future victims if the perpetrator is not stopped.<br><br>So if the "hurting of a child" is a *domestic violence* situation, the<br>district attorney will likely proceed with the case even if the victim<br>doesn't want to press charges.<br><br>ยน If the victim doesn't want to cooperate but their testimony is needed,<br>the DA can subpoena the victim and compel them to testify.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
