<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's review the statute first:<br><br>*A private person may arrest another:*<br><br>*1. For a public offense committed or attempted in his presence.*<br><br>*2. When the person arrested has committed a felony although not in his<br>presence.*<br><br>*3. When a felony has been in fact committed, and he has reasonable<br>cause for believing the person arrested to have committed it.*<br><br>Well, the first clause is pretty easy: the offense was committed or<br>attempted in his presence. The third clause is also fairly<br>straightforward, and it does oddly apply the "reasonable cause"<br>provision which is also applied to law enforcement nationwide.<br><br>The second clause is a bit trickier. It says "when the person arrested<br>has committed a felony". There doesn't appear to be any supposition in<br>this clause as there is in the third clause, which applies the<br>reasonable cause standard.<br><br>It appears that the second and third clauses differ in this way:<br><br>In clause 2, in one way or another, we are positive that this person<br>committed this felony, but we didn't see it. There is no doubt<br>whatsoever. How, exactly, a "private person" could encounter such a<br>circumstance, I do not know. How you can be so positive that someone<br>could have committed a felony that you did not see is beyond me, and<br>seems to be a clause just waiting for some hapless citizen to try to use<br>as justification for citizen's arrest, only to be shredded by defense<br>counsel.<br><br>In clause 3, we know a felony has been committed. We have reasonable<br>cause to believe that the arrested person committed it. We may not be<br>positive, but we do meet the standard of reasonable belief. In other<br>words, a "reasonable person" would believe that this person committed<br>this felony. This clause would likely be favored far more than clause 2<br>as it only requires the "reasonable person" standard, not the absolute<br>standard required in clause 2.<br><br>*Would the proper construction of this merely mean one must have<br>probable cause, as within the orthodox treatment of criminal law in<br>general, or does this require that the state actually proceed on a<br>felony charge, and /or require the defendant must be convicted at<br>trial?*<br><br>There is nothing in the statute that requires the defendant be<br>convicted in order to meet the statutory requirements listed. *That<br>said,* if the district attorney decides not to press charges, it would<br>have to be determined whether or not that decision stems from the fact<br>that he believes the arrestor did or did not meet the burden of proof<br>listed in the statute. If he is not pressing charges because he believes<br>the statutory requirements for arrest were not met, this sets the<br>arrestor up to be charged with false arrest.<br><br>*Notably, the latter constructions would't seem to make sense, given the<br>fact that prosecutors may be politically motivated for not filing a<br>charge, and a conviction is largely based upon prosecutorial<br>performance, and given the fact that juries may acquit the defendant for<br>any line of reason they choose (i.e. jury nullification.)*<br><br>You've put the cart before the horse. We're talking about the statute<br>for legally placing a person under citizen's arrest. Even the police<br>arrest people whom prosecutors choose to "not charge" and whom then are<br>released. What the district attorney's office chooses to do is up to<br>them. This statute is clearly structured to give legal abilities for<br>private citizens to effect an arrest when certain circumstances are<br>present.<br><br>That said, I'd never trust a statute to fully protect me unless that was<br>its design. For example, the Good Samaritan laws in effect in most<br>states protect persons who stop to help at the scene of an accident. The<br>specifics differ by state, but in most cases, if reasonable care was<br>taken, even if the volunteer injures the victim further, he is<br>indemnified against lawsuits, both civil and criminal. These laws are,<br>in fact, designed to encourage volunteers to assist, as sometimes the<br>difference between life and death is starting CPR that much sooner<br>before the ambulance arrives. However, even these laws are not<br>foolproof, and victims who are saddled with massive bills for ambulances<br>and doctors will try to extract payment from any place they can. I<br>wouldn't put it past them to try to sue, even in the face of Good<br>Samaritan laws. Nothing personal, just business.<br><br>This law is not designed to indemnify the arrestor against lawsuit. It<br>is designed to provide a legal framework under which a person can effect<br>a citizen's arrest. Bottom line: I wouldn't do it. In today's litigious<br>society, the risk is far too great, and this law has more holes than a<br>sieve. Instead, you're much better served if you can ***be a good<br>witness.*** Remember or record anything and everything you see. Remember<br>the who/what/when/where/why/how, and report them to law enforcement as<br>soon as you can safely do so. Everyone has a phone, 95% of those have<br>cameras. Take pictures or record video.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
