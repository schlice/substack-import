<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can certainly press charges. I wouldn't expect any *criminal*<br>charges to apply, so it's likely you're going to try to sue for battery<br>or some other civil charge. But if it was *mutual combat*, as you<br>state, expect the other party to press the same charges (if it was truly<br>mutual, what applies to you applies to the other party). And if criminal<br>charges applied, you'd both be arrested.<br><br>What, exactly, do you think will happen when you go to court?<br><br>The judge will fine both of you and send you on your way.<br><br>So in the end, you'll both just end up spending all kinds of money that<br>you could probably spend better elsewhere, and I'm not sure anyone will<br>feel better.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
