<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **Trump himself wouldn\'t be able to qualify as an air traffic<br>> controller because he\'s a felon**<br><br>Starting off your question with an incorrect assertion is usually not a<br>good start. You absolutely can be an air traffic controller with a<br>felony conviction, **so long as the conviction was not for alcohol or<br>drug charges.**<br><br>> **but he gets to author the standards by which all air traffic<br>> controllers are hired**<br><br>Well, not exactly. It's the FAA who authors those standards. Yes, he is<br>the *de facto* head of the FAA, since it is an Executive branch<br>administration, and he certainly has a great deal of input into what<br>rules are implemented, but no, he does not write that regulation.<br><br>Now, no one is claiming that DEI actually caused the crashes we<br>experienced. But it is an open secret in the aviation industry that some<br>DEI initiatives could have potentially led to a lowering of standards in<br>certain situations, particularly when qualifications were closely<br>matched between candidates. The fact that DEI was even a factor in<br>hiring is what may have potentially led to a less qualified candidate<br>being hired. The FAA, for its part, denies that standards for air<br>traffic controllers were ever lowered. But again, there's that open<br>secret about airline hiring practices related to DEI initiatives...<br><br>> he\'s 2 weeks in office & 67 people are dead, are the skies safe?<br><br>The short answer is "it's too early to say." It appears that the<br>helicopter crash was pilot error on the part of the helicopter pilot,<br>and the Philadelphia crash was catastrophic aircraft failure caused by a<br>fire on board. Until we know more, we can't really say how preventable<br>those crashes were and whether or not any administration policies would<br>have even made a difference.<br><br>Let's be patient and let cooler heads prevail for a while.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
