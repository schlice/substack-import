<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [As quickly as you can sign the papers and pay the filing<br>fees.\<br>\<br>However, if you expect to get alimony, some states require that you have<br>to have been married for a certain period of time first.\<br>\<br>Most states award \"rehabilitative alimony\" which means that the court<br>wants to make sure a spouse gets back on his/her feet after a divorce.<br>Regardless of the length of the marriage, the requesting spouse\'s<br>ablity to get back into the workplace will ultimately determine whether<br>or not, and to what extent, alimony will be awarded.\<br>\<br>To the best of my knowledge, only California and Texas require a<br>marriage to be a certain length before awarding<br>alimony.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
