<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can\'t do anything by yourself. While laudable, you simply don\'t<br>have enough inertia. And if events like Columbine or Sandy Hook or<br>Aurora couldn\'t generate enough momentum, neither can you personally.<br><br>You should look into partnering with organizations like [[the Brady<br>Center](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c0015e&url=http://www.bradycampaign.org/bradycenter){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bradycampaign.org"}]{.qlink_container}, [[Moms Demand<br>Action](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=58b4fa&url=http://momsdemandaction.org/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="momsdemandaction.org"}]{.qlink_container}, and the<br>[[Violence Policy<br>Center](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5f280c&url=http://www.vpc.org/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="vpc.org"}]{.qlink_container}. These organizations are all<br>working towards a gun-free America, albeit in different ways.<br><br>You should definitely look at voting Democrat. Hillary Clinton has a<br>very strong anti-gun policy. She has made plain that she wants to roll<br>back the *Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act* so that victims of<br>gun violence can sue the manufacturer of that gun. She would like to<br>destroy the gun manufacturing industry in the United States by suing<br>them out of existence. Bernie Sanders doesn\'t have quite as radical a<br>view against PLCAA, but as a Democrat, he is most definitely anti-gun by<br>definition.<br><br>You might try taking different tacks as well, like successfully suing<br>Ford when a drunk driver kills a family, or suing Ginsu when a knife is<br>used to commit a murder. You might be able to generate some anti-gun<br>momentum that way.<br><br>It\'s definitely an uphill climb, but \"the journey of a thousand miles<br>begins with just one step.\"<br><br>By the way, I\'m pro-gun. I do what I want.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
