<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The only way that your brother would not have been able to buy firearms<br>in the US is if he was determined by a court to be a mental defective.<br><br>If this is the case, and he has sufficiently recovered, and he can go<br>back to court to prove that he has indeed improved, he can have that<br>determination stricken, in which case he can once again buy guns.<br><br>If a court never ruled him as a mental defective, then he would not have<br>been barred from purchasing firearms in the first place. Medical<br>histories and interactions between doctors and patients are covered by<br>doctor-patient privilege and are legally protected.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
