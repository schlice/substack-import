<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's look at this a different way.<br><br>Gravity is universal, right? I mean, you know, with **100%<br>certainty***,* that gravity works on *every dropped object?*<br><br>If you're honest, you say "no, I don't know for 100% certain, but pretty<br>darn close to 100%."<br><br>That's correct. Even gravity, which we're pretty sure works against<br>every dropped object, isn't 100% certain, because you personally have<br>not seen every dropped object. That said, we believe gravity is **true<br>beyond a reasonable doubt**. In fact, the level of uncertainty is so<br>small, that we sometimes call it the "law" of gravity. But while that<br>level of uncertainty *approaches* zero, it is never *actually* zero.<br><br>That's valid, and everyone agrees with the fact that gravity is true<br>beyond a reasonable doubt.<br><br>Now, let's look at evolution versus creation. Can you say, with 100%<br>certainty, that we evolved from single-celled organisms (from goo, to<br>you, through the zoo)? No, if you're honest, you can't say that either.<br>Neither can you say that the first life was caused by intelligence with<br>100% certainty.<br><br>The evolutionist believes that there is a *greater degree of certainty*<br>that life evolved from spontaneously generated single-cell life forms.<br>Similarly, the creationist believes that there is a *greater degree of<br>certainty* that intelligence formed the first life.<br><br>There is indeed evidence on both sides. Evolutionists have *physical*<br>evidence, which creationists cannot produce, since the creator would<br>necessarily have to exist outside of the physical. Intellectually<br>dishonest evolutionists attempt to cut off the argument there; if it's<br>not material, then it doesn't exist, they say. But even evolutionists<br>believe that certain things exist which are not material. So they<br>already believe that materialism is not a valid refutation of<br>creationism, but that's why we call them intellectually dishonest.<br><br>Creationists are sometimes hobbled by their reliance on religious texts<br>and the circular logic which sometimes surrounds them. Apologetics<br>attempts to cut through this with true reason and logic, but all too<br>often, they are so stuck on their dogma that they can't see past it.<br>Evolutionists are sometimes hobbled by their reliance on materialism<br>that they pre-load their assumptions of materialism into their<br>conclusions, which ruins the scientific method because it naturally<br>rules out some potential causes. In addition, some evolutionists have<br>formed *volitional* objections to even the idea that some sort of<br>intelligence could have been involved in the formation of the first<br>life.<br><br>You would need serious creationist apologists not bound to their<br>religious texts to sit down with open-minded, intellectual evolutionists<br>who are not bound to the idea of materialism to discover if there is any<br>understanding which can be gleaned from each other.<br><br>In my time, I have discovered that this is a tall order. So the two<br>sides just blast away at each other's sacred cows, and no one makes any<br>progress.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why do creationists blast evolution because it is just a theory, but not<br>gravity or other theories?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
