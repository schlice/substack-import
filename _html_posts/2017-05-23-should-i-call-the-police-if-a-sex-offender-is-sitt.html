<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Question Details:*<br>><br>> *This guy comes here everyday and sits in his car and sometimes eats<br>> lunch, but don\'t you think the police should be monitoring him and<br>> making sure he\'s kept under surveillance?*<br><br>No.<br><br>You really don't need more context than that.<br><br>Apparently though, Quora wants our answers to be more complete. So let<br>me supply some details.<br><br>Sex Offender List does not equal 24x7 Surveillance. Someone on the<br>sex offender list must register their home address and must notify the<br>police if they move. They will be judged every time they seek<br>employment, try to open a credit card, or get a loan. But they don't get<br>24x7 police surveillance. They are not "monitored." They are "tracked,"<br>meaning the police know where they live. If a sex assault happens within<br>a certain distance of where they live, guess who will be the prime<br>suspect.<br><br>Sex offenders have not lost any Constitutional rights. They have<br>every other right that you and I have. They can go wherever they please<br>(with the possible exception of schools depending on the state). He's<br>perfectly allowed to sit in his car and eat lunch. He probably gets<br>shunned from any other place he could go to eat his lunch, so it's<br>likely the solitude of his car is the only place he feels safe.<br><br>Please don't call the police unless you'd like to report a crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
