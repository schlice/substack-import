<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, *worshipping God* is only important to people who feel<br>like God deserves worship. They feel this way because they have been<br>*saved*. They have been guaranteed an eternity with Him after they die.<br><br>Sounds like everyone would want this, right? So the next logical<br>question then would be, "Okay, if 'being saved' is so important, why<br>don't we have a need or a motivation to get saved?"<br><br>The answer: free will. If we were *compelled* to do it (even by some<br>intrinsic need or extrinsic motivation), then we are not *truly* free to<br>choose.<br><br>God has built a system whereby you can freely choose to either love Him<br>or reject Him, and in this life, no consequences will flow from that<br>decision. And to make sure that choice is truly free, He places us in a<br>world filled with evidence of His existence, *but without His direct<br>presence*, which would be so powerful and awe-inspiring as to overcome<br>our free will and compel us to believe, negating our free will. In other<br>words, *God has provided enough evidence in this life to convince<br>anyone* *willing* *to believe, yet he has also left some ambiguity<br>so as not to compel the* *unwilling**.* In this way, God gives us<br>the opportunity either to love Him or to reject Him without violating<br>our freedom. In fact, the very purpose of this life is to make that<br>choice freely and without coercion. For love, by definition, must be<br>freely given. It cannot be coerced.<br><br>C. S. Lewis, in his *Screwtape Letters,* wrote the following regarding<br>God's ability to compel people to do things:<br><br>> the Irresistible and the Indisputable are the two weapons which the<br>> very nature of \God's\ scheme forbids Him to use. Merely to<br>> over-ride a human will (as His felt presence in any but the faintest<br>> and most mitigated degree would certainly do) would be for Him<br>> useless. He cannot ravish. He can only woo.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
