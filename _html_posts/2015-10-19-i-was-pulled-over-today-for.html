<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Laws are different in each state. Some states stipulate<br>that police vehicles must be perpendicular to the road. Colorado, for<br>example, stipulates that the radar must be captured from a marked police<br>vehicle (no unmarked cars clocking traffic), but does not dictate how<br>the vehicle must be positioned in order to capture speed. State laws<br>don\'t usually address the \"visibility\" of the car, as that is<br>subjective and is based on the position of the target vehicle in<br>relation to the police vehicle.\<br>\<br>If you were really speeding, and you got a ticket, just pay the fine and<br>do better next time.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
