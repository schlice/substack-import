<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I think I\'ll be foregoing the S6 unless I get the S6<br>Edge, but while it\'s beautiful, I think the lack of a removable battery<br>is a big hit for me. I bought two batteries and a charger on Amazon for<br>\$20, it\'s so easy to grab a spare battery and have it in your pocket,<br>change it out, and be back to working in no time, instead of having a<br>big power bank hanging off of your device for a few hours so your<br>battery can recharge.\<br>\<br>I guess it just opens the door for battery case makers again, and<br>assuming the battery case connects via USB, you can also have additional<br>storage in your battery case, since it does connect via USB to the<br>phone. So maybe the battery case manufacturer can add additional storage<br>using USB.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
