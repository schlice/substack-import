Some people may also experience impairment in thinking<br>> and judgment. You should avoid or limit the use of alcohol while being<br>> treated with lamoTRIgine. Do not use more than the recommended dose of<br>> lamoTRIgine, and avoid activities requiring mental alertness such as<br>> driving or operating hazardous machinery until you know how the<br>> medication affects you. It is important to tell your doctor about all<br>> other medications you use, including vitamins and herbs. Do not stop<br>> using any medication without first talking to your doctor.<br><br>\<br>(lamoTRIgine is the chemical name for Lamictal)\<br>\<br>I would advise you to be very cautious if you plan on drinking while on<br>Lamictal. If you are going to drink at all, don\'t drive, even if you<br>don\'t think you\'re going to drink enough to be drunk. The additive<br>effects on Lamictal can impair you even when you\'re not technically<br>drunk.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
