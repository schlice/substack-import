<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Essentially, it works out this way:\<br>]<br><br>- Congress raised your taxes to make healthcare more affordable for<br>  everyone. They did this by imposing a special tax which you will pay<br>  if you are not enrolled in an approved health insurance plan.<br>- You can \"opt out\" of paying this extra tax by buying an approved<br>  health insurance plan.\<br><br>Congress is not \"forcing\" you to buy health insurance. They are merely<br>raising your taxes. If you don\'t want your taxes raised, you can opt<br>out of the tax increase by buying a health insurance plan that is<br>approved under the ACA. Congress has the authority to raise your taxes.<br>They also have participated in social engineering projects through<br>taxation for a very long time, so this concept is nothing new.\<br>\<br>There was a great deal of controversy over this, since the authors of<br>the plan and its cheerleader-in-chief \"sold\" the plan to the American<br>people in a different way, using different plain language, than it was<br>actually implemented under the new law. This led to a lot of<br>misunderstanding and disrespect for the new mandates.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
