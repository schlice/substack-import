<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it possible to provide untested (therefore illegal) methods of<br>holistic health care to cure disease, by using a waiver to remove burden<br>of legal liability?**<br><br>Actually, the physician faces more legal liability for potential<br>mistakes than the holistic practitioner.<br><br>Now let's correct a misunderstanding. You said "untested (therefore<br>illegal)" and that is incorrect.<br><br>Untested does not equal illegal.<br><br>In the United States, if a holistic health provider wants to sell me oil<br>of oregano for my "leaky gut" he can do so. But it's outside of the<br>realm of regulated Western medicine, and the diagnosis and treatment<br>plan is not approved by the American Medical Association, and the<br>supplement is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.<br><br>That does not equate to "illegal." It equates to "untested by a<br>government-approved body" and therefore not able to print on a bottle<br>that it treats or cures any specific disease or condition. That's the<br>only thing that would be illegal.<br><br>Basically, if you believe that the only way you can stay safe is to have<br>AMA-approved doctors prescribing you (using a Federally-protected<br>prescription) a drug which has been approved by the FDA to treat the<br>condition diagnosed by the AMA-approved doctor, then holistics is not<br>for you.<br><br>The downside, of course, is that you could get in bed with a "snake oil<br>salesman." He may be selling you a supplement which hasn't been tested,<br>hasn't been proven to actually help your condition, and may possibly<br>contribute to making you worse. You have far fewer legal protections<br>when dealing with unlicensed holistic therapists.<br><br>But there is far less legal liability in going to a holistic doctor. You<br>do so knowing that it might help, or it might not. On the outside, it<br>might make you worse. That's all on you, and you generally do sign a<br>waiver indicating that the diagnoses are not endorsed by the AMA and the<br>supplements are not regulated by the FDA and at the outset it could make<br>you worse. When you visit a licensed, regulated physician in the United<br>States, you expect that the treatment will help you, not make you worse,<br>and the physician can be held liable if his treatment makes you worse.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
