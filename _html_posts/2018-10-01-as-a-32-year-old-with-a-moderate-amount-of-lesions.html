<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**As a 32-year-old with a moderate amount of lesions from multiple<br>sclerosis, do you think there is hope within the next 10 to 15 years of<br>some type of brain repair?**<br><br>When I was first diagnosed, I had well over 20 lesions and only one of<br>them wasn't a silent lesion. So I fully appreciate your question.<br><br>I will answer with two points.<br><br>Prolactin, when used with an interferon beta, [[has been<br>shown](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fedfd8&url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367923/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nih.gov"}]{.qlink_container} to have remyelinating<br>properties. But it also is a pro-inflammatory agent, so less ideal for<br>MS, in which the inflammation of the nerves precipitates most of the<br>symptoms. Not to mention (and especially important for me), pure<br>prolactin supplementation has been shown to produce male lactation. Um,<br>thanks but no thanks? Anyway, some groundbreaking work is ongoing right<br>now to understand prolactin's role in remyelination and to produce some<br>results in terms of repairing some of the lesions in the brain.<br><br>Secondly, I was on Tysabri for 18 months. It worked *so well*, that my<br>brain was actually able to repair itself. For the only time in the<br>history of my disease course, my lesions actually shrank while I was on<br>Tysabri. That's not anything that Tysabri did other than to shut down<br>disease process so thoroughly as to allow the brain the opportunity to<br>heal.<br><br>So not only are we very close to having a medication which could<br>potentially aid in remyelination, we currently have approved MS therapy<br>drugs that work so well that the body can, in fact, heal itself.<br><br>So to answer your question: yes, I firmly believe that we will have<br>some restorative treatments within the next 15 years.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
