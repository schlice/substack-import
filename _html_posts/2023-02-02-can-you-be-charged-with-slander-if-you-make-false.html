<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Slander (like its printed cousin libel) is part of a family of offenses<br>called *defamation*.<br><br>There are four elements which are required to exist in order to prove<br>*prima facie* defamation:<br><br>1.  a false statement purporting to be fact<br>2.  publication (libel) or communication (slander) of that<br>    statement to a third person<br>3.  fault amounting to at least negligence, and<br>4.  damages, or some harm caused to the reputation of the person or<br>    entity who is the subject of the statement.<br><br>Some other notes about defamation:<br><br>- Fault is shown when, at least, negligence in not taking reasonable<br>  care to prove or disprove the truth of the statement before it was<br>  communicated occurred.<br>- Public officials are held to a higher standard when claiming<br>  defamation. Public officials must show that the false, defaming<br>  statements were said with \"actual malice.\" This was outlined in the<br>  famous defamation case *New York Times v. Sullivan* (376 US 254,<br>  1964). The reason why public officials are held to a higher standard<br>  is because of the threat relaxed defamatory statements could pose to<br>  first amendment freedom of speech. The *Sullivan* court stated that<br>  \"actual malice\" means that the defendant said the defamatory<br>  statement \"with knowledge that it was false or with reckless<br>  disregard of whether it was false or not.\" The plaintiff must prove<br>  actual malice by \"clear and convincing\" evidence, rather than the<br>  preponderance of the evidence standard normally required in a civil<br>  case.<br>- Truth is considered to be an *absolute defense* to defamation. In<br>  other words, if you make a statement which harms someone's reputation,<br>  but the statement is actually true, a defamation claim will fail.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
