<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a person is hit by a vehicle in autonomous mode with a driver<br>behind the wheel, who should be held at fault?**<br><br>Under current law, the driver of the vehicle is always responsible for<br>what the car does.<br><br>Current law requires a driver in the driver's seat in command of the<br>vehicle even if the vehicle is operating in self-driving mode. The<br>driver is responsible for maintaining situational awareness the entire<br>time the vehicle is self-driving, and the driver is responsible for<br>stepping in and preventing the vehicle from doing anything that the<br>driver would not do.<br><br>Therefore, self-driving mode is currently not an issue in any states<br>which allow its use; the driver remains responsible at all times.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
