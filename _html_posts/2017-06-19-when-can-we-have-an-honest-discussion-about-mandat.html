<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I don't like the idea of mandatory gun ownership in the United States<br>any more than I like the idea that I am required to purchase health<br>insurance.<br><br>Both of them are a bad idea.<br><br>We know that eating apples is good for you. "An apple a day keeps the<br>doctor away." So why don't we mandate that people eat apples?<br><br>Because in the United States, we are free to live our lives as we see<br>fit. This freedom allows us to make choices. Not all choices are good,<br>and not all are bad. Ideally, you'd like to make far more good choices<br>in your life than bad ones, but the occasional chocolate binge or energy<br>drink isn't going to kill you. All things in moderation.<br><br>So mandatory \*anything\* is counter to what we believe is foundational<br>for this country.<br><br>I think what we really should do is to *remove as many barriers to legal<br>gun ownership as we possibly can*, while keeping guns out of the hands<br>of criminals or the criminally insane. That means: easier licensing,<br>50-state reciprocity, and forced enforcement of gun crimes against<br>criminals.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
