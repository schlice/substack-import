<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No.<br><br>Your job is to love them. I'm pretty sure Jesus said explicitly what<br>your job is.<br><br>> One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing<br>> that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, "Of all the<br>> commandments, which is the most important?"<br>><br>> "The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this: 'Hear, O Israel:<br>> The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all<br>> your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all<br>> your strength.' The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'<br>> There is no commandment greater than these." --- Mark 12:28--31 NIV<br><br>That's it. That's your job. Love them. Nothing more, nothing less. When<br>we love, we display the love Christ has for us. God's love works<br>*through* us.<br><br>We are not to point at others and call them sinners, because every time<br>you point a finger at someone, three fingers point back at you (try it<br>and you'll see what I mean). We have no right to judge others, as we are<br>sinners ourselves.<br><br>We are to focus on our own journey. Let others focus on their own<br>journeys and make their own choices.<br><br>Unless they ask.<br><br>And if they *do* ask, I suggest you bring them to talk to a pastor.<br>Because that whole "fire and brimstone" approach you want to take is<br>very off-putting.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
