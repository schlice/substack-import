<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Someone is coming into my house with a key when I\'m away. Calling the<br>police doesn\'t help; neither does speaking to the owner of the building<br>nor using video equipment. What can I do to end this madness?**<br><br>It's easier to beg for forgiveness than to ask for permission.<br><br>Your solution is simple. Hire a locksmith and change the locks. Do not<br>ask for permission, just do it. Then give a copy of the key to the<br>landlord. In most cases, landlords don't care if you change the locks,<br>as long as they have a copy of the key.<br><br>End the madness. Change the locks.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
