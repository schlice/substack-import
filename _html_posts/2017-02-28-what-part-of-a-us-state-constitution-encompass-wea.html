<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's unlikely that you'll find specifics about any item in a state's<br>Constitution. The Constitutions of individual states usually mirror what<br>is said in the US Constitution, that is, they lay out broad sets of<br>rights, such as "the right of the people to keep and bear arms for self<br>defense" and the like.<br><br>Individual tools and weapons will be enumerated in a state's laws, not<br>in its Constitution.<br><br>In Texas, the law itself is actually pretty thin, so you have to look to<br>legislation and case law to find out what is legal to carry and what is<br>not. You can find the law itself in Texas Penal Code §46.02, Unlawful<br>Carrying Weapons:<br><br>> § 46.01. Definitions<br>><br>> In this chapter:\<br>> .....(6) "Illegal knife" means a:\<br>> (A) knife with a blade over five and one-half inches;\<br>> (B) hand instrument designed to cut or stab another by being thrown;\<br>> (C) dagger, including but not limited to a dirk, stiletto, and<br>> poniard;\<br>> (D) bowie knife;\<br>> (E) sword; or\<br>> (F) spear.\<br>> (7) "Knife" means any bladed hand instrument that is capable of<br>> inflicting serious bodily injury or death by cutting or stabbing a<br>> person with the instrument.<br>><br>> § 46.02. Unlawful Carrying Weapons<br>><br>> \(a\) A person commits an offense if the person intentionally,<br>> knowingly, or recklessly carries on or about his or her person a<br>> handgun, illegal knife, or club if the person is not:<br>><br>> \(1\) on the person's own premises or premises under the person's<br>> control; or<br>><br>> \(2\) inside of or directly en route to a motor vehicle or watercraft<br>> that is owned by the person or under the person's control<br><br>That's about the extent of the law. So to get more specifics, you have<br>to go to case law. The following cases are generally cited to define<br>knife carry laws:<br><br>- Rainer v. State, 763 S.W.2d 615 (Tex. App. 1989)<br>- Smith v. State, 1988 Tex. App. (Tex. App. 1988)<br>- Albert v. State, 659 S.W.2d 41 (Tex. App. 1983)<br>- Armendariz v. State, 396 S.W.2d 132 (Tex. Crim. App. 1965)<br>- Cook v. State, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 3053<br><br>Specific to carry, these cases effectively define the following:<br><br>- It is illegal to conceal or open carry any knife with a blade over 5 ½<br>  inches long<br>- It is illegal to conceal or open carry throwing stars or any type of<br>  throwing knife<br>- It is illegal to conceal or open carry dirks, daggers, stilettos, and<br>  other stabbing knives<br>- It is illegal to conceal or open carry a bowie knife<br>- It is illegal to conceal or open carry a sword or spear<br><br>Carry restrictions do not apply to a person's own vehicle or a vehicle<br>that is under their control, as long as the weapon is being carried for<br>a lawful purpose.\[1\](#BtwoW){#cite-BtwoW .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-BtwoW){.citation_index} [[Texas Knife<br>Laws](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eefd87&url=http://www.knifeup.com/texas-knife-laws){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="knifeup.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
