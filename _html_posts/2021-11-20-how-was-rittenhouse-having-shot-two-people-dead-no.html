<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Great answers here, but two things haven't really been said yet:<br><br>1.  An "active shooter" is someone who is just walking around,<br>    indiscriminately shooting people with no provocation. Just waltzing<br>    up to someone and popping them in the head. *THAT* is an active<br>    shooter. Rittenhouse was on the ground, being kicked and hit in the<br>    head with a skateboard, *THEN* he fired. That simply doesn't fit the<br>    definition of an active shooter.<br>2.  If you are going to use a firearm (especially when you do not have<br>    the legal authority to possess one) to "defend others," you had<br>    better make DAMN SURE that those others are actually not the<br>    aggressors. Remember, you are making the decision, on the street,<br>    that would normally be reserved for a judge and jury. But you're<br>    trying to make it. You're trying to determine who is the aggressor<br>    and who is the victim, AND THEN you are seeking to use deadly<br>    force against the one you have chosen is the aggressor.\<br>    \<br>    Choose wisely, you only get one chance, and your choice will haunt<br>    you for the rest of your life.\<br>    \<br>    Huh. Maybe you should leave that choice to the people with the<br>    qualified immunity.\<br>    \<br>    Or, hear me out, **only use deadly force on someone when your own<br>    life is threatened!**<br><br>You're not a cop! It's not your job to "defend others." Your firearm is<br>for YOUR PROTECTION! NOT THEIRS! If they wanted to be protected,<br>they should have gone through the process to get their own carry permit<br>and their own gun! I'll say it again (and probably a few more times<br>too), it's not your job to go out and defend others!<br><br>Kyle Rittenhouse wasn't out there using his gun to defend others. He was<br>defending property against looters. He got called away to provide<br>medical assistance, and he was attacked. He fired in self-defense. The<br>jury agreed that this is what happened. The video evidence from<br>throughout the day supports this.<br><br>When you get a concealed carry permit, the purpose is to protect<br>yourself and your family. The purpose is not to become a vigilante. You<br>are not "deputized." It would have to be an absolutely stupid blatant<br>active shooter before I draw my firearm against him. Like someone just<br>spinning around in a circle shooting anything that moved. And even then,<br>I'd attract his attention first and allow him the opportunity to point<br>his gun at me (yeah, reckless, I know) before I fired. But I'd have the<br>double protection of using my firearm to protect others AND using my<br>firearm to protect myself. That's about the only time I'd ever shoot<br>someone who was not directly threatening me.<br><br>Otherwise, *I'D* be in the defendant's chair instead of Rittenhouse.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How was Ritterhouse (having shot two people dead) not an active shooter<br>that Grosskreutz should have engaged to protect others?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
