<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why is PUBG Mobile struggling to run on HTC U Ultra (Qualcomm<br>Snapdragon 821, Adreno 530, 4GB RAM), it can still be considered a high<br>end phone sitting between S7 and S8?**<br><br>First of all, I dispute your claim that the HTC U Ultra sits "between"<br>the S7 and the S8.<br><br>In order to sit between them, it has to be demonstrably better than the<br>S7 in terms of functional specs. Even a casual statistical comparison<br>reveals that it is not.<br><br>While the S7 is only rocking a Snapdragon 820 and the U Ultra is rocking<br>an 821, the 820 in the S7 is running at 2200 MHz, while the U Ultra is<br>running at 2150. And while they are both rocking QHD (2560x1440), the S7<br>does it using S-AMOLED, while the U Ultra is still stuck on S-LCD.<br>Therefore, the S7 is more battery-friendly and easier on the graphics<br>card than the U Ultra.<br><br>They both have 4GB of RAM so if it plays well on the S7, it should play<br>well enough on the U Ultra. PUBG says that minimum specs are Android<br>5.1.1 or later and 2GB of RAM or more. So it should run fine.<br><br>Sounds like you may have some other apps interfering. If you're really<br>keen on playing PUBG, I'd try a phone wipe, and then try it out before<br>you re-install your apps. If it works with no problems, then you're<br>having an app contention issue.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
