<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yep. Killing someone who murdered any untold millions of people is still<br>murder. You would still be arrested.<br><br>What you\'re talking about is *justification*, which is something<br>for a jury to decide, after you are arrested and charged, and placed on<br>trial.<br><br>The only difference would be if you killed someone who was in the<br>*process* of killing dozens of people, in which case you would be<br>killing someone in self-defense (defense of others is self-defense).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
