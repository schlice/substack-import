<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What actions will the House take on persons refusing to testify?<br><br>Behind closed doors, they've been talking about having the<br>Sergeant-at-Arms detain people who violate subcommittee subpoenas. But<br>this seems a little far-fetched, even for them.<br><br>Ultimately, they will attempt to hold individuals who defy subpoenas in<br>contempt of Congress.<br><br>This really means nothing unless they attempt to enforce those<br>subpoenas, usually through the DOJ and the US Attorney's Office<br>(normally, the office in DC is the one used for this sort of<br>enforcement).<br><br>It's at this point that they will start to face some of the legal<br>challenges that this issue is certain to bring, starting with the fact<br>that the legitimacy of the subpoenas is questionable at best, and at<br>worst, is rife with legal deficiencies.<br><br>If the subpoenas are not legally enforceable because the underlying<br>investigation is unconstitutional, the US Attorney's Office will be<br>unable to pursue any enforcement of the subpoenas.<br><br>At the very least, issuance of subpoenas, being held in contempt of<br>Congress and attempted enforcement actions will bring the question of<br>the legality of the whole "subpoena about impeachment" issue to the<br>fore. And to the courts, where those questions of law will be decided.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
