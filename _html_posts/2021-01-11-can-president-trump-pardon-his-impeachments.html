<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can President Trump pardon his impeachment(s)?<br><br>Impeachment is a political remedy and it is not related to whether or<br>not someone has broken a law. Pardons are for federal crimes. You<br>can't pardon an impeachment.<br><br>Impeachments are for "high crimes and misdemeanors" but since<br>impeachment is a political remedy, it doesn't necessarily have to be a<br>violation of law which triggers an impeachment. Even speech which is<br>perfectly legal, but unbecoming the office of the president (which is<br>exactly what he did), is impeachable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
