<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why would Cook County prosecutors drop all charges against \'Empire\'<br>actor Jussie Smollett?**<br><br>There are one of two possibilities.<br><br>1.  The prosecution found a defect in their case. Perhaps something in<br>    the background of the witnesses or the defendant that would make<br>    prosecuting the case problematic.<br>2.  The prosecution engaged in a one-time good-deal known as ***deferred<br>    prosecution***, where they simply decided that pursuing these<br>    charges did not benefit the state. Fortunately for Smollett, Chicago<br>    does not require the defendant to plead guilty before prosecution<br>    can be deferred like some other states.<br><br>In this case, the prosecution requested, and the judge granted, a *nolle<br>prosequi* (or "will not prosecute"). This can happen for any number of<br>reasons: new evidence, discovery of a defect in their case, or perhaps<br>just to "cut a break" to the defendant. We do know that Smollett's<br>community service was considered, and we also know that Smollett<br>forfeited his bond (the \$10,000 he used to bail out of jail). After<br>these considerations, the prosecution decided to nol pross the case.<br><br>We may never know which one of these possibilities is the real reason<br>why the prosecution decided to drop the case.<br><br>The case is left as if charges were never brought. This is different<br>from an acquittal, because charges can be brought again if the<br>prosecution chooses (after filing a new charging document), for example,<br>if new evidence comes to light. Acquittals generally mean that charges<br>cannot be filed again.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
