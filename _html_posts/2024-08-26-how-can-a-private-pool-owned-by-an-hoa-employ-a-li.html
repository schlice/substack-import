<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In most HOA communities, a community pool is unguarded. Signs are posted<br>at the gated entrance to the pool that swimming is at your own risk<br>since there is no lifeguard on duty.<br><br>The HOA maintains general liability insurance on all common areas within<br>the HOA, and dues pay for that insurance. Neighborhoods which have pools<br>will have liability insurance commensurate with the risk.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
