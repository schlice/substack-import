<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Celebrate.<br><br>Also, keep working to enhance the culture of life.<br><br>Talk to your legislators. It's time to start talking about pregnancy<br>resource centers again. We need to dump money into these places, so that<br>new mothers (if they choose to keep their babies) have all the resources<br>they need to start out strong. Not only financial and materiel support,<br>but education and post-natal healthcare, even mental health services<br>should all be accessible or linked to pregnancy resource centers. You<br>shouldn't be able to swing a stick on a street corner in American towns<br>without hitting a PRC. They should be everywhere and they should be free<br>to expectant/new mothers.<br><br>If they don't choose to keep their babies, we also need to talk about<br>removing the barriers to adoption in this country. As it stands, there<br>are at least 36 couples waiting to adopt a baby for every one baby<br>placed for adoption. The availability of adoptive parents is not at<br>question. The problem is the *years* of bureaucratic red tape they have<br>to navigate in order to complete their adoption. We must work to slash<br>that barrier.<br><br>Making progress is good. But don't take your foot off the accelerator.<br>Keep moving forward.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
