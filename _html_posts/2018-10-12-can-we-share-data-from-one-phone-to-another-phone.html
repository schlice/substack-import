No. No phones currently support the Li-Fi standard.<br><br>In the future, I can see phones supporting Li-Fi, but I still think<br>we're maybe 5--10 years out before a phone starts to embed the<br>technology.<br><br>The infrastructure needs to support it first, and then you'll see<br>handsets picking it up. I could see it used in specialized equipment<br>first, and then rolled out to phones later on.<br><br>It's a promising technology though.<br><br>[https://purelifi.com/(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3b88bd&url=https://purelifi.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
