<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What do pro-life believers think about women who have gotten pregnant<br>by either rape, incest, or other means, should the mother have a voice<br>and choose to not carry the burden which wasn\'t her fault?**<br><br>Let me first state that this is a legal discussion and I am a student of<br>the law. While I may have moral concerns about these issues, that does<br>not drive my view of the law. My personal moral stances are my own and<br>are not relevant as part of a legal discussion.<br><br>Legally, I don't look at rights (i.e. right to life, right of autonomy<br>over one's body, etc) because if the fetus is a human being (which it<br>is), it has human rights endemic to human beings. The fetus has as much<br>right to life as the mother. Legally, neither has more rights than the<br>other.<br><br>When we discuss rape or other means of pregnancy (i.e. coercion), the<br>only issue we can discuss is consent. That issue simply is: *did the<br>mother consent to sex?*<br><br>Consent is important, because consent, either expressed or implied,<br>means that the woman accepts the consequences of sex. Those include the<br>possibility of catching an STI, or the possibility of getting pregnant.<br>All of these are accepted by the woman who consents to sex. For example,<br>the woman who consents to sex accepts the responsibility of contracting<br>an STI. The notable exception here, of course, is foreknowledge. You<br>have to know that your partner has an STI. If you didn't know, you have<br>legal grounds to sue your partner for sexual battery, regardless of<br>state.<br><br>If a woman does not consent to sex, either through some form of rape<br>(incest can be a form of rape; consensual incest is still consenting) or<br>coercion, she should not be legally bound to the consequences of that<br>sex. She should not be forced to carry the baby to term, if she doesn't<br>choose to do so.<br><br>It's important to understand that not all women who were raped choose to<br>abort their babies. Actually a very large majority choose to carry the<br>baby to term. At that point, they either choose to keep the baby, or<br>give it up for adoption. But in any case, the woman should have *all*<br>choices available to her. Abortion should rightly be the *last* choice,<br>as even abortion advocates want it to be a rare occurrence; but in this<br>case, it should still be on the table.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
