<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [When we start limiting the \"bearing\" of arms to a<br/>certain group or groups, the \"slippery slope\" will start, and if it\'s<br/>acceptable to limit the \"bearing\" of arms to that group, you can also<br/>by extension find it acceptable to limit the \"keeping\" of arms to that<br/>group as well. Which means that society will eventually find it<br/>acceptable that law-abiding non-military and non-police citizens will<br/>not be able to own firearms.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
