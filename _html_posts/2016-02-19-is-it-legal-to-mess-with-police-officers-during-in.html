Wasting their time will<br>not likely be looked upon fondly. Additionally, you are probably there<br>for a reason. It probably wouldn\'t be beneficial to you to change the<br>subject, especially to something totally unrelated to the discussion.<br>They will probably think you are deflecting, which just makes you look<br>more guilty.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
