<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is no requirement that the Senate as a body express such a<br>position. The Senate gave scheduling authority to the Senate Majority<br>Leader. The Senate Majority Leader "advised" the President that the<br>matter would not be taken up until after the next election. Considering<br>that the Senate Majority Leader sets the calendar, and considering that<br>the Senate has seated that authority with him, wouldn't that be<br>considered "advice?"<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-can-Gorsuch-revere-the-Constitution-as-he-claims-while-participating-in-an-unconstitutional-act/answer/Anthony-Zarrella<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
