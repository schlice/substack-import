<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No one wants World War III.<br><br>And if Iran and Israel go to war, there is no doubt that a global<br>conflict will ensue, with Arab countries on one side, and Israel, the<br>US, NATO allies and friends on the other.<br><br>Israel has been dealing with Hamas terror attacks since they withdrew<br>from Gaza. Swatting rockets out of the skies and dealing with suicide<br>bombers can be pretty draining for a country to deal with.<br><br>But for Iran to *directly* involve itself in the conflict, rather<br>than through proxies as it has been (i.e. Hezbollah and the Houthis), is<br>a clear *escalation.*<br><br>Escalations, when they have global implications, are never a good thing.<br><br>Conflict with the Palestinians is one thing. Global war between Iran and<br>Israel is a completely separate thing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
