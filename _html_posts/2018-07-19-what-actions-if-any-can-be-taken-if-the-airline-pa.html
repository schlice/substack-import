<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What actions, if any, can be taken if the airline passenger sitting<br>directly next to you or your child is viewing pornography in flight?**<br><br>1.  Try talking to the passenger first. Explain that his screen is<br>    visible. Request that he either change his choice of content or<br>    reorient himself so that his screen is no longer visible (even<br>    accidentally) to your child.<br>2.  If that doesn't work, involve the flight crew. They can either<br>    request that the passenger modify his viewing, or they can re-seat<br>    you (if availability exists to do so).<br><br>One way or another, you can easily resolve the situation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
