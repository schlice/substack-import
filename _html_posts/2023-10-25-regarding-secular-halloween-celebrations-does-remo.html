<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>"Spiritual effects?" Like the ritual actually does something?<br><br>Only God has the power to have a "spiritual effect." Dressing up as a<br>ghost has absolutely no effect other than to limit your field of vision.<br>Man, it was hard to see in those costumes.<br><br>The truth is that *holidays only have the meaning that we give them.*<br><br>That said, pretty much every holiday once derived from some sort of<br>pagan ritual. Even Christmas. According to some evidence, Pope Julius I<br>chose December 25, 336 AD as the date when Christmas was first<br>celebrated. This date was chosen in an effort to adopt and absorb the<br>traditions of the pagan Saturnalia festival. Saturnalia was an<br>adaptation of the Ancient Greek festival known as Kronia. Kronia was<br>celebrated in midsummer rather than midwinter. It is thought to signify<br>the end of the harvest season to honor Saturn, a god associated with<br>agriculture.<br><br>These days, really the only thing remaining of the old pagan rituals is<br>the date. We have so modified and commercialized the holiday that its<br>original meaning is pretty much gone.<br><br>With the exception of Halloween. There is still quite a lot of<br>less-than-savory stuff going on there.<br><br>You should be careful of Halloween. There is a "celebration of death"<br>which sometimes associates with Halloween. Christians do not celebrate<br>death, but we celebrate life with Jesus. We don't fear death, but we<br>also don't celebrate it. Be cautious about this with Halloween<br>festivals.<br><br>Is there anything spiritually wrong with dressing up in costumes of<br>superheroes and knocking on doors for candy? No, not really. We only<br>need to be cautious of celebrating the wrong things.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
