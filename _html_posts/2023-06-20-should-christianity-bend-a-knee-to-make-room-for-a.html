<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's almost like you, dear questioner, are thinking, "Gosh, Christianity<br>would be perfect if it weren't so Islamophobic." It's almost as if<br>people are so caught up in the multiculturalism of the day that they<br>forget that absolute truth exists.<br><br>While most religions have some beliefs that are true, not all religious<br>beliefs can be true because they are mutually exclusive---they teach<br>opposites. In other words, some religious beliefs must be wrong. But<br>you're not supposed to say that in America today. You're supposed to be<br>"tolerant" of all religious beliefs. And in our culture today, tolerance<br>no longer means to put up with something you believe to be false (after<br>all, you don't tolerate things you agree with). The new definition of<br>tolerance says that *you're supposed to accept every belief as true!*<br><br>In a religious context, this is known as religious pluralism, the<br>belief that all religions are true. This is wrong, for a number of<br>reasons.<br><br>1.  Since mutually exclusive religious beliefs cannot be true, it makes<br>    no sense to pretend that they are. In fact, on an individual level<br>    it can be *dangerous* to do so. If Christianity is true, then it's<br>    dangerous to your eternal destiny not to be a Christian. Likewise,<br>    if Islam is true, then it's dangerous to your eternal destiny not to<br>    be a Muslim.<br>2.  The claim that "you ought not question someone's religious beliefs"<br>    is itself a religious belief for pluralists. But this belief is just<br>    as exclusive and "intolerant" as any religious belief of a Christian<br>    or Muslim. In other words, pluralists think all non-pluralist<br>    beliefs are wrong. So pluralists are just as dogmatic and<br>    closed-minded as anyone else making truth claims in the public<br>    square. And they want everyone who disagrees with them to see things<br>    *their* way.<br>3.  The prohibition against questioning religious beliefs is also an<br>    absolute moral position. Why shouldn't we question religious<br>    beliefs? Would it be immoral to do so? And if so, by whose standard?<br>    Do pluralists have any good reasons supporting *their belief* that<br>    we ought not question religious beliefs, or is it just their own<br>    personal opinion that they want to impose on the rest of us? Unless<br>    they can give us good reasons for such a moral standard, why should<br>    we allow them to impose it on us? And why are pluralists trying to<br>    impose that moral position on us anyway? That's not very "tolerant"<br>    of them.<br>4.  The pluralist's claim that we ought not question religious beliefs<br>    is a derivative of the biblically-inaccurate prohibition against<br>    passing judgments. Before we even look at the Bible, the prohibition<br>    against judging is itself false because on its face, it fails to<br>    meet its own standard: "you ought not judge" is itself a judgment.<br>    Pluralists frequently misinterpret Jesus' comments on judging found<br>    in Matthew 7:1-5. Jesus did not prohibit judging as such, only<br>    judging hypocritically, or judging wrongly. Indeed, everyone (the<br>    pluralist, the Christian, the atheist, the agnostic) makes<br>    judgments. So the issue isn't whether or not we make judgments, but<br>    whether or not we make the *right* judgments.<br>5.  The Bible commands Christians to question religious beliefs (cf<br>    Deuteronomy 13:1-5; 1 John 4:1; Galatians 1:8; 2 Corinthians 11:13).<br>    Since Christians have a religious belief that they ought to question<br>    religious beliefs, then pluralists, **according to their own<br>    standard**, should accept this Christian belief as well. But of<br>    course they do not. Ironically, pluralists (the advocates of the new<br>    tolerance) are not really tolerant at all. They only "tolerate"<br>    those who already agree with them, which by anyone's definition is<br>    not tolerance.<br>6.  Are pluralists ready to accept as true the religious beliefs of<br>    Muslim terrorists---especially when those beliefs say that all<br>    non-Muslims (including pluralists) should be killed? Are they ready<br>    to accept as true the religious beliefs of those who believe in<br>    child sacrifice or other heinous acts? I certainly hope not. On that<br>    note, do Muslims fully accommodate Christians? Hardly. They believe<br>    that Christians are *infidels* (their word). If they don't<br>    accommodate us, could they be said to be *Christianophobic*? Why are<br>    Christians expected to be better than Muslims in that regard?<br><br>While we should *respect* the rights of others to believe what they<br>want, we are foolish, and maybe even unloving, to *tacitly accept* every<br>religious belief as true. Why is this unloving? Because *if*<br>Christianity is true, then it would be unloving to suggest to anyone<br>that their opposing religious beliefs are true as well. Affirming such<br>error might keep them on the road to eternal separation from God.<br><br>**Instead, if Christianity is true, we ought to kindly tell them the<br>truth because only the truth can set them free.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
