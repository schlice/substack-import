<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It wasn\'t okay for either of them to do what they did.<br>But what they did is a little confusing, and the question makes clear<br>assumptions that Republicans are somehow okay with Iran-Contra while<br>being not okay with the nuclear agreement with Iran.\<br>\<br>The Reagan deal you speak of was called the [[Iran--Contra<br>affair](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=76c3b8&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%25E2%2580%2593Contra_affair){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. It was the *illegal*<br>sale of arms to Israel, who then shipped the weapons to Iran. The US was<br>paid for the weapons by Israel. The US could not directly give arms to<br>Iran since it was still under an arms embargo. In exchange, the Iranians<br>agreed to do everything they could to secure the release of US hostages<br>being held by the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. To this day, it is still<br>unclear whether or not Reagan actually authorized such a deal, even<br>though he publicly supported the idea. It is generally recognized that<br>subordinates working for Reagan, most notably Lt. Col (ret) [[Oliver<br>North](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9e96ec&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_North){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, actually planned and<br>executed the deal. The military even coined a term, \"Ollieism,\" still<br>taught today in US military education schools, whereby a subordinate,<br>doing something he believes his superior to be supportive of, does<br>something illegal under the illusion that he will be supported by his<br>superior.\<br>\<br>Obama\'s deal with Iran is completely different. Obama negotiated a deal<br>directly with Iran to allow them to develop nuclear capabilities.<br>They\'re not supposed to develop any nuclear weapons (we have \"their<br>word\"), but we have given them the green light to enrich uranium, which<br>is the long pole in the tent to developing nuclear weapons. The jump<br>from enriched uranium to nuclear weapons is a short one. Most experts<br>agree that Iran will have nuclear weapons. The deal doesn\'t give us<br>much legs for oversight, even though there is some token oversight in<br>there. The deal restores trade with Iran, giving them a much-needed<br>economic boost, which most experts agree will head straight to Hezbollah<br>and Hamas in the form of new rockets to shoot at Tel Aviv. As you can<br>imagine, Israel isn\'t happy about it. Obama said exactly this during<br>his press conference:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> Israel has legitimate concerns about its security relative to Iran.<br>> You have a large country with a significant military that has<br>> proclaimed that Israel shouldn\'t exist, that has denied the<br>> Holocaust, that has financed Hezbollah, and as a consequence there are<br>> missiles that are pointed toward Tel Aviv. And so I think there are<br>> very good reasons why Israelis are nervous about Iran\'s position in<br>> the world generally. And I\'ve said this to Prime Minister Netanyahu;<br>> I\'ve said it directly to the Israeli people. But what I\'ve also said<br>> is that all those threats are compounded if Iran gets a nuclear<br>> weapon.\<br><br>\<br>And it\'s a country we\'ve just given the green light to enrich uranium.<br>This will only heighten tensions in the region, as Egypt and Saudi<br>Arabia are going to pursue nuclear aspirations to defend against the<br>soon-to-be-nuclear Iran.\<br>\<br>To heighten the massive stupidity of this deal, Obama also declared that<br>Congress can\'t stop it, and he would veto any attempts to overturn the<br>deal. So Congress\' Constitution authority over trade deals has also<br>been usurped.\<br>\<br>Maybe Reagan knew about Iran-Contra, maybe he didn\'t. I won\'t justify<br>Iran-Contra by saying that Reagan\'s a good guy so he had the best<br>intentions so it\'s okay. Iran-Contra wasn\'t okay, and neither was<br>Obama\'s Iran deal.\<br>\<br>Obama\'s deal, in contrast with Iran-Contra, is very harmful. It\'s<br>harmful to the region. It\'s harmful directly to Israel. It creates the<br>path for Iran to get nuclear weapons, in a shorter amount of time (8<br>years instead of 10). There\'s enough flexibility in the agreement that<br>Iran can hide their stuff before inspectors arrive. \"See? Nothing going<br>on here.\" It creates incentive for neighboring nations to pursue their<br>own nuclear ambitions. It gives Israel incentive to attack Iran<br>pre-emptively. Instead of easing tensions, it makes them worse.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
