<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I hate to burst your bubble, but *Roe* is dead and isn't coming back.<br>Whether or not abortion is legal, and up to what gestational age, is an<br>issue for lawmakers in Congress or the states to decide, not the courts.<br>Today, individual states can choose to allow completely, allow<br>partially, or limit abortions at their discretion.<br><br>So the quickest way to get *Roe*-like permission for abortion is to move<br>to a state which completely allows abortions, like New York, California,<br>Oregon, Washington, or Colorado.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-9723e40cf6b23a15890446a9320cf391){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-9723e40cf6b23a15890446a9320cf391" master_w="524"<br>master_h="334"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(Image courtesy* [[*NBC<br>News*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eefb05&url=https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/map-23-states-ban-abortion-post-roe-america-rcna27081){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nbcnews.com"}]{.qlink_container}*)*<br><br>The next quickest way is to elect people who will enact laws allowing<br>abortions in your state.<br><br>There are other, slower, ways to make it happen:<br><br>- Propose a Constitutional amendment. If there is as much support for<br>  abortion as you believe there is, it should be no problem getting 2/3<br>  of Congress and 3/4 of the states to sign on to an amendment to the<br>  Constitution declaring that the right to an abortion actually does<br>  exist. But that means you only need 12 states to say no and your<br>  amendment doesn't get added to the Constitution. So you have a really<br>  tough hill to climb for this one. You could also propose a<br>  Constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to privacy, which was<br>  the faulty basis upon which *Roe*'s right to an abortion was based,<br>  and then try to say that abortion restrictions are unconstitutional<br>  based on the newly-discovered right to privacy. But you face exactly<br>  the same problem: you need majorities in 3/4 of the states to amend<br>  the Constitution.<br>- Or, you could lobby Congress to pass Federal abortion protections. But<br>  clearly, while people want *some* access to abortion, they don't want<br>  100% unfettered access to abortion at all gestational ages up until<br>  birth. So Congress would have to pass a *compromise* bill like, for<br>  example, allowing abortions up to at least 15 weeks, and states could<br>  decide to allow it for longer, but no less than 15 weeks. That would<br>  be a valid compromise bill: it sets a minimum threshold for the<br>  states, and allows them to permit it further if they choose, but<br>  they'd all have to allow at least a little. However, Congress really<br>  isn't interested in *compromise* these days. Some brave<br>  Representatives worked on a compromise bill, but the radical<br>  leadership of both the House and the Senate wouldn't even bring it to<br>  the floor for debate. So you're unlikely to get any motion out of<br>  Congress any time soon.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What\'s the quickest way to ensure that Roe v.
