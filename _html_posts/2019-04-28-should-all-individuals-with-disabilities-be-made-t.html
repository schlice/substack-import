<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Should all individuals with disabilities be made to work?<br><br>I understand the nature of your question. It could be taken as a very<br>offensive one, but I get it. You're probably asking about people who<br>receive government benefits, under a program we called "welfare to<br>work."<br><br>The answer is a qualified no, because no one should be *made*<br>to work. That's called slavery and we outlawed that a few years<br>ago.<br><br>That said, what about people who receive government benefits? Should<br>*they* be made to work? Again, the answer is a qualified no.<br><br>No one should be made to work. But by the same token, no one should be<br>allowed to *not* work and continue to receive government assistance<br>for not working, when one is fully able to work.<br><br>President Obama removed the work requirement from government welfare<br>assistance during his presidency. This means you do not have to work,<br>and you do not have to look for work, if you are able-bodied and you<br>choose to not work.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
