<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> **Can an employer ask if you are disabled and what your condition<br>> is?**<br><br>Can they ask? Sure! They can ask anything they want. But during your job<br>interview, it would be really foolish for them to do so. Why? Because if<br>they do ask you, and you don't get the job, you could reasonably accuse<br>them of violating ADA and not hiring you because of your disability. So<br>smart employers don't ask you about your disability during your job<br>interview.<br><br>Generally, the only thing an employer will ask you during the interview<br>is this following sanitized generalized question:<br><br>*Can you perform the essential functions of this job with or without<br>reasonable accommodations?*<br><br>If you answer yes, then you can move forward. Of course, it leaves open<br>to interpretation what exactly is "reasonable," but I digress.<br><br>> **Are there any examples of reasonable accommodations under the<br>> Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)?**<br><br>Certainly. Let's say you are a cashier at a grocery store. You have a<br>prosthetic leg. A reasonable accommodation would be to provide you a<br>stool at your register because putting that much pressure on your<br>prosthesis for that long is challenging. It doesn't cause an undue<br>hardship to the business, and you're able to continue to do your job.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
