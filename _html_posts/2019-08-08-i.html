How does it work and what\'s the<br>best way to test its working?**<br><br>Hopefully you're certain what a stun gun is.<br><br>This is a stun gun:<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-566879a7e7e4453865274401e81af842){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-566879a7e7e4453865274401e81af842" master_w="800"<br>master_h="800"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Stun guns have contact probes which stick out of the front of the<br>unit, similar to this one. When they make contact with something and the<br>unit is activated, any current will flow through them. To that end, stun<br>guns require direct contact with your assailant in order to work.<br>Stun guns are not a *standoff device*; you cannot use them at standoff<br>distances. You must essentially be point-blank to touch the probes to<br>your attacker.<br><br>You'll also notice two probes facing each other towards the middle.<br>These are called test probes. When nothing is touching the contact<br>probes and you activate the stun gun, current will arc between the test<br>probes.<br><br>The best way to learn how to use this device is to take a self-defense<br>class which includes using a stun gun. I would not recommend carrying<br>one without some level of training, even though you can buy these<br>devices from anywhere.<br><br>You should also make sure you check your local laws to ensure that you<br>are permitted to carry one, as laws vary widely across states and around<br>the world.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
