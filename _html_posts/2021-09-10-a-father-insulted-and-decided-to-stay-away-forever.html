<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>He has *a right* to not talk to his daughter again.<br><br>*But he bases his decision on fear-mongering rather than science, and<br>that is incredibly foolish.* He ignores her individuality and her right<br>to choose for her own body what is best, instead imposing his own<br>morality over hers. This is incredibly insensitive and foolish. In other<br>words, the father is a complete moron.<br><br>The CDC doesn't help if you ask them, because they use the 18--29 age<br>group range as the "reference range." This is what happens when your<br>"scientific study" doesn't have a "control group" to study against.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-0a0c9eb022a8dfb2c6da93098a1a2acd){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-0a0c9eb022a8dfb2c6da93098a1a2acd"<br>master_w="1032" master_h="326"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>This isn't "science." It's "educated guesswork." But you can at least<br>see that the risk scales upward the older you get.<br><br>In short, it is *exceedingly unlikely* that a normal, healthy 20-year<br>old would even be hospitalized, much less die, from COVID infection<br>(barring any comorbidities, of course). And knowing that there are risks<br>for 20-year olds taking the vaccine that older adults do not face also<br>should rightly weigh on the mind of the 20-year old and should<br>influence their decision about whether or not to vaccinate.<br><br>**TL;DR: He can do whatever he wants with his daughter, but he is<br>terribly foolish to do so. The science does not agree with his<br>decision.**<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>A father insulted and decided to stay away forever from his 20-year-old<br>daughter who decided not to get vaccinated against covid-19 because he<br>says he prefers not to find out when his daughter dies from covid-19. Is<br>the father right?<br><br>\<br><br>*This is a contentious and emotionally-charged topic. I have taken the<br>(unusual for me) step of leaving comments open.*<br><br>*Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner. But do not misunderstand, I take this step very<br>cautiously, and I have no tolerance for harassing or inane behavior.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you are simply<br>commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised<br>if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything vaguely harassing in<br>there, and your deletion will be followed by a block/mute, and a BNBR<br>report. I will do this immediately and with no compunction. You have<br>been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
