<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First off, Reagan was never a proponent of gun control while he was<br>president. In fact, he lobbied for the abolishment of the BATF *after*<br>his assassination attempt in 1981. He was one of the most staunchly<br>pro-gun presidents of the modern era.<br><br>Machine guns have been banned since the National Firearms Act of 1934.<br>Reagan didn\'t sign that. What FOPA did was reopening interstate sales<br>of long guns on a limited basis, legalization of ammunition shipments<br>through the U.S. Postal Service (a partial repeal of the Gun Control<br>Act), removal of the requirement for record keeping on sales of<br>non-armor-piercing ammunition, and federal protection of transportation<br>of firearms through states where possession of those firearms would<br>otherwise be illegal. Those are pro-gun measures. The machine gun ban<br>mirrored what was already in the National Firearms Act. It was a<br>non-starter.<br><br>Two years after Reagan left office, he did soften on some of his<br>positions, and did support the passage of the Brady Bill, which did<br>eventually get passed into law in 1993. He said of the Brady Bill:<br>\"\t\his nightmare might never have happened\" in an [[op-ed in the<br>New York<br>Times](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=574abb&url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/29/opinion/why-i-m-for-the-brady-bill.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nytimes.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
