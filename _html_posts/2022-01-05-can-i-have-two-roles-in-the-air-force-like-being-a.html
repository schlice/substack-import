<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Usually, training in an AFSC is challenging and time-consuming. You<br>commit to a job when you select your AFSC, usually because the Air Force<br>wants to spend the appropriate money on your training and then use you<br>in that field. That said, there are a few ways that you can do multiple<br>jobs in the Air Force. But very few of them include doing the work of<br>multiple AFSCs at the same time.<br><br>One would be to *cross-train* into another AFSC. In essence, you would<br>be giving up your old career field and training into a new one. This is<br>only something you are able to do if it is in the best interest of the<br>Air Force (i.e. you're in an over-manned AFSC and you are moving into an<br>undermanned AFSC). The Air Force would send you back to Tech School for<br>your new AFSC, and then send you on to another duty assignment.<br><br>Another method would be to serve as an *augmentee*. For example,<br>Security Forces often employs and trains augmentees from other career<br>fields to, er, *augment* their capabilities during contingencies and<br>personnel shortages (usually due to deployments). While the active guys<br>get deployed, the auggies come in and backfill. Additionally, the flight<br>line needs extra ramp personnel during contingencies; they often use<br>augmentees from other career fields to fill that need during those<br>times.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can I have two roles in the Air Force like being a pilot and a medic, or<br>can you only select one?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
