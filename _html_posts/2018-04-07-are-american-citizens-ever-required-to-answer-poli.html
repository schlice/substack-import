<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, but only in very limited circumstances.<br><br>You are required by law to provide your real name when police stop and<br>question you. You are also required to provide your real address and<br>other real identifying information (but not personally identifying<br>information like your Social Security Number). Failing to do so is a<br>separate crime, and you can be held on that charge alone until you can<br>be identified.<br><br>If you enter into a plea agreement with the district attorney, if it<br>includes testimony, once you have signed on the dotted line, you must<br>answer their questions as detailed in your agreement, or you risk<br>terminating your agreement and being prosecuted yourself.<br><br>Beyond that, you do not have to say anything. You do not have to give<br>any information at all. You can even lie if you choose. It\'s not<br>illegal to lie to the police. It may not help you, but it\'s not a<br>crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
