<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [We live in an ordered and free society. We all have<br>individual rights. We submit that in order to have an ordered society,<br>there have to be laws that govern our interactions so that your free<br>exercise of your rights doesn\'t interfere with my free exercise of my<br>rights.\<br>\<br>This means we voluntarily cede that control to the government, and<br>we voluntarily follow laws. Anyone who lives in a civil society must<br>follow the laws to keep it that way. Disagreements with the laws are, of<br>course, possible, but that\'s a matter for lawmakers, not an excuse for<br>lawlessness.\<br>\<br>Every law is only imposed on those willing to live in a free society,<br>which involves compliance with the law.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-are-common-logical-fallacies-in-gun-control-arguments/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
