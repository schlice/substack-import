<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do I have the right to demand that a person wear their mask correctly<br>and not just wear it under their nose?**<br><br>No.<br><br>Even if it is illegal for someone to not wear their mask correctly, you<br>have no right to demand that another person wear their mask correctly.<br>The reason is because you have no right to be free from risk. You do<br>not have the right to be free of the potential of someone in society<br>infecting you (where you are not affirmatively engaged with them), even<br>if they know they are positive.<br><br>There are plenty of illegal things that people do, and even if they do,<br>you have no right to demand that they follow the law, even if it<br>affirmatively makes you safer. Unless you can show that their actions<br>directly impact your ability to exercise your own rights (not<br>potentially, but actually), you cannot demand that someone else follow<br>the law. What you can do is notify law enforcement of a violation of<br>law.<br><br>Additionally, while it may be a very small corner case, a person may<br>have a particular disability which does not allow them to wear the mask<br>correctly, or wear a mask at all. For some people, wearing a mask may<br>exacerbate an existing medical condition. The CDC lists some examples of<br>people in this group:<br><br>> - Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing---or those who care for<br>>   or interact with a person who is hearing impaired---may be unable to<br>>   wear cloth face coverings if they rely on lipreading to communicate.<br>>   In this situation, consider using a clear face covering. If a clear<br>>   face covering isn't available, consider whether you can use written<br>>   communication, use closed captioning, or decrease background noise<br>>   to make communication possible while wearing a cloth face covering<br>>   that blocks your lips.<br>> - Some individuals with developmental disabilities, sensory<br>>   integration concerns or tactile sensitivities, certain mental health<br>>   conditions, or limited cognitive ability may have a negative<br>>   reaction to wearing a cloth face covering. These individuals may<br>>   consult with their healthcare provider as part of the decision to<br>>   wear a cloth face covering.<br>> - Younger children (e.g., preschool or early elementary aged) may be<br>>   unable to wear a cloth face covering properly, particularly for an<br>>   extended period of time. Wearing of cloth face coverings may be<br>>   prioritized at times when it is difficult to maintain a distance of<br>>   6 feet from others (e.g., during carpool drop off or pick up, or<br>>   when standing in line at school). Ensuring proper cloth face<br>>   covering size and fit and providing children with frequent reminders<br>>   and education on the importance and proper wear of cloth face<br>>   coverings may help address these issues.<br>> - Individuals should not wear cloth face coverings while engaged in<br>>   activities that may cause the cloth face covering to become wet,<br>>   like when swimming at the beach or pool. A wet cloth face covering<br>>   may make it difficult to breathe. For activities like swimming, it<br>>   is particularly important to maintain physical distance from others<br>>   when in the water.<br>> - Individuals who are engaged in high intensity activities, like<br>>   running, may not be able to wear a cloth face covering if it causes<br>>   difficulty breathing. If unable to wear a cloth face covering,<br>>   consider conducting the activity in a location with greater<br>>   ventilation and air exchange (for instance, outdoors versus indoors)<br>>   and where it is possible to maintain physical distance from others.<br>> - Individuals who work in a setting where cloth face coverings may<br>>   increase the risk of heat-related illness or cause safety concerns<br>>   due to introduction of a hazard (for instance, straps getting caught<br>>   in machinery) may consult with an occupational safety and health<br>>   professional to determine the appropriate face covering for their<br>>   setting. Outdoor workers may prioritize use of cloth face coverings<br>>   when in close contact with other people, like during group travel or<br>>   shift meetings, and remove face coverings when social distancing is<br>>   possible. \[1\](#DbNsk){#cite-DbNsk .citation_link}<br><br>Masks are "defense-in-depth." Having everyone wear one increases the<br>potential of you catching your own droplets before they get out, and you<br>blocking droplets expelled by others. Having multiple layers of defense<br>helps to protect you. But even the failure or the loss of one of these<br>layers, while slightly increasing your risk, does not ameliorate the<br>effectiveness of your own mask. It is the same concept as "herd<br>immunity;" even if one person is infected and is spreading droplets, the<br>preponderance of masks should catch any airborne droplets.<br><br>Additionally, just as important as masks is social distancing. Avoiding<br>people not wearing masks like the plague (pun intended) is definitely<br>best practice. Six feet should be just the start for those people. If<br>enough people start keeping a wide berth around people without masks, it<br>might convince them that wearing a mask is better than being a societal<br>pariah.<br><br>Most importantly, if it is illegal to not wear a mask correctly in your<br>area, notify the management (if you're in a facility), or the police (if<br>you are not).<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-DbNsk){.citation_index} [[Coronavirus Disease 2019<br>(COVID-19)](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ddfcac&url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cdc.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
