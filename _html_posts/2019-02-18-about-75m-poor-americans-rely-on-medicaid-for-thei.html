<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**About 75m poor Americans rely on Medicaid for their health care, how<br>would Trump administration\'s new rule of forced to work impact them?**<br><br>Yes, as of 2017, there are approximately 74 million low-income Americans<br>who are covered by Medicaid.<br><br>Medicaid is a "means-tested" program, which means that a determination<br>is made whether an individual or family is eligible for government<br>assistance. That determination is based on whether the individual or<br>family possesses the "means" to do without that help. Part of the<br>"means" includes the ability to find gainful employment.<br><br>Note that many people on Medicaid are disabled, and also receive<br>Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability (SSD)<br>money. These people, clearly, do not have the ability to work, and so<br>would be unaffected by any requirement to search for a job. Also covered<br>by Medicaid are low-income seniors 65 and older, who are also not<br>subject to any work requirements.<br><br>Any "welfare-to-work" program adds the stipulation that those who have<br>the ability to work and are of working age must at least attempt to find<br>gainful employment. Today, these requirements are governed by the<br>states, not the Federal government. The latest example of this was<br>Arkansas' work requirements for Medicaid, stripping about 4300<br>recipients of coverage for failing to meet the state's work requirements<br>in September of 2018. This is the first time that a state has actually<br>removed recipients from Medicaid for failing to follow state rules<br>regarding work.<br><br>The Trump administration supports these rules as states impose them,<br>assuming that they do so fairly, and not with the goal of "just kicking<br>people off of Medicaid." The goal is to ensure that beneficiaries have<br>control by providing them with the right incentives to live healthier,<br>independent lives. For example, Kentucky's program did not meet those<br>goals, and was rejected. But Indiana, New Hampshire, and eight other<br>states are currently either asking for, or are implementing, work<br>requirements for the able-bodied.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
