<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What happens if one juror says not guilty?<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>In most cases, juries must reach a unanimous verdict. In all Federal<br>cases, the jury must be unanimous. In state cases, nearly all states<br>require unanimous verdicts in criminal trials. State civil trials are<br>the exception. About a third of US states allow just a majority vote to<br>find for the petitioner. Some states have a set dollar amount below<br>which a majority is allowed, and above which the finding must be<br>unanimous.<br><br>If one juror says not guilty when a unanimous vote is required, you have<br>what is called a "hung jury." What happens after a hung jury depends on<br>the court and the type of case. In some cases, a list of questions can<br>be produced which the parties must answer in a supplemental hearing. And<br>in other cases, the judge may declare a "mistrial."<br><br>In a civil mistrial, it's up to the petitioner to decide if they want to<br>start from scratch and re-try the case. In a criminal mistrial, the<br>prosecutor can choose to dismiss the charges entirely, or re-try the<br>case. The prosecutor could also approach the defense with a plea deal in<br>order to not re-try the case.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
