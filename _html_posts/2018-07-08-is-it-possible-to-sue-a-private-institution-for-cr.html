<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it possible to sue a private institution for cruel and unusual<br>punishment?**<br><br>In the United States, you can sue anyone for violating rights or<br>violating laws, causing you monetary damage.<br><br>The question: how likely are you to prevail?<br><br>I really don't see a scenario where a private institution could be<br>guilty of cruel and unusual punishment. The reason: "cruel and unusual<br>punishment" is a phrase from the Eighth Amendment, and it normally<br>applies to how the government treats prisoners. After you're convicted<br>and in jail, the Constitution says you still must be treated humanely.<br><br>Very few private institutions that I know of are incarcerating people,<br>and thus even in a position in which they could be punishing someone in<br>a "cruel and unusual" way. It's highly unlikely that a claim of cruel<br>and unusual punishment would prevail against a private institution.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
