<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I haveWill the 14th Amendment withstand Donald Trump?<br><br>Let's be fair. Trump can't rescind an Amendment. He can't "overrule,"<br>"scuttle," or "trash" an Amendment.<br><br>He's not trying to do that.<br><br>He has stated that he will use an Executive Order to clarify to his<br>agencies what the 14th Amendment means in terms of illegal immigrants.<br><br>Supreme Court cases have shown how the Amendment applies to citizenship<br>of children of US citizens. They also show how the Amendment applies to<br>citizenship of children of lawful permanent residents.<br><br>**But no Supreme Court decision has ever rendered a verdict on how the<br>14th Amendment applies to citizenship of children of illegal<br>immigrants.**<br><br>Senator Jacob Howard worked closely with Abraham Lincoln in drafting and<br>passing the 13th Amendment (which abolished slavery). He also served on<br>the Senate Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which drafted the 14th<br>Amendment. In 1866, Senator Howard clearly spelled out the intent of the<br>14th Amendment by writing (emphasis mine):<br><br>> Every person born within the limits of the United States, and subject<br>> to their jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and national law a<br>> citizen of the United States. **This will not, of course, include<br>> persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who<br>> belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited<br>> to the Government of the United States**, but will include every other<br>> class of persons. It settles the great question of citizenship and<br>> removes all doubt as to what persons are or are not citizens of the<br>> United States. This has long been a great desideratum in the<br>> jurisprudence and legislation of this country.<br><br>I want you to note where Senator Howard says "This will not, ***of<br>course***, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners,<br>aliens..." This is important. This means that it was *well known* at the<br>time that children born to foreigners (i.e. people visiting the country<br>legally, but not citizens) would not be automatic US citizens. He<br>also says "aliens," which is the old, not-politically-correct term for<br>"illegal immigrants." He also lumps foreigners and aliens in with<br>children who are born to ambassadors or foreign ministers, two<br>categories of people that birthright citizenship activists actually<br>admit are not US citizens by birth. Why them and not foreigners? Why<br>them and not illegal aliens? Because they work for a foreign government?<br>Doesn't a foreigner owe allegiance to a foreign government? Doesn't an<br>illegal alien owe allegiance to a foreign government?<br><br>See, the original phrase in the 14th Amendment which is so frequently<br>overlooked and distorted with today's meaning, **and which actually<br>argues against birthright citizenship for non-citizens,** is "subject to<br>the jurisdiction thereof." That phrase meant something completely<br>different when the 14th Amendment was written than it does today:<br><br>> All persons born or naturalized in the United States, **and subject to<br>> the jurisdiction thereof**, are citizens of the United States and of<br>> the State wherein they reside.<br><br>In the late 1800s, this did not mean "subject to our laws." In fact,<br>court decisions later on determined who is "subject to our laws." The<br>*Plyler* decision determined that every person in the United States,<br>legal or illegal, is subject to most of the provisions of the<br>Constitution. But disingenuous people are using *Plyler,* to this day,<br>to argue that this also applies to the whole 14th Amendment, and<br>that every person who drops a kid on US soil is instantly a citizen,<br>when that was never the intention of the Amendment in the first place.<br>The phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof," in the late 1800s,<br>meant "to whom you owe allegiance." It meant to which nation you are a<br>subject. If you are not a US citizen, you do not owe allegiance to the<br>US; you are not subject to the jurisdiction of the US. I know it's hard<br>to wrap your head around because that's not what the phrase means today.<br>But that's what it meant in 1860. Remember that it was also written to<br>*exclude Native American children*, who were subject to the jurisdiction<br>of their tribe, not the US government. They became *tribe citizens*, not<br>US citizens.<br><br>Yes, the Constitution applies to everyone. But *citizenship* is<br>something that the government gets to determine, and that is separate<br>from whether or not the Constitution actually applies to a person.<br><br>The 14th Amendment was never intended to grant citizenship to children<br>of foreigners visiting on tourist visas, and it was never intended to<br>grant citizenship to children of illegal immigrants, and it was never<br>intended to grant citizenship to children of foreign ambassadors. As you<br>know, it was actually written to ensure that the children of freed<br>slaves were automatically citizens, in an effort to quash some of the<br>terrible aftermath of the *Dred Scot* decision. But it was also written<br>to ensure that citizens of Native American tribes were *not* citizens,<br>even though they were born in the US.<br><br>There is a case to be made that the Supreme Court should clarify the<br>meaning of "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" when it comes to<br>citizenship at birth. They should clarify whether it means that a<br>wealthy foreign couple can fly to the US on a tourist visa, have a<br>child, and fly home, and then 18 years later, that "anchor baby" can<br>return to the US (it's already a citizen) and sponsor the entire family<br>in to the US, bypassing the entire immigration waiting list. They should<br>clarify whether or not a pregnant woman can raft across the Rio Grande<br>and have a child on the US side of the river and it automatically be a<br>citizen. Because you crossed a river. Illegally.<br><br>These are problems *unique to the United States*. You can't compare<br>our problems to any other country, because ***no other country has our<br>diversity, or our problems***. We, as the United States, need to correct<br>the problems we have, regardless of what the rest of the world does. The<br>world isn't even evenly split when it comes to birthright citizenship:<br>only 30 countries in the Western Hemisphere have birthright citizenship.<br>*But the United States is the only one people will flock to in order to<br>take advantage of that fact.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
