<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: yes.<br><br>Longer answer: The actual *mark* you apply to the paper is irrelevant.<br>The fact remains, you signed the paper. This is why a single line, or<br>even an X, are valid signatures. When you are asked to testify, and the<br>lawyer shows you the paper with the fake signature, and he asks you,<br>\"Did you sign this paper with this mark?\" how are you going to answer?<br><br>If you used the fake signature in an attempt to defraud the company by<br>violating the privacy policy and/or ethics code and then claiming you<br>never received the training and never signed the form, not only can you<br>be sued for privacy and/or ethics violations, you will also be sued for<br>fraud for intentionally trying to defraud the company.<br><br>And after all of that is concluded, you\'ll be terminated for cause,<br>which means no follow-on benefits. They walk you to the door.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
