<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The statement you quoted, on its face, wasn\'t very controversial. I<br>think we can all agree that we need to do a better job of identifying<br>those who are mentally unstable and getting them help.<br><br>The *problems* with her statements come after. She proposed<br>closing the \"gun show loophole\" which does not exist. She proposed<br>closing the \"Charleston loophole\" which says that if your background<br>check does not return an answer after three days you can purchase your<br>firearm, which is not what happened in Charleston either, and is still<br>not a cause for unhinged people going on shooting rampages.<br><br>She then claimed that the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act<br>(PLCAA) prevents people from suing gun manufacturers, ever. She called<br>it \"blanket immunity,\" and this is an incorrect characterization of<br>the law. She claims that PLCAA prevents people from suing gun<br>manufacturers to make their products \"safer.\" This is patently false,<br>and totally absurd.<br><br>Guns are very safe tools to operate. Very rarely do you hear of someone<br>being injured when they properly use the gun.<br><br>It\'s easy to confuse \"Safer for the operator\" with \"Safer for the<br>person at the business end of the gun\" when you fail to realize that<br>guns are actually designed to kill. If they do kill, the gun is working<br>properly. If the operator was uninjured, the gun is also operating<br>safely.<br><br>And under PLCAA, if a gun is unsafe to operate, the manufacturer can<br>still be sued.<br><br>The purpose of PLCAA was to prevent the Left\'s tactic of trying to sue<br>gun manufacturers into oblivion because their products killed people. If<br>their products are unsafe, you can still sue them. And if you want to<br>pressure a manufacturer to make a \"safer\" handgun (whatever that<br>means), you don\'t do that through the courts. You do it through your<br>purse or wallet. You buy the safer one, you ignore the unsafe one.<br>That\'s how free markets work.<br><br>You don\'t see people trying to sue Ford when a drunk driver kills a<br>family. You don\'t see people telling Ford they need to make a \"safer\"<br>car.<br><br>But this is exactly what Clinton wants to do. She wants to repeal PLCAA<br>so that gun violence victims\' families can transfer the liability from<br>the shooter to the manufacturer, something that is unprecedented in<br>history.<br><br>Don\'t let her rhetoric fool you.<br><br>In fact, Bernie Sanders actually had it right:<br><br>> Well, this is what I say, if I understand it --- and correct me if I'm<br>> wrong. If you go to a gun store and you legally purchase a gun, and<br>> then, three days later, if you go out and start killing people, is the<br>> point of this lawsuit to hold the gun shop owner or the manufacturer<br>> of that gun liable?<br>><br>> If that is the point, I have to tell you I disagree. I disagree<br>> because you hold people --- in terms of this liability thing, where<br>> you hold manufacturers' liability is if they understand that they're<br>> selling guns into an area that --- it's getting into the hands of<br>> criminals, of course they should be held liable.<br>><br>> But if they are selling a product to a person who buys it legally,<br>> what you're really talking about is ending gun manufacturing in<br>> America. I don't agree with that.<br><br>While Bernie and I agree on very little, on this point we totally agree.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
