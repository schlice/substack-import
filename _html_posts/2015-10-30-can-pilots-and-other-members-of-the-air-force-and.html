<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [*Effectively*, meaning in such a way as to force the<br>commanders and civilians in charge to make a decision in a particular<br>way?\<br>\<br>Nope.\<br>\<br>Maybe you\'re a little unclear on how the military works.\<br>\<br>If I really wanted to be a dick to someone who I outranked (and that<br>very rarely happened \-- I distinctly remember a Staff Sergeant mouthing<br>off to me at one time, and I was a Captain at the time), I\'d tell them,<br>\"OK, I\'ll flip \'ya for it,\" meaning if they win the proverbial<br>\"coin toss,\" they could have it their way. I\'d then flip an imaginary<br>coin in the air, catching it on my shoulder (covering my rank). When<br>I\'d reveal my rank underneath, I\'d say, \"Oh darn, I win.\"\<br>\<br>Petitions really aren\'t a part of the military ethos.\<br>\<br>The point of that story? The general outranks the pilots. When the<br>general (and the civilians in charge of the general) makes a decision,<br>that\'s it. Petitions might be a good way to gauge the feeling amongst<br>the pilots, but understanding that most of those generals are pilots<br>themselves, I bet they understand those same feelings already, so a<br>petition is not likely necessary.\<br>\<br>You may not know that the current CSAF, General Mark A. Welsh, was a<br>Hawg driver himself. Unfortunately, sometimes generals need to make the<br>hard decisions, and that may include cutting a beloved workhorse of the<br>Air Force. He said, \"We used the standard DoD planning scenarios. The<br>results very clearly showed that cutting the A-10 fleet was the<br>lowest-risk option, from an operational perspective, of a bunch of bad<br>options. While no one is happy, from a military perspective, it\'s the<br>right decision, and it\'s representative of the extremely difficult<br>choices that we\'re facing in the budget today.\" (*Checkpoints,* Dec,<br>2014, p. 16)\<br>\<br>As General Welsh said, cutting the A-10 is the lowest-risk option of a<br>bunch of bad options. It\'s the best of all the bad choices out there.\<br>\<br>[[Bill Stein\'s answer to Given its history of success, including<br>current combat against ISIL, why does the U.S. Air Force seek to cut<br>funding of the A-10 Thunderbolt (\"Warthog\")? Shouldn\'t they embrace<br>it as one of their best aircraft? Could the Navy etc. adopt it at<br>least?](https://www.quora.com/Given-its-history-of-success-including-current-combat-against-ISIL-why-does-the-U-S-Air-Force-seek-to-cut-funding-of-the-A-10-Thunderbolt-Warthog-Shouldnt-they-embrace-it-as-one-of-their-best-aircraft-Could-the-Navy-etc-adopt-it-at-least/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
