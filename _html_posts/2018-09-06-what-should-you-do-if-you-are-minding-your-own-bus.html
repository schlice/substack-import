<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What should you do if you are minding your own business and an armed<br>police officer approaches you, out of the view of others, and speaks to<br>you in a threatening manner?**<br><br>Answer his questions. Don't be a jerk; don't provoke him or snub your<br>nose at him.<br><br>If he arrests you, don't resist arrest.<br><br>If you really felt that his behavior was unacceptable, feel free to<br>report him. If you weren't arrested, you'll have to go down to the<br>station to file an official report. Be prepared to be interviewed in an<br>interview room. Be prepared to give your real name, address, and phone<br>number. If you were arrested, inform your lawyer of the issue you have<br>with the officer's conduct, and ensure that while your lawyer is<br>addressing the charge at hand, he is also, separately, addressing the<br>officer's conduct during the incident.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
