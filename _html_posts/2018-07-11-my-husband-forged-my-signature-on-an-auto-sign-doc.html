<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My husband forged my signature on an auto sign document. Is it<br>legal?**<br><br>I'm going to assume that in your answer "auto sign" means some document<br>you needed to sign for your "auto" or your car. You probably meant to<br>say an "auto loan" document.<br><br>[[Definition of forgery from<br>FindLaw.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=de2e90&url=http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/forgery.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="findlaw.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Notice the essential element of forgery as a crime (emphasis mine):<br><br>> In most jurisdictions, the crime of forgery is not charged unless the<br>> forgery is done **with intent to deceive or the attempt to commit<br>> fraud or larceny**. For instance, works of arts can be copied or<br>> replicated without any crime being committed unless someone attempted<br>> to sell or represent the copies as originals. In these cases, the<br>> copies would become illegal forgeries.<br><br>Therefore, legally speaking, ***if he actually had your permission, and<br>you consented to the signature***, the signature is legal.<br><br>But the legality turns on *intent*, which is very difficult to prove. So<br>if I was your husband, I'd have taken a picture of the document and sent<br>it to you and you would have replied saying "go ahead and sign for me"<br>so that I had a paper trail that I could prove that you consented to me<br>signing your name.<br><br>Now, you didn't say whether or not you consented to your signature being<br>used. *If you did not consent to your signature being used*, it is<br>by definition a forgery, and the signature is void, and your husband<br>could be facing fraud charges. If it's a loan, he could be facing bank<br>fraud charges, and that's a Federal crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
