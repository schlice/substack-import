<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there a legal source that matches each U.S. law with a punishment<br>for breaking it?**<br><br>In general, within each written law (either federal or state), the range<br>of punishments for violating those laws are already written there. They<br>describe the law, the conditions under which a person has violated the<br>law, and the range of punishments which can be levied for breaking that<br>law.<br><br>It is a range of punishments because it is a court of law which decides<br>exactly what (if any) punishment will be given after being found guilty<br>of violating a law. That said, the punishment will fall somewhere in<br>that range.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
