<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You stated that someone was charged with \"barring the course of<br>justice\" (otherwise known as \"obstruction of justice\") but this<br>person knew about a murder and intentionally deflected law enforcement.<br><br>This is very serious. How serious, you ask?<br><br>If someone knew about a murder, and specifically provided false<br>information so that attention was deflected from the actual murderer or<br>the false information was given specifically to derail the actual<br>investigation, this person could then be charged with the offense of<br>\"accessory after the fact.\" If you are an accessory to a crime, you<br>are generally charged exactly as the actual suspect is charged.<br><br>The charge of \"barring the course of justice\" is a lesser included<br>offense of the \"accessory after the fact\" charge.<br><br>If the person is indeed charged with obstruction, it is not as serious<br>as the greater charge of accessory after the fact, but it\'s still<br>likely to be considered felony obstruction (depending on jurisdiction,<br>since it\'s more egregious than something like failing to give your real<br>name), and will get that person a minimum of one year in prison. Other<br>punishments are specific to the jurisdiction (i.e. maximums and fines),<br>but a felony is a minimum of one year in prison.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
