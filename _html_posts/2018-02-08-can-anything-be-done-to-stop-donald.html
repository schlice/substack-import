<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>To answer your specific question, he's the Commander in Chief. That<br>means he's the boss. And since there is no one else in the military's<br>food chain higher than him, I don't think there's anyone who can really<br>stop him from doing as he pleases with the military.<br><br>But probably what's more interesting is *why* he's doing it. I'm<br>surprised you haven't read Obama's manifesto. "Little Donny" has. That<br>manifesto would be *Rules for Radicals* by Saul Alinsky. Yes, Trump has<br>read it. And yes, he's totally using it against you. It's the book that<br>essentially defined the entire eight years of the Obama administration.<br>And Trump is using it.<br><br>He's using Twitter to enrage you. He's calling out the media in general<br>(and CNN in specific) and isolating them. He's using ridicule, which<br>Alinsky says is "the most powerful weapon of all." And it's working<br>(clearly).<br><br>The parade idea is no different. It is literally infuriating not only<br>everyone on the Left, but all of his enemies, worldwide. So I guess the<br>tactic continues to work.<br><br>I'm surprised you haven't read it. Because if you did, you'd see that<br>Trump's actions aren't unconsidered or brash or boorish. They're<br>straight out of the book.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
