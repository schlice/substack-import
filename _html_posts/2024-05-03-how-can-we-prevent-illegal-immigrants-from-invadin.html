<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>1.  Do not elect Democrats. Democrats want more illegal immigrants, and<br>    then they want to give those same illegal immigrants voting status<br>    (with a wink-wink nod-nod reminder as to which party is their Santa<br>    Claus).<br>2.  But in addition to that, live in a state with a strong Castle<br>    Doctrine, and then defend your home with force. Pinpoint accurate,<br>    high-velocity force.
