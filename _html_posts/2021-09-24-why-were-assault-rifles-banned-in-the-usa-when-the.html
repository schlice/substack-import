<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is a truth that you may not be aware of:<br><br>Rights are not defined anywhere in the Constitution.<br><br>While we know that you have the freedom of speech, what exactly are you<br>allowed to say? Are there any restrictions at all on what you can say?<br>Doesn't the state have the responsibility to provide for the safety of<br>its citizens? Can't the state regulate the time, place, and manner of<br>your speech so as to preserve the general welfare of the population? Can<br>you shout "Fire!" in a crowded theater if there is no fire?<br><br>So while there is a right, where that right bumps into other rights is<br>where we find the sphere of law, both written and case law. The law<br>defines the limits of the right, and what the state has the ability to<br>restrict in order for it to meet its obligations to its citizens.<br><br>Laws allow my free exercise of my rights to not interfere with your free<br>exercise of your rights. In other words, *your right to swing your arm<br>ends at my nose.* They also allow the state to accomplish their stated<br>mandates, such as preserving the safety of the population.<br><br>In this way, you can ask yourself if there is a way to restrict a<br>specific type of weapon without actually denying you your right to keep<br>and bear arms.<br><br>While you may not necessarily think so, the courts do. The courts said<br>that you can restrict *a specific type* of weapon, and doing so is not<br>unconstitutional, and does not deny you the ability to keep and bear<br>arms. For example, *United States v. Miller* held that the Second<br>Amendment does not protect your right to own a sawed-off shotgun.<br>Therefore, we know that certain types of weapons can be restricted.<br><br>While we definitely disagree with the government about restricting<br>"assault weapons," Congress allowed it because it had a built-in<br>expiration date. The AWB would have to be renewed in ten years, after a<br>showing that it actually had benefit. Additionally, it didn't make<br>*ownership* of assault weapons illegal; it just halted sales of *new*<br>assault weapons.<br><br>When ten years had passed, and they saw that the AWB had *no significant<br>impact on crime rates, or on rates of homicide with a gun* (surprise,<br>surprise), it was allowed to expire.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why were assault rifles banned in the USA when the 2nd amendment clearly<br>states that citizens have the right to bear arms and that right shall<br>not be infringed?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
