<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What states is it illegal to carry pepper spray?<br><br>None. Pepper spray can be purchased and carried in all 50 states.<br><br>There are, of course, some variations in specifics in the states, but no<br>outright bans.<br><br>> - California: As of January 1, 1996 and as a result of Assembly Bill<br>>   830 (Speier), the pepper spray and Mace programs are now<br>>   deregulated. Consumers will no longer be required to have training,<br>>   and a certificate is not required to purchase or possess these<br>>   items. Pepper spray and Mace are available through gun shops,<br>>   sporting goods stores, and other business outlets. California Penal<br>>   Code Section 12400--12460 govern pepper spray use in California.<br>>   Container holding the defense spray must contain no more than 2.5<br>>   ounces (71 g) net weight of aerosol spray. Certain individuals are<br>>   still prohibited from possessing pepper spray, including minors<br>>   under the age of 16, convicted felons, individuals convicted of<br>>   certain drug offences, individuals convicted of assault, and<br>>   individuals convicted of misusing pepper spray.<br>> - Massachusetts: Before July 1, 2014, residents may purchase defense<br>>   sprays only from licensed Firearms Dealers in that state, and must<br>>   hold a valid Firearms Identification Card (FID) or License to Carry<br>>   Firearms (LTC) to purchase or to possess outside of one\'s own<br>>   private property. New legislations allow residents to purchase<br>>   pepper spray without a Firearms Identification Card starting July 1.<br>> - Florida: Any pepper spray containing no more than 2 ounces (57 g) of<br>>   chemical can be carried in public openly or concealed without a<br>>   permit. Furthermore, any such pepper spray is classified as<br>>   \"self-defense chemical spray\" and therefore not considered a<br>>   weapon under Florida law.<br>> - Michigan: Allows \"reasonable use\" of spray containing not more<br>>   than 18% oleoresin capsicum to protect \"a person or property under<br>>   circumstances that would justify the person\'s use of physical<br>>   force\". It is illegal to distribute a \"self-defense spray\" to a<br>>   person under 18 years of age.<br>> - New York: Can be legally possessed by any person age 18 or over.<br>>   Restricted to no more than 0.67% capsaicin content. It must be<br>>   purchased in person (i.e., cannot be purchased by mail-order or<br>>   internet sale) either at a pharmacy or from a licensed firearm<br>>   retailer (NY Penal Law 265.20 14) and the seller must keep a record<br>>   of purchases. The use of pepper spray to prevent a public official<br>>   from performing his/her official duties is a class-E felony.<br>> - New Jersey: Non-felons over the age of 18 can possess a small amount<br>>   of pepper spray, with no more than three-quarters of one ounce<br>>   (28 g) of chemical substance.<br>> - Virginia: Code of Virginia ยง 18.2-312. Illegal use of tear gas,<br>>   phosgene and other gases. \"If any person maliciously release or<br>>   cause or procure to be released in any private home, place of<br>>   business or place of public gathering any tear gas, mustard gas,<br>>   phosgene gas or other noxious or nauseating gases or mixtures of<br>>   chemicals designed to, and capable of, producing vile or injurious<br>>   or nauseating odors or gases, and bodily injury results to any<br>>   person from such gas or odor, the offending person shall be guilty<br>>   of a Class 3 felony. If such act be done unlawfully, but not<br>>   maliciously, the offending person shall be guilty of a Class 6<br>>   felony. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the use of tear gas<br>>   or other gases by police officers or other peace officers in the<br>>   proper performance of their duties, or by any person or persons in<br>>   the protection of person, life or property.\"<br>> - Washington: Persons over 18 may carry personal-protection spray<br>>   devices.Persons over age 14 may carry personal-protection spray<br>>   devices with their legal guardian\'s consent.<br>> - Wisconsin: Tear gas is not permissible by regulation, OC products<br>>   with a maximum OC concentration of 10% and weight range of oleoresin<br>>   of capsicum and inert ingredients of 15--60 grams (0.53--2.12 oz)<br>>   are authorized. Further, the product cannot be camouflaged, and must<br>>   have a safety feature designed to prevent accidental discharge. The<br>>   units may not have an effective range of over 20 feet (6.1 m) and<br>>   must have an effective range of six feet (1.8 m).In addition there<br>>   are certain labeling and packaging requirements, it must not be sold<br>>   to anyone under 18 and the phone number of the manufacturer has to<br>>   be on the label. The units must also be sold in sealed tamper-proof<br>>   packages.<br>> - Texas law makes it legal for an individual to possess a small,<br>>   commercially-sold container of pepper spray for personal<br>>   self-defense. However, Texas law otherwise makes it illegal to carry<br>>   a \"chemical dispensing device\".\[1\](#vIyjK){#cite-vIyjK<br>>   .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-vIyjK){.citation_index} [[Pepper spray -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5b3bfd&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_spray){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
