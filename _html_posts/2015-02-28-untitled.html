<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [*Well all guns are designed to kill.*\<br>*whether its fully auto, semi auto, lever action , pump or bolt action<br>they are still more deadly than a knife or club.*\<br>\<br>This, sadly, is incorrect. Guns are more *efficient* at killing than<br>knives or clubs, but to say that they are more *deadly* is<br>[incorrect.(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=fad9f1&url=http://ishttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihabara_massacre){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container} Just ask the<br>samurai from Japan just how deadly someone with a sword can be. Guns are<br>equalizers, in that you don\'t need exceptional physical prowess to<br>wield one effectively. A small woman can take down a large man with a<br>gun, more efficiently than she could with a knife or club.\<br>\<br>*does the \"right to bear arms\" cover bombs as well, or are they<br>illegal?*\<br>The right to bear arms does not cover mass-casualty devices like<br>Claymore mines or grenades. The National Firearms Act of 1938 has made<br>sure of that, and it has been just fine so far. So no, the right to bear<br>arms does not cover bombs.\<br>\<br>*And you can own fully automatic weapons outside of the armed<br>services.*\<br>Yes, with a Federal Firearms License. They are not easy or cheap to come<br>by, and they will do more background checking than you get when you walk<br>into your local gun store to by a handgun. The point here is that it\'s<br>highly unlikely that someone would obtain a Federal Firearms License<br>just to buy an automatic weapon to commit crimes with. They\'re more<br>likely to buy such a weapon on the black market. One thing which has<br>been made clear throughout history:\<br>\<br>Criminals, almost to a person, don\'t follow laws.\<br>\<br>So if someone wants to kill lots of people, there\'s a fair chance that<br>he\'s not going to follow laws to do it. They probably won\'t legally<br>buy firearms from your local store; they\'ll probably buy an illegal<br>fully-automatic weapon from their local black market gun<br>dealer.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Should-people-on-college-campuses-be-allowed-to-have-guns/answer/Harman-Meyerhoff<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
