While she claimed she was a B student, her GPA was a 2.0<br>(which is just barely D- level, just above failing). The County judge<br>said that her testimony was proof of either "a lack of intelligence or a<br>lack of credibility."<br><br>An appeals court overturned the county court ruling on a 2--1 vote. The<br>appeals court said the girl "had a 2.0 GPA right now, but she's making<br>B's so she hopes to bring her average up."<br><br>She said she wants an abortion because she knows she's not "financially<br>stable" right now and wants to get there before she has a baby. She<br>actually wants to first join the military and become financially stable<br>before she has a baby.<br><br>The appeals court said that \"the petitioner\'s testimony demonstrates<br>that she possesses an ability to assess the consequences of her choice<br>and the risk it entails, as well as the intention to reassess her<br>decision after consultation with her physician.\"<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can you imagine a court deems a 17 year old girl \"not intelligent<br>enough\" to have an abortion, but by default, smart enough to have,<br>raise, and support a child?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
