<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [You\'re correct, almost every jurisdiction requires<br>compliance with the lawful order of a peace officer.\<br>\<br>The key word there is \"lawful.\"\<br>\<br>If I don\'t have the authority to stop you, then my order for you to<br>stop would be \"unlawful.\"\<br>\<br>Clearly, this wouldn\'t be something you would sort out at the scene,<br>but your lawyer would get your entire case thrown out even if you had<br>the smoking gun in your pocket from a recent murder. It\'s called the<br>\"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine. Because the stop was unlawful,<br>everything that follows from the stop is also unlawful and inadmissible<br>in court.\<br>\<br>So in summary: do what they are telling you, and let your lawyer sort<br>the rest out; that\'s what you pay them for.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Does-running-from-the-police-establish-reasonable-suspicion-or-probable-cause-for-a-detention-or-an-arrest/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
