<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Do symptoms calm down when MS patients cry?<br><br>It would be easy to dismiss this question as nonsense. We've had all<br>these decades of treating MS symptoms with many varieties of treatments,<br>including corticosteroids and pain killes, and you say you can *cry your<br>way to feeling better?*<br><br>Well not so fast, it's at least conceivable that the idea has some<br>merit.<br><br>> Biochemist and tear expert Dr. William Frey has researched chemical<br>> differences between protective and emotional tears. Emotional tears<br>> contain three chemicals released by the body during stress: 1)<br>> Leucine-enkephalin --- a mood-elevating and pain reducing endorphine<br>> 2) ACTH --- a hormone considered to be the most reliable indicator of<br>> stress and 3) Prolactin --- the hormone that regulates milk production<br>> in mammals.<br>><br>> Frey states that emotional crying has a physical purpose: tears are<br>> secreted through a duct, much like urination. He believes that like<br>> urination, tearing may be involved in removing toxic substances or<br>> waste products from the body. He posits that this is why so many<br>> people report feeling better after crying. The venting of emotions is<br>> helpful, but the actual chemical composition of the discharged tears<br>> may be involved in this feeling of well-being.<br>><br>> Interestingly, there is a 24 percent higher concentration of protein<br>> in emotional tears than in irritant tears. This protein carries the<br>> molecular code for emotions throughout the body. Frey also states that<br>> our tear gland concentrates manganese, a mineral involved with our<br>> moods, and tears remove this concentrated mineral from our body. The<br>> concentration of manganese is 30 times greater in tears than in blood<br>> serum. And while irritant tears were 98 percent water, emotional tears<br>> contained many more toxins.\[1\](#Sjpgi){#cite-Sjpgi .citation_link}<br><br>The endorphines and hormones present in emotional tears are fascinating.<br>Leucine-enkephalin is an endorphine which reduces pain and boosts mood,<br>so MS pain could be temporarily relieved by its release.<br><br>But more interesting to me is the pregnancy hormone *prolactin*, which<br>has been shown in studies to actually trigger *the rebuilding of<br>myelin*. Of course, its use in men is contraindicated due to the<br>propensity for prolactin to induce male lactation. Eww...<br><br>But still, it is at least within the realm of possibility that crying<br>emotional tears (like when you watch a sad movie) could, at least<br>potentially, help your MS symptoms. To the best of my knowledge, this<br>has never been studied. But maybe it should be.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-Sjpgi){.citation_index} [[Gender differences and the<br>health benefits of<br>crying](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ed85c6&url=https://www.smdailyjournal.com/opinion/gender-differences-and-the-health-benefits-of-crying/article_ccff1ce1-20c4-5f47-99dd-83a99c80f2d8.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="smdailyjournal.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
