<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [This has been a question that Congress, the Supreme Court,<br>and states have been wrestling with since the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\<br>\<br>For the most part, the court has found that the Civil Rights Act is<br>constitutional, and is complementary to most protections in the<br>Constitution. Where we are finding difference is in gay rights. Only 21<br>states and the District of Columbia have made \"sexual orientation\" a<br>protected class under the Civil Rights Act. The reason that so many<br>states (and the Federal government) have not added the same protection<br>is because of the conflict between **the right to be free from<br>discrimination and the right to freely practice one\'s religion.**<br>Churches, church-affiliated organizations, and some private<br>organizations have successfully made such First Amendment claims. The<br>Free Exercise clause states that Congress shall make no law prohibiting<br>the free exercise of religion. Laws that burden religious practice<br>without a compelling state interest can be overturned on Free Exercise<br>grounds. Imposing public accommodation laws which protect sexual<br>orientation may burden free exercise of religion, especially in<br>businesses with expressive, or speech-related purposes (such as wedding<br>photography).\<br>\<br>Legal scholars are all over the map on where to draw the line (i.e. in a<br>zero-sum game, religious liberty wins or gay rights wins). Clearly,<br>there should be sexual orientation protections in public accommodations<br>nationwide. But just as clearly, there should be sensible religious<br>exemptions built in. For example, you could say that churches and<br>church-affiliated organizations would be able to claim a religious<br>exemption. Also, businesses with over X employees would not be eligible<br>for religious exemption to the public accommodation law, which allows<br>for small businesses, which are generally privately held and more<br>personally invested and run by the owners, to maintain religious<br>exemptions, where larger businesses which are not as deeply religious as<br>smaller ones, would not. You would also have to deny exemptions to<br>certain types of public accommodations, such as the ones that provide<br>emergency services (i.e. emergency room doctors and nurses, EMT\'s), or<br>others in which denying such services places a person\'s life or health<br>in jeopardy, such as basic accommodations like hotels and motels, or<br>other emergency services like towing services. Therefore, the pharmacist<br>in the hospital would not be exempt, where the pharmacist in the strip<br>mall might. The pharmacist in the Wal-Mart might not be exempt, and the<br>pharmacist in the strip mall might not if he was the only pharmacist<br>within hundreds of miles.\<br>\<br>Applying new public accommodations standards in this way allows for some<br>religious exemptions to small, privately-held businesses, and it also<br>allows for the \"narrowing of the field\" in the future, and applying<br>further restrictions on who might get an exemption.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
