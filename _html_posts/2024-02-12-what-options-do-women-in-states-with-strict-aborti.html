<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The woman has several options:<br><br>1.  Carry the baby to term and deal with the "serious problems" after<br>    the baby is born, assuming the baby survives the birth.<br>2.  Go to a state which allows abortion for any reason and get an<br>    abortion. Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion<br>    provider, can't provide abortions in states which ban them, but they<br>    have resources to connect you to agencies which can help you find a<br>    provider in an abortion-friendly state, as well as helping you pay<br>    for gas, flights, travel, meals, and childcare expenses.<br>3.  The riskiest option (and the option that is *potentially* illegal,<br>    depending on your state): apply for and get abortion pills through<br>    the mail. However, this is extremely risky, especially if you are at<br>    the point in your pregnancy where you could identify "serious<br>    problems." Usually, abortion pills are only medically safe in<br>    pregnancies up to 10 weeks. But major fetal abnormalities can<br>    usually only be detected after roughly 10 or 11 weeks of gestation.<br>    Some anomalies, such as spina bifida, heart defects, or<br>    diaphragmatic hernia, cannot be reliably detected before 13 weeks of<br>    gestation. The CDC recommends a first trimester screening between<br>    weeks 11 and 13 of pregnancy to look for certain birth defects, such<br>    as Down syndrome or chromosomal disorders. Therefore, abortion pills<br>    may not be appropriate, and if you take them, you could be placing<br>    your own health at serious risk, and it may be illegal in your<br>    state.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
