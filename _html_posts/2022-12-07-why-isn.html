<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Public nudity is not legal because society has decided that it should<br>not be.<br><br>States have obligations to create well-ordered societies within their<br>borders. Part of their undeniable responsibilities are to "promote the<br>general welfare" so that everyone can safely participate in society.<br><br>Public nudity is limited because societies have equated nudity with<br>sexuality. Right or wrong, that's what they've done. While female<br>breasts are indeed just appendages used to nurse infants, society has<br>sexualized them, in a way in which society has not done with the male<br>chest. Again, in an attempt to create an ordered society where sexual<br>activity is confined to private spaces (which is definitely an<br>objectively good goal for a society to have), exposure of breasts in<br>public is (mostly) forbidden. The same holds true for all genitalia;<br>while it is used to excrete waste, the genitalia is also used for sex.<br>Separating the two uses is generally too problematic, especially for<br>females who show little physical change between states of arousal and<br>non-arousal.<br><br>In areas where public nudity is permitted, lines are indeed still drawn<br>around public arousal, the exhibition of which is deemed to be sexual.<br>This does target men, but it does not *unjustly* target men.<br><br>At the end of the day, states need to create a safe society where people<br>can freely engage with each other. Restricting the time, place, and<br>manner of public nudity is therefore a state prerogative.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
