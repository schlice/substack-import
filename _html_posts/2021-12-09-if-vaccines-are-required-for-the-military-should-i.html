<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, military members should not be allowed to break their service<br>commitments if they don't want the vaccine.<br><br>Members were fully aware of the types of exemptions for vaccines which<br>were available at the time they enlisted, and none of those exemptions<br>are changing now. Members are free to exercise their rights to use any<br>of those exemptions if they so choose. Vaccines did not become mandatory<br>until they were fully approved by the FDA, so there can no longer be an<br>objection about an "unapproved" vaccine.<br><br>Members who are not under any Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC) are<br>free to separate at any time. ADSCs are incurred upon certain events,<br>such as the military paying for your college, or when you sign an<br>enlistment contract.<br><br>In other words, there is no reason that they should get an extra<br>opportunity to breach their contract or lessen their ADSC due to this<br>vaccine.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>If vaccines are required for the military, should individual soldiers<br>and officers have the freedom to leave the service before their time if<br>they wish to remain unvaccinated?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
