<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So two questions here:<br><br>What does it really mean to be a born again Christian?<br><br>The phrase "Born-again Christian" actually comes from the Bible:<br><br>> Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the<br>> Jews. This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, "Rabbi, we know<br>> that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs<br>> that you do unless God is with him." Jesus answered him, "Truly,<br>> truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the<br>> kingdom of God." Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man be born when he<br>> is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother\'s womb and be<br>> born?" Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born<br>> of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That<br>> which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the<br>> Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born<br>> again.' The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but<br>> you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with<br>> everyone who is born of the Spirit."<br>><br>> Nicodemus said to him, "How can these things be?" Jesus answered him,<br>> "Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these<br>> things? Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear<br>> witness to what we have seen, but you do not receive our testimony. If<br>> I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you<br>> believe if I tell you heavenly things? No one has ascended into heaven<br>> except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man. And as Moses<br>> lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be<br>> lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.<br>><br>> "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever<br>> believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." --- John<br>> 3:1--16 NIV<br><br>As you can see, Nicodemus is clearly very confused when Jesus tells him<br>that you must be "born again" in order to enter the kingdom of heaven.<br>He says, "How can this be? Can you enter into your mother's womb a<br>second time and be born again?"<br><br>But Jesus wasn't talking about crawling back into your mother's womb to<br>be reborn. Reading the rest of the section, Jesus makes clear that the<br>"rebirth" we are discussing is *spiritual* ("so it is with everyone who<br>is born of the Spirit"). Clearly, Jesus is discussing a spiritual<br>rebirth.<br><br>Indeed, the BIble tells us that when we are saved, we die to self<br>and we are born again in spirit. We die to our old ways. We die to<br>our old life. And we are reborn as a new person in Christ. This is the<br>point at which *salvation* occurs. Salvation is a one-shot deal, an<br>instantaneous reconciling of the believer to Christ.<br><br>The Bible says that before we accepted Christ, we were *dead* in our<br>sin, following the evils of this world. But God made us alive together<br>with Christ (Ephesians 2:1--10). So you can see what they were talking<br>about when Jesus was discussing being "born again" in spirit. When the<br>believer makes a true confession of his or her sins, a true repentance<br>of those sins (which includes a "turning away" from that life), and a<br>complete acceptance of Jesus as their personal Lord and Savior, that<br>*salvation* happens. This is the point at which the believer *dies* to<br>their old way of life, and is *born again* in spirit and truth.<br><br>Salvation is a gift from God. Those who accept that gift die to their<br>old life.<br><br>**Can one study the Bible without actually having a close relationship<br>with Christ?**<br><br>It depends on what you mean by "study the Bible." You can absolutely<br>read the Bible and gain nothing from the experience except for reading a<br>story about something that happened to some people about 2000 years ago.<br><br>But the Bible, being the inspired word of God, will change you *if you<br>let it*.<br><br>The difference is how you read.<br><br>If you enter into your time of reading prayerfully, asking God to clear<br>your heart to accept the truth of the words in Scripture, he will allow<br>the words to touch your heart. True transformation is of God, not of us<br>reading a book. The book doesn't do the work; the words on the page<br>don't do the work, God does the work. And God will only do the work<br>*when you let him*. He respects your free will and will never force you<br>to believe. But he will never say no if you ask.<br><br>So if you read the Bible without preparing an open mind and an open<br>heart, and without doing so after prayerfully asking God to allow the<br>words to speak to your soul, all you'll be doing is reading a book. But<br>if you accept that the Bible is the inspired word of God, if you open<br>your heart to its truths, and you humbly ask God to whisper his truth to<br>you through your reading, *this book will change your life.*<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What does it really mean to be a born again Christian?
