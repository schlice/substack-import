<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you are in a situation in which you are able to divert a train that<br>is about to hit 5 people so that it hits one person, what is the legally<br>right thing to do?**<br><br>*(This answer is specific to the US. Other countries may have different<br>laws which would change the nature of this answer)*<br><br>Since you asked about the legal answer, then the answer is, as<br>everyone has said, to do nothing. Legally, you are only implicated if<br>you act. There is no law which *requires* you to intervene to save a<br>life in this situation, unless you are in certain specific government or<br>medical professions (and if you are, you know you are). Therefore, as an<br>unaffiliated civilian, you are legally correct if you do nothing.<br><br>So you can either be legally responsible for the death of one person, or<br>not legally responsible for the deaths of five people.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
