When asking questions, it helps to know what<br>precisely happened.<br><br>From the actual decision:<br><br>> Lorie Smith wants to expand her graphic design business, 303 Creative<br>> LLC, to include services for couples seeking wedding websites. But Ms.<br>> Smith worries that Colorado will use the Colorado Anti-Discrimination<br>> Act to compel her---in violation of the First Amendment---to create<br>> websites celebrating marriages she does not endorse. To clarify her<br>> rights, Ms. Smith filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction to prevent the<br>> State from forcing her to create websites celebrating marriages that<br>> defy her belief that marriage should be reserved to unions between one<br>> man and one woman.<br>><br>> \...\<br>><br>> *Held:* The First Amendment prohibits Colorado from forcing a website<br>> designer to create expressive designs speaking messages with which the<br>> designer disagrees. \[1\](#CxgUj){#cite-CxgUj .citation_link}<br><br>The decision DID NOT say that business owners can discriminate<br>against gay couples. In fact, if a gay couple was denied service, they<br>could absolutely bring a complaint under state law and the business<br>would face disciplinary action.<br><br>Lorie Smith, just like Jack Phillips, does business with *everyone*.<br>Gay, straight, black, white, whatever.<br><br>What they will *not* do is express messages which conflict with their<br>deeply-held religious beliefs.<br><br>And the Court said that the First Amendment protects the right of a<br>business to not speak a state-endorsed message which does not comport<br>with their beliefs.<br><br>It's not about the *people*. It's about the *message*.<br><br>\<br><br>> *Couldn\'t gay customers and those who support them stop doing<br>> business with them instead of trying to force someone to think how<br>> they do?*<br><br>Absolutely! In fact, if they are at all concerned about it, we<br>encourage gay couples (and those who support them) to choose the<br>businesses with which they work carefully, making sure they only choose<br>to endorse the businesses whose ideals are in line with their own.<br><br>This "choosing" of businesses is called free-market capitalism. A<br>business exchange is a mutually agreed-upon transaction between a<br>willing buyer and a willing seller. Both the buyer and the seller must<br>be willing and able to engage in the transaction. Then, and only then,<br>will the transaction proceed.<br><br>No one should compel either the buyer or the seller to engage in the<br>transaction against their will. Free-market capitalism ideally would<br>never compel either the buyer or the seller to engage in commerce.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-CxgUj){.citation_index}<br>[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opi\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d340d7&url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-476_c185.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="supremecourt.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
