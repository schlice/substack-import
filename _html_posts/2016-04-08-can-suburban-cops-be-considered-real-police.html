<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You raise a valid question. I mean, how does a county sheriff\'s deputy<br>from middle-of-nowhere, population 12 plus a few cows relate in<br>experience to a big-city cop like NY or LA or Chicago?<br><br>In experience, they don\'t even come close.<br><br>But are they *real*?<br><br>Well, they fill a real need, and they provide a real service. Their oath<br>of office is the same. Their commitment to serving their community is<br>the same. Their willingness to take a bullet for you is the same.<br><br>So are they *real* police? In every sense of the word, *yes.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
