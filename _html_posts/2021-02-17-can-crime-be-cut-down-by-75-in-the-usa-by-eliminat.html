<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can crime be cut down by 75% in the USA by eliminating this phrase<br>from the Constitution "No Cruel Or Unusual punishment"?**<br><br>We debate continuously in this country whether or not we should have<br>capital punishment. There is a vocal minority who believes that capital<br>punishment can be considered "cruel and/or unusual." Yet we still have<br>it.<br><br>Nevertheless, people still commit murder, even with the threat of the<br>state catching and killing them.<br><br>So even with a punishment as severe and final as death, people still<br>commit those crimes. There is at least, therefore, some evidence to show<br>that the severity of the punishment is not always a deterrent to crime.<br>So I don't think you can say definitively that you'll get a 75%<br>reduction in crime by allowing cruel punishments.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
