<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What is the emoluments clause?<br><br>The Emoluments Clause (Article I, Section 9, Clause 8), or the "Title of<br>Nobility" Clause, reads:<br><br>> No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no<br>> Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall,<br>> without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument,<br>> Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or<br>> foreign State.<br><br>In [[Federalist<br>22](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1e30fe&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._22){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, Hamilton said, \"One of<br>the weak sides of republics, among their numerous advantages, is that<br>they afford too easy an inlet to foreign corruption.\" To that end, the<br>Emoluments Clause was designed to do two things: prevent a Nobility<br>Class from being established in the United States, and protect the<br>government from being influenced by foreign governments.<br><br>The word "emolument" has a very broad meaning, but at the time of the<br>Constitution's writing, it meant "benefit," "profit," or "advantage." To<br>that end, people who hold offices of profit or trust (like the<br>President) cannot receive any "benefit," "profit," or "advantage" from a<br>foreign government. The Office of Legal Counsel in the DOJ has stated<br>that this clause is violated if that person receives money from a<br>business or partnership, and the amount of money he receives is \"a<br>function of the amount paid to the \business or partnership\ by the<br>foreign government.\" You can see then that the foreign government could<br>be directly influencing the president through the business or<br>partnership, which could be a way for the foreign government to exert<br>"undue influence or corruption."\[1\](#ZvNvc){#cite-ZvNvc<br>.citation_link}<br><br>Most Presidents have sidestepped this issue by placing their assets into<br>a "blind trust." What this means is that the assets of the President are<br>sold, the proceeds are used to procure new assets, and the President is<br>unaware of the assets in the trust. He cannot know what assets are held<br>in trust; therefore, he can never be unduly influenced by someone<br>profiting his assets, because he doesn't know what they are.<br><br>President Trump presents a unique case, as his name and brand is<br>valuable. His properties are valuable, in part, because of his name on<br>them. While he can relinquish ownership and day-to-day control of his<br>assets, and he can divert profits to someone else (i.e. trustees), and<br>even if he places his assets into blind trust (which would be nearly<br>impossible with real property), he will always know what assets are<br>valuable to him, as there will always be assets with the Trump name on<br>them, whether or not he personally has any in blind trust.<br><br>Another interesting twist: some of Trump's properties are mortgaged, and<br>those mortgages are owned by foreign banks. Are any of Trump's foreign<br>policy deals changing his position in his mortgaged properties? More<br>importantly, has he made (or will he make) foreign policy decisions<br>based on what would be beneficial to his mortgage instead of what is<br>beneficial to the country? You can be sure that the Office of Legal<br>Counsel is scrutinizing every one of Trump's assets and their holdings<br>very closely, to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ZvNvc){.citation_index}<br>[http://ogc.osd.mil/defense_ethic\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e033f1&url=http://ogc.osd.mil/defense_ethics/resource_library/emoluments_clause_applications.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="osd.mil"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
