<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Unless your termination agreement had some clause which barred you from<br>ever working for that parent company or its subsidiaries ever again, you<br>*can* re-apply. Companies do, indeed, re-hire employees, but most often,<br>those employees quit to pursue other opportunities, and then came back<br>when they realized the grass *really wasn't* greener on the other side<br>of the fence. Your personnel file (which will remain permanent in some<br>minimal form at the company forever) is re-opened, and you get a<br>"re-hire date" as well as your original hire date.<br><br>However, if you were terminated for cause (as it sounds like you were)<br>instead of terminated without cause (i.e. laid off), your personnel file<br>will be marked as such, and the chances that you'll be re-hired are<br>somewhere between slim and none.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
