<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [It sounds like we both (police and the citizens they<br>serve) have created a self-perpetuating cycle of fear and caution around<br>each other.\<br>\<br>I think you have a deep-seated hatred for cops. Yes, hate is a strong<br>word. But I think it applies. I know it\'s not conscious, and we\'ll get<br>there in a minute. But I think the problem is your perception of police<br>officers\' behaviors. I\'m not saying that cops are angels, we all know<br>they are not always model citizens. But we all need to give a little in<br>order to overcome that mistrust.\<br>\<br>But let\'s get into a little bit about what you\'ve said, and see if we<br>can find some of the cognitive bias that leads you to your repulsion.\<br>\<br>*Why do they look all arrogant and hostile, even at lunch, try to take<br>more space than the can naturally take?*\<br>\<br>I\'m not sure exactly what you mean by \"taking more space than they can<br>naturally take\". If you mean that they take a four-top table when there<br>are only two of them, that may stem from a number of factors:\<br>\<br>- They feel less insecure when there is more defensible space around<br>them\<br>- They don\'t naturally interact well with the general public in social<br>situations\<br>- They are generally worried that someone might try to tamper with their<br>food because they just don\'t like cops.\<br>\<br>They also know that *everyone* is watching them, everywhere they go.<br>In this day and age, no other profession is so closely scrutinized as<br>police. We should monitor politicians as closely as we monitor police.<br>In what other job can you step out of your car and have 10 cameras<br>trained on you recording your every action? Unless you\'re a rock star,<br>the only other time this happens is if you\'re a cop. And they don\'t<br>want those videos for *memorabilia,* they want them to *indict* you*.*<br>Sounds like a great way to spend the day, don\'t you think?\<br>\<br>Interaction is a two-way street, and interaction with the public is a<br>big area where cops can improve, and it\'s an area where I think I am<br>uniquely qualified to help. I\'m a *volunteer.* I don\'t get paid by a<br>police department. I\'m not a full-time cop. Think of us in the same way<br>you think of volunteer firefighters: fully trained to do the job, fully<br>certified, just part-time volunteers instead of full-time paid officers.<br>I try to do this every time I am working: have a conversation with<br>someone that doesn\'t end in any hard feelings, but with a smile and a<br>\"have a good day.\" I really do try to do this. It\'s an effort,<br>because people are openly hostile with the police. But that doesn\'t<br>stop me from trying. This task would be much harder for a full-time<br>officer who faces this abuse every day.\<br>\<br>*Why do they sir/ma\'m you, in our very informal state? Nobody else<br>ma\'ms me, except for telephone sales people, and I don\'t like it.*\<br>\<br>Officers are required to be extra polite, all the time. If you can force<br>yourself to not project an attitude of rudeness, try to say, \"And<br>please don\'t call me ma\'am; I don\'t like it.\" I bet you most<br>officers would say, \"Oh, I\'m sorry, it\'s something that is required<br>for us. I\'ll try to watch it. I may slip now and then, but I\'m trained<br>that way, I don\'t mean to offend you.\"\<br>\<br>Personally, I was brought up to respect police officers. \"The man in<br>blue is a friend to you\" was the mantra I lived by. I treat everyone I<br>speak with to \"yes sir\" or \"yes ma\'am\", but also because I am a<br>former military officer. It\'s simply a polite way to address someone. I<br>address all police officers in that way; as a police officer, I<br>similarly treat people with the same respect that I would expect they<br>treat me with. We used to call it the \"Golden Rule\" when I was growing<br>up: \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\" We seem to<br>have lost that in society, along with lots of other<br>culturally-acceptable things like chivalry. I expect nothing less when<br>people communicate with me.\<br>\<br>*Why can\'t they be more human?*\<br>\<br>This one you\'re going to have to clarify for me.\<br>\<br>*Firefighters have command presence, too, but you just know they are the<br>good guys.*\<br>\<br>And here is where we have identified your learned distrust for police<br>officers.\<br>\<br>My training sergeant told us on our first day, \"If you want to be<br>loved, be a firefighter.\" The implication was \"because no one loves<br>cops.\" While that\'s not exactly true (fewer people love cops than<br>firefighters), it is a truism in today\'s society that people generally<br>perceive firefighters as \"helpful\" and police officers as<br>\"harmful.\"\<br>\<br>Why is that?\<br>\<br>Police officers can arrest you, firefighters cannot.\<br>\<br>Naturally, going to jail is uncomfortable. Sitting on your hands for a<br>30-minute car ride is uncomfortable. Getting booked into the jail is<br>uncomfortable. Not to mention the time lost from work, and the potential<br>for a permanent criminal record, which can seriously damage your life.\<br>\<br>But let\'s be realistic. Are cops *really* out to get *you*? Are<br>cops really thinking in their heads, \"Let\'s find some moron to arrest<br>today\"? Not even close. Cops want to do their jobs, arrest the bad<br>guys, and go home with no more extra holes than they left the house<br>with. They are not interested in \"jamming anyone up.\" They simply want<br>to get the bad guys and go home.\<br>\<br>So the only reason you truly have to be worried is when you\'re a bad<br>guy. Other than that, it\'s your learned perception of police that is<br>coloring your view of them.\<br>\<br>It may be that you believe police are only there as revenue tools for<br>the state. If that\'s your belief, you have to take that up with the<br>state for writing the laws that the police are enforcing. \"Don\'t shoot<br>the messenger\" is the quote that comes to mind.\<br>\<br>*Then when they pull me over, I am instinctively repulsed by them, and<br>it shows, and they never give me a warning. Never.*\<br>\<br>Let\'s be clear about something. If you are pulled over, you have broken<br>a law. You do not have a right to a warning. If a police officer is<br>feeling exceedingly generous, he may choose not to write you a ticket,<br>but a lot of that depends on your attitude and your record. If you have<br>a reasonably clean record and are reasonably polite and cooperative, you<br>might get a warning, but there is no requirement for an officer to give<br>you a warning. Ever. If you were stopped, it\'s because you broke a law,<br>and that officer has every right to give you a ticket, and you have<br>every responsibility to try to do better next time.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
