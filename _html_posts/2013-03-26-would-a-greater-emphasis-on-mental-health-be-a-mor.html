<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [You are absolutely correct. The problem we have in this<br/>country is how we treat our mentally ill. Do you know where the three<br/>largest mental institutions in this country are? Riker\'s Island, the LA<br/>County Jail, and the Cook County Jail. The problem is that we treat our<br/>mentally ill as criminals. This is what our state mental programs have<br/>devolved into.\<br/>\<br/>However, controlling the sale and acquisition of guns is not a terrible<br/>thing, either. A gun is something that is specifically designed to kill<br/>people. No other item allowed for distribution to the general public has<br/>this specific use. Therefore, it is right to ensure that only qualified<br/>owners who are not criminals or mentally unstable may actually possess<br/>such a tool.\<br/>\<br/>There are definitely items on both sides of the debate that need to be<br/>addressed. Sensible restrictions on who can possess a firearm are<br/>necessary to protect the citizenry. However, understanding that the law<br/>is only applicable to those who follow it, in order to have an ordered<br/>society, we need to criminalize only the criminal behavior. Our current<br/>laws do nothing to further that goal; they only criminalize law-abiding<br/>citizens\' behaviors. When laws criminalize non-criminal behavior, they<br/>are less likely to be followed by the non-criminal citizenry, making the<br/>laws patently useless. We must have laws that make it unlawful for the<br/>mentally unstable to possess firearms, but we must do so in a way that<br/>is wholly non-invasive and protects the rights of the remainder of<br/>society to keep and bear arms. This is definitely a difficult task,<br/>because of our treatment of the mentally ill in today\'s society. In<br/>order to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill, we have to do a<br/>better job of identifying, and helping, the mentally<br/>ill.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
