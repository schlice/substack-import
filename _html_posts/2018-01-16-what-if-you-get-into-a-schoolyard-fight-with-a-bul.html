<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What if you get into a schoolyard fight with a bully and accidentally<br>kill him? Will you get arrested? On what charges?**<br><br>First of all, it sounds like you're talking about a child since you said<br>schoolyard. So the answer is, of course, "it depends."<br><br>So rather than saying "will" you be arrested, let's instead look at the<br>question of whether or not you "can" be arrested.<br><br>So: can you be arrested? The short answer is yes, you can. The<br>charge? Murder.<br><br>It's certainly not 1st Degree Murder (the unlawful taking of a life with<br>forethought and malice), but it would certainly qualify as 2nd Degree<br>Murder (the unlawful taking of a life with forethought).<br><br>You can most definitely be charged with 2nd Degree Murder, as you were a<br>willing participant in a fight in which you threw a punch which, through<br>a series of events, resulted in the death of another person. The willing<br>throwing of a punch which resulted in death is forethought. You had no<br>intention of causing death, which is the difference between the 1st and<br>2nd degree of the crime.<br><br>Now that you've been arrested, **is there any defense to this charge?<br>Absolutely**. You will most likely claim that you acted in self-defense.<br>You will claim that you were not a willing participant in the<br>altercation; instead, you only struck the bully to defend yourself. You<br>were doing only what you needed to do to defend your life or to defend<br>yourself from grave bodily harm.<br><br>Also at issue is the age of the defendant, and whether or not the youth<br>is charged as an adult. This differs by state. The state can indeed<br>commit you to custody as a youth, and you can serve time in a youth<br>facility.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
