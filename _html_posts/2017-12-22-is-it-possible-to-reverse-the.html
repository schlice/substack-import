<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it possible to reverse the \"Trump\" tax debacle when the Democrats<br>come into power in 2018 and 2020?**<br><br>The pleading in your question which states "when" the Democrats come<br>into power in 2018 and 2020 did not go unnoticed.<br><br>So let's assume what you *really* meant to ask was "Hypothetically, if<br>the Democrats retake both Houses of Congress in 2018, and the Presidency<br>in 2020, can these tax cuts be reversed?" Since you're asking about the<br>tax cuts themselves and not whether or not Democrats have a chance at<br>re-taking Congress or the White House, we will focus exclusively on<br>that. If you're curious, there have already been numerous askers who<br>have asked about whether or not the Democrats can re-take Congress and<br>the White House in 2018 and 2020 respectively.<br><br>The answer to your (revised) question is that while it is physically<br>possible to pass another bill that restores taxes to the way they were<br>in 2017, **history tells us that when Republicans pass tax cuts, even if<br>Democrats rail against them, they rarely repeal them.**<br><br>The last time Republicans got a tax cut passed was in 2003, and<br>Democrats complained about it for years. But when the cuts were set to<br>expire in 2010, Obama, even though he claimed that those tax cuts hurt<br>the deficit and that it was a huge problem, cut a deal to extend them<br>for two years. Then in 2012, he cut another deal which made most of the<br>tax cuts permanent and only raised taxes on those who made more than<br>\$400,000.<br><br>So while Democrats *en bloc* voted against the tax bill, and will likely<br>try to use it as political fodder for the foreseeable future, it's<br>unlikely that they will repeal it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
