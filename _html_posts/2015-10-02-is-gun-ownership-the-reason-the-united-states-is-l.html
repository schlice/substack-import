<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [*(Because \"gun ownership\" is such a nebulous term and<br>means a lot of things, including buying black market guns, I will assume<br>you meant \"legal gun ownership\" when you said \"gun ownership.)*\<br>\<br>You claim that the United States is leading the world in mass shootings.<br>When you actually look at the numbers around the world, and adjust for<br>variations in population, we\'re definitely up there, but we certainly<br>don\'t \"lead the world.\"\<br>\<br>At 0.15 mass shooting fatalities per 100,000 people, the US had a lower<br>rate than Norway (1.3 per 100,000), Finland (0.34 per 100,000) and<br>Switzerland (1.7 per 100,000).\<br>\<br>The United States does have a higher *rate of incidents* than other<br>countries, but when looking at the actual numbers per capita, the US<br>doesn\'t lead the world.\<br>\<br>Legal gun ownership has never been shown to influence mass shootings. In<br>fact, in the countries in which legal gun ownership has been removed,<br>shootings still occur. Homicides with guns still occur. Homicides<br>continue to occur. Suicides still occur, and suicides with guns still<br>occur.\<br>\<br>Removing legal gun ownership removes one avenue that criminals have to<br>gaining illegal guns: stealing them from legal gun owners. There are<br>still plenty of other methods for criminals to acquire illegal guns. The<br>removal of legal gun ownership channels only strengthens the black<br>market.\<br>\<br>We also haven\'t even addressed non-gun related death around the world.<br>If these were included, we would likely see something much different<br>statistically, as there have been a number of high-profile terrorist<br>attacks in Europe that are not included in those numbers because we<br>focused exclusively on guns.\<br>\<br>There is the rub: we tend to ignore the actual issue because we tend to<br>focus on the gun.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
