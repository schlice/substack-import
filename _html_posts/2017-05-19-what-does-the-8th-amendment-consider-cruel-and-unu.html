<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *I thought torturing an inmate just before they die is a violation of<br>> the 8th amendment. I\'ve heard many say that they deserve to suffer<br>> after what they\'ve done, but that doesn\'t change the fact that it\'s<br>> still torture. For instance, the electric chair, and iirc cyanide gas<br>> also causes great pain.*<br><br>This is why you've seen a switch away from the electric chair, the<br>hangman's noose, the guillotine and the firing squad to more "humane"<br>execution methods. As each is found to cause pain, it too is reviewed<br>and changed.<br><br>We thought the gas chamber was a good way to execute people without<br>undue suffering, and it certainly was better than the electric chair and<br>the firing squad, but it was determined to cause pain, and so has<br>generally been outlawed as a method of execution.<br><br>We thought we had the problem of "pain during execution" licked when<br>they came up with lethal injection. Inject a solution to cause<br>unconsciousness, inject a paralytic, and then inject a chemical to stop<br>the heart. Simple, painless, and effective. Right? Well, not so much.<br>The idea behind the three drugs was to mimic the chemical cocktail used<br>during surgery. Except that an anesthesiologist is required to<br>administer the drugs during surgery; no such person is present during a<br>lethal injection. If the chemicals are not accurately dosed for the<br>person being executed, it is possible that, for example, the pancuronium<br>bromide used to paralyze the muscles may not work, or the dose of sodium<br>thiopental may be too low (for example, in the case of an opioid addict)<br>and the subsequent injection of potassium chloride would cause<br>tremendous pain while the person is undergoing cardiac arrest.<br><br>There is now a movement because of at least one highly-publicized failed<br>lethal injection, to change the drugs. Eleven states have switched, or<br>have stated their intention to switch, to a one-drug lethal injection<br>protocol. A one-drug method is using the single drug sodium thiopental<br>to execute someone. The drug, by itself, is lethal at high doses, in<br>just the same way that opiate addicts can kill themselves by overdosing<br>on heroin, for example. In theory, it should be entirely painless, as<br>the person universally loses consciousness before death. However, the<br>new improved one-drug execution method hit yet another snag. In 2011,<br>after pressure by activist organizations, the manufacturers of sodium<br>thiopental and pentobarbital halted supply of the drugs to U.S. prisons<br>performing lethal injections and required all resellers to do the same.<br><br>Now, facing a shortage of the one drug that could perform the most<br>humane lethal injections, prisons and legislatures scrambled to find a<br>better, more sustainable solution. It was suggested that inert gas<br>asphyxiation could be used to execute prisoners. Indeed, people<br>worldwide have been using nitrogen asphyxiation as a method to commit<br>suicide, and assisted suicide. It is painless, as the body does not feel<br>like it is choking due to lack of air, even though the oxygen content in<br>the "air" is eliminated. The person has no feeling that they are<br>suffocating, and loses consciousness in one to two breaths. Persons<br>committing assisted suicide will often use a plastic gas-enclosing bag<br>placed over the head, commonly known as a "suicide bag." The hazards of<br>inert gas asphyxiation are well known, and in the US alone, at least 80<br>people died due to nitrogen gas asphyxiation between 1992 and 2002. In<br>April 2015, the governor of Oklahoma signed a bill authorizing nitrogen<br>asphyxiation as an alternative execution method if the state's preferred<br>execution method was not available. No one has yet been executed using<br>this method.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
