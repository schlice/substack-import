<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The right to an attorney is in the 6th Amendment to the Constitution<br>(\"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a<br>speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury \ \... \ and to have the<br>assistance of counsel for his defense\"). Additionally, the right to due<br>process is in the 5th and 14th Amendments (basically, a citizen of the<br>United States \"shall not be deprived of life, liberty, or property<br>without due process of the law\"). Besides an affirmative granting of an<br>attorney, you have the right to procedural due process, and substantive<br>due process. The government is therefore obligated to ensure that your<br>right to due process is guaranteed when you proceed through the legal<br>system. Therefore, in order to ensure your due process rights are<br>granted, you have the right to have an attorney present at any time. If<br>you are adjudicated to be impoverished, this changes nothing about the<br>wording of the 6th Amendment, and you still must have due process rights<br>protected, therefore the state will provide you with an attorney.<br><br>The right to keep and bear arms is completely different, in that it is a<br>natural right. The Constitution does not \"grant\" you the right to keep<br>and bear arms. It does not say \"You have the right to keep and bear<br>arms.\" The Constitution \"enjoins\" or \"prevents\" the government from<br>taking your natural right to self-defense away. It says \"The right to<br>keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" This means the government<br>cannot take away your right to keep and bear arms; in other words, it<br>says the government cannot make a law which takes away your right to<br>keep and bear arms. Nothing in that statement is read to mean that the<br>government must also provide you with arms. It simply states that the<br>government cannot pass any laws which take away your right to keep and<br>bear arms. Whether or not you can, or choose, to exercise that right, is<br>up to you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
