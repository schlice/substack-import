<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If the Justice Department is right and a sitting president cannot be<br>indicted and arrested, then the president is not legally in a position<br>in which an indictment is possible.<br><br>Therefore, a court could find that a statute could be "frozen" (the<br>legal term is *tolled*) until such time as the president *becomes<br>eligible for indictment*.<br><br>Now that Trump is no longer president, a prosecutor could have brought<br>charges. They've had a full year to bring charges. No one has.<br><br>So either there was no actual, chargeable crime, or the statute of<br>limitations has now, officially, expired in the year since Trump has<br>left office.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Do democrats realize statutes of limitations aren\'t frozen just because<br>a person becomes president and every \"crime\" Trump is accused of have<br>passed that?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
