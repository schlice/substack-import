<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Of course it is!<br><br>Remember what you're asking though, you said "science." I hope you're<br>not thinking test tubes and experiments, because science is much more<br>than that.<br><br>Science is, at its core, a search for causes. In fact, Francis Bacon<br>(the father of modern science) said, "True knowledge is knowledge by<br>causes."<br><br>In order to prove that a creator God exists, we have to start by asking<br>the right question, using scientific principles to examine the evidence,<br>leading us to a right conclusion (or cause). And in this case, the right<br>question to ask first is:<br><br>Why do we have something rather than nothing at all?<br><br>In other words, how did you and everything around you get here? The<br>argument for God can be presented very simply:<br><br>- Something exists.<br>- You do not get something from nothing.<br>- Therefore, a necessary and eternal Being exists which caused something<br>  to exist.<br><br>You cannot deny you exist because you have to exist in order to deny<br>your own existence (which is self-defeating), so the first premise above<br>is true. Descartes said "I think, therefore I am." No one has ever<br>demonstrated that something can come from nothing unless they redefine<br>what 'nothing' is, so the second premise rings true. Self-creation is an<br>analytically false statement, because you would have to exist before you<br>existed in order to create yourself. Therefore, the conclusion naturally<br>follows---an eternal Being is responsible for everything that exists.<br><br>*This is a position no thinking atheist denies*; they just claim that<br>the universe is that eternal being. However, the problem with that<br>stance is that all scientific evidence points to the fact that the<br>universe had a beginning (the "Big Bang"). And everything that has a<br>beginning must have a cause; therefore, the universe had a cause and is<br>not eternal. This thought is the foundation of the Cosmological<br>Argument:<br><br>- Everything that had a beginning had a cause.<br>- The universe had a beginning.<br>- Therefore the universe had a cause.<br><br>Because the only two sources of eternality are an eternal universe<br>(denied by all current empirical evidence) or an eternal Creator, the<br>only logical conclusion is that God exists.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
