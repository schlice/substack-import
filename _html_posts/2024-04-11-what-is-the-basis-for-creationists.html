<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Creationists believe in Adam and Eve because their stories are in the<br>Bible, and Jesus has said on more than one occasion that the Bible is<br>the word of God. Creationists don't really need more authority than God<br>to believe what they do.<br><br>However, scientific studies show us that there is the distinct<br>possibility that the Biblical stories are true:<br><br>> In 1987, a group of genet足icists published a surprising study in the<br>> journal *Nature*.足 The足 researchers examined the mitochondrial DNA<br>> (mtDNA) taken from 147 people across all of today\'s major racial<br>> groups. These researchers found that all modern humans descended from<br>> one of two branches in humanity\'s family tree. One of these branches<br>> consists of nothing but African lineage; the other contains all other<br>> groups, including some African lineage.<br>><br>> 足Even more impressive, the geneticists concluded that all human beings<br>> on Earth right now can trace their lineage back to the Eve gene, a<br>> single common female ancestor whom scientists called the Mitochondrial<br>> Eve.\[1\](#jGntJ){#cite-jGntJ .citation_link}<br><br>And not to be left out,<br><br>> In human genetics, the Y-chromosomal most recent common ancestor<br>> (Y-MRCA, informally known as Y-chromosomal Adam) is the patrilineal<br>> most recent common ancestor (MRCA) from whom all currently living<br>> humans are descended. He is the most recent male from whom all living<br>> humans are descended through an unbroken line of their male ancestors.<br>> The term Y-MRCA reflects the fact that the Y chromosomes of all<br>> currently living human males are directly derived from the Y<br>> chromosome of this remote ancestor. \[2\](#moAcT){#cite-moAcT<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-jGntJ){.citation_index} [[Eve Gene: Do We All Descend From<br>a Common Female<br>Ancestor?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ef40b4&url=https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/evolution/female-ancestor.htm%23:~:text%3DEven%2520more%2520impressive%252C%2520the%2520geneticists,lived%2520around%2520200%252C000%2520years%2520ago.){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="howstuffworks.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-moAcT){.citation_index} [[Y-chromosomal Adam -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b7e0a0&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-chromosomal_Adam){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
