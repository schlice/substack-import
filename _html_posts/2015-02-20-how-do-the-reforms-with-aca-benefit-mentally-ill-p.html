<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [While I am not a fan of the Affordable Care Act (because<br>it is anything but affordable, and doesn\'t provide needed care), there<br>are some provisions that benefit the mentally ill. You can find these<br>and more answers on the<br>[http://www.healthcare.gov(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a7ee2d&url=http://www.healthcare.gov){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container} website.\<br>\<br>The ACA mandates that most individual and small employer healthcare<br>plans, including all the plans offered in the Marketplace, have coverage<br>for mental health and substance abuse services. Because of this law<br>change, most plans must now cover preventative screenings as well, such<br>as depression screenings for adults, and behavioral assessments for<br>children. Finally, as of 2014, the ACA removed any \"pre-existing<br>condition\" denials from insurance, so you can buy insurance and be<br>covered for any pre-existing conditions you may have, including any<br>mental illness.\<br>\<br>I\'m also reasonably certain that there are no age limitations on this<br>coverage, but you should check with your individual insurance carrier<br>for more information.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
