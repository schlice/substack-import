<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If there is a case where someone is accusing another person of sexual<br>assault, and there is no evidence on their side, but there is a motive<br>for the accuser to fake the accusation, can these motives be used as<br>evidence in court?**<br><br>So let's separate the hyperbole about today's<br>"let's-drag-up-something-from-thirty-years-ago-and-call-it-sexual-assault"<br>from actual legal workings. You asked about a court, so let's discuss<br>actual law around sexual assault.<br><br>While laws are indeed different in every state, sexual assault shares a<br>few commonalities across all states. In general, sexual assault is a<br>crime or a group of crimes in which the *offender* subjects the *victim*<br>to any form of unwanted touching of a sexual nature. The differences<br>between states involve which specific crimes fall under the broad<br>umbrella of sexual assault. Some states have made sexual assault the<br>overall term for crimes like rape and unwanted touching, while still<br>others have differentiated their assaults based on penetration, making<br>the penetration crimes more severely punished than the non-penetration<br>(touching-only) crimes.<br><br>Also generic to all sexual assault laws is the fact that the offender<br>will use force or coercion, or that the victim is incapacitated<br>(unconscious, drunk, unable to consent, etc).<br><br>There are, finally, statutes of limitations on any of these crimes, and<br>they vary by state, depending on the state in which the offense was<br>committed.<br><br>So now that we've covered the basics about sexual assault laws around<br>the country, let's dissect the question:<br><br>**If there is a case where someone is accusing another person of sexual<br>assault, and there is no evidence on their side**<br><br>Well, we're going to have a hard time making a case if the victim is<br>accusing an offender of a sexual assault but there is no evidence to<br>corroborate that accusation. Depending on the assault in question, there<br>may or may not be physical evidence, so these kinds of cases are usually<br>made on circumstantial evidence. In general, such circumstantial<br>evidence of a sexual assault could be anything surrounding the incident<br>which would lend credence to its veracity: sometimes there are witnesses<br>to the assault or to interaction before or after it, or sometimes there<br>is physical evidence obtained by an emergency room, or there is a<br>confession to a friend, or there is a police report. Without any of<br>this, it's essentially a "he-said-she-said" exercise, and courts don't<br>like to convict people based on imperfect recollections alone. There has<br>to be a solid body of circumstantial evidence in order to bring a sex<br>assault case to court, and in most cases, that does not exist. FBI<br>statistics state that out of 1000 reported cases of rape, only 13 are<br>referred for trial, and only 7 result in convictions. As difficult as it<br>is to hear, it's highly unlikely that enough evidence exists in a<br>usable-enough form to substantiate charges of sexual assault. This is<br>certainly not meant to diminish what a victim may have experienced, only<br>to point out the difficulty in making these charges stick.<br><br>Additionally, as I quickly mentioned above, there are statutes of<br>limitations in place in each state. Depending on the crime being<br>alleged, there is a limited amount of time to bring those charges. If<br>you are outside of those timeframes, you cannot bring a charge at all,<br>as you have no standing to do so.<br><br>**but there is a motive for the accuser to fake the accusation, can<br>these motives be used as evidence in court?**<br><br>Motives are not evidence. Motive is the *intent* to perform an act.<br>Motive is not evidence of an act. You can have motive without an act. I<br>can *want* to kill someone without actually doing so. Character evidence<br>is admissible in certain circumstances, such as proving motive, but<br>motive itself is not evidence.<br><br>Motive can, however, be used by an offender to cast doubt on the<br>victim's claim of impartiality. An accused offender can certainly raise<br>the concept of motive behind the victim's actions in court, and they can<br>certainly do so by questioning the victim's character.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
