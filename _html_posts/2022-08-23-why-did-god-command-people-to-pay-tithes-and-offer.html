<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This confusion is common. The Bible separates out the two types of<br>giving: giving to the government (which is always mandatory) and giving<br>to the church (which is always voluntary).<br><br>Except in the case of Israel, which at that time was a<br>[theocracy(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f98387&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theocracy){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}*.* In other words, Israel<br>at the time was *both the government and the church.* So sometimes,<br>modern day Christians confuse the giving which was required to run the<br>government, and the giving of your heart to the church, *because they<br>both went to the same place.*<br><br>The Levitical priests acted as civil government, so the giving of the<br>tithe (see Leviticus 27:30--33) was what we would consider today to be<br>income tax. Deuteronomy 14:22--29 also details a second tithe to fund a<br>national festival. This was more than what we would consider to be a<br>religious tithe (10% of a person's income); it was actually well above<br>20%. But all of that money was paid to the "government" to run the<br>country.<br><br>Any giving *above that* was to the church and was totally voluntary (see<br>Exodus 25:2 and 1 Chronicles 29:9). People would give whatever was in<br>their heart to give. This giving was never specified by the church.<br><br>Interestingly, in the United States, we pay on average between 20 and<br>30% of our income in taxes, which is very similar to what the Israelites<br>paid to their theocratic government during that time.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why did God command people to pay tithes and offerings if they were not<br>required to do so by law (Leviticus)?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
