<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A2A, but there are too many good answers for me to add anything<br>meaningful other than to summarize what you\'ve already heard:<br><br>The \$3 charge was a \"test charge\" to see if the card actually worked.<br>Criminals can use these charges in \"batches\" to find working card<br>numbers from lists of stolen numbers.<br><br>They will then either use the cards themselves or resell the numbers as<br>\"known good\" numbers, assuming that most people are not going to catch<br>the \$3 charge in time to do something about it. A criminal can then get<br>two or three good charges processed before the card is deactivated.<br><br>But credit card companies are getting smarter in their pattern<br>recognition, and if something doesn\'t fit your normal pattern of<br>spending, they will decline the charge and contact you.<br><br>This happened to me yearly. I go down to Florida with my family on<br>vacation. Every time I go into Walmart to buy snacks and sundries, my<br>credit card gets declined at the register, and then both my wife\'s and<br>my phones start buzzing with texts and ringing with calls. The bank\'s<br>app logs notifications, too.<br><br>Now, I can notify the bank in advance that I\'m going to be on vacation.<br>Less chance my valid charges will be rejected when I\'m there.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
