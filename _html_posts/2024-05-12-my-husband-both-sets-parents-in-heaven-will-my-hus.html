<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This exchange in the Gospel of Mark happened when Jesus was being<br>questioned by some particularly disdainful Sadducees, who were trying to<br>trap Jesus. Just before this exchange, they asked Him if they should pay<br>taxes, and Jesus said the now-famous line about "rendering unto Caesar<br>that which is Caesar's." Anyway, here's what happened:<br><br>> "Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies<br>> and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and<br>> raise up offspring for his brother. Now there were seven brothers. The<br>> first one married and died without leaving any children. The second<br>> one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was the<br>> same with the third. In fact, none of the seven left any children.<br>> Last of all, the woman died too. At the resurrection whose wife will<br>> she be, since the seven were married to her?"<br>><br>> Jesus replied, "Are you not in error because you do not know the<br>> Scriptures or the power of God? When the dead rise, they will neither<br>> marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in<br>> heaven. --- Mark 12:19--25 NIV<br><br>The answer is that in Heaven, we are all children of God. We are neither<br>married upon arrival, nor will we marry once we're there.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
