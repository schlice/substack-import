<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I think you are asking about the \"lost memory\" part of<br>your question. While [[Matthew<br>Bohrer](https://www.quora.com/profile/Matthew-Bohrer)]{.qlink_container}<br>already told you about being charged while in your coma, once you come<br>out, you can still be charged for the murder, even though you remember<br>none of it.\<br>\<br>Basically, the law considers what your state was at the time you<br>committed the crime. Your lack of memory may be taken into consideration<br>at sentencing, but whether or not you remember your crime doesn\'t<br>alleviate you of the requirement to stand for your<br>crime.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
