<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's true that the modern Gregorian calendar was instituted in 1582 by<br>Pope Gregory XIII. The Gregorian calendar was a revision of the Julian<br>calendar, which was instituted by Julius Caesar in 46 BC. Revisions<br>included adding a leap year every fourth year and changing how the<br>holiday of Easter is determined. Today, the Gregorian calendar is used<br>throughout the world.<br><br>But it was the Hebrews who adopted the lunisolar calendar structure<br>before either of them. This calendar used years based on the solar year<br>(how long it took the earth to go around the sun), but months were based<br>on the phases of the moon.<br><br>Once the calendar was adopted, it was the standard used by everyone,<br>regardless of faith. I'm certain that atheists were taught their days of<br>the week songs and their months of the year songs in elementary or<br>primary school just like the rest of us.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
