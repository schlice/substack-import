<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it illegal to gift a lottery ticket to a minor? If an adult buys a<br>lottery ticket or scratch-off and gives it to a minor, would that be<br>illegal? The adult buys and redeems the ticket on behalf of the minor.**<br><br>The answer is that it varies by state. However, in all cases, an<br>adult must purchase the tickets. There are no states that allow minors<br>to purchase lottery tickets.<br><br>For lottery tickets, there are both in-state and multi-state lottery<br>tickets. The state rules for lottery tickets vary (some allow tickets to<br>be gifted to minors, some do not).<br><br>Many states are very strict about scratch games, with ad campaigns in<br>that state reminding residents that scratch tickets are "not child's<br>play" and that scratch tickets cannot be gifted to minors.<br><br>The reason why there are such strong restrictions (in most states) about<br>gifting lottery tickets to minors is that there is not insignificant<br>evidence to suggest that kids who received scratch tickets or lottery<br>tickets as gifts tended to gamble earlier in life, which is a possible<br>risk factor for more severe gambling disorders later.<br><br>> \"We know that playing the lottery at a young age is inappropriate and<br>> can increase the potential for problem gambling later in life,\" said<br>> McGill professor Jeffrey Derevensky, co-director of the International<br>> Centre for Youth Gambling Problems and High-Risk Behaviors at McGill<br>> University.<br><br>Therefore, while it seems innocuous, research suggests that playing<br>lottery games could potentially lead youth down the path to more severe<br>disorders later in life.<br><br>To that end, I would suggest a different gift for a child than scratch<br>tickets.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
