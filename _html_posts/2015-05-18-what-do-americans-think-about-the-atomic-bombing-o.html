<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Several reasons that it was an acceptable weapon:\<br>]<br><br>1.  It\'s the weapon we had. It may not have been the weapon we wanted,<br>    but it was the weapon we had.<br>2.  It was a strategic weapon, not a tactical one. When you use<br>    strategic weapons like bombs, you know that there is collateral<br>    damage.<br>3.  Scientists knew that the results of the weapon would be devastating,<br>    but they didn\'t know exactly how devastating until they dropped<br>    it.\<br>4.  The decision to use it was fueled by many different things, but I<br>    can probably bet that Pearl Harbor was still fresh in Americans\'<br>    collective minds. I\'d also bet that if we were fighting a country<br>    and not a terrorist organization when 9/11 hit, there would have<br>    been calls to launch nuclear strikes against that country. I\'m<br>    reminded of the words of the orator John Stuart Mill:\<br><br>> War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and<br>> degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that<br>> nothing is worth war is much worse. The person who has nothing for<br>> which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his<br>> own personal safety, is a miserable creature, and has no chance of<br>> being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than<br>> himself.<br><br>\<br>It was a hard thing to do, but ultimately I think it ended the war with<br>fewer Japanese lives lost than the alternative would have (an Allied<br>invasion of Japan).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
