<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is a lawyer giving legal advice when they answer questions someone has<br>about a stranger\'s legal situation?**<br><br>There is a difference between *legal advice* and *legal information.*<br><br>Only lawyers are qualified to give legal advice. Non-lawyers can give<br>legal information.<br><br>Even if lawyers answer a question, it wouldn't be considered legal<br>advice unless the answer would affect the rights and responsibilities of<br>the person who asked the question. Actual legal advice requires research<br>to determine how the law applies to that specific person, which requires<br>an attorney-client relationship, which only licensed attorneys in that<br>jurisdiction can create, and they certainly would not use open forum<br>spaces to answer those questions. True legal advice comes from<br>establishing an attorney-client relationship and then working through<br>that relationship only.<br><br>When anyone answers legal questions on forums such as this one, they are<br>providing legal information, not legal advice.<br><br>That's why when I answer questions like these, I always append a footer:<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice. This<br>answer does not create an attorney-client relationship, nor is it a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice. This answer is for GENERAL<br>INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. If you ignore this warning and convey<br>confidential information in a private message or comment, there is no<br>duty to keep that information confidential or forego representation<br>adverse to your interests. Seek the advice of a licensed attorney in the<br>appropriate jurisdiction before taking any action that may affect your<br>rights. If you believe you have a claim against someone, consult an<br>attorney immediately, otherwise there is a risk that the time allotted<br>to bring your claim may expire.*<br><br>*Quora users who provide responses to legal questions are intended<br>third-party beneficiaries with certain rights under Quora\'s* [[*Terms<br>of Service*](https://www.quora.com/about/tos)]{.qlink_container}*.*<br><br>\<br><br>(I can't use the automatic footer because I already have it set for<br>medical answers, which I also give)<br><br>Basically, this footer reminds readers that this is not legal advice,<br>just legal information. Quora does not allow anyone to give legal<br>advice, and we want to make it abundantly clear that this is not what<br>they are getting here.<br><br>If you want legal advice, hire a lawyer.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
