<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Apple does this *every day* to circumvent security holes which allow<br>people to \"jailbreak\" their iPhones.<br><br>\"Jailbreaking\" is a term which describes a method by which people can<br>circumvent security measures in *their own phones* (which is different<br>from what the FBI did by the way) so that they can gain access to<br>certain system functions which Apple has restricted by default in iOS.<br><br>In order to \"jailbreak\" a phone, hackers use portions of the iOS which<br>have weak security, and they use those weak areas to inject system-level<br>commands which allow ordinary users to \"elevate\" their security<br>posture, allowing them to run those system-level commands.<br><br>It\'s a cat-and-mouse game. Hackers find a vulnerability in iOS, they<br>exploit it to build a \"jailbreak\" for iPhone users; users jailbreak<br>their phones using the exploit, Apple publishes a \"patch\" fixing the<br>security hole discovered by the hackers.<br><br>Ultimately, if Apple finds out what the Cellebrite team did to get into<br>the phone, they will fix that flaw and push out a patch to iPhone 5Cs.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
