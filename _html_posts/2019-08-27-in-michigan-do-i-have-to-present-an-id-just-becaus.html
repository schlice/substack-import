<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In Michigan, do I have to present an ID just because an officer asks<br>for it?**<br><br>Only if you are driving a car or performing some other licensed<br>activity. If you're driving a car, you must present a valid drivers<br>license upon demand.<br><br>Since there is no requirement for identification at any other time out<br>in public, you cannot be compelled to produce identification in any<br>other routine "walking down the street" situation.<br><br>Whether or not you are required to identify yourself when a police<br>officer asks is a different story. If you are just having a general<br>"how's the weather" conversation with a police officer, you're under no<br>obligation to tell them anything at all, including your name. Those are<br>called "consensual interviews" because you are communicating by mutual<br>consent (like, you know, normal people). If you ever are concerned<br>whether or not you are being questioned or the conversation is a<br>consensual interview, just ask if you're free to go. If you are, most<br>likely your conversation was a consensual interview.<br><br>If the police have conducted what is known as a *Terry stop* (named<br>after the Supreme Court case in 1968 *Terry v. Ohio*), whether or not<br>you are required to identify yourself is a matter of state law. Most<br>states have established "stop and identify" laws that state that if the<br>police are conducting a *Terry stop*, you are required to, at a minimum,<br>provide your real name and address.<br><br>Michigan does not have a "stop and identify" law, so you are not<br>required to identify yourself even during a *Terry* stop. If you are<br>engaged in a *Terry* stop, you simply need to say that you want to<br>remain silent. Just saying, "I wish to remain silent" is enough.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
