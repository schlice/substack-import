<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Of course it's brilliant.<br><br>It's unlikely that it is malware because the devices all simultaneously<br>detonated. A malware bug that overloaded the battery would cause varying<br>results: some batteries would explode, but some batteries would vent<br>mostly harmlessly, while some batteries would swell, alerting the user<br>to an issue.<br><br>The fact that the devices so violently experienced exothermic events is<br>more indicative of a dedicated explosive device than a software bug or<br>malware causing the hardware to spontaneously self-destruct. You need an<br>energetic device that would reliably produce an explosion, and frankly,<br>there is no such device inbuilt into a pager. You would need to include<br>one in the pager at some point in the supply chain.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
