<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So you have two questions here: why is the Constitution included in the<br>*God Bless The USA Bible*, and why does the link to the Constitution not<br>appear on the Trump White House website?<br><br>\<br><br>Here's the answer to the first question: ***Why do you think Trump has<br>the Constitution included in his \"God Bless the USA Bible"?***<br><br>Let me just start by saying, as a Christian, I take issue with the "God<br>Bless the USA Bible," also known as the "Trump Bible."<br><br>The Bible wasn't commissioned or written by President Trump, and he<br>didn't have any editorial control over what was placed into it. It was<br>only *endorsed* by President Trump. It was also endorsed by<br>singer/songwriter Lee Greenwood (who wrote the song "God Bless The<br>USA"). But neither of them decided what was to go into it. For brevity's<br>sake (and because I'm lazy and don't want to type out its proper name<br>every time) we'll just call it "The Trump Bible."<br><br>The Trump Bible is a leather-bound Bible with an embossed American flag<br>on the front, and it contains the King James Version of the Bible, along<br>with the Founding Documents (the Declaration of Independence, the<br>Constitution, the Pledge of Allegiance) and the lyrics to the song "God<br>Bless The USA" in Lee Greenwood's own handwriting. It was supposed to<br>contain the New International Version of the Bible, but Zondervan (the<br>publisher of the NIV) withdrew their version of the Bible after public<br>criticism. Instead, the KJV was included because it is already part of<br>the Public Domain and is not under copyright restrictions.<br><br>I take issue with the Bible being lumped together with our nation's<br>founding documents. Doing so tends to equate (at some level) our<br>founding documents with the Bible. While our nation was indeed founded<br>on a Judeo-Christian heritage, that does not put our founding documents<br>on par with the Bible. They are certainly great documents, *but they<br>don't hold a candle to the Bible.* Putting them together in a single<br>book tends to both improperly elevate our founding documents, and water<br>down the Bible. The Bible should stand *alone* as the inspired Word of<br>God, as the founding documents, while pretty great in their own right,<br>are not the inspired word of God.<br><br>\<br><br>Second question: ***\Why was\ the Constitution removed from the White<br>House web page on \Trump's\ first day in office?***<br><br>So first mistake: the Biden White House website did not have a copy of<br>the entire Constitution on it. It had [[a page<br>describing](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a2b36a&url=https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/about-the-white-house/our-government/the-constitution/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="archives.gov"}]{.qlink_container} the Constitution, and<br>then[ [a<br>link](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=22ee61&url=https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="archives.gov"}<br>]{.qlink_container}over to the National Archives which has more<br>information (and photos and history and the actual text) about the<br>Constitution.<br><br>Second mistake: The Trump White House team did not intentionally remove<br>references to the Constitution from the website. **The new<br>Administration builds a completely new website from scratch, and the old<br>administration's version of the White House website is *archived*.**<br>Those archives stay online, and<br>[you(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=65c09c&url=https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="archives.gov"}<br>]{.qlink_container}can<br>[go(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6d8588&url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="archives.gov"}<br>]{.qlink_container}visit<br>[them(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6ef8ae&url=https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="archives.gov"}<br>]{.qlink_container}any time.<br><br>Trump White House Website 2.0 is still under construction, and is very<br>thin currently. It is constantly being updated. Currently it only has<br>very pertinent information about the early days of the Trump 2.0<br>administration, and a lot of the historical information (like<br>information about our government) is still under construction.<br><br>Lack of a link to the Constitution does not mean the administration does<br>not care about the Constitution, or doesn't retain any fidelity to it.<br>It simply means the site is still under construction, and we are still<br>very early in the new administration.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
