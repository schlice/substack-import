<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Refugees are indeed not "illegal aliens."<br><br>Refugees are also humans. I almost feel like you're including "human"<br>because you think that "illegal alien" means "unlawful little green men<br>from space." Yes, they are human. They're people, just like you and me.<br><br>However, I, and so many others like me, understand the harsh reality.<br>That reality is that many people sneak into this country illegally. When<br>they are captured, they repeat the one word they know in English:<br>*asylum*. They claim that they are political refugees, fleeing the<br>bad conditions where they came from.<br><br>Here is where we find the problem. And it's not an immigrant problem,<br>but a government problem.<br><br>*The definition of asylum has changed over the years.*<br><br>Nowadays, you can claim asylum for virtually any reason, including<br>fleeing deplorable living conditions where you came from. News flash:<br>that's what every immigrant is doing. At this point, there is zero<br>difference between a *legal immigrant* and a person seeking *asylum*.<br>They just go through different processes to get here. Oh, and because<br>the person seeking asylum is already here, they get to stay. They<br>get released into the country to await their asylum hearing.<br><br>Can you see the injustice with that?<br><br>On top of that, many seeking asylum never return for their hearings.<br>They just disappear into the country. And we support them through our<br>tax dollars.<br><br>We have not only done a tremendous disservice to actual refugees, but<br>we've made the problem of illegal immigration that much worse.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
