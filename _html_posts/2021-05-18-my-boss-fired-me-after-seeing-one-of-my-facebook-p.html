<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the United States, if you are not a contract employee, the answer is<br>no.<br><br>Most employment in the United States is what is known as "at will"<br>employment. The employer can fire you at any time for any<br>non-protected reason, and you can quit at any time without being<br>required to "give notice" or any arrangement under which you must do<br>some administrative thing before you are permitted to stop working.<br><br>Certain things cannot be a basis for employment termination. They are<br>(at the federal level) your race, religion, sex, age, disability, or<br>country of origin. Some states and some local jurisdictions (counties,<br>cities, etc) have added sexual orientation as a protected class. And<br>disability only counts if you cannot do the job you were hired to do<br>even with reasonable accommodations.<br><br>If your employer decides that he no longer likes you, he can fire you.<br>If he doesn't like your values, or your Facebook posts, or your hair<br>style, or your choice of friends, he can fire you. Just so long as he<br>doesn't fire you because you're black, or because you're a girl (or a<br>boy), or because you're a Muslim.<br><br>In this case, he fired you because he doesn't like your political<br>values. In the United States, in most cases, this is perfectly legal.<br><br>For further assistance, you should check with an attorney in your area<br>who specializes in employment law.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice.
