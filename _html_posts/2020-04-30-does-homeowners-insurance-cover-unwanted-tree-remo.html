<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is tree removal covered under homeowners insurance?<br><br>Generally not, unless the tree falls on your home or your property (like<br>onto a fence) and causes damage. Then, your homeowner's policy will pay<br>to fix the damage and remove the tree. If the tree hasn't fallen yet,<br>its removal is usually not covered by your homeowner's insurance policy.<br><br>If your tree falls on your neighbor's house, typically your neighbor's<br>homeowner's policy will pay to fix the house and remove the tree. You<br>generally wouldn't be liable unless the tree was dead or was a<br>pre-existing hazard that you were told about.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
