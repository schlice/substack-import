<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can believe whatever you like! But the claim that all religions<br>believe in one God or that just because all religions contain *some*<br>truth that all religions *are* true is just pluralist nonsense that<br>appeals to the broadly tolerant American mind.<br><br>It might be tempting to think this. This appeals to our progressive<br>multicultural world, doesn't it? We don't like the thought of only one<br>religion being true, because it would mean that billions of religious<br>people from every other religious faith are wrong today and have been<br>wrong throughout the centuries. And that's a big problem if Christianity<br>is true because Christianity seems to teach that non-Christians are<br>going to hell.<br><br>There's also the not-unfounded fear that those who think they have the<br>truth will be intolerant of those who won't accept it.<br><br>Easygoing Americans are more apt to believe that no religion has the<br>complete truth. This sentiment is often illustrated by the favorite<br>parable of many university professors: the parable of the six blind men<br>and the elephant. This is where each blind man feels a different part of<br>the elephant and therefore reaches a different conclusion about the<br>object in front of him. One grabs the tusk and says, "This is a spear!"<br>Another feels the trunk and says, "This is a snake!" The one hugging the<br>leg claims, "This is a tree!" The blind man holding the tail thinks, "I<br>have a rope!" The one feeling the ear believes, "This is a fan!" And the<br>one leaning on the elephant's side is certain, "This is a wall!" These<br>blind men are said to represent world religions because they each come<br>to a different conclusion about what they are sensing. Like each blind<br>man, we are told, no one religion has the truth. No one religion has the<br>complete answer. Religions are simply different paths up the same<br>mountain.<br><br>In America, truth in religion is considered an oxymoron. There is no<br>truth in religion, we are told. It's all a matter of taste or opinion.<br>You like chocolate, I like vanilla. You like Christianity, I like Islam.<br>If Buddhism works for you, then it's true for you. Besides, you ought<br>not judge me for my beliefs!<br><br>At first glance, it might appear that the existence of so many<br>contradictory beliefs just reinforces the elephant parable, namely that<br>truth in religion cannot be known. But exactly the opposite is the case.<br>The elephant parable may seem persuasive until you ask yourself one<br>question: "What's the perspective of the one telling the parable?" The<br>one telling the parable appears to have an objective perspective of the<br>entire proceeding because he can see that the blind men are mistaken.<br><br>And that's exactly correct. In fact, he wouldn't know that the blind men<br>were wrong unless he had an objective perspective of what was right! So<br>if the person telling the parable can have an objective perspective, why<br>can't the blind men? They could---if the blind men suddenly could see,<br>they too would realize that they were originally mistaken. That's really<br>an elephant in front of them and not a wall, fan, or rope.<br><br>We too can see the truth in religion. Unfortunately, many of us who deny<br>there's truth in religion are not *actually* blind but only *willfully*<br>blind. We may not want to admit that there's truth in religion because<br>that truth will convict us. But if we open our eyes and stop hiding<br>behind this self-defeating nonsense that truth cannot be known, then<br>we'll be able to see the truth as well. And not just truth in the areas<br>where we demand it---money, relationships, health, law, etc.---but truth<br>in religion as well. As the blind man healed by Jesus said, "Once I was<br>blind, but now I see."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
