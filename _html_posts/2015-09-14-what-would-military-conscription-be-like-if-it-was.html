<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [We already know what it would be like because it happened<br>three times before.\<br>\<br>[[Conscription in the United<br>States](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=346a11&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_draft){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>\<br>It\'s not likely to ever be needed again, as the US has successfully<br>transitioned to an all-volunteer force. We have enough manpower in the<br>combined forces of the Active, Reserve and Guard forces in the United<br>States to cover us for the foreseeable future. However, the Selective<br>Service System remains in place as a contingency if it is ever<br>needed.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
