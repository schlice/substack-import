<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is an excellent question. Most of the confusion stems from the<br>translation between Hebrew and English.<br><br>The word translated as "rest" in Hebrew has a variety of meanings. In<br>fact, one of the main definitions of the Hebrew word *shabat* is "to<br>cease or stop." In Genesis 2:2 the understanding is that God "stopped"<br>His work; He "ceased" creating on the seventh day. All that He had<br>created was good, and His work was finished.<br><br>So the definition of the word "rest" doesn't mean that He was tired and<br>He had to take a break. It signifies that He "stopped" creating. It was<br>an intentional cessation of creation activity. Everything He wanted to<br>create had been made. He looked at His creation, declared it "good"<br>(Genesis 1:31), and He stopped. In the Jewish tradition, the concept of<br>*shabat* has been carried over as the "Sabbath." The Law of Moses taught<br>there was to be no work at all on the seventh day (Saturday). Because<br>God ceased from work that day, the Israelites were to cease from their<br>work that day as well. The days of creation are the basis of our<br>universal observance of a seven-day week.<br><br>TL;DR: God's "rest" was not because He was tired, but because He was<br>completely finished with His work.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
