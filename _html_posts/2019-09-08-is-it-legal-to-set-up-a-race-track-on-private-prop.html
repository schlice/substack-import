<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is it legal to set up a race track on private property you own?<br><br>Whether or not it is legal is usually controlled by the government body<br>controlling the area in which you own land.<br><br>Most areas where people own land are covered by what is known as<br>*zoning*. Zoning allows governments to allocate areas of land for<br>specific uses. Most ownable land is zoned for some purpose, be it<br>commercial, residential, multi-family, office buildings, etc.<br><br>If you own property in the middle of nowhere, where it takes you an hour<br>of driving through absolute nothingness to reach, not covered by any<br>zoning regulations, then you can probably do anything you like on your<br>property and not only would it be legal, but no one would likely notice.<br><br>However, if you are like most land owners and you own a piece of<br>property anywhere near a populated area, you will probably have to<br>comply with local zoning laws.<br><br>(EDIT) In the United States, all land falls within a state, so even if<br>you're in the middle of nowhere, you still have to comply with any state<br>laws regarding operating a race track, especially if people are able to<br>come see the cars.<br><br>If it's literally a private race track just for you, it's highly<br>unlikely that the state would even care.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
