<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What happens if the US Senate ties 50-50 on whether to call witnesses<br>in the Trump impeachment trial?**<br><br>You need a simple majority in order to change a rule. The President of<br>the Senate (the VPOTUS) is usually the tie-breaker, but because of<br>conflict of interest when a President has been impeached and is on<br>trial, the Chief Justice of the SCOTUS acts as the presiding chair of<br>the Senate during the trial.<br><br>However, Roberts is not a voting member of the Senate. He is not<br>President *Pro Tempore* of the Senate. He is simply the chair of the<br>proceedings. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that Roberts would cast<br>a vote at all.<br><br>Therefore, as I said in Sentence One, you need a simple majority in<br>order to change a rule. That means you need 51 votes to change the rule<br>and add a rule that allows calling of witnesses. If you have a tie, that<br>means you only have 50 votes in favor of changing the rule, which is one<br>vote shy of the majority you need to change the rule.<br><br>With 50 votes, the motion fails to carry. No witnesses.<br><br>> \"If it ends in a tie? Well, I mean if you don\'t have a majority,<br>> then it fails, yeah, the motion fails,\" Sen. John Thune, a Republican<br>> from South Dakota and a member of GOP leadership, told CNN on<br>> Wednesday when asked about the vote on witnesses.<br>><br>> \"I think the likelihood is \-- strong likelihood \-- is \[Chief<br>> Justice Roberts\] would not break a tie and I would respect his<br>> position if he didn\'t,\" Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of<br>> Connecticut said \...\.<br>><br>> Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania said, \"I\'m assuming that<br>> on something that fundamental, he\'s gonna make --- he\'ll have the<br>> Senate make the determination.\"<br>><br>> Asked then if a 50-50 vote would fail, Casey responded, \"That\'s my<br>> understanding.\"\[1\](#yQByy){#cite-yQByy .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-yQByy){.citation_index} [[What happens if there\'s a tie<br>vote on witnesses at Trump\'s impeachment<br>trial?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6a06ea&url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/30/politics/trump-impeachment-trial-witness-vote-tie/index.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="cnn.com"}<br>]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
