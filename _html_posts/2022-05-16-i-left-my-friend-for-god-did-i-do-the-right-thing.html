<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Jesus talked about this in the Sermon on the Mount:<br><br>> If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it<br>> away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your<br>> whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you<br>> to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose<br>> one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. ---<br>> Matthew 5:29--30 NIV<br><br>Jesus was talking specifically in this passage about committing the sin<br>of adultery, but he described it by using hyperbole, of course. He<br>wasn't advocating self-mutilation. He was trying to get the point across<br>that sin is *that important* to get a handle on that it would be better<br>to lose a body part than to have your whole body cast into hell.<br><br>Think about that. God wants *so badly* for us to avoid sin that he'd<br>hyperbolically state that you should cut off the offensive part of your<br>body if it causes you to sin.<br><br>Understanding the force behind what Jesus said, if your friend was<br>causing you to sin, wouldn't the guidance be to "cut out" that friend<br>from your life? And in all truth, if you have a "friend" who turns you<br>away from God, is that really a great example of a "friend?" Perhaps<br>it's *you* who should be bringing your "friend" to God, not your<br>"friend" bringing you away from God.<br><br>Food for thought.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
