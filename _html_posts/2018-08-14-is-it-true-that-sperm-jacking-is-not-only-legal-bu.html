<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it true that sperm jacking is not only legal but the woman who<br>sperm jacks can be awarded child support?**<br><br>Sperm theft is technically not illegal.<br><br>If a woman spermjacks and then uses the sperm to get pregnant, she can<br>petition the court to seek child support payments from the father.<br><br>However, that's a double-edged sword. If she does this, openly declaring<br>in court that he is the father, he also has paternity rights. He gets to<br>be involved in the child's life as much or as little as he chooses (he<br>is the father, after all).<br><br>Granted, he did not choose to be a father, but he did participate in an<br>act which frequently results in children being produced, so such a thing<br>is not outside the realm of possibility. It's no more or less wrong than<br>a condom with an unintentional hole in it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
