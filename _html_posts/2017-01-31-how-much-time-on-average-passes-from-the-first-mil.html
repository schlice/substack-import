<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>[[Erica<br>Friedman](https://www.quora.com/profile/Erica-Friedman)]{.qlink_container}<br>is, as ever, spot on with her comments. There is nothing "predictable"<br>about this disease.<br><br>I had "double vision" as your friend calls it. It's actually one of the<br>most common first symptoms of MS, [[optic<br>neuritis](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=185d9b&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_neuritis){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. The ON goes away on its<br>own, even without steroids, within a few weeks to a few months. Since<br>that bout of ON, I've never had another relapse on that eye. And I've<br>been diagnosed for more than 10 years.<br><br>I started on Copaxone within six months of my initial bout of ON. It<br>worked for seven years, until it stopped. I experienced my next symptom:<br>weakness on the right side of my body. My MRI confirmed the new lesions<br>on the left side of my brain, right where you'd expect them. So I<br>switched medications, and I've been stable since then.<br><br>MS is like flying a plane in many respects. As you go along, you measure<br>your location with respect to your flight path. When you get off-course,<br>you make a course adjustment, changing your heading ever so slightly so<br>that you get back on course. These minor course corrections continue<br>throughout the entire journey, keeping you on track. MS is very much<br>like that. We monitor our progression throughout our lives, and as we<br>find ourselves drifting off course, we make minor corrections. Sometimes<br>we hit a big bump and have to make a major correction, but we try to<br>keep ourselves on course as much as possible.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
