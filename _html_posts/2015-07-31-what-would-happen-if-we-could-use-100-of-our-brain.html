<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In actuality, you should ask what you couldn\'t do if you<br>used all of your brain at once.\<br>\<br>Basically, the 10% thing came about in the early days of brain<br>understanding, when a metal rod or some other object pierced the brain<br>and the victim was nearly unharmed. Doctors surmised because of this<br>that parts of the brain sat unused.\<br>\<br>In actuality, you do use your whole brain as [[Dan<br>B](https://www.quora.com/profile/Dan-B-1472)]{.qlink_container}<br>mentioned. But when you are injured, your brain has the ability to<br>\"re-route\" around damaged areas and rebuild neural pathways. Some<br>damage can\'t be repaired or routed around, but much can. There are a<br>certain number of \"reserve\" stem cells available for rebuilding brain<br>cells, but by adolescence, your full complement of adult brain cells has<br>been formed, along with a reserve of cells not in use. This reserve can<br>be used to rebuild damaged areas and re-route around damage if needed.\<br>\<br>Using 100% of your neural capacity (active and reserve) would mean that<br>you have no more reserve available for when brain cells die off or are<br>damaged. This would mean that you would lose brain capacity daily for<br>the rest of your life from the moment that you used 100% of your neural<br>load.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
