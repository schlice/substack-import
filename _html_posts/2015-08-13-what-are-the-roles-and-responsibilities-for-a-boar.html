<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I am a board member of a non-profit organization, so I<br>speak from experience when I suggest you read carefully the bylaws of<br>the non-profit as well as their operating rules. You should also look<br>into what indemnification they offer against lawsuits against the board.<br>Will they provide you with general indemnification insurance, to include<br>attorney representation? I would want to know that before I signed on to<br>that board.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
