<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>While there are classified things which the military spends money on,<br>it's not as if the *vast* majority of military spending is classified.<br><br>For example, the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act stated the<br>following uses for their money:<br><br>> The bill authorizes appropriations to DOD for<br>><br>> - Procurement, including aircraft, weapons and tracked combat<br>>   vehicles, shipbuilding and conversion, and missiles;<br>> - Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation;<br>> - Operation and Maintenance;<br>> - Working Capital Funds;<br>> - Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction;<br>> - Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities;<br>> - the Defense Inspector General;<br>> - the National Defense Sealift Fund;<br>> - the Defense Health Program;<br>> - the Armed Forces Retirement Home;<br>> - the Space Force;<br>> - Overseas Contingency Operations; and<br>> - Military Construction.<br>><br>> \...\<br>><br>> The bill authorizes appropriations for base realignment and closure<br>> activities, and maritime matters.<br>><br>> The bill authorizes appropriations and sets forth policies for<br>> Department of Energy national security programs, including the<br>> National Nuclear Security Administration.<br>><br>> The bill also sets forth policies regarding certain federal activities<br>> related to artificial intelligence, including implementation by the<br>> President of a National Artificial Intelligence Initiative to support<br>> research and development, education, and training programs.<br>><br>> The bill establishes measures related to financial intelligence,<br>> anti-money laundering, and countering the financing of terrorism.<br>> These include expanding information sharing requirements among<br>> agencies that are tasked with administering efforts to counter money<br>> laundering and the financing of terrorism, as well as authorizing<br>> training and technical assistance to facilitate these measures.<br><br>There are other things the bill does, but these are the things related<br>directly to the outlay of funding.<br><br>So there's a lot that the DOD is spending money on, not just classified<br>superweapons.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>USA spends more than 700 Billion Dollars in their military, what secret<br>weapon you think is real and still classified by the US Military?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
