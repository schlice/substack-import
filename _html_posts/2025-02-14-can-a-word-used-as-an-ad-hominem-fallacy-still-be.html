<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Part of the misunderstanding is misunderstanding what an *ad hominem*<br>is.<br><br>*Ad hominem* is Latin for "to the man." In other words, instead of<br>responding to the question at hand, you instead attack the person.<br>Recent example: rather than attacking JD Vance's words, internet trolls<br>love to talk about his eye liner. Another recent example: rather than<br>attacking the things that Elon Musk is finding, they are attacking him<br>personally.<br><br>These are *ad hominem* attacks.<br><br>An ad hominem is what it is because it is used in an attempt to deflect<br>from the lack of a valid response to the argument made.<br><br>So to answer your question, yes, an *ad hominem* **attack is<br>still considered *ad hominem* even if the attack itself is based<br>in truth.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
