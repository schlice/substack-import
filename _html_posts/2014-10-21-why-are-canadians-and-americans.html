<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Part of the problem is that we don\'t really understand<br>the true definition of a GMO. For example, if I cross-breed a plant with<br>another, is that considered a GMO? There is a lot of confusion in the US<br>as to what constitutes a GMO. Thankfully,<br>[Wikipedia(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4ff5f0&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}<br>]{.qlink_container}has provided the definition of a GMO:\<br>\<br>\"A genetically modified organism (GMO) is an organism whose<br>genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering<br>techniques.\"\<br>\<br>\"Genetic engineering techniques\" are \"the direct manipulation of an<br>organism\'s genome using biotechnology.\"\<br>\<br>So cross-breeding a plant is not considered GMO, but the large majority<br>of scientific evidence we have so far shows that GMOs are not very much<br>different from cross-breeding plants.\<br>\<br>There is a lot of controversy and the issue has been politicized. In<br>fact, in the state of Colorado, the November 2014 General Election has a<br>ballot question which will add labeling to food produced in the state if<br>it contains GMOs.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
