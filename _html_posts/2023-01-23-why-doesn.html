<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>God isn't some great cosmic vending machine. You don't put prayers into<br>the slot, push the button, and get your wishes out. It doesn't really<br>work that way.<br><br>Did you ever ask your parents for ice cream for breakfast? If you did,<br>what did they tell you? If you're a thinking adult, if your child asked<br>you for ice cream for breakfast, what would you tell them?<br><br>For the sake of the example, let's assume that you'd say no. Why?<br>Because ice cream for breakfast isn't healthy for them. They may not<br>know that. Or they may know that, and not care. But you know it. And so<br>you do what's best for them. **Sometimes, what's best for them includes<br>telling them no.**<br><br>If a parent does this with their child, don't you think that God would<br>do that with His children?<br><br>So if your prayers have not been answered in the way in which you want,<br>or think they should, one of several things may have happened:<br><br>- God heard your prayer and said no.<br>- God heard your prayer but you are asking for insincere, selfish, or<br>  unbiblical reasons.<br>- You may not be one of God's children (not yet "adopted" into His<br>  family), so He's not going to answer your prayers anyway.<br><br>So what can you do about this? It depends on why God isn't answering<br>your prayer in the way in which you want.<br><br>If God isn't answering your prayer because He's saying no, then we have<br>to learn to accept His wisdom. He's saying no for a reason, because just<br>like ice cream for breakfast, granting your prayer may not be good for<br>you. It may not be in your best interest, and what's in your best<br>interest is always in keeping with His good plans for you, which you and<br>I probably don't even know. But we know He has good plans for us<br>(Jeremiah 29:11), so we must trust that His ways are better for us<br>in the long run.<br><br>If God isn't answering your prayer because you are insincere in your<br>desire, or you are being selfish or unbiblical, it's time to examine<br>your own heart and ask why it is that you want what you're asking for.<br>Is it something that advances the Kingdom, or is it something that<br>advances your own comfort? Nowhere in the Bible does it say that being a<br>Christian will always be a pleasurable, comfortable, cozy experience. In<br>fact, the Bible tells us exactly the opposite, that being a Christian<br>will be a very challenging prospect, and we should expect trouble from<br>this world (John 16:33).<br><br>If God isn't answering your prayer because you aren't one of His<br>children yet, then consider why you're asking God for things in the<br>first place, when you haven't taken the necessary steps to get right<br>with God first. Have you truly, truly repented of your sin? Have you<br>truly asked God to come into your heart and take over your life? Have<br>you been baptized, to show the world of your decision? Are you daily<br>trying to live a right, Godly life? "You hypocrite, first take the plank<br>out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck<br>from your brother's eye" (Matthew 7:5). Maybe fix your own affairs<br>before you ask God to provide you with the fruits of His benevolence.<br><br>In all of these cases, what we do about this is fix ourselves and<br>fix our view of God, or our relationship with God. Once we realize that<br>God is going to fulfill His plans for our lives whether we agree or not,<br>we realize that prayer is a way for us to converse with God, to get our<br>minds right around His plans for us, and to ask Him to bring us<br>alongside Him while he works His plans in our lives.<br><br>So rather than asking for things, we should be asking God to help us<br>understand His plans better, so that the things we want better align<br>with His good plans for us.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
