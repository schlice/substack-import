<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If, as claimed by most gun rights' supporters, guns are not the cause<br>of the unspeakable murders of schoolchildren and others during school<br>shooting rampages, can we at least agree that it's the easy access to<br>guns that is the principal reason?**<br><br>It's not even a *tangential* reason.<br><br>Guns make the act of killing more precise and easier. They don't make<br>killing possible. A true killer will find another way if he can't get<br>his hands on a gun.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
