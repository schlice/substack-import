<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If social tyranny can limit your free speech and more, then what is<br>the point of the constitution?**<br><br>The Constitution prevents the *government* from limiting your free<br>speech. It says nothing about what people can do through social tyranny.<br><br>The Constitution provides a framework under which people *should*<br>pattern their lives, and people abiding by the Bill of Rights would be a<br>good start.<br><br>But no one is under any obligation to protect or observe your rights<br>under the Constitution, other than the government.<br><br>The Bill of Rights limits what the government can do to you. Private<br>citizens can still use social tyranny to limit your speech, and it fully<br>has nothing to do with the Constitution.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
