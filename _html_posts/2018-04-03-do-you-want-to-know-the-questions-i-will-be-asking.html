<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you want to know the questions I will be asking my neurologist<br>about my relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis?**<br><br>Question details:<br><br>> I have an MRI this month and will be asking follow-up questions about<br>> my results as well as questions around whether or not I should have a<br>> second child due to my current status and what my life will look like<br>> with 2 children while being a victim of MS.<br><br>So there's two questions in there:<br><br>- whether or not I should have a second child due to my current status<br>- what my life will look like with 2 children while being a victim of<br>  MS.<br><br>With regard to your first question, I advise women not to change their<br>life goals due to MS. So in general, I tell women to go ahead and get<br>pregnant. It will be the most MS-free nine months you will experience.<br>In general, MS symptoms disappear during pregnancy. We know that there<br>is a hormonal component to MS, and we know that during pregnancy,<br>hormonal changes tend to suppress MS disease activity. We *also* know<br>that once you have your baby, those protections tend to fall off, and<br>you'll likely experience a relapse. But beyond the fact that you'll be<br>symptom-free during your pregnancy, and you're likely to experience a<br>relapse after your baby is born, you can get pregnant and have a normal<br>baby.<br><br>If you're worried about whether or not your baby will have MS, it is<br>true that having a first-degree relative with MS increases their risk of<br>developing the disease. The average person in the United States has<br>about one in 750 (.1%) chance of developing MS. For first-degree<br>relatives of a person with MS, such as children, siblings or<br>non-identical twins, the risk rises to approximately 2.5-5% (between one<br>in 40 and one in 20). We do know that it's not all genetic though.<br>Location of childhood makes a difference. There is a higher prevalence<br>of MS development in children who live above 40 degrees latitude before<br>they turn 15. Girls develop MS two to three times as frequently as boys.<br>Some recent studies have shown that the ratio may be closer to four<br>times as frequent. Also, exposure to an as-of-yet unidentified viral<br>trigger starts the disease process. \[1\](#vrgQA){#cite-vrgQA<br>.citation_link}Whether or not you want your children to incur that risk<br>is up to you, but there are so many unknowns that it's illogical to base<br>your decision solely on the fact that you have MS. Ultimately though,<br>it's up to you.<br><br>To your second question, you will have to make allowances for your<br>disease. MS is life-*changing*, not life-*ending*. Modern medications<br>have made lifespans of people with MS nearly match lifespans of people<br>without the disease. That said, you will have to work around the<br>disease. You may get more tired more quickly, so you may have to be more<br>conscious about pacing yourself. You can't allow your kids to run you<br>ragged. If you're thinking about breastfeeding, you will have to work<br>closely with your neurologist regarding your MS medication and therapy.<br>So beyond a few extra decisions you have to make about what you do<br>during the day, your life will pretty much be the same as it would have<br>been had you not developed MS.<br><br>Hopefully, some of this helped you. Make sure you ask your neurologist<br>all of these questions as well, and work closely with him or her on your<br>treatment plan and any lifestyle modifications you may need to make.<br>Keep asking questions; knowledge is power!<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-vrgQA){.citation_index} [[Who Gets<br>MS?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=cc6883&url=https://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/Who-Gets-MS){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
