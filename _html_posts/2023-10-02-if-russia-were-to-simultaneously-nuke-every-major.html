<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>NORAD is required to identify the missile within TWO MINUTES after<br>it is launched, so the Pentagon knows about that launch as soon as we<br>do. As the missile gains altitude and we gain ground-based locks on it<br>as well as satellite locks, we get more data on the type of missile<br>(thus we know its range) and we gain its trajectory which gives us a<br>"threat fan" overlay on the screen which shows us where it could<br>potentially land. That takes about FIVE MINUTES<br><br>Unfortunately, I don't have the unclassified mock-ups of what a threat<br>fan looks like, but suffice it to say that if the threat fan crosses the<br>ADIZ around North America, it is counted as a threat launch and the<br>National Command Authority is notified.<br><br>Five minutes.<br><br>If missile flight time from Russia is around 30 minutes, that gives us<br>25 minutes to evacuate the President from the White House to Joint Base<br>Andrews (the 1st Helicopter Squadron sits alert at Joint Base Andrews to<br>perform this exact function) and place him on the National Airborne<br>Operations Center (formerly known as the National Emergencey Airborne<br>Command Post: the "Kneecap"), which can all be done within that 25<br>minute timeframe. So the President will indeed be safe.<br><br>If, for some reason, the President cannot get out of the White House,<br>there is a secure bunker beneath the facility that he can shelter in.<br><br>The National Command Authority is the President, the Vice President, and<br>the Secretary of Defense. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is<br>also accounted for since he can issue the same orders to the military.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
