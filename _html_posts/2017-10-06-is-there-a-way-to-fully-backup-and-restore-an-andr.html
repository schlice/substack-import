<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**TL;DR: Unless you're flashing a custom ROM onto your phone, you don't<br>need to do a full backup.**<br><br>There's a lot of answers here. Most are mostly correct.<br><br>The correct answer is **without rooting, you cannot fully back up and<br>restore an Android phone.**<br><br>The question is *what does "fully" mean?* In this context, "fully" means<br>backing up the entire "user" space, as well as the entire "system"<br>partition. This means you're backing up<br><br>- The Android operating system and all of its patches<br>- All of the applications (apks) that run on your phone as well as all<br>  of their settings<br>- All of the "user" space, which includes all of your files, your<br>  pictures, your ringtones, your music files, etc.<br><br>You can only back up all of this with a rooted phone. Some of these<br>partitions are not available to the user who does not have root-level<br>privileges.<br><br>But the question remains: *why?* Why would you want to back up all of<br>these things when you can simply restore the originals from the same<br>place you got them? If your phone is wiped:<br><br>- The Android operating system will be re-installed from your **recovery<br>  partition**, so it is not necessary to separately back it up<br>- The applications will be restored from the Google Play store (for the<br>  APKs) and from your phone manufacturer's backups (for example, Samsung<br>  Cloud stores all of your apps' settings), so it is not necessary to<br>  separately back them up<br><br>Your user files are the only items you will need to back up yourself.<br>Any of the tools indicated in the other answers will fully back up the<br>user partitions. Your phone manufacturer probably also has tools which<br>will do this for free (for example, Samsung offers Kies, a software<br>package which runs on your computer and allows you to regularly back up<br>your phone). In addition, Samsung Cloud will back up your user<br>partition. There are other piecemeal solutions which can offer cloud<br>backup for portions of your user partition (for example, Google Photos<br>offers *unlimited* photo storage).<br><br>The only reason you would want to take a "full" backup of your phone<br>(OS, apps, and user space) is if you are applying another operating<br>system to your phone. For example, if you are flashing CyanogenMod or<br>AOSP onto your phone, you probably want to take a full backup of your<br>phone first. If you have no idea what CyanogenMod or AOSP are, then you<br>really don't need to do a "full" backup of your phone. Oh, and if you<br>are flashing CM or AOSP, you're already rooted.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
