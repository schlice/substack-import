<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Not sure what you mean by "why did the US military change their process<br>for it," but the ASVAB is the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude<br>Battery. It replaced the AFQT (the Armed Forces Qualifying Test).<br><br>The military has been using qualification testing since World War I. The<br>Army first started testing people in 1917 (tests called the Army Alpha<br>and the Army Beta). These tests were standardized into the Army General<br>Classification Test (AGCT) and the Navy General Classification Test<br>(NGCT). The purpose of these tests was to ensure that military<br>applicants had specific aptitude to do specific jobs. It was used as a<br>placement test to place applicants into military jobs. By the end of<br>World War II, the services all had their own individual tests for<br>military selection.<br><br>But after WWII, the services moved back to a single aptitude test,<br>called the Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT). The new AFQT was modeled<br>after the AGCT. However, the AFQT was specifically designed to be used<br>as a screening device. To that end, the AFQT was established to both<br>measure examinees' general ability to absorb military training within a<br>reasonable length of time, and provide a uniform measure of examinees'<br>potential usefulness in the military. The AFQT was used by all of the<br>Services through 1972. While the AFQT was used to identify military<br>applicants who had a reasonable probability of success in service, other<br>Service-specific tests were needed to classify them into jobs. The Army<br>Classification Battery, the Navy Basic Test Battery, and the Airman<br>Qualification Examination, just to name a few, were used for<br>classification purposes from the late 1950s to the mid 1970s.<br><br>The first ASVAB was introduced in 1968, and by 1975 all the services had<br>moved away from individual testing and were using the ASVAB for both<br>selection and classification of applicants. Combining selection and<br>classification testing made the testing process more efficient. It also<br>enabled the Services to improve the matching of applicants with<br>available job positions and allowed job guarantees for those qualified.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
