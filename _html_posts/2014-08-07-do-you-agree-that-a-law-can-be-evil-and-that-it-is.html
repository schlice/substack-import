<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [This is a great question. Almost sounds like homework from<br/>my Law 410 class \"The Ethics of Law\".\<br/>\<br/>Can a law be evil? If you hold to the opinion (as I do) that you cannot<br/>legislate morality, then a law cannot be evil *prima facie.* It is only<br/>morality that can determine \"goodness\" or \"evilness.\" If<br/>implementing the law consistently causes you to violate your moral code,<br/>I would consider peaceful protest and not follow that law.\<br/>\<br/>Morals are personal or cultural values, and so what is morally right in<br/>one culture may not be morally right in another culture. For us to judge<br/>another culture based on the standards of our own is what we call<br/>*ethnocentrism* and in today\'s \"global village\" it\'s something we<br/>need to guard against.\<br/>\<br/>Laws that violate internationally-recognized standards of human decency<br/>should be strongly objected to in the international arena, and the<br/>countries that implement such laws should be singled out. It\'s a good<br/>job for the United Nations. I suggest they stay out of every other job<br/>while they\'re at it.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
