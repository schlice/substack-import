<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When a job is advertised as "including health care benefits," it means<br>that the employer has purchased a group health insurance plan for its<br>employees. The employer will share the cost of the plan with the<br>employees, and then at the point of service, you will either have to pay<br>a "copay" or a "coinsurance" amount.<br><br>Specifically, under the Affordable Care Act, insurance must be, well,<br>*affordable*. But what does that mean? Companies with more than 50<br>full-time workers must provide group health insurance that meets the<br>federal standards for<br><br>1.  Minimum Value<br>2.  Minimum Essential Coverage, and<br>3.  Affordability.<br><br>For 2021, the premium cost of the lowest-level employee-only coverage<br>(i.e. not "employee + 1" or "family" coverage) *must be less than 9.83%<br>of an employee's household income* to be considered *affordable*. This<br>is an increase from the 2019 affordability percentage of 9.78%. The ACA<br>originally set the affordability threshold at 9.5% of an employee's<br>household income.<br><br>For many employers, it is difficult to determine an employee's household<br>income. Accordingly, the IRS provided three safe harbors for employers<br>to determine if they have offered affordable coverage. An employer may<br>choose any safe harbor, but must apply the safe harbor on a reasonable<br>and consistent basis. The three safe harbors are:<br><br>> 1.  Rate of Pay Safe Harbor: Under this safe harbor, an employer's<br>>     offer of coverage will be deemed affordable if the cost for the<br>>     lowest-level self-only coverage is no more than the IRS issued<br>>     affordability percentage (9.78% for 2020 or 9.83% for 2021) of an<br>>     amount equal to 130 hours multiplied by the lower of the<br>>     employee's hourly rate of pay during the calendar month (or the<br>>     start of the plan year).<br>> 2.  Form W-2 Safe Harbor: Under this safe harbor, an employer's<br>>     offer of coverage will be deemed affordable if the employer's<br>>     share of the cost for the lowest-level self-only coverage is no<br>>     more than the IRS issued affordability percentage (9.78% for 2020<br>>     or 9.83% for 2021) of the employee's wages as reported in Box 1 of<br>>     Form W-2.<br>> 3.  Federal Poverty Line Safe Harbor: Under this safe harbor, an<br>>     employer's offer of coverage under a calendar year plan is<br>>     affordable if an employee pays no more for the lowest-level<br>>     self-only coverage than the IRS issued affordability percentage<br>>     (9.78% for 2020 or 9.83% for 2021) of the published annual<br>>     individual U.S. mainland federal poverty level divided by<br>>     12.\[1\](#VdIbn){#cite-VdIbn .citation_link}<br><br>If you elect "Employee + 1" or "Family" coverage, your costs may be<br>higher, but those options are not used to determine if a plan is<br>"affordable."<br><br>However, your total healthcare cost is more than just the paycheck<br>deduction. In determining health care costs, you must look at several<br>things:<br><br>- How much money is being deducted from your paycheck during each pay<br>  period, or the aforementioned paycheck deduction. This is your share<br>  of the "premium" for the health insurance. You should also examine how<br>  much your employer is paying for the insurance, so that you can see<br>  the total cost of your plan.<br>- Whether or not your plan has a *deductible*, which is an amount you<br>  will pay out of pocket for covered services, usually at a group<br>  discounted rate, before insurance starts paying.<br>- What your "copay" or "coinsurance" amounts will be at the point of<br>  service for each covered service once any deductibles are paid.<br><br>If you are able to find a better overall deal on the marketplace than<br>you can get through your employer-sponsored health plan, you should be<br>able to decline the group health plan, and the money your employer was<br>deducted from your paycheck for your health plan will simply be paid to<br>you. It's part of your salary anyway. If the employer has more than 200<br>eligible employees, they are required to opt you in to health coverage<br>unless you opt out.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What does \"including health care benefits\" mean when a job offer is<br>extended in Colorado? I took a lower paying position because it<br>\"included health care benefits\" and then I found out they were twice<br>the cost of benefits offered on the marketplace?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-VdIbn){.citation_index} [[IRS Announces ACA Affordability<br>Percentage For 2021 - Liebert Cassidy<br>Whitmore](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ef549f&url=https://www.lcwlegal.com/news/irs-announces-aca-affordability-percentage-for-2021/%23:~:text%3DFor%25202021%252C%2520the%2520premium%2520cost,of%2520an%2520employee's%2520household%2520income.){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="lcwlegal.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
