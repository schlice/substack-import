<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I love answering questions like this, because the words you choose for<br>your question reveal your own biases.<br><br>The prophesies which seem silly to you were written thousands of years<br>before Jesus was born, yet He fulfilled them all in His lifetime. Many<br>of those things were beyond His control, like where He was born or who<br>his family was. The mathematical probability of that happening by random<br>chance is *so low* that is is virtually impossible.<br><br>And that "silly" book is actually 66 books, written by 40 different<br>authors over the course of 1500 years, in three different languages, on<br>three different continents. Yet there is unity in the story, and there<br>are no errors or conflicts between any of them. It is *literally*<br>impossible for humans to pull that off without divine intervention.<br><br>So is it really all that silly that these books and prophesies so<br>clearly reveal God's divine intervention?<br><br>\<br><br>As for His intervention into "sentient beings' problems," nothing<br>"happens" naturally (which I assume you mean by random chance).<br>Everything has a cause. God will fulfill His plan, whether you like it<br>or not. If you are one of His, He will fulfill His plans through you.<br>And even if you are not one of His, He will still fulfill His plans<br>through you and you won't ever know it or be a part of it.<br><br>Since He's going to fulfill His plans in your life one way or the other<br>whether you like it or not, doesn't it make more sense to do it *with*<br>Him rather than *against* Him? I should think that would make for a<br>better life, living in harmony with God's will rather than constantly<br>opposed to it.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
