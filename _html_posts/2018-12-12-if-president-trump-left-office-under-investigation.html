<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If President Trump left office under investigation, how would deciding<br>to pardon him or not pardon him affect Mike Pence\'s future<br>electability?**<br><br>If Trump voluntarily "left office under investigation," in order to<br>complete the hypothetical, he would then be indicted (as a regular<br>citizen) and tried in a regular court. If he were found guilty, I highly<br>doubt that Pence would pardon him.<br><br>If Trump were impeached AND removed from office (a feat which is nigh<br>impossible given the composition of the Senate), and then indicted and<br>found guilty, Pence could conceivably claim that the whole thing was, to<br>borrow Trump's words, a "witch hunt," and *maybe* pardon him.<br><br>But Pence is actually a politician. He's keenly aware of one thing that<br>Trump seems to be far less concerned with: *optics*. I doubt that if<br>public opinion swayed against Trump, especially after he was indicted<br>and convicted in a court, for real crimes, that Pence would pardon him.<br>And if he was actually *removed from office,* he would be the first<br>president to ever be removed from office. Nixon was close, but he<br>resigned before he could be removed from office. Pardoning someone who<br>was *so guilty* that he became the first president ever to be removed<br>from office would play very poorly with everyone. Optics is key.<br><br>Would it hurt his future electability? Not at all. It's not going to<br>change anyone's votes whatsoever. The people who believe Trump is guilty<br>weren't going to vote for Pence anyway, and you're certainly not going<br>to lose any Trump voters because you *help* Trump when you think he's<br>being railroaded.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
