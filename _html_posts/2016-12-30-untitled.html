<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Please don\'t misunderstand, I want you to write your book, and I\'m<br>genuinely interested. When it\'s ready, I\'ll probably buy a copy<br>because your story is fascinating already, and I haven\'t even seen the<br>book yet.<br><br>My tone comes across as harsh initially, because I have spoken to *so<br>many people* who believed they "cured\" their MS or "healed themselves\"<br>that they have come off of their medications. Almost without fail, they<br>relapsed, and ended up with more disability than if they would have just<br>stayed the course. I can see this is not you, so if you were off-put by<br>my initial tone, I apologize. I also agree, Complementary and<br>Alternative Medicines (CAMs) are, first and foremost, *complementary,*<br>meaning they complement traditional medicines. You can\'t eschew one for<br>the other, you need both.<br><br>HSCT stands for [[hematopoietic stem cell<br>transplantation](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9a8f9f&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}.<br>[It(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9a8f9f&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} is a procedure which uses<br>your own induced pluripotent stem cells to "reboot\" your immune system.<br>They harvest your stem cells, induce pluripotency, and reproduce them.<br>Then they use chemotherapy to destroy your bone marrow. Once it is all<br>gone, they re-introduce your stem cells and re-grow your bone marrow,<br>thus restarting your immune system from scratch. It is a dangerous<br>procedure (one has died already), and there are indeed many risks, but<br>so far, the small study group has seen tremendous success, with 70%<br>coming completely off of medication with no further indication of MS.<br>Larger trials are just beginning now, but it shows promise.<br><br>Good luck, and keep us posted on the book.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/If-I-am-writing-a-nonfiction-book-about-how-I-sent-long-term-severe-multiple-sclerosis-into-remission-how-much-total-pledge-money-should-I-request/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
