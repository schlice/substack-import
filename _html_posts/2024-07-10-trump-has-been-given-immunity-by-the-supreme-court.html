<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's take this a step at a time.<br><br>> Trump has been given immunity by the Supreme Court.<br><br>No he has not. This is the immunity which has existed since the<br>Constitution was written, and is part of the very nature of presidential<br>authority. SCOTUS merely recognized and reaffirmed the immunity which<br>already existed. They did not *grant* new immunity.<br><br>The ruling held that the very nature of presidential power entitles a<br>president (or former president) to absolute immunity from criminal<br>prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive<br>constitutional authority; he is also entitled to at least presumptive<br>immunity from prosecution for all his official acts; there is no<br>immunity for unofficial acts. The ruling made clear that it is the Court<br>which determines whether an action or duty is "official" or<br>"unofficial."<br><br>When a president fulfills his Constitutionally-mandated duty, what he<br>does is *de facto* legal, even if a federal or state law makes that<br>action criminal for anyone else. This is the source of the immunity. It<br>is not new.<br><br>> Will this create a king<br><br>Most certainly not. He is still bound by the Constitution, and in order<br>to prosecute a president for an official act which is alleged to be<br>criminal, the president must be impeached AND removed from office.<br><br>But when it comes to the president's *other* official acts, according to<br>Chief Justice Roberts in the decision, there is on one hand the concern<br>that allowing criminal charges against a former president for his<br>official acts would affect his decision-making while in office. "A<br>President inclined to take one course of action based on the public<br>interest may instead opt for another, apprehensive that criminal<br>penalties may befall him upon his departure from office," Roberts<br>posited. On the other hand, Roberts noted, the public has an interest in<br>"fair and effective" enforcement of criminal laws. Weighing those two<br>sets of interests, Roberts concluded, a president should have immunity<br>from criminal prosecution for his official -- but not his unofficial --<br>acts unless, at the very least, prosecutors can show that **bringing<br>such charges would not threaten the power and functioning of the<br>executive branch.**<br><br>But since the impeachment remedy is there, and a president cannot<br>overcome impeachment and removal from office, the ruling does not create<br>a king. It does not guarantee that a president can do anything he<br>chooses without consequence, because he can still be impeached, removed<br>from office, and criminally charged following that political action.<br><br>> **if Trump is elected in his \'official acts\' he can do anything<br>> including getting rid of his rivals?**<br><br>Hopefully, the last section answered this question. If "getting rid of<br>his rivals" is an action which is part of his Constitutionally-mandated<br>duties, then the president enjoys absolute immunity. If it is not, then<br>the president can be impeached, removed from office, and prosecuted.<br><br>But the president cannot be criminally charged for performing his duties<br>in accordance with the Constitution. If a court finds that the actions<br>were unofficial, even a former president can be indicted and prosecuted.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
