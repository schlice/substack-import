<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Considering all the school shootings in America, is the American<br>government fully bribed by the greedy NRA, incompetent, or both?**<br><br>In order for this comparison to be valid:<br><br>- School Shootings in America<br>- A fully bribed government, paid for by the "greedy NRA"<br><br>or<br><br>- School Shootings in America<br>- An incompetent government<br><br>you would have to show that there is a *relation* between the things you<br>are comparing. One must *relate* to the other in some meaningful way.<br>For example, an incompetent government would have to be the cause of<br>school shootings in America, or a government which was bribed by the<br>"greedy NRA" (your words) to look the other way on doing what's<br>necessary to stop school shootings (because we all know exactly what<br>needs to be done to stop school shootings; we're just not doing it).<br><br>Unfortunately in this case, there is no direct comparison to school<br>shootings and either action, or inaction, by the government.<br><br>So what we have here is a *false comparison*. To wit, your question<br>cannot be answered.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
