<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If the American constitution was amended to give Cabinet secretaries<br>and officials power to subpoena Congress, submit legislation to<br>Congress, even vote on legislation, along with long, fixed terms, what<br>might that look like?**<br><br>It would look like a further erosion of a government by and of the<br>people, and a further step towards a future of laws and policy being<br>enacted by the unelected bureaucracy, and control by a federal<br>dictatorship of hundreds of offices of unelected bureaucrats, further<br>sliding America towards bureaucratic despotism.<br><br>Cabinet secretaries are appointed positions by the President, not voted<br>on by the people. At least in the original construction of the<br>government, the House was elected by the people, so they had a voice<br>when legislation was proposed. Remember the rallying cry around the<br>Boston Tea Party? "No taxation without representation!" The House<br>provided that representation, with legislation proposed and written by<br>legislators directly elected by, and therefore directly accountable to,<br>the people.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
