<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How can I report a person I suspect is not a soldier?<br><br>There is no law that prevents a person from lying about being a soldier.<br>In fact, the First Amendment in the United States protects freedom of<br>expression.<br><br>If the person is lying on a social media platform, you might report the<br>lie to the platform. Perhaps it violated a use agreement for the<br>platform.<br><br>If you see someone dressed in a military uniform who you suspect is not<br>a soldier getting a cup of coffee with a military discount, report them<br>to the police. Theft of service is illegal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
