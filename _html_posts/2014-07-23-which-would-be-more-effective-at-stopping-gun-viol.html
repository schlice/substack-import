<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [I\'m not even going to address the second side of the<br/>\"or.\" It\'s disturbing to say the least. But to assuage your aching<br/>conscience, I\'d like to address the first part.\<br/>\<br/>*Cracking down on guns will reduce gun violence.*\<br/>\<br/>Was that the answer you were looking for?\<br/>\<br/>It\'s true. If you\'re looking to reduce violence caused by guns,<br/>reducing the amount of guns in the world will reduce gun violence.\<br/>\<br/>How, exactly, you reduce the amount of guns in the world, is the trick.\<br/>\<br/>Guns used in crimes are not legal guns. They are either imported into<br/>this country illegally, or are stolen from law-abiding gun owners. So<br/>reducing ownership of legal guns won\'t put a dent in gun crime. Legal<br/>gun owners do not commit crimes with their guns. You might lessen the<br/>amount of crimes committed using guns stolen from law-abiding citizens\'<br/>residences, but that\'s about it. The vast majority of illegal guns are<br/>not stolen, but are purchased on the black market. So restricting<br/>private ownership of firearms is going to do little to lessen gun<br/>violence.\<br/>\<br/>(By the way: concealed-carry gun owners are the least likely to commit<br/>crimes. The murder rate among CCW gun owners is [[even lower than the<br/>rate of police-involved<br/>homicides](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b606c6&amp;url=http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2013/11/dean-weingarten/note-to-vpc-have-you-looked-at-police-involved-homicides){.external_link<br/>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br/>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br/>qt-tooltip="thetruthaboutguns.com"}]{.qlink_container}. Legal gun owners<br/>= safer than cops. \)\<br/>\<br/>So if you can find a way to stem the illegal flow of guns into this<br/>country, you might eventually be able to reduce gun violence. But it<br/>will only be supplanted by knife violence, blunt object violence, and<br/>frying pan violence.\<br/>\<br/>The problem is you\'re focusing on the gun, and it makes sense why. The<br/>gun is purpose-built to kill. It does this very effectively. But if<br/>killing is at all justified in any situation, then using the most<br/>efficient tool is not a problem. I can drive a screw in with a hammer,<br/>but it\'s not the most efficient tool for the job. I can kill someone<br/>with a spaghetti noodle, but there are more efficient ways to do so. If<br/>killing can be justified, the tool with which I choose to kill is up to<br/>me.\<br/>\<br/>If you just focus on the gun, you\'re focusing on the symptom of the<br/>problem, not the problem itself. The \"iceberg effect\" is at play here.<br/>You\'re focusing on the \"gun\" in \"gun violence.\" The 90% of the<br/>iceberg that is underneath the water is the \"violence\" portion, and<br/>that\'s much harder to tackle than the \"gun\" part. It\'s easy to<br/>tackle the \"gun\" part, but it\'s codified in the Constitution that<br/>Americans have a right to keep and bear arms. You can\'t restrict gun<br/>ownership without violating the Second Amendment.\<br/>\<br/>If you want to restrict gun ownership in the United States, you first<br/>have to repeal the Second Amendment.\<br/>\<br/>Once you\'ve done that, then come back to us and ask again about<br/>cracking down on guns.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
