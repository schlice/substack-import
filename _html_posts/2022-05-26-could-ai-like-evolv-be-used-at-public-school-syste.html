<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So, could AI be used to help thwart school shooters?<br><br>Emphatically, *YES!!!*<br><br>........but who's going to pay for it?<br><br>You do realize that sports franchises (and companies like Disney, who<br>[[also deployed Evolv<br>scanners](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ea7592&url=https://blogmickey.com/2020/07/massive-changes-coming-to-disney-world-theme-park-bag-check-experience/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="blogmickey.com"}]{.qlink_container}) are *FOR-PROFIT*<br>businesses that can *afford* AI systems, right? Public schools will<br>*never* have that level of funding as long as they are run by the<br>government. You can dash that idea right now, because until AI becomes<br>as ubiquitous as the mobile phone, it will never be implemented in<br>public schools.<br><br>And even if it is, it will be so overburdened by regulations and<br>requirements to accommodate this minority group and that minority group<br>that it will be, mostly, ineffective.<br><br>The best that public schools can do is to lock down harder and increase<br>armed guards more. Of course, that becomes distasteful to the general<br>public because *public school* starts to look a lot like *prison*.<br><br>So it doesn't matter how many school shootings happen, people don't want<br>to do what is necessary to secure our students. Because the solutions<br>are hard. And they are not fun. And they do not contribute to<br>the ideal learning environment.<br><br>But they are necessary.<br><br>So who will make the tough decisions?<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Could A.I. like Evolv be used at public school systems like the sport<br>franchises (Tennessee Titans, Carolina panthers, New York Mets, The<br>Super Bowl, Lincoln Center), to prevent shootouts?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
