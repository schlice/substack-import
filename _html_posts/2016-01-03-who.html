<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In the United States, the law still states that a dissent must be<br>verbalized in order for the sexual contact to be deemed \"unwarranted.\"<br>If the accuser was as intoxicated as the aggressor, how would the<br>accusor be able to say with certainty that dissent was verbalized? If<br>there is doubt as to whether or not dissent was actually verbalized, and<br>the message was received, and that doubt is reasonable, this is enough<br>to disprove a rape charge as opposed to mutual agreement.<br><br>The best advice: avoid drunken sex. Too many legal issues.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
