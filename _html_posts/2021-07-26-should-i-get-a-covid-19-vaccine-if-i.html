<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Depends on what you want to protect yourself against.<br><br>- There is evidence that the vaccines will protect you against the<br>  "variants" of COVID-19 that are running around these days,<br>  specifically the Delta variant. There is just some evidence, it hasn't<br>  been proven yet that all of the vaccines will provide similar results<br>  against the variants. A Public Health England analysis (in a preprint<br>  that has not yet been peer-reviewed) showed that at least two of the<br>  vaccines are effective against Delta. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was<br>  [[88% effective against symptomatic<br>  disease](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a8d9e0&url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-b-1-617-2-variant-after-2-doses){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="www.gov.uk"}]{.qlink_container} and [[96% effective<br>  against<br>  hospitalization](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1e2681&url=https://khub.net/web/phe-national/public-library/-/document_library/v2WsRK3ZlEig/view_file/479607329?_com_liferay_document_library_web_portlet_DLPortlet_INSTANCE_v2WsRK3ZlEig_redirect%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fkhub.net%253A443%252Fweb%252Fphe-national%252Fpublic-library%252F-%252Fdocument_library%252Fv2WsRK3ZlEig%252Fview%252F479607266){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="khub.net"}]{.qlink_container} from Delta in the studies,<br>  while Oxford-AstraZeneca (which is not an mRNA vaccine) was 60%<br>  effective against symptomatic disease and 93% effective against<br>  hospitalization. The studies tracked participants who were fully<br>  vaccinated with both recommended doses.<br>- It is unlikely that simply being infected with the original COVID-19<br>  virus will protect you against any of the variants.<br>- There is good evidence that since you've already had the original<br>  COVID-19 (not the variant), you are likely protected from being<br>  re-infected by that virus, or passing that virus to others.<br><br>So if you're interested in protecting yourself from the variant, you<br>might consider one of the vaccines.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why is it necessary to receive the Covid-19 vaccine if I have already<br>had the virus?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
