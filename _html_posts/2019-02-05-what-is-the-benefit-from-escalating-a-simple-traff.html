<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the benefit from escalating a simple traffic stop into a<br>felony arrest by refusing to give your name and ID to a police<br>officer?**<br><br>None. There really is no benefit to escalating a simple traffic stop<br>into a felony (or misdemeanor) arrest.<br><br>You won't beat the ticket by increasing your belligerence. You will<br>*only* make the situation worse by escalating noncompliance.<br><br>There simply is no scenario in which things get *better* by turning a<br>simple traffic stop into an arrest of any kind. But withholding your<br>identification, which you are *required* to give when demanded by a<br>police officer, and which you *agreed* to give when you received your<br>license, and for which the DMV can *revoke* your license (automatically<br>in some states)?<br><br>And FYI, in most jurisdictions, it's at best a misdemeanor to fail to<br>identify yourself to a police officer. At which point you'll be<br>arrested, and you'll be held in jail until you can be positively<br>identified.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
