Not even an amount that can harm you. Just<br>an amount.<br><br>I had a Crock-Pot once, and on the bottom, this label was there. After<br>investigating, I found that the solder used to hold the light bulb which<br>illuminated when the Crock-Pot was powered on contained lead. This<br>solder has absolutely zero to do with cooking my food. It was<br>permanently sealed inside the base of the unit, "no user-serviceable<br>parts inside," the other label read. It never came into contact with<br>anything meaningful.<br><br>However, the product contained lead, somewhere.<br><br>Literally, the most un-helpful label ever to be found on anything I've<br>used.<br><br>Most people, for that reason, simply ignore these labels.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
