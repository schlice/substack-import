<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: No. They're both the same God in two different<br>persons. Add in the Holy Spirit (who is also God) and you have **one God<br>in three Persons: the Trinity.**<br><br>The concept of the Trinity is a very difficult one to wrap your head<br>around. Honestly, we struggle to do it. Our brains have difficulty<br>grasping the concept, and anything we do to try to understand falls<br>woefully short.<br><br>But that's to be expected, as God's mind is so much greater than our<br>mind. We don't have the capacity to understand God's infinite mind or<br>the plans He has for us. It's arrogance for us to believe we have the<br>ability to understand the mind of God. It's like you standing over a<br>pregnant mother's womb and trying to explain what life is like on the<br>other side, in such a way that the baby in the womb would understand.<br>That baby simply doesn't yet possess the capacity to understand. Paul<br>told the believers in Corinth, "Now we see but a poor reflection; then<br>we shall see face to face. Now, I know in part; then I shall know fully,<br>even as I am fully known" (1 Cor. 13:12). Paul was basically saying that<br>we may not ever gain full understanding while we are alive on earth, and<br>we probably need to learn to accept that.<br><br>But we can try. We must be careful, however, to not put too much faith<br>in our trying. The Bible tells us to not focus on trying to understand,<br>not to focus on trying to make all the pieces fit together. "Trust in<br>the Lord, lean not on your own understanding" (Prov. 3:5). We are not<br>told to not try to understand, just don't "lean on" your understanding,<br>which means don't make it an ultimatum. "God, you'd better explain<br>yourself, or I'm outta here!" That would be "leaning" on your own<br>understanding, and we are admonished against that.<br><br>Anyway, here's a really terrible comparison, but it gets the point<br>across. Let's compare me and Obama. We are alike in *personhood*. We are<br>both human. But we are most definitely not alike in *role*. I mean, the<br>man rolls with a posse. So while we are similar in *personhood*, we are<br>vastly different in *role*.<br><br>The three members of the Trinity are exactly the same. They are all the<br>same in *personhood* (in that they are all God), but they are different<br>in *role*. God the Son subordinates Himself below God the Father, so He<br>can say things like "My Father" and "My God" and do so unironically,<br>even though He too is God.<br><br>One God in three Persons.<br><br>Just because it's not written like that in the Bible doesn't mean that<br>there isn't evidence in there to support it. Jesus talks about God the<br>Father and the Holy Spirit as three separate persons, while at the same<br>time declaring that all three of them are the same God.<br><br>Just because it's hard to comprehend doesn't make it any less Biblical.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
