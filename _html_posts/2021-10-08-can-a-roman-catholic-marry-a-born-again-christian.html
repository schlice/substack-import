<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let me see if I can answer your question without labeling you, judging<br>you, or telling you what you should or shouldn't do.<br><br>*CAN* you marry without switching your religions? Yes. You can be<br>married in either a nondenominational Christian ceremony, or in a<br>Catholic ceremony; neither group would deny either of you. If I recall<br>correctly, if the Catholic is married outside of a Catholic church, the<br>marriage would need to be blessed by a priest in order to be a valid<br>Catholic marriage.<br><br>Now, we get to the question of whether or not you *SHOULD* do so.<br>I'm not going to tell you what you should do. I'll simply give you the<br>information you need and let you decide.<br><br>[[Michael<br>Ballai](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-Ballai)]{.qlink_container}<br>was the closest to giving you a biblically-based answer when he talked<br>about being "unevenly yoked." The Scripture he is referring to is:<br><br>> Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has<br>> righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with<br>> darkness? What accord has Christ with Belial? Or what portion does a<br>> believer share with an unbeliever? --- 2 Corinthians 6:14-15 ESV<br><br>There are other parts of the Bible that talk about this same concept.<br>However, in this case, the Bible passage is referring to a believer<br>marrying an unbeliever.<br><br>And here is where we get into the rub of the topic. You are both,<br>technically, "believers." But you believe the same things in different<br>ways. And as a former Roman Catholic now Christian, I can tell you that<br>they are *vastly* different. I can't say that they are "one's going to<br>Heaven and the other's questionable" different, but I can say that the<br>differences are more than superficial.<br><br>And you'll need to think about these things. When you have children,<br>which religion will you raise them under? What they learn and how they<br>learn it will be different for both of you.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
