<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it outrageous that MGM Resorts International has filed federal<br>lawsuits against more than 1,000 victims of last October's mass shooting<br>in Las Vegas in an apparent attempt to avoid liability?**<br><br>*Not at all.*<br><br>As with any opinion site masquerading as news, you have to do your<br>homework.<br><br>Doing your homework reveals<br>[this(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=aae76f&url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/mgm-resorts-sues-victims-of-las-vegas-mass-shooting){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="thedailybeast.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>What you find is that the people who MGM sued are people who have<br>already sued MGM, or have threatened to sue MGM. MGM's lawsuit is in<br>accordance with the [[federal SAFETY<br>Act](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ead50f&url=https://www.safetyact.gov/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="safetyact.gov"}]{.qlink_container}, which provides "a<br>calibrated balance of remedies and limitations on liabilities arising<br>from mass attacks committed on U.S. soil where services certified by the<br>Department of Homeland Security were<br>deployed."\[1\](#PfsxC){#cite-PfsxC .citation_link} Since MGM used the<br>security services of Contemporary Services Corporation, "whose security<br>services have been certified by the Secretary of Homeland Security for<br>protecting against and responding to acts of mass injury and<br>destruction," (*ibid)* according to the SAFETY Act, any cases for relief<br>of injury due to mass violence where DHS certified services were used<br>are exclusively Federal cases under original jurisdiction, not to be<br>handled in the local courts.<br><br>Obviously, MGM is looking to dismiss these actions because the victims<br>need to sue Contemporary Services Corporation, not MGM, since the SAFETY<br>act provides that "\s\uch cause of action may be brought only against<br>the Seller of the Qualified Anti--Terrorism Technology and may not be<br>brought against the buyers, the buyers' contractors, or downstream users<br>of the Technology, the Seller\'s suppliers or contractors, or any other<br>person or entity" (6 C.F.R. ยง 25.7(d)). The seller of the "qualified<br>anti-terrorism technology" is CSC, and the "buyer or downstream user" is<br>MGM.<br><br>Therefore, the suits will be dismissed at the federal level, and the<br>plaintiffs will need to sue CSC, not MGM.<br><br>Basically, the Federal suit is saying to the defendants, "Hey, you can't<br>sue us because Federal law says you have to sue CSC instead. So any<br>current lawsuits against us should be dismissed, and any future suits<br>should be directed against CSC."<br><br>This action provides injunctive relief for MGM, keeps the victims'<br>petitions for relief moving in the correct direction according to the<br>law, and keeps the local courts unclogged with cases which they legally<br>cannot adjudicate.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-PfsxC){.citation_index}<br>[https://media.lasvegasnow.com/nx\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8ff760&url=https://media.lasvegasnow.com/nxsglobal/lasvegasnow/document_dev/2018/07/16/MGM%2520Lawsuit_1531784831785_48790338_ver1.0.pdf){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="lasvegasnow.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
