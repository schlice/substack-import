<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Fourteenth Amendment\'s Equal Protection Clause guarantees that no<br>state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal<br>protection of the laws.<br><br>In the context of transgender athletes, Federal law (backed now by<br>Executive Order and Supreme Court rulings) recognizes that<br>**discrimination on the basis of sex does not include those who identify<br>as transgender. Discrimination on the basis of sex refers specifically<br>to biological sex.**<br><br>Therefore, the Equal Protection Clause guarantees that states may not<br>discriminate against people due to their *biological sex*.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
