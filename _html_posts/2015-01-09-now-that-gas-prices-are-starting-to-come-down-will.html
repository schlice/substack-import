<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There isn\'t a direct cause-effect relationship like you<br>suggest. There are lots of reasons that airlines started to tack on<br>additional fees, but the bottom line is that the airline industry has<br>one of the thinnest profit margins of any industry (on average, the<br>airlines make around \$4/passenger/flight), and any time there is a<br>change in the economy, it affects the airlines noticeably.\<br>\<br>Seeing the changing landscape of the airline industry, and seeing<br>\"low-cost\" or \"budget\" airlines becoming more popular (Southwest<br>Airlines was the only airline able to stay in the black following 9/11),<br>the big carriers had to do something to adjust to the changing landscape<br>of travel.\<br>\<br>For example, United tried to form its own \"value\" brand, \"Ted,\" in<br>order to compete directly with low-cost airlines, in 2004. It was<br>actually the spike in fuel prices that caused Ted to cease operations<br>after only five years (2009). Following the cessation of Ted\'s<br>operations, the airline started investigating moving the fee-for-service<br>model from on-board meals and expanding it into other areas of the<br>travel experience. The most visible is the baggage fee. But other fees<br>include the ability to move into an Economy Plus seat (individual seats<br>priced based on popularity), use the Premier check-in lane, or buy<br>travel insurance. This allows people to customize their travel<br>experience based on what they are willing to pay.\<br>\<br>I think that the fee-based system will probably keep. I expect soon, you<br>will be able to purchase an upgrade to another seat type on the plane,<br>using the same system they use for on-board meals. As on-board data<br>services expand, expect to see those services available with fees as<br>well.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
