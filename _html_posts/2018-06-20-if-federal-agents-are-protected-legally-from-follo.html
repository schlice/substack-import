<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If federal agents are protected legally from following orders that are<br>illegal, are there any such protections for refusing to follow orders<br>that are immoral, unjust and possibly violate ethical codes of<br>conduct?**<br><br>No.<br><br>The reason is simple: **there is no standard for morality or ethics that<br>is universal amongst all people.**<br><br>My ethical and moral code is most likely different from yours. So there<br>is no basis upon which we can set a baseline for behavior. If everyone<br>is free to ignore orders based on their own moral code, then anyone can<br>claim that their own moral code prevents them from following orders, and<br>no one would follow orders, and no one could be prosecuted for failing<br>to follow orders.<br><br>Agents can refuse to follow *unlawful* orders. Agents cannot lawfully<br>refuse to follow *unethical* or *immoral* orders. They can certainly do<br>it and hope for the best in their disciplinary hearings, but there is no<br>rule that allows an agent to refuse to follow an order because they<br>personally find it immoral or unjust.<br><br>An "ethical code of conduct" sounds like department policy. If an agency<br>is issuing orders that violate its own internal policies, that should be<br>addressed separately.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
