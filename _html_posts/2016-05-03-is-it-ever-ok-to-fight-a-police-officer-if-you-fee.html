<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Short answer: it is illegal to fight a police officer who is performing<br>his duties.<br><br>Everyone else answered all the details for you. Even if you are right,<br>and even if the officer walked up to you, while you were doing nothing<br>but minding your own business, and simply tried to kill you for no good<br>reason, you would still be in a position of disadvantage legally because<br>there are no legal circumstances in which you are allowed to fight an<br>officer. You might do it to save your life (in your opinion), but<br>you\'re still going to end up in jail for assaulting a police officer.<br>By the way, this is why the vast majority of people who fight with<br>police do it: they really and truly believed they were going to die and<br>they simply wanted to defend themselves. Still illegal, though.<br><br>Regardless, there is no situation in which fighting with a police<br>officer will end up good for you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
