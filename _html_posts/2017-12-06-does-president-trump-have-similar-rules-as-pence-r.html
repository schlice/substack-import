<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>President Trump has not said whether or not he has started following the<br>Pence/Graham rule of never being alone with a woman who is not his wife,<br>or if he's going to attend a function in which alcohol is served,<br>ensuring that his wife is there. I'm pretty sure Trump is rarely alone<br>as President, and if he is, I'm certain that there is at least one other<br>person who is aware of it.<br><br>[[The<br>rule](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=732641&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Graham_rule){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} was actually first<br>practiced by Billy Graham, the Evangelical preacher. In a series of<br>meetings in 1948 in Modesto, California, Graham and a group of other<br>Evangelical leaders vowed to \"avoid any situation that would have even<br>the appearance of compromise or suspicion.\"<br><br>> The accountability agreement, which has become known as the<br>> \"[[Modesto<br>> Manifesto](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e49626&url=https://www.christianhistoryinstitute.org/magazine/article/the-modesto-manifesto/){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="christianhistoryinstitute.org"}]{.qlink_container},\"<br>> covered not only their interactions with women, but also commitments<br>> to integrity with respect to finances, their interactions with local<br>> churches, and publicity.\[1\](#sJyZC){#cite-sJyZC .citation_link}<br><br>Pence, as a public figure, follows the rule to protect himself. It<br>honestly has nothing to do with protecting women. In fact, critics of<br>the rule say that it marginalizes women, depriving them of opportunities<br>to network and share their ideas.<br><br>However, Pence knows, in the era of Al Franken and John Conyers, that an<br>accusation can ruin your career. To avoid the possibility of such a<br>career-ending accusation, he follows this rule.<br><br>It's too bad that society has changed so much that ***the mere<br>accusation*** of sexual misconduct can cost you your entire life's work.<br>However, it has. In light of this, smart men will do what they must to<br>protect themselves.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-sJyZC){.citation_index} [[Billy Graham rule -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=732641&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Graham_rule){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
