At the time, you couldn't be<br>diagnosed with MS with just one symptom. The McDonald Criteria specified<br>"two different symptoms, affecting two different body systems,<br>disseminated by time and space" to be positively diagnosed with MS. But<br>my MRI was so definitive (he said it looked like Swiss cheese) that he<br>called it "probable MS." He said I should not wait, and should start an<br>MS therapy drug as soon as possible. He said, "the most 'conservative'<br>approach is to 'conserve' as much brain tissue as possible." The<br>downside: even if you are "probable MS," by starting the medication, you<br>are essentially claiming that you are "definite MS," even without the<br>official diagnosis. I took the "conservative" approach and started<br>Copaxone.<br><br>My second symptom wouldn't occur for at least five more years, probably<br>because I had started early on an MS therapy drug. At a routine annual<br>physical, my neurologist noted that I had weakness on the right side of<br>my body. Correlating this weakness to new lesions which appeared on my<br>MRI prompted me to change my medicine, since clearly it had stopped<br>working. I only stayed on that medicine (Tysabri) for about 18 months<br>due to the risk of PML, and then switched to Gilenya.<br><br>I've been on Gilenya for a little over five years, but I just switched<br>to Zeposia. Zeposia works pretty much the same way Gilenya does, except<br>that it targets fewer sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors. Zeposia<br>binds with high affinity to only S1P receptors 1 and 5, and has little<br>affinity to the other S1P receptors. This means that it, in theory, is<br>safer and causes fewer side effects.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
