<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sperm is a component of life, not a life in and of itself. Sperm cells<br>are not, definitionally, "alive."<br><br>While I shouldn't have to give you a biology lesson, sperm combines with<br>egg to produce a zygote, the earliest form of human life. A unique life<br>form is only formed at the time that a sperm fertilizes an egg and forms<br>a zygote. This is a time period we call *conception*. It is at this time<br>that a fully unique set of DNA is created, and thus, a wholly distinct<br>human life.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is masturbation a form of abortion?
