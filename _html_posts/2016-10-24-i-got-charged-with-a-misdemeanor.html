<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>AkA<br><br>[[Christopher<br>Hawk](https://www.quora.com/profile/Christopher-Hawk)]{.qlink_container}<br>is, sadly, spot on.<br><br>It\'s not the fact that it\'s a misdemeanor. It is what the offense says<br>about your character. And despite what the media would lead you to<br>believe, police departments look for candidates of exceptional character<br>and candidates who possess a moral compass.<br><br>I would think such an offense would be a serious impediment to getting<br>hired as a police officer.<br><br>That said, candidates are in short supply these days (courtesy of the<br>good folks over at Black Lives Matter), so who knows, maybe your<br>department might overlook such a transgression if you could show you had<br>a stellar record since then.<br><br>It will likely be an uphill climb, the odds are definitely not in your<br>favor, but there is still a chance. You should definitely apply until<br>you are told no by the department. Don\'t conceal it. Be up front about<br>it, show how you have changed since then, and maybe you\'ll have a shot.<br>No guarantees, but a shot nonetheless.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
