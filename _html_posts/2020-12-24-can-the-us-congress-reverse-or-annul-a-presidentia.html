<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sure, if you can prove that the president didn\'t issue it.<br><br>The White House has an Office of Pardons. Let\'s say the Director of<br>that office sends a memo to a prison stating that the President has<br>pardoned a certain prisoner and to release that inmate immediately.<br><br>That\'s an illegal pardon.<br><br>But if the President pardons someone, it is never illegal. The pardon<br>power is enumerated in the Constitution, so exercising it is *de facto*<br>Constitutional. There is no case in which the President can issue a<br>pardon illegally.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
