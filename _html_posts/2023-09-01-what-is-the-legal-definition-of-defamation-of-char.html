<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>According to our friends at<br>[nolo.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=aff0b0&url=http://nolo.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nolo.com"}]{.qlink_container}:<br><br>> \"Defamation of character\" is a catch-all term for any statement that<br>> hurts someone\'s reputation. Written defamation is called \"libel,\"<br>> while spoken defamation is called \"slander.\" Because written<br>> statements last longer than spoken statements, most courts and<br>> insurance companies consider libel more harmful than slander.<br>><br>> Defamation is not a crime in most states, but it is a \"tort\" (a<br>> civil wrong, rather than a criminal wrong). The person who has been<br>> defamed (the \"plaintiff\") can sue the person who did the defaming<br>> (the \"defendant\") for damages.\[1\](#oEjUA){#cite-oEjUA<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>When it comes to a former employer and reference checks, there are some<br>things that the former employer must provide in order to protect<br>themselves from lawsuit, there are some things that they cannot<br>provide, and then there are some things that if they do provide, open<br>them up to the possibility of a lawsuit.<br><br>Previous employers must provide basic information regarding your<br>employment with them. This includes:<br><br>- Employment dates<br>- Job responsibilities<br>- Salary history<br>- Whether the employee was dismissed or left on their own<br><br>The information provided should be factual and based on documented<br>evidence of the employee\'s job performance. In other words, if the<br>employer says you're a bad employee, this should only be based on<br>documented performance reports, which you acknowledged.<br><br>Employers cannot provide *personal information*, such as race,<br>religion, age, or disability status.<br><br>So now to your big question: **if an employer lies about you (i.e. lists<br>false information about you on a reference check), are they liable?**<br><br>The answer is yes.<br><br>While it is not illegal for an employer to provide a bad reference, that<br>employer crosses the liability line when they provide untrue<br>information about a former employer. That employer then becomes liable<br>for a defamation of character lawsuit.<br><br>In order to prevail in such a lawsuit, several key elements must be<br>proven at trial:<br><br>- The employer made a false and defamatory statement about you, either<br>  spoken or written.<br>- The employer published the statement to a third party, likely the<br>  prospective employer, without authorization.<br>- The employer acted with some degree of fault when making the statement<br>  (i.e. the characterization of your employment does not align with your<br>  signed performance reports).<br>- The statement caused harm to you, likely because you were rejected<br>  from the job.<br><br>If you can prove these elements in court, you can hold your former<br>employer liable for defamation and collect damages, both compensatory<br>and punitive.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
