<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So you have two totally separate questions here (unless you were trying<br>to tie the Trinity into Jesus' death and resurrection, but I don't see<br>it. So I'll take your questions one at a time.<br><br>> **Is there even a little, common sense logical connection between<br>> Jesus\' death and human resurrection?**<br><br>Certainly.<br><br>If you have to *die* before you can be *resurrected*, Jesus' death,<br>followed by His resurrection, paved the way for us all to be<br>resurrected. Someone had to be *the first*, right? Jesus was the first.<br><br>His death is important, because He had to die before He could be<br>resurrected. The Bible talks about this in several places, but one I can<br>think of off the top of my head is in Genesis:<br><br>> *Then the Lord God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us in<br>> knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also<br>> of the tree of life and eat, and live forever---" therefore the Lord<br>> God sent him out from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which<br>> he was taken.*<br><br>After Adam and Eve ate from the tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil,<br>God made this statement. But why wouldn't He want Adam and Eve to eat<br>from the Tree of Life, and live forever? Because if man becomes<br>immortal, Jesus wouldn't be able to die. And if Jesus can't die, He<br>can't be resurrected. Jesus defeated both sin AND death by dying on<br>the cross and being resurrected.<br><br>> Can one be three at the same time?<br><br>This is literally one of the toughest concepts in the Bible to<br>understand. But just because we can't comprehend it doesn't mean that it<br>isn't true. Just imagine yourself talking to a pregnant mother's belly:<br><br>"Listen baby, it's gonna be so cool when you get here. There's this<br>stuff called ice cream, you're going to love it. And then there's this<br>stuff called trees and grass and sunsets and clouds and..."<br><br>Can that baby even comprehend what you're saying? No, because at that<br>time, the baby's brain isn't developed enough to comprehend it. In a<br>similar way, our brains can't even comprehend the mind of God or what He<br>has in store for us.<br><br>The Trinity is just the same. Yes, God is three unique, individual<br>persons. Yes, at the same time, He is one God. And it's really difficult<br>for us to wrap our brains around that fact. That doesn't make it any<br>less true.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
