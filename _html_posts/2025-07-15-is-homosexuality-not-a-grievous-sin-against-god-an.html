<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So you've asked about a "grievous" sin, and that's borrowing from the<br>Catholic tradition where they classify sins into "venial" sins and<br>"mortal" sins. Catholics believe that mortal sins have three elements:<br><br>- Grave matter<br>- Full knowledge<br>- Complete consent<br><br>Therefore, a "mortal sin" is always a "grave (grievous) sin," but a<br>"grave sin" is not always a "mortal sin."<br><br>Mortal sins can actually cause you to lose your salvation in the<br>Catholic tradition, because Catholics believe that a mortal sin severs<br>the sinner's relationship with God and deprives them of sanctifying<br>grace.<br><br>\<br><br>OK, now that we got all that background out of the way, this question<br>was posted in the Christians and Christianity Space, not in the<br>[[**Catholic<br>Corner**](https://thecatholiccorner.quora.com/)]{.qlink_container}<br>space. And in the Christian tradition, sins are treated differently than<br>in the Catholic tradition.<br><br>**Christians do not believe that you can lose your salvation. No sin can<br>"unsave" you.** There are a number of reasons we believe this:<br><br>- If it is true that a Christian is a "new creation"...\<br>  *\<br>  Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has<br>  passed away; behold, the new has come. \-- 2 Corinthians 5:17 ES\<br>  \*<br>  ...then he cannot become an "old creation" again. The old creation is<br>  gone. In order for a Christian to lose salvation, the new creation<br>  would have to be destroyed, and there is no evidence in the Bible that<br>  this takes place.<br>- If it is true that a Christian is "redeemed"...\<br>  \<br>  *knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from<br>  your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold,<br>  but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without<br>  blemish or spot. \-- 1 Peter 1:18--19 ESV\*<br>  \<br>  ...then you were bought with a price. We were purchased at the cost of<br>  Christ's death. For a Christian to lose salvation, God Himself would<br>  have to revoke His purchase of the individual for whom He paid with<br>  the precious blood of Christ, and there is no Biblical evidence which<br>  shows this.<br>- If it is true that a Christian is "justified"...\<br>  *\<br>  Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with<br>  God through our Lord Jesus Christ. \-- Romans 5:1 ESV\*<br>  \<br>  ...then we have been "made righteous." All those who receive Jesus as<br>  Savior are "declared righteous" by God. For a Christian to lose<br>  salvation, God would have to go back on His Word and "un-declare" what<br>  He had previously declared. There is no Biblical indication that this<br>  would ever happen.<br>- If it is true that a Christian is promised "eternal life"...\<br>  *\<br>  "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever<br>  believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. \-- John 3:16<br>  ESV\*<br>  \<br>  ...then we are given the promise of spending eternity with God. If<br>  a Christian can lose his salvation, then we would need to redefine<br>  what "eternal" means. Does "eternal" really mean "eternal"?<br>- If it is true that a Christian is marked by God and sealed by the<br>  Spirit...\<br>  *\<br>  In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your<br>  salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy<br>  Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire<br>  possession of it, to the praise of his glory. \-- Ephesians 1:13--14<br>  ESV\*<br>  \<br>  ...then at the moment of faith, the new Christian is marked and sealed<br>  with the Spirit. For a Christian to lose salvation, God would have to<br>  erase the mark, withdraw the Spirit, revoke the guarantee, keep the<br>  inheritance, forego the praise, and lessen His glory. And again, there<br>  is no indication in the Bible that this could happen.<br>- If it is true that a Christian is guaranteed glorification...\<br>  *\<br>  And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called<br>  he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. \--<br>  Romans 8:30 ESV\*<br>  \<br>  ...then at the moment of faith (Romans 8:1), Christians are justified,<br>  and glorification comes with justification. If a Christian can lose<br>  salvation, then Romans 8:30 is in error, because God could not<br>  guarantee glorification for all those whom He predestines, calls, and<br>  justifies.<br><br>In short, a Christian cannot lose his salvation, if he has truly been<br>saved. The things the Bible tells us would happen to us when we are<br>saved would all have to be undone, and there is no indication in the<br>Bible that any of that would ever happen. Additionally, God<br>*promises* that these things will happen in the life of the<br>believer, and God does not break His promises. Salvation is the gift of<br>God, and God's gifts are "irrevocable" (Romans 11:29). Christians cannot<br>be un-regenerated. Those who have been purchased with the blood of<br>Christ cannot be returned for in-store credit. God promised these things<br>and He does not lie (Titus 1:2).<br><br>In the Christian tradition, all sin causes us to fall short of God's<br>standards. No one sin is worse than any other sin. *WE* may believe<br>that some sins are worse than others, but there's no indication that God<br>treats any one sin any differently than any other sin. Is homosexual<br>activity a sin? Yes. But the Bible does not describe the sin of<br>homosexual activity as greater than any other sin. *All sin is offensive<br>to God*. Without Christ, we are lost, regardless of the sin we have<br>committed.<br><br>But most crucially, the Bible tells us that God's forgiveness is<br>available to *everyone*, even the homosexual, the adulterer, the<br>idol worshiper, the murderer, and the thief. God promises that He will<br>give us the strength to overcome our sin, including homosexuality, if we<br>believe in Jesus Christ for our salvation (1 Corinthians 6:11; 2<br>Corinthians 5:17; Philippians 4:13).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
