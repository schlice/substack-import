<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Would an aircraft with a rotor in the center like this work?<br><br>In that configuration, no.<br><br>A helicopter has two rotors, one to provide forward thrust, and one to<br>counter the torque of spinning the first one.<br><br>This aircraft has no second rotor to counter the torque of the first<br>one.<br><br>Secondly, it would be inefficient. It would be subject to the same top<br>speed of other single-rotor helicopters which tops out at half the speed<br>of sound due to the issue of [[retreating blade<br>stall](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=61cd01&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retreating_blade_stall){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. This would make it slow<br>by airplane standards.<br><br>Finally, unless you can get that rotor to tilt significantly, it's going<br>to have a very hard time moving in any direction at all, since it<br>doesn't seem to have any thrust other than the single blade.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
