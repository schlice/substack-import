<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How is bundling IE with Windows different than what Amazon does with<br>its own brand of products?**<br><br>This is a great question<br>[Shri(https://www.quora.com/profile/Shri-Amin)]{.qlink_container},<br>thanks for asking. Let's look at what the two companies are offering,<br>and the answer will become crystal clear.<br><br>Amazon. While it may look like the Fire Tablet is nothing more than<br>an Android tablet, you'd be shockingly mistaken to believe that. In<br>fact, *Amazon is not selling you a tablet. It is selling you a portal<br>into Amazon services.* It may look like a tablet. It may run programs<br>from an app store. It may even run an Android-based operating system.<br>But don't be fooled. It is really nothing more than a portal to allow<br>you to easily consume content from Amazon. And its licensing and its<br>sale price prove it. These devices are deeply discounted and are<br>subsidized by Amazon. They recoup part of that cost by showing you<br>Amazon ads on your lock screen. They recoup the rest of that cost by<br>providing you with a portal to directly consume Amazon products and<br>services. For example, Fire Tablets are the only tablets which can show<br>content just like an Echo Show. In fact, Alexa is baked right in to Fire<br>Tablets. Buy the optional cradle, and your Fire Tablet looks shockingly<br>like an Echo Show. Surprised? You shouldn't be.<br><br>Microsoft. The big takeaway here is that while Amazon is a product<br>and service company which offers many value-added services which can be<br>accessed through their hardware, *Microsoft is a software company.* They<br>primarily make a very well known operating system, Windows. In addition,<br>they also make a suite of office automation applications like Word,<br>PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook. Finally, Microsoft produces a web<br>browser, which was previously called *Internet Explorer*, or IE for<br>short.<br><br>The problem is that Microsoft made it technically impossible to<br>uninstall Internet Explorer, or to make it not the default browser. And<br>in 2001, the US government filed an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft<br>alleging that it was intentionally trying to maintain its monopoly<br>position on the PC market by not allowing users to choose their browser.<br><br>Which wouldn't have been a bad thing, if Internet Explorer was a better<br>browser.<br><br>But it's *horrible*. As far as security goes, it has more holes than<br>Swiss cheese. It supports ancient protocols which have been exploited<br>many times over and should be removed, but again, IE couldn't be<br>removed. It's slow, inefficient, and didn't contain any of the new<br>features being incorporated into Chromium-based or Mozilla-based<br>browsers such as Firefox or Chrome.<br><br>Anyway, Microsoft lost the lawsuit, with different results in the EU and<br>in the US, but the same basic theme: Microsoft was forced to decouple IE<br>from Windows and give users the opportunity to install other browsers.<br><br>Even today, they still prod you to try their browser, called Edge, which<br>is still years behind its competitors in terms of features and<br>functionality. But at least now they let you change.<br><br>\<br><br>This was a quick overview and I could go into much more detail about<br>Microsoft's antitrust problems, which were not limited to just IE. Just<br>know that the problem with Microsoft and IE was Microsoft's refusal to<br>allow people to uninstall it, which was declared to be an antitrust<br>violation.<br><br>No one is declaring that Amazon has a monopoly on Android tablets. And<br>Amazon is not billing a device as an "Android tablet." They are calling<br>it a "Fire Tablet." Meaning it's an Amazon asset, designed to access<br>Amazon services. Are you upset that you can't install Android on your<br>Echo Show? It's a purpose-built device, which is why you're probably not<br>upset. But the fact that your Fire Tablet is actually a purpose-built<br>Android device for accessing Amazon services is surprising? It shouldn't<br>be.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
