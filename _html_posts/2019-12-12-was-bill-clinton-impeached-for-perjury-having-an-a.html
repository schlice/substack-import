He repeatedly lied to investigators who<br>were investigating, among other things, the Whitewater scandal, the<br>Travelgate scandal, and the alleged misuse of FBI files. The probe<br>extended into Monica Lewinsky when she was connected with Vernon Turner,<br>a subject of the Whitewater investigation. Lewinsky was preparing to<br>perjure herself and advised Linda Tripp to do the same.<br><br>Clinton was deposed on January 17, 1998, and he lied about having sexual<br>relations with Lewinsky.<br><br>Clinton was impeached with two Articles. The first was for lying to the<br>grand jury about his affair with Lewinsky and his attempts to tamper<br>with witnesses. The second was for obstructing justice in the Paula<br>Jones lawsuit by suborning and encouraging perjury, and various other<br>offenses related to Lewinsky.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
