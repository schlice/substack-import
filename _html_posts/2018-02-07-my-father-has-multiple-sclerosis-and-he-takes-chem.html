<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I am sorry that your father has MS.<br><br>I am even sorrier to report that there currently is no cure for MS.<br><br>However, that does not mean your father will not live a long and happy<br>life. With the current list of drugs for MS, lifespans for people with<br>the disease nearly match the lifespans of people without MS. We can<br>control the symptoms of the disease. We can keep relapses at bay, and<br>when they do happen, we can make them as short as possible, along with<br>increasing the amount of time between relapses.<br><br>While not a cure, the drugs at least provide the ability to live as<br>normal a life as possible with MS.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
