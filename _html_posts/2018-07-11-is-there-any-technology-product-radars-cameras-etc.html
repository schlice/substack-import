They then digitally "stitch and stretch" the<br>images from those four cameras to produce that cool 360 degree view you<br>see while parking. As you note in the image, the picture is always on<br>while the car is in reverse. But you can push the "360" button above the<br>screen to turn the cameras on when you're not in reverse and moving<br>below 10 miles per hour, such as when you're parallel parking.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
