<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [First of all, we cannot give specific legal advice on<br>Quora. If you want specific advice, you will need to hire your own<br>attorney.\<br>\<br>You may have signed an agreement when you entered practice with your<br>clinic. That agreement may have contained a \"non-compete\" clause which<br>would prevent you from taking patients with you for X amount of time<br>after you leave the practice. If this is the case, it\'s generally<br>legally binding and has been upheld more often than not in court.\<br>\<br>If there is no such \"non-compete\" clause, generally patients can see<br>whatever provider they choose.\<br>\<br>I would hire an attorney and have him review your legal documents which<br>you signed when you entered your clinic practice.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
