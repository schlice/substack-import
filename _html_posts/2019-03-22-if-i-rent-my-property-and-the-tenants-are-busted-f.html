<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If I rent my property and the tenants are busted for growing<br>marijuana, is the landlord responsible for criminal activities?**<br><br>Not for the criminal activities of the tenants.<br><br>It's like saying the owner of the car is responsible for the killing of<br>pedestrians when the driver of the car plows it into a crowd.<br><br>Don't forget, there are always exceptions to this. For example, if the<br>landlord knew what was going on and did nothing (which is common in grow<br>operations), or actually assisted the tenants with fulfilling their<br>illegal activities (perhaps by installing upgraded power in the rental<br>unit to safely run grow lights and air handlers) the landlord could be<br>charged with a different charge, not the illegal grow. For example, the<br>landlord could be charged with "aiding and abetting" criminal activity,<br>or could be charged as an accessory to the crime, depending on his level<br>of involvement with the tenants. These are both criminal charges, but<br>they are different from being charged with the actual crime.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
