<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Yes, the device would be effective at defeating license<br>plate cameras. However, it would only work on cameras with flashes (not<br>all of them have them, some have IR lights) and it is most certainly<br>illegal. In almost all states, anything that obscures your license plate<br>in any way from cameras is illegal. It doesn\'t matter how the plate is<br>obscured. In some cases, some laws may not specify that lights can\'t be<br>used in this way, so it may be technically legal in some states.\<br>\<br>In nearly all cases, the only use for this is to defeat red light<br>cameras.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
