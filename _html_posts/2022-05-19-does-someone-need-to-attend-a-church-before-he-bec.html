<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So in order to answer this, I suppose we need to define our terms.<br><br>- What is a church?<br>- What is a Christian?<br><br>If you are considering a "church" as "a building where Christians gather<br>periodically to communally worship God," the answer is no, you don't<br>strictly need to visit a church building in order to become a Christian.<br><br>But it's important to note that we've found, especially during COVID, a<br>church is more than a building. When Jesus told Peter that "upon this<br>rock I will build my church" (Matthew 16) he wasn't talking about<br>construction. He was talking about his church as a group of people, also<br>called an "assembly" or a "congregation." The Greek word *ekklesia* is<br>the word we use to describe the church, which translates to "a<br>called-out assembly or congregation." So the upshot of this is that<br>"the church" is so much more than a building.<br><br>The catch-phrase we like to use is this: *Don't just go to church, be<br>the church.* What does this mean? Almost every church meets once a week,<br>usually on Sunday. So, for one or two hours a week, the people are<br>*being* the church. But, the people should *be the church* during the<br>166-167 hours when they aren't together in the building on Sunday. Joel<br>Hunter, the pastor of Northland Church in Florida, said it best, "the<br>church happens not so much when we gather, but when we scatter." If you<br>are "being the church" only on Sunday, then you're missing the concept.<br>Church doesn't just happen when we are together in a building. Church<br>primarily happens when we are *away from* the building.<br><br>And what it mean to "become a Christian?" What is a Christian? The<br>answer to that is that a Christian is someone who has accepted the fact<br>that they are a sinner, believes that Jesus Christ sacrificed his life<br>as a penal substitution for his sins, and confesses Jesus Christ as his<br>lord and savior. When you boil down all the trappings, this is the root<br>of what a Christian is. So the big question: does this series of beliefs<br>and actions require a special building? Of course not. You can do this<br>anywhere.<br><br>But to *grow* as a Christian is best achieved with *help*. Worshipping<br>communally with believers is a tremendous help in growing your faith, so<br>getting plugged in to an actual body of believers is going to be<br>important to help you grow in your faith.<br><br>So the TL;DR: do you need to attend a church before becoming Christian?<br>No. But don't discount the power of belonging to a church.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Does someone need to attend a church before he becomes a Christian?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
