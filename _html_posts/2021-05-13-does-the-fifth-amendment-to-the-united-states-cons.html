<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No.<br><br>[[Jose<br>Bustamante](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jose-Bustamante-21)]{.qlink_container}'s<br>answer is spot on here.<br><br>Remember, dash cam footage is *evidence*, not *testimony,* so it<br>is not covered by the 5th Amendment.<br><br>Evidence is a double-edged sword. If the evidence shows someone<br>committing a crime, your dash cam footage can be used to help convict<br>that person and clear you. But if the opposite is true, and your dash<br>cam footage shows *you* committing the crime, if the police learn you<br>have a dash cam, they can subpoena your video, and you can be charged<br>with obstruction if you don't supply it, or destruction of evidence if<br>you delete it before you give it to them.<br><br>Even worse, in the above instance (you have a dash cam and you don't<br>supply the video), the judge can instruct the jury that *you destroyed<br>the evidence because it was not going to be beneficial to you,* and they<br>should treat the lack of video in that way. It's a principle called<br>"[[spoilation of<br>evidence](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=bdcef0&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoliation_of_evidence){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}" and it's really<br>unhelpful to you. Don't do this. It's better to try to explain what the<br>video is showing, rather than to have the judge tell the jury to<br>interpret the video that they never got to see in the light **that<br>is the most unfavorable to you**.<br><br>So if you're going to install a dash cam to protect yourself, be a good<br>driver, because your video will show your driving as well as theirs.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice.
