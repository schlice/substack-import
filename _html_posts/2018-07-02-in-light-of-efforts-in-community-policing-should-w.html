<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In light of efforts in community policing, should Warren v. District<br>of Columbia be overturned?**<br><br>There are a lot of moving parts that have to come together before the<br>precedents begun in *Warren* can be removed.<br><br>Primarily, what *Warren* did was to declare that law enforcement does<br>not have an obligation to protect any one citizen. Law enforcement has a<br>general duty to protect the public at large, but they do not have<br>specific requirements to protect any one person. This declaration has<br>wide-ranging effects, but primarily it goes to *liability*. For example,<br>without *Warren*, if your child was killed by a drunk driver, you could<br>theoretically sue the police for failing to protect him from that drunk<br>driver. If the police have a specific duty to protect all citizens, the<br>police become legally liable any time someone is hurt.<br><br>Despite the advancements in community policing, this will never change<br>because it physically can't. We simply don't have enough police officers<br>to make protection of every citizen a reality. We'd literally need **100<br>times** the amount of police officers we have now, and even then, we'd<br>still only have one cop to three citizens. Think of how high your taxes<br>would have to be to support a police force that is 100 times as large as<br>it is now. And with all of the talk these days about how we have a<br>"police state" (we really don't; read a freakin' history book for crying<br>out loud), do you really *want* the police department to be that large?<br><br>TL;DR: We just don't have nearly enough police officers to make it<br>possible to remove the liability limitations *Warren* grants to the<br>police, and it would be physically impossible to have enough.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
