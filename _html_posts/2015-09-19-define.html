<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I think it\'s a valid question. What exactly does it mean<br>to infringe on a Constitutional right? Can you place reasonable<br>restrictions on firearms without infringing one\'s right to keep and<br>bear them?\<br>\<br>Let\'s look at another amendment to try to gain a better understanding<br>of \"infringment.\" Can you shout \"Fire!\" in a crowded movie theater<br>(assuming there is no fire)? Why not? If you possess freedom of speech,<br>you should be able to say whatever you want, whenever you want. But you<br>can\'t shout fire in a crowded movie theater. Interesting. Let\'s<br>continue this example. Can you gather a few hundred people in the center<br>of town and make a political speech? This is tailor-made for what the<br>Amendment protects. But what if, by your speech, the crowd goes into a<br>frenzy and destroys businesses and hurts people? You aren\'t rioting,<br>you just exercised your First Amendment right to speak. Is this legal?<br>Can the government legally prevent that speech without actually<br>infringing on your right?\<br>\<br>I asked a lot of questions, but they\'re all rhetorical. You can\'t<br>shout fire in a crowded theater. You can\'t whip a crowd into a frenzy<br>with your speech. There are reasonable limits (such as public safety and<br>preventing riots) that we can place on speech. The state has a vested<br>interest in keeping people safe; indeed, the state is well authorized<br>and remanded to do so. So reasonable restrictions on rights so that<br>people remain safe are absolutely allowed.\<br>\<br>The question then falls to balancing the safety of the general public vs<br>the free exercise of the right. Can you make a law that says if you<br>carry a rifle in public, the chamber has to be empty? The answer is yes<br>you can. Does this infringe on your right to keep and bear arms? Not<br>appreciably. Does it keep people safe? Debatable. Nevertheless, because<br>it accomplishes its goal without unduly infringing on your right to keep<br>and bear arms, this is a reasonable law. Can you impose a 10,000% tax on<br>ammunition? Does it keep people safe? Not really. Does it infringe on<br>your right to keep and bear arms? Absolutely. The ammunition is<br>considered part of the gun, and taxing at such a high rate is a clear<br>attempt at circumventing the Amendment by using the taxation authority<br>of the Congress. This, clearly, would be unconstitutional, and would<br>infringe on your right to keep and bear arms.\<br>\<br>Each law must be evaluated individually looking at each of these<br>criteria. The court has said that whatever laws are passed must further<br>a compelling state interest, and must do so in the least intrusive way<br>possible.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
