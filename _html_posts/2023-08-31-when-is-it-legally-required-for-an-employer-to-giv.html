<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You said "employment contract." That's a very specific legal term.<br><br>That term means the employer and the employee have signed a contract<br>specifying a length of time of employment. Employment contracts will<br>have specific termination requirements, or they may have none at all,<br>depending on the character of the termination. The requirement for<br>giving notice will be spelled out in the employment contract depending<br>on the character of the termination.<br><br>In other words, if it is a termination "with cause" (because you broke a<br>term of the contract), it will have one specific set of rules regarding<br>notice, and if it is a termination "without cause" (when you didn't<br>break a term of the contract), it will have another specific set of<br>rules.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
