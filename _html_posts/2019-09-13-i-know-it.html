<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I know it\'s illegal in NYS to possess marijuana, but is it illegal to<br>ingest it as well? Could you be ticketed twice, once for having it, and<br>once for ingesting it?**<br><br>No, because as far as I know, there is no statute for unlawful ingestion<br>of marijuana.<br><br>In New York, there are indeed separate charges, but the charges are not<br>for ingesting it. The charges are for unlawful possession, and for<br>unlawful sale. New York does have a medical marijuana process, and they<br>have also decriminalized marijuana in small amounts (less than 25<br>grams). Possessing less than 25 grams of marijuana will get you a fine<br>of no more than \$100, assuming you haven't been convicted of the same<br>crime within the last three months.<br><br>If the marijuana is burning, or it is in public view, or if you possess<br>anywhere more than 25 grams but less than 2 ounces (57 grams), the<br>charge immediately becomes a fifth-degree criminal possession of<br>marijuana, a Class B misdemeanor, carrying a possible three-month<br>sentence. Amounts in the 2--8 ounce (57--227 g) range are fourth-degree<br>criminal possession of marijuana, a Class A misdemeanor for which<br>offenders can receive up to six months in jail. Any of these<br>misdemeanors will get you a criminal record.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
