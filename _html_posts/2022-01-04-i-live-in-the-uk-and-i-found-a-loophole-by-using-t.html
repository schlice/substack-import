<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A loophole is defined as a *perfectly legal implementation of a law<br>or a rule*, but which does not achieve the goal of the law or the rule.<br><br>Therefore, by definition, if you found a true loophole (and you were not<br>using any deception or illegal practices in order to execute it), it<br>would not be illegal.<br><br>Now, if your "loophole" was a *software glitch* which made the ticket<br>machine spit out a free ticket when you hit a specific key combination,<br>that's not a loophole, that's *theft* and you can indeed be charged with<br>that.<br><br>Here's an example of a loophole:<br><br>The bus company gives free bus rides to students. You are a regular<br>working shlub just like the rest of us, but in your spare time from<br>home, you are enrolled in an online class wherein you are learning how<br>to use a particular piece of software. The course is 12 weeks long, and<br>it is free to join. *But your status as a "student" is recognized by the<br>bus company* and you are registered as a "student" and thus you get free<br>bus rides.<br><br>This would be a "loophole." The idea of the free rides for students plan<br>is to allow students to get to and from school, but you are not using it<br>that way. However, since you are technically a "student," you do<br>technically qualify for student rate bus passes.<br><br>(EDIT) Since people still seem to be confused about what a loophole is,<br>let me give you an example of what a loophole *is not.*<br><br>When you ride the train, you are supposed to buy a ticket. The ticket<br>shows your origin and your destination, and charges you a fee<br>appropriately. If your origin station is rural, your origin station may<br>not have turnstiles or any other form of barrier before boarding. No<br>matter, you are still required to buy a ticket at your station of<br>origin. Failing to buy a ticket at your station of origin ***is not<br>a loophole***, because you are not legally using the system. This is<br>actually called [[fare<br>evasion](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5a34fc&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fare_evasion){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} and is illegal. It is not<br>a loophole.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I live in the UK and I found a loophole. By using that loophole, I don't<br>pay for any bus tickets. Is it a crime or not? If it is a crime, what<br>would be the result of it?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
