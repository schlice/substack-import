<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The justification for people to have any of the rights they have in the<br>United States is the Constitution.<br><br>The Framers of the Constitution held the right to own property as almost<br>sacred. They believed that property and liberty were one, and property<br>was a guarantee of legal rights. A free people was a people who could<br>own property.<br><br>In the 18th century, most people lived off of land that they owned. Land<br>was abundant and it could be had as "fee simple," the type of ownership<br>which gave them complete and full ownership of the property. This was in<br>stark contrast to what they had in England at the time, wherein all the<br>fee simple property was vested in the Crown. At best in England, you<br>lived at the sufferance of the king (and later, Parliament). As<br>agriculture was the main industry, the ability to own land and live off<br>of it was one of the main reasons that colonists left England (and other<br>countries) and came to the United States.<br><br>These days, the Supreme Court does not hold property to the same level<br>as the Framers did; they consider life and liberty to be far superior to<br>property, which has given rise to concepts like eminent domain, which<br>tries to square itself with the Constitution, and does so only just.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
