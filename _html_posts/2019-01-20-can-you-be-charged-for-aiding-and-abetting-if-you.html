<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you be charged for aiding and abetting if you live with someone<br>who has a warrant?**<br><br>The exact charge would not generally be aiding and abetting. It's more<br>likely you'd be charged with "harboring a fugitive."<br><br>Aiding and abetting, or in some states, accessory after the fact, may be<br>charged if you supply money to the fugitive. However, simply giving<br>money to a fugitive does not meet the standard for harboring a fugitive.<br><br>At a federal level, 18 USC ยง 1071 requires proof of four elements:<br><br>1.  Proof that a federal warrant had been issued for the fugitive\' s<br>    arrest,<br>2.  The accused had knowledge that a warrant had been issued,<br>3.  The accused actually harbored or concealed the fugitive,<br>4.  The accused intended to prevent the fugitive\' s discovery or<br>    arrest.<br><br>State laws vary, of course, but they all have some law against harboring<br>a fugitive.<br><br>So just living with a fugitive doesn't rise to the level of harboring.<br>You have to know the person has a warrant, and you have to intend to<br>prevent the person's discovery. This means you have to do "something" in<br>furtherance of concealment of the fugitive (i.e. you go out of the<br>residence and make financial transactions on their behalf so they don't<br>have to leave the residence).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
