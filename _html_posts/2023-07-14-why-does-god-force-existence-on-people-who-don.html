<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Asking why God does anything is a challenging thing to do from the<br>get-go.<br><br>If there is an all-knowing, all-powerful God of the Universe (and we can<br>prove that such a creator God exists), then we would rightly expect that<br>His motivations for His actions would be, largely, unknown to us. Since<br>there would be so many things that He would know and we would not, it<br>would be virtually impossible for us to understand His reasons for<br>certain actions unless He deigned to explain them to us. And Scripture<br>tells us that He does not frequently do that. Solomon wrote in Proverbs<br>25:2, "It is the glory of God to conceal a matter\.\" Isaiah 45:15<br>states, "Truly You are a God who hides Himself." 1 Corinthians 2:11<br>says, "No one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God."<br>Deuteronomy 29:29 reads, "The secret things belong to the Lord our God"<br>(NKJV). Ecclesiastes 11:5 proclaims, "As you do not know the path of the<br>wind, or how the body is formed in a mother's womb, so you cannot<br>understand the work of God, the Maker of all things." Isaiah 55:8-9<br>teaches, "'For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways<br>My ways,' declares the Lord. 'As the heavens are higher than the earth,<br>so are My ways higher than your ways and My thoughts than your<br>thoughts.'"<br><br>Clearly, Scripture tells us we lack the capacity to grasp God's infinite<br>mind or the way He intervenes in our lives. How arrogant of us to think<br>otherwise. Trying to analyze His omnipotence is like an amoeba<br>attempting to comprehend the behavior of man. Romans 11:33 (NKJV)<br>indicates that God's judgments are "unsearchable" and His ways "past<br>finding out". Similar language is found in 1 Corinthians 2:16: "Who has<br>known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct Him?" Unless the Lord<br>chooses to explain Himself to us, which He does not often do, His<br>motivation and purposes are beyond the reach of mortal man.<br><br>Revelation 4:11 declares (emphasis mine): "You are worthy, O Lord, to<br>receive glory and honor and power; for you created all things, and by<br>Your will they exist and were created." The takeaway from this verse<br>is that God freely chose to create and was not constrained by any<br>outside force or by some need to fill a deficiency. Psalm 115:3 says:<br>"But our God is in heaven; He does whatever He pleases." The simple<br>answer to the question, therefore, is that God wanted to create<br>humans, so He did.<br><br>But just because God didn't create us because He needed to doesn't mean<br>He doesn't care about His creation, or that people are somehow<br>unimportant to God. Among all of His creation, only humans were created<br>in the image of God. As theologian Wayne Grudem rightly commented:<br><br>> Someone might wonder, if God does not need us for anything, then are<br>> we important at all? Is there any significance to our existence or to<br>> the existence of the rest of creation? In response it must be said<br>> that we are in fact very meaningful because God has created us and<br>> determined that we would be *meaningful to him*. That is the final<br>> definition of genuine significance (Grudem, 1994, p. 162, italics in<br>> original).<br><br>In other words, God created us of His free will. The fact that He<br>created us in His image implies our meaning and our importance.<br><br>It is also said that God created us "for His glory." But what does that<br>mean?<br><br>> Everyone who is called by My name, Whom I have created for My glory, I<br>> have formed him, yes, I have made him --- Isaiah 43:7<br><br>What does *that* mean? Some people (some of whom I have had the pleasure<br>of interacting with on this forum) have suggested that if the God of the<br>Bible made humans simply "for His glory," then this would imply that God<br>is an egotistical dictator who simply wanted more "subjects" to grovel<br>at His feet and tell Him how great He is.<br><br>But if God is omnipotent (fully complete, lacking nothing), then He<br>doesn't *need* praise. So that can't be it. It must be, then, that not<br>only are we designed to bring glory to God, but we are also designed to<br>enjoy God's glory *and find our own completeness in it.* It is a perfect<br>feedback loop of humans receiving God's glory, responding with obedience<br>and praise, and being complete and fulfilled by their reception of God's<br>glory as well as by their proper response to it. We can say, then, that<br>God created humans to live blissfully perfect lives receiving and<br>reciprocating His glory.<br><br>\<br><br>That said, does that always happen? No. In fact, it hardly ever happens.<br>The fact remains that sin has infected this world. We experience<br>hardships and suffering. We experience both joy and pain.<br><br>But we know how we were designed. We know that God's plans for us are<br>always for our good, never for harm. And we can trust that He loves us,<br>knows us, and cares for us. So if you're ever feeling like no one cares<br>whether or not you're alive, you're wrong. At least One does.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
