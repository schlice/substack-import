<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It's actually a lot more simple than folks are trying to make it.<br><br>The bottom line: humans have human minds. Angels (including Satan) have<br>*angelic minds.*<br><br>Humans, with our human minds and its limitations, do not possess the<br>full knowledge of the glory of God. Thus, our choice to sin (and in many<br>cases, our sin without choice) can be directly associated with a lack of<br>the full knowledge of God. In other words, much of our sin can be<br>attributed to our fallen, human condition.<br><br>Angels do not have this limitation. Satan, and all the angels, were<br>continually in God's presence and had the full knowledge of the glory of<br>God. Therefore, they had no excuse for rebelling against God and turning<br>away from Him. They were not tempted. Satan and the other angels<br>rebelled against God despite what they knew was the utmost evil.<br><br>God built a mechanism to redeem humanity, through the person of Jesus.<br>No mechanism was designed for the salvation of fallen angels. Besides,<br>there's no indication that they would repent, given that they were not<br>deceived and made their decisions while having full knowledge of the<br>glory of God. Theirs wasn't a sin based on a fallen nature. Theirs was<br>an active rejection of God with the full knowledge of what they were<br>doing and why. Why would we be upset that God gives them exactly what<br>they asked for?<br><br>Luke 12:48 tells us that the severity of God's judgment varies according<br>to how much knowledge a person possesses. The angels, therefore, with<br>their vast knowledge, deserve a much greater judgement.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
