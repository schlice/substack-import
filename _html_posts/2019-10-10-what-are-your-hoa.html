<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are your HOA's by-laws or declarations regarding owning a home<br>business?**<br><br>Most HOAs allow home-based businesses. However, the HOA would be<br>concerned whether or not your HOA would increase traffic into and out of<br>the neighborhood or required parking outside of what a single family<br>residence would support. Any home-based business which caused traffic to<br>increase into the neighborhood would not be permitted. But simply owning<br>a home-based business is generally not prohibited.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
