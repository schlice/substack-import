<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can the Democratic party successfully bring suit against the<br>Republican party for gerrymandering thus denying Democrats their right<br>of association?**<br><br>Either party can sue for gerrymandering. The problem: *it's very<br>difficult to tell actual gerrymandering (illegal) from genuine<br>redistricting (legal).*<br><br>Essentially, it's really easy to say what districts *should not* look<br>like. Some of the worst gerrymandering is easy to spot.<br><br>> \I\t's much more difficult to say what districts *should* look like,<br>> because reformers can disagree on what priorities should govern our<br>> political cartography. Should districts be drawn to be more compact?<br>> More conducive to competitive elections? More inclusive of<br>> underrepresented racial groups? Should they yield a mix of Democratic<br>> and Republican representatives that better matches the political<br>> makeup of a state? Could they even be drawn at random? These concepts<br>> can be difficult to define and often stand in tension with one<br>> another.\[1\](#Fbapm){#cite-Fbapm .citation_link}<br><br>Some states attempt to do this by taking redistricting out of the hands<br>of politicians. Colorado *literally did this Tuesday.* We voted for<br>amendments to our state Constitution which takes redistricting out of<br>the hands of politicians and gives it to an independent commission which<br>is made up of 12 members: four from the state's largest political party,<br>four from the state's second largest political party, and four<br>independent members. They will draw boundaries for both Congressional<br>districts and State Congress districts (two separate Amendments were<br>passed for that: Amendment Y and Amendment Z). According to our new<br>Constitutional amendment, "\t\he redistricting commission should set<br>district lines by ensuring Constitutionally guaranteed voting rights,<br>including the protection of minority group voting, as well as fair and<br>effective representation of constituents using politically neutral<br>criteria."<br><br>But lawsuits about gerrymandering rarely yield results, since it is very<br>difficult to spot actual gerrymandering except in the worst cases.<br>Gerrymandering is difficult to separate from legal and necessary<br>redistricting without resorting to simply removing the political<br>motivation altogether.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-Fbapm){.citation_index} [[Hating Gerrymandering Is Easy.<br>Fixing It Is<br>Harder.](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=69f571&url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hating-gerrymandering-is-easy-fixing-it-is-harder/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="fivethirtyeight.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
