<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Can the US Congress ban voting by mail for federal elections?<br><br>No.<br><br>The Constitution determines who can do what for elections for Federal<br>government positions.<br><br>In the case of Senators and House Representatives, Article I Section 4<br>states:<br><br>> *The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and<br>> Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature<br>> thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such<br>> Regulations, except as to the Place of Choosing Senators.*<br><br>So when it comes to electing Congress, Congress can alter how states<br>hold those elections. They could pass a new law prohibiting mail-in<br>ballots for Senators or Representatives.<br><br>However, elections of the President are covered separately, in Article<br>II Section 1:<br><br>> *Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof<br>> may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of<br>> Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the<br>> Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an<br>> Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed<br>> an Elector.*<br>><br>> *\...\*<br>><br>> *The Congress may determine the Time of choosing the Electors, and the<br>> Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same<br>> throughout the United States.*<br><br>Congress has the authority to choose only the day and time that Electors<br>are chosen, and that day must be consistent across the country. There is<br>nothing in there which states that Congress can change the manner by<br>which a state conducts that election. Therefore, that authority belongs<br>only to the state.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
