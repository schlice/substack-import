<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>MS is known as "The Great Imitator" because none of its symptoms are<br>unique to MS. Everything you experience with MS can be experienced as a<br>consequence of some other disease or condition.<br><br>*So how do you know if you have MS or some other disease with the same<br>symptoms?*<br><br>A diagnosis of MS is a "diagnosis of exclusion" wherein neurologists<br>will "exclude" everything else which can cause the symptoms you are<br>seeing. When they have excluded everything else, the only remaining<br>choice must be MS.<br><br>There are also symptoms which, in the aggregate, would appear in many<br>other diseases, but together only appear in MS. This includes the white<br>spots on the MRI, the positive spinal tap, the positive findings on a<br>neuro exam, etc.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How do physicians differentiate and diagnose Multiple sclerosis (MS)<br>when other diseases mimic it with the same symptoms?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
