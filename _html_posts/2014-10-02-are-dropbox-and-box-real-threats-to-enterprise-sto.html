<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [They are absolutely players in the market. Threats? Not<br>really.\<br>\<br>EMC has its own cloud storage offering (Syncplicity) which boasts the<br>largest array of device offerings, larger than any other cloud storage<br>company. EMC and Syncplicity is a \"leader\" in [[Gartner\'s newest<br>Magic<br>Quadrant](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9f1010&url=https://www.syncplicity.com/whitepaper/gartner-efss-magic-quadrant){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="syncplicity.com"}]{.qlink_container} for Enterprise File<br>Synchronization and Sharing.\<br>\<br>But none of those other companies have the financials to back up their<br>SaaS (Storage as a Service) plays. EMC has never been in the red, and I<br>can count on one hand the number of times they missed targeted earnings,<br>ever. EMC has the widest array of offerings, covering the entire data<br>life cycle, the Professional Services to fit those solutions anywhere,<br>and world-class Customer Service to support the<br>business.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
