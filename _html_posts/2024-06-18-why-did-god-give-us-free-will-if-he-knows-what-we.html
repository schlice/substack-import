<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> Why did God give us free will if he knows what we will choose?<br><br>The free will isn't for Him. The free will is for you*.* Just<br>because He can see what you chose even though you haven't gotten there<br>yet doesn't mean that the free will itself isn't important.<br><br>Free will permits you to be accountable for your own decisions<br><br>> **Will those who make the wrong choice be punished even if they did<br>> not want to make that choice?**<br><br>This makes no logical sense. If you didn't want to make the choice, then<br>why did you make the choice? You have free will. You could have freely<br>chosen the other choice. Hardly anyone chooses something they did not<br>want to choose.<br><br>You chose the desire of your heart at the moment of choice. You desired<br>that more than anything else, and that's what you chose. Nearly everyone<br>chooses in this way.<br><br>Therefore, since you are free to make any choice at the moment of<br>choosing, the choice you make indicates what your greatest desire is at<br>that moment.<br><br>TLDR: We are all responsible for the choices we freely make<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
