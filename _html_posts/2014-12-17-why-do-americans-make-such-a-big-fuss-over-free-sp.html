<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Ultimately, it\'s not important what one person or another<br>believes is a really important freedom. What\'s most important is what<br>the founders thought were really important freedoms.\<br>\<br>Human dignity was something that the founders believed was so immutable,<br>so ingrained in the consciences of all men, that there was never any<br>thought that it would be violated. Even the King gave some modicum of<br>human dignity.\<br>\<br>The rights enshrined in the Bill of Rights are ones that the founders<br>thought needed to be protected in writing. Ones that the King routinely<br>violated. Ones that they believed would become the cornerstone for a new<br>type of free society.\<br>\<br>The longest-running democracy in the world can\'t be<br>wrong.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
