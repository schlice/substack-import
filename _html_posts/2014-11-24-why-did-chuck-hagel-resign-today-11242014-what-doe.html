<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Hagel and the current White House administration did not<br>see eye to eye on a lot of issues, considering Hagel is a Republican.\<br>\<br>Additionally, the administration, being Democratic, must be associated<br>with \"drawdown\" and elimination of war. Instead, we\'re ramping up<br>against ISIS. This again causes the administration to look bad in its<br>own party (regardless of whether or not we need to be ramping up), and<br>calls for Hagel\'s ouster have been increasing over the past few<br>months.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
