There is no indication that the words were meant to be literal.<br><br>Nowhere in scripture do we find this teaching. We see scriptures refer<br>to the elements as the body and blood, but we also see Jesus clearly<br>stating that the words He was speaking were spiritual words: \"It is the<br>Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have<br>spoken to you are spirit and are life,\" ([[John<br>6:63](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e973c4&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John%25206.63){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). He did not say they were<br>literal words; that is, He did not say that they were His actual body<br>and blood.<br><br>But, a Catholic might object and say that Jesus clearly said, \"This is<br>My blood\...\" and \"This is my body\...\" This is true, but Jesus<br>frequently spoke in spiritual terms: \"I am the bread of life,\" ([[John<br>6:48](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=336ba0&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John%25206.48){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}); \"I am the resurrection<br>and the life,\" ([[John<br>11:25](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3b5238&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John%252011.25){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}); \"I am the true vine,\"<br>([[John<br>15:1](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b0ba41&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John%252015.1){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}), etc. Jesus often spoke in<br>figurative terms and in the context of Jesus telling His disciples that<br>they must eat His body and blood, He clearly says He was speaking in<br>spiritual terms, \"\...the words that I have spoken to you are spirit<br>and are life,\" ([[John<br>6:63](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e973c4&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John%25206.63){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br><br>After Jesus said, \"This is my blood,\" ([[Matt.<br>26:28](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=95cbb0&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Matt.%252026.28){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}), He said, \"But I say to<br>you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that<br>day when I drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom,\" ([[Matt.<br>26:29](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2a8b44&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Matt.%252026.29){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). Why would Jesus speak<br>figuratively of His blood as \"the fruit of the vine\" if it was His<br>literal blood? We can clearly see that Jesus was speaking figuratively.<br><br>2. There is no indication the disciples thought the elements changed<br><br>There is no indication in the biblical accounts of the Last Supper that<br>the disciples thought that the bread and wine changed into the actual<br>body and blood of Christ. There simply isn\'t any indication of this.<br>Should we say that the disciples who were sitting right there with<br>Jesus, actually thought that what Jesus was holding in his hands was his<br>own body and blood? That would be ridiculous.<br><br>3. There is no indication the disciples worshipped the elements<br><br>We see no indication at all that the disciples worshipped the elements.<br>The adoration of the Eucharist is practiced during the Mass. Catholicism<br>says, \"Moreover, the Catholic Church has held firm to this belief in<br>the presence of Christ\'s Body and Blood in the Eucharist not only in<br>her teaching but in her life as well, since she has at all times paid<br>this great Sacrament the worship known as \"latria,\" which may be given<br>to God<br>alone.\"[1(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=13456f&url=http://carm.org/transubstantiation%23footnote1_ndr89ec){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="carm.org"}]{.qlink_container} Where is the worship given the<br>sacrament by the disciples anywhere in the New Testament? It is not<br>there.<br><br>4. The supper was instituted before Jesus\' crucifixion<br><br>The Mass is supposed to be a reenactment of the sacrifice of Christ.<br>Therefore, according to Roman Catholic theology, the bread and wine<br>become broken body and shed blood of Christ and represent the<br>crucifixion ordeal. But how can this be since Jesus instituted the<br>Supper before He was crucified? Are we to conclude that at the Last<br>Supper, when they were all at the table, that when Jesus broke the bread<br>it actually became His sacrificial body \-- even though the sacrifice<br>had not yet happened? Likewise are we to conclude that when Jesus gave<br>the wine that it became His actual sacrificial blood \-- even though the<br>sacrifice had not yet happened? That would make no sense at all.<br><br>5. The Roman Catholic view is a violation of Levitical law<br><br>The Roman Catholic interpretation of the Eucharist requires the<br>participant to eat human flesh and drink human blood. Remember, Roman<br>Catholicism teaches that the bread and the wine become the actual body<br>and blood of Christ. Essentially, this amounts to cannibalism. What does<br>the Scripture say concerning this?<br><br>\"For as for the life of all flesh, its blood is identified with its<br>life. Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, You are not to eat the<br>blood of any flesh, for the life of all flesh is its blood; whoever eats<br>it shall be cut off,\" ([[Lev.<br>17:14](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a609e0&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Lev.%252017.14){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br><br>Notice that the scripture says that you are not to eat the blood of any<br>flesh. It would certainly appear that the Roman Catholic view is in<br>contradiction to the Old Testament scripture since it advocates the<br>eating of the blood of Christ. To the RCC it is not just symbolic, it is<br>the actual eating and drinking of the body of Christ.<br><br>6. It is a violation of the incarnation<br><br>The biblical doctrine of the incarnation states that the Word which was<br>God and was with God ([[John<br>1:1](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=148c83&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John%25201.1){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}), became flesh and dwelt<br>among us ([[John<br>1:14](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9fa1c5&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John%25201.14){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}). This \"became flesh\"<br>involves what is known as "the Hypostatic Union." This is the teaching<br>that in the one person of Christ are two natures: divine and human. That<br>is, Jesus is both God and man at the same time and He will forever be<br>God and man.<br><br>Furthermore, by definition, for Jesus to be human He must be located in<br>one place. This is the nature of being human. A human male does not have<br>the ability to be omnipresent. He can only be in one place at one time.<br>To say that Jesus in His physical form is in more than one place at a<br>time, is to deny the incarnation. That is, it denies that Jesus is<br>completely and totally a man \-- since a man can only be it one place at<br>one time. Therefore, to say that the bread and wine become the body and<br>blood of Christ is to violate the doctrine of the incarnation by stating<br>that Christ is physically present all over the planet as the mass is<br>celebrated. This is a serious problem and a serious denial of the true<br>and absolute incarnation of the Word of God as a man.<br><br>But, did not Jesus say in [[Matt.<br>28:18-20](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2f2e8f&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Matt.%252028.18-20){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container} that He would be with the<br>disciples always, even to the ends of the earth? Is this not a<br>declaration that Jesus will be physically present everywhere? No, this<br>is not what is stated.<br><br>The answer is found in the teaching of the communicatio idiomatum. This<br>is the teaching that the attributes of both the divine and human nature<br>are ascribed to the single person of Christ. It does not mean, however,<br>that anything particular to the divine nature was communicated to the<br>human nature. Likewise, it does not mean that anything particular to the<br>human nature was communicated to the divine nature. It means that the<br>attributes of the divine nature are claimed by the person of Christ.<br>Therefore, Jesus is omnipresent, not in His human nature, but in His<br>divine nature.<br><br>To make this more clear, let\'s look at some verses that illustrate the<br>communicatio idiomatum:<br><br>- [[John<br>  17:5](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c25d22&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John%252017.5){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}, \"And now, glorify Thou<br>  Me together with Thyself, Father, with the glory which I had with Thee<br>  before the world was.\"<br>- [[John<br>  3:13](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3458d2&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John%25203.13){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container},\"And no one has ascended<br>  into heaven, but He who descended from heaven, even the Son of Man.\"<br><br>Please notice that in these two verses, Jesus lays claim to the glory<br>that He had with the Father before the foundation of the world. He also<br>claims to have descended from heaven, but how could these be true since<br>He is a man? The answer is because the attributes of the divine nature<br>are claimed by the person of Christ. Therefore, the person of Christ<br>could claim to have glory with the Father and could claim to descend<br>from heaven. But we know that the man Jesus, in the flesh, did not exist<br>until His conception. Furthermore, this means that the two natures of<br>Christ are distinct, yet they are in Union in the one person of Christ<br>(the hypostatic union). It further means that the attributes of the<br>divine and the attributes of the human are not transferred to one<br>another \-- the divine does not become localized and the human does not<br>become infinite. If this were the case, then the nature of the divine<br>and the nature of the human will be violated. Therefore, we can see that<br>for Jesus to be a man, He must retain the attributes of humanity. This<br>means that He must be localized and it means He cannot be physically<br>omnipresent. If He were, by definition He would not be a man. But the<br>Roman Catholic position is that the bread and wine become the actual<br>body and blood of Christ and this violates the doctrine of the<br>incarnation. Therefore, transubstantiation cannot be the correct<br>teaching of Scripture.<br><br>7. The Lord\'s Supper is not a sacrifice of Christ<br><br>The Bible tells us:<br><br>\"By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body<br>of Jesus Christ once for all. 11 And every priest stands daily<br>ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can<br>never take away sins; 12 but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins<br>for all time, sat down at the right hand of God, 13 waiting from that<br>time onward until His enemies be made a footstool for His feet. 14 For<br>by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified"<br>([[Heb.<br>10:10-14](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1a6f61&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Heb.%252010.10-14){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br><br>In the Roman Catholic Mass, there is a sacrifice of Christ. In other<br>words, in the ceremonies, is a reenactment and an actual sacrifice of<br>Christ per the Mass. This is an obvious contradiction to the Scriptures<br>which teach us that Christ died once for all and that by the one<br>offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified. It does<br>not state in the Word of God that the sacrifice of Christ must be<br>repeated in order to forgive us of our sins or somehow help us to<br>maintain our salvation by the infusion of grace. The fact that Christ<br>died once and the sacrifice occurred once, is proof that it is<br>sufficient to cleanse us of our sins. We connect with the sacrifice of<br>Christ by faith, not by a ceremony.<br><br>Finally, because the sacrifice of Christ was once for all, it is<br>sufficient to save us and we do not need to maintain our salvation by<br>our efforts or by our participation in the Lord\'s supper. It is not a<br>means of grace that secures our salvation or infuses into us the grace<br>needed that then enables us to maintain our salvation by our works.<br>Instead, we are made right before God by faith.<br><br>- \"being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which<br>  is in Christ Jesus,\" ([[Rom.<br>  3:24](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=009a19&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Rom.%25203.24){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br>- \"Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the<br>  deeds of the law,\" ([[Rom.<br>  3:28](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=777928&url=http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Rom.%25203.28){.external_link<br>  rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>  onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>  qt-tooltip="biblia.com"}]{.qlink_container}).<br>- \"For what saith the scripture?
