<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The question begins with an incorrect interpretation of Exodus 21--22.<br>Pro-choice people use this passage to claim that the Bible not only<br>endorses abortion, but encourages it.<br><br>However, that couldn't be further from the truth. Exodus 21 isn't about<br>*abortion*, it's about *retribution*. *And it actually proves that the<br>law should protect the unborn.*<br><br>Basically, Exodus 21 says this: "If people are fighting and hit a<br>pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious<br>injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands<br>and the court allows. But if there is serious injury, you are to take<br>life for life." The passage goes on to say that, in general, penalties<br>should be "eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,<br>burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise" (v24--25).<br>Ultimately, what the passage says is that **the punishment should fit<br>the crime.**<br><br>This law is only references "abortion" in that it gives the example of a<br>pregnancy ending prematurely. However, the basis of the statute is not<br>the ending of the pregnancy prematurely. It is the assumption that the<br>baby delivered prematurely **has the same rights and protections under<br>the law as an adult human being. That is, *the fetus is a person.***<br><br>Oops, that's probably not what the pro-choice person wanted to hear when<br>they referenced that passage, is it...<br><br>Medical science says that life begins at<br>conception\[1\](#FTxVc){#cite-FTxVc<br>.citation_link}\[2\](#TdOxX){#cite-TdOxX<br>.citation_link}\[3\](#rsZho){#cite-rsZho .citation_link}. Probably<br>also not what the pro-choice person wanted to hear, because now they<br>have to face the inconvenient truth that abortion kills a live human<br>being. And if you want to hold to the Old Testament law as is presented<br>in Exodus 21, that live human being is a person with rights, the same<br>rights and protections under the law as an adult human being.<br><br>Several passages of Scripture also show that truth.<br><br>- Psalm 139:13 and 16: "You created my inmost being; you knit me<br>  together in my mother's womb \...\ Your eyes saw my unformed body;<br>  all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of<br>  them came to be." What David is saying here is that God is there, in<br>  the womb, at the beginning of life, and He has plans for that life<br>  which He has had from the beginning. Phrases like "unformed body,"<br>  "inmost being," and "knit me together" describe processes occurring at<br>  the cellular level of embryonic and fetal life. In other words, God<br>  has unique plans for *every* life He creates, from its inception.<br>- Jeremiah 1:5: God planned for Jeremiah to be a prophet before he was<br>  even conceived: "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before<br>  you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the<br>  nations." The statement "I knew you" indicates that God regarded<br>  Jeremiah as an individual well before he was born.<br>- Galatians 1:15: God had set Paul apart for a special work before he<br>  was born.<br><br>In God's eyes, each baby in the womb is already an individual, no matter<br>where in the developmental process that baby happens to be.<br><br>Under the law in Exodus 21, causing the death of an unborn child was a<br>serious crime, and the punishment for it was "a life for a life." That<br>law was an extension of a more basic law from Genesis 9:6: "Whoever<br>sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed, for God made man<br>in his own image." (ESV). Taken together, we see that the fetus, which<br>was already given legal protection in Exodus 21, is considered a human<br>life---a human being created in God's own image.<br><br>From all of this, we can conclude that all human life, from the moment<br>of conception onward, is precious to God. He created that life in His<br>image. Harming or destroying that life was a crime under Old Testament<br>law, and is a sin.<br><br>Murder is the unlawful taking of a human life. Murder is also a sin.<br><br>Therefore, God considers abortion to be murder.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-FTxVc){.citation_index} [[The Human Reproductive System:<br>Basic Biology In Color Series Vol. 4: KRIEGER, Morris: Amazon.com:<br>Books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=115108&url=https://www.amazon.com/Human-Reproductive-System-Basic-Biology/dp/B005KFTOMU){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[2\](#cite-TdOxX){.citation_index} [[Langman\'s Medical Embryology:<br>9781496383907: Medicine & Health Science Books @<br>Amazon.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6f1424&url=https://www.amazon.com/Langmans-Medical-Embryology-T-W-Sadler/dp/1496383907){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>\[3\](#cite-rsZho){.citation_index} [[Before We Are Born:<br>9780323608497: Medicine & Health Science Books @<br>Amazon.com](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=28f966&url=https://www.amazon.com/Before-Are-Born-Essentials-Embryology/dp/0323608493){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
