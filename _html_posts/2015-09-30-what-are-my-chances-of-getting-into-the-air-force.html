<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Question details:*<br>><br>> *How can I get in?*<br>><br>> *I am currently in 11th grade, 4.29 GPA, cadet in the Civil Air<br>> Patrol, member of my school\'s Spanish honor society and the national<br>> honor society, I have a varsity letter from my school\'s academic<br>> team, and am taking about 7-8 AP classes throughout high school. I am<br>> also taking a 4-year aerospace elective career track. I tutor kids<br>> around 3 days a week in math, too. The only thing I lack is physical<br>> stuff, which I will be working on. I am a girl, by the way.*<br><br>The \"physical stuff\" is important. This is why only 52% of cadets who<br>enter the Academy are in the top 10% of their respective high school<br>classes. I\'m assuming by your statistics that you\'re in the top 10% of<br>your class.<br><br>You\'ve got everything you need already, except for the \"physical<br>stuff.\"<br><br>Take [[Tom<br>Farrier](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tom-Farrier)]{.qlink_container}\'s<br>advice and get into the Air Force Academy recruiting site. The Academy<br>will be looking for athletic participation, usually in team sports. The<br>\"physical stuff\" is very important, as females are expected to meet<br>physical standards in the military as well as males. The actual numbers<br>vary slightly between the sexes, but the standards are there for both.<br>The website talks about what you will need to do to prepare for the<br>Academy\'s physical requirements. You should be participating in one or<br>more of these things:<br><br>> - Rigorous team sports (ex. Soccer or Football)<br>> - Strenuous individual sports (Swimming or Wrestling)<br>> - An individual fitness program including both distance running and<br>>   conditioning exercises --- upper-body strength, running speed and<br>>   endurance should be your objectives<br><br>You will have a [[Candidate Fitness<br>Assessment](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3b86bc&url=http://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/the-application-process/fitness-assessment/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="academyadmissions.com"}]{.qlink_container} that you will<br>have to pass before you can get into the Academy. And it is very<br>physically demanding; don\'t forget that the Cadet Area at the Academy<br>is at an altitude of 7258\' above sea level. If you\'re like me, coming<br>from sea level, that transition is really tough. It\'s doable, but it\'s<br>tough.<br><br>Finally, remember that you\'re not applying for \"college\" so much as<br>you\'re applying to become an Air Force officer. This is a completely<br>different type of college: you\'re signing up to become one of the<br>future leaders of the finest Air Force in the entire world. It is<br>definitely the greatest challenge you will ever undertake: you will push<br>yourself beyond what you think is possible. If that sounds a little<br>scary, it\'s because it is. Challenges are sometimes scary. The leaders<br>of character we need in the military are the ones who will push<br>themselves beyond what they think they can achieve to learn what they<br>really can achieve. Remember what Mark Twain said: \"Courage is<br>resistance to fear, mastery of fear, not absence of fear.\"<br><br>Keep fighting, and good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
