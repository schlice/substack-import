<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You remember Capt [[Chesley<br>Sullenberger](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8331dc&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesley_Sullenberger){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}? I always bring<br>[Sully(https://www.quora.com/topic/Chesley-Sullenberger)]{.qlink_container}<br>up as he is a fellow grad. Does it matter that Sully graduated the year<br>I turned 1? Nope, not a bit. Not to a grad, anyway.\<br>\<br>If you recall, US Airways Flight 1549 had both of its engines disabled<br>by striking a flock of Canada Geese on takeoff out of LaGuardia on<br>January 15, 2009. Capt Sullenberger successfully ditched his aircraft in<br>the Hudson River, saving all 155 passengers and crew aboard.\<br>\<br>Aircraft fuselages, engines, and windscreens are routinely tested to<br>withstand bird strikes using the \"[[Chicken<br>gun](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=42df39&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_gun){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}\" which fires whole, dead<br>chickens (preferrably not frozen) at aircraft windshields and engines,<br>as chickens have been found to accurately mimic the characteristics of a<br>bird strike by a live, fully-grown bird.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
