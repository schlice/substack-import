<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can sue anyone for anything. The question becomes how likely you'll<br>be to prevail.<br><br>And in this case, how likely you'll be to prevail depends greatly on<br>where you live, and whether or not the neighbor had a duty to prevent<br>the tree from falling in the first place. And that duty is dependent, at<br>least in Florida, on whether or not the tree was *alive*.<br><br>If the tree was alive when it fell on to the homeowner's property (i.e.<br>a hurricane came through and knocked the tree down), the homeowner is<br>responsible for his own damages. However, if the tree was dead and it<br>fell on to the homeowner's property, the homeowner where the tree was<br>located is responsible for the damages, as he had a duty to remove the<br>dead tree before it fell.<br><br>If a known hazard exists, it is in your best interest to notify the<br>homeowner of the hazard. A dead tree is just such a hazard. Even worse,<br>if you were the homeowner with the dead tree and you were notified that<br>a hazard existed and you did not fix it, it's likely that your insurance<br>carrier won't cover the claim either.<br><br>Please check with a lawyer in your jurisdiction to see if the same holds<br>true for you.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
