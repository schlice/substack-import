<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is an interesting philosophical Constitutional question. This<br>question came up just recently when President Trump created the US Space<br>Force. The same argument that was made when Trump created the Space<br>Force would hold true when the Air Force was created. Indeed, the<br>argument was made in the 50s when the Air Force was created, and the<br>same argument holds true today.<br><br>The "textualist" argument is based on the text in Article I, Section 8<br>of the Constitution. This text seems to give Congress the authority to<br>create an Army and Navy, but not an Air Force or a Space Force. However,<br>the Constitutional disagreement that holds the most water is the<br>"sufficiently distinct" argument. If the new military function is<br>"sufficiently distinct" from the conventional meaning of "army" and<br>"navy" in 1788, then Congress still wouldn't have the authority to<br>establish the new service, since Article I allows them to establish an<br>"army" and a "navy," and those military functions are "sufficiently<br>distinct" from the functions of an "air force" or a "space force."<br><br>However, the argument falls flat for a number of reasons, but the<br>primary reason is that if the Air Force is constitutional as part of the<br>Army (i.e. the Army flies helicopters), or if the Air Force is<br>constitutional as part of the Navy (i.e. the Navy flies carrier-based<br>aircraft), then the Air Force is constitutional if it is reorganized<br>into its own branch under the Necessary and Proper clause.<br><br>The other reason is that the text in Article I Section 8 seems more<br>intent on granting the power to create armed forces to a specific branch<br>of government than controlling exactly the armed forces that they can<br>create.<br><br>While no one has yet realistically argued that the Air Force or the<br>Space Force is unconstitutional, if you are a textualist, you may fall<br>into the camp which believes that the role of an "air force" or a "space<br>force" are sufficiently distinct from what we traditionally know as the<br>role of an army or the role of a navy, such that the Constitution did<br>not grant Congress the power to establish them. A Constitutional<br>amendment would need to be enacted if this question should need to be<br>addressed in the future, and that would take care of this argument<br>completely.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How then does the Constitution allow for the US Air Force?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
