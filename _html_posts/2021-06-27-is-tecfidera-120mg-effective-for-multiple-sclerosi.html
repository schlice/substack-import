<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>That's the starting dose for the drug: 120mg twice a day. After a week,<br>the drug gets bumped up to its maintenance dose: 240mg twice a day.<br><br>That said, temporary reductions of the dose down to the starting 120mg<br>may be considered for patients who can't tolerate the maintenance dose.<br>You'd run the 120mg dose for a week and then return back to the 240mg<br>dose. And if you can't stay on the 240mg dose, it's recommended that you<br>switch to another medication.<br><br>This should tell you one important thing: **staying on the 120mg dose<br>twice a day is not recommended because it is not as effective as the<br>maintenance dose.**<br><br>In other words, if you can't tolerate the 240mg dose (and if you can't,<br>you're not alone: close to 40% of people stopped taking Tecfidera<br>because of impactful side-effects), you should consider one of the other<br>MS therapy drugs. Talk to your neurologist about everything you are<br>experiencing while taking Tecfidera, and if you are unable to tolerate<br>the maintenance dose, perhaps together you can find an alternative<br>therapy.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Is Tecfidera 120mg effective for multiple sclerosis?<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
