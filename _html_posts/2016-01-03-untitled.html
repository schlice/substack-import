<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [The founding fathers saw much technological advance<br>throughout their lifetimes. They watched warfare progress from the rock<br>to the stick to the sharpened stick, the spear, the bow and arrow, then<br>on to the sword and knife, and finally to a musket and rifle.\<br>\<br>The first \"Gatling\" gun was even being invented around this time.\<br>\<br>So to say that it is inconceivable that the founding fathers could not<br>have seen technological progress occurring is far from correct.\<br>\<br>What they did do to overcome that issue was to say that the people<br>have the right to keep and bear the same types of weapons that the<br>military uses.\<br>\<br>Today, the military uses far more advanced weapons than civilians can<br>use for legitimate purposes, because smart people saw that coming and<br>addressed it.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-historical-context-in-which-the-right-to-bear-arms-was-introduced-in-the-American-Constitution-Is-that-context-still-valid-today/answer/Rob-612<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
