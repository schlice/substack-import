<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You've heard already about "attractive nuisance" statutes which require<br>that you take reasonable steps to secure your nuisance, be it a swimming<br>pool or a trampoline.<br><br>It's important to note that you can successfully defend against a<br>liability lawsuit if you have actually taken those reasonable steps to<br>secure your trampoline. If you erected the appropriate 6-foot privacy<br>fence around your yard, and you installed appropriate warning signs,<br>whatever is required by your locality, and they were all in good repair,<br>you stand a good chance of being able to prevail in such a suit.<br><br>The court will look at what a reasonable person would do in order to<br>secure a yard with a trampoline, as well as local ordinances for<br>securing "attractive nuisances," and your liability will be reduced<br>based on how far you went to do so.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
