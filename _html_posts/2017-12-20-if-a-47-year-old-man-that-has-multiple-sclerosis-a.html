<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a 47-year-old man that has multiple sclerosis, and smokes marijuana<br>everyday several times a day and night while on several MS medications<br>be a part of the reason that his symptoms are getting worse?**<br><br>Medical cannabis is not a disease modifying drug. It does not slow down<br>the progression of the disease, and it does not reduce the severity,<br>duration, or frequency of MS relapses.<br><br>What medical cannabis does do for MS patients is reduce neurological<br>pain better than any prescription pain medicine on the market. For those<br>MS patients who struggle with neurological pain (i.e. pain caused by<br>faulty nerves, not by any physical condition), cannabis can be extremely<br>helpful without all of the toxic side effects of today's high-test pain<br>medicines like Oxycontin.<br><br>I do question what "several MS medications" means. I assume it means a<br>disease modifying drug and other meds to counter side effects, but I'm<br>just taking a guess.<br><br>If I were the physician, I'd focus on the particular disease modifying<br>drug, as it's fairly clear that it is not working. It would be time to<br>take a different tack.<br><br>I would tell this 47-year old man that he should talk to his neurologist<br>about changing his disease modifying drug to something else, as this one<br>doesn't seem to be working.<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
