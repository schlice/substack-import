<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is the iPhone Xs Max better than Samsung S9 or Note 9?<br><br>The short answer is "it depends."<br><br>"Better" is a matter of opinion. So what is better to one person may not<br>be better to someone else.<br><br>To me, better falls into two categories: comparisons of specs on paper,<br>and how those specs translate into real-world performance.<br><br>On paper, some of the specs in the Xs Max are certainly better than<br>what's found in the Note 9. The processor is the big story here: the 7<br>nm production process creating the A12 Bionic chip is so far the best on<br>paper in the industry. The cameras are, on paper, really good, but not<br>much better than the X. The display is also really good, but better than<br>the Note 9? On paper, it's pretty much a wash.<br><br>As far as "how the paper specs translate into real world performance,"<br>that remains to be seen. People are going to have to start getting them<br>"in-hand" and doing some real-world comparison analyses to really see if<br>that "on-paper" spec translates into a better real-world performance<br>bump.<br><br>I suggest watching some of the more well-known YouTube tech vloggers<br>such as [[Marques<br>Brownlee](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f95fe7&url=https://www.youtube.com/user/marquesbrownlee){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="youtube.com"}]{.qlink_container}, [[Linus<br>Sebastian](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=15705d&url=https://www.youtube.com/user/LinusTechTips){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="youtube.com"}]{.qlink_container}, and [[Lewis<br>Hilsenteger](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1f2b69&url=https://www.youtube.com/user/unboxtherapy){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="youtube.com"}]{.qlink_container} to see what they have to<br>say when they start getting devices in-hand. Lew [[already has a<br>video](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eeba90&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DRQIG7XYqkK8){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="youtube.com"}]{.qlink_container} up about the release, and I<br>bet he's talking about this very topic. I haven't even seen that one<br>yet.<br><br>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eeba90&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DRQIG7XYqkK8){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="youtube.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
