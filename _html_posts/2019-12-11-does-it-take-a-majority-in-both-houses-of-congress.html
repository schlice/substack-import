You<br>would think that this would be enough to dissuade a rogue House from<br>filing a biased, one-sided, partisan impeachment, but when you want to<br>use impeachment as an election ploy instead of to combat high crimes and<br>misdemeanors, facts don't matter.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
