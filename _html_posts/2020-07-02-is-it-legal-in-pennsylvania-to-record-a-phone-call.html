<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is it legal in Pennsylvania to record a phone call that does not<br>include the other persons consent, BUT it does not record their voice?<br>In other words, only my side of the conversation is audible.**<br><br>*(NOTE: IANAL and this is not legal advice)*<br><br>Since you are only recording yourself, you're not really recording a<br>phone call. Recording a phone call implies that you record both sides to<br>the conversation. So in my opinion, this recording would be just fine,<br>as long as you cannot hear the other party on the recording.<br><br>Do be aware however that Pennsylvania is an "all-party" state. In order<br>to record a phone call, all parties to the call must be aware and agree<br>to the recording.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is legal information, not legal advice.

If you ignore this warning and convey confidential<br>information in a private message or comment, there is no duty to keep<br>that information confidential or to forego representation adverse to<br>your interests.

Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously.

If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually,<br>you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment.<br>Put anything vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be<br>followed by a block and a mute. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
