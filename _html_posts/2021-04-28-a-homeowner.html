<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>An HOA cannot operate on expired covenants. If the covenants have truly<br>expired (which I highly question), then the HOA no longer exists. The<br>covenants are what gives the HOA authority.<br><br>However, laws are time-dependent. If you violated the rules while the<br>rules existed, the violation is still valid and can still be collected<br>against. The HOA still has to settle its debts and perform closeout<br>operations (like disposing of community property and transferring<br>control of insurance policies), and it has budgeted for those funds to<br>do that. So yes, if you incurred the debt while the HOA was still<br>active, there is a better than average chance that you have to pay the<br>debt.<br><br>I highly doubt that a covenants would simply expire. Perhaps the HOA was<br>designed to run for a fixed period of time and then dissolution<br>processes would begin, but it's not like the HOA magically disappears.<br>As I mentioned, there are still closeout operations which would need to<br>take place. Without seeing your governing documents, we can't say<br>specifically.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>A homeowner\'s association operating on expired covenants has sent me a<br>bill for past due dues. To repeat, the covenants are expired. What do I<br>do with the bill?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
