<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [The law does not allow sentencing guidelines to be<br>dictated or influenced by the prison system. The prison system is not a<br>party to the decisions made by judges or juries when determining<br>sentencing.\<br>\<br>And most prisons in the United States are run by the government. There<br>are some prisons which take over the sentences of certain long-term<br>prisoners, and they do this under contract with a state. The terms of<br>the contract determine which prisoners get sent to private prisons, not<br>decisions by judges or juries.\<br>\<br>If you feel that private prisons create more prisoners, feel free to<br>lobby your state\'s lawmakers and repeal the law which allows for<br>private prisons in your state.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
