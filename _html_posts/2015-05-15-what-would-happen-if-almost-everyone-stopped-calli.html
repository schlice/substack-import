<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Cops would get really bored.\<br>\<br>Since there were no more calls for service, cops could focus more on<br>traffic infractions (yeah, that sounds like the outcome you were after),<br>and beneficially, community-oriented policing. We could definitely<br>reduce the number of patrols on the streets, reducing the number of paid<br>officers on the staff.\<br>\<br>Insurance claims would be very difficult to adjudicate. Without police<br>reports, insurance companies won\'t know the \"documented\" facts about<br>what happened, and insurance would become far more expensive to have and<br>to use, since insurance companies would have to do their own<br>investigations to determine what happened, and the results will always<br>be in their own best interests, not yours.\<br>\<br>And probably the biggest issue if people simply stop calling the police:<br>crime would dramatically increase because there\'s no chance of me being<br>caught and punished for my crime. As long as I can get away from you,<br>I\'m off scot-free. With no threat of police investigations following<br>me, no threat of crime scene analysis, no ballistics testing, etc., all<br>I have to do is kill you (and any other witnesses) and I\'m good to go.\<br>\<br>You would also see an increase in street justice. Didn\'t like the rough<br>ride Freddie Gray may have had? Maybe you shouldn\'t stop calling the<br>police, because that will become the way we deal with criminals. When<br>there are no jails to which we can send bad guys, we deal with them the<br>old-fashioned way: a lead pipe and a rough ride.\<br>\<br>Ultimately, organized crime would flourish, as gangs of organized<br>criminals would take over the policing of neighborhoods, charging<br>\"protection fees\" to all of the residents, who would either pay or be<br>subject to the same treatment as the criminals. You wouldn\'t have the<br>option to \*not\* call your local protectorate, as they would be there<br>patrolling your streets whether you liked it or not.\<br>\<br>The police would be back, but they wouldn\'t be government<br>organizations, they would be organized crime. You\'d have no choice but<br>to do what they said, when they said it, and they would be too powerful<br>for anyone to stop.\<br>\<br>Now, if the police were still around, and they decided to try to stop<br>this, you\'d have all-out war on your hands.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
