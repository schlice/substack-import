<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should police body cam footage be considered a matter of public<br>record?**<br><br>It already is, with caveats. As with any information collected by a<br>government agency, body camera footage can be retrieved under the<br>Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Note that all departments have<br>different retention requirements based on the laws in that locality and<br>the regulations in the department. If you want to get body camera<br>footage, it's best to make your request as soon as you can, otherwise<br>you risk the footage being deleted.<br><br>For non-evidentiary camera footage, you can submit a FOIA request to the<br>department to retrieve the footage from a specific officer during a<br>specific interaction on a specific day. Evidentiary footage is sealed<br>until the trial is over and the District Attorney's office releases that<br>evidence back into storage, at which time a FOIA request should be<br>sufficient to release it.<br><br>It is not "public record" in the sense that all footage should be posted<br>to a public website all the time, nor should it be. There is plenty of<br>sensitive information that would be captured on body cameras which even<br>you would probably not want circulating on the Internet. That said, a<br>record of who retrieves what information should be kept, and submitting<br>a FOIA request to the department is sufficient for that purpose. In<br>other words, you can take it, but if it ends up on YouTube, we want to<br>know who it was who started that ball rolling.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
