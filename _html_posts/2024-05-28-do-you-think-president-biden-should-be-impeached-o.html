<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer is yes.<br><br>The reason is that Democrats have *weakened the process of impeachment*<br>by taking it from what it was traditionally (only for high crimes and<br>misdemeanors, and generally only when there was at least some consensus<br>in the House) and turning it into a political spectacle that only one<br>side of the aisle is able to effect on a president. It should continue<br>to be used that way, in a "shoe-on-the-other-foot" scenario.<br><br>Democrats rarely think of what happens when the shoe is on the other<br>foot, like when they reduced the requirement from a supermajority to a<br>simple majority to appoint Federal judges. Republicans warned that this<br>would come around to bite them, and it did when Republicans expanded<br>that rule change to include SCOTUS judges under McConnell.<br><br>They should be reminded that what is good for the goose is also good for<br>the gander.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
