<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, absolutely. Not only does the public believe this, but the police<br>do, too.<br><br>If the police are required to wear body cameras and to film every<br>interaction they have with the public, the public rightly should have<br>the same freedom to do so.<br><br>The line is, as you mentioned, drawn when the recorder gets too close to<br>a police activity in the name of "freedom to film". You can't interfere<br>with police activities, and if a cop tells you to move back, move back.<br><br>Now, if a cop tells you to stop recording, you do it but take your<br>recording to a lawyer, or your nearest ACLU branch.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
