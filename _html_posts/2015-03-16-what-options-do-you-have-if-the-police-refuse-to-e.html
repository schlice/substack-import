<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *The particular example I am thinking of is a climbing gym that caters<br>> to children. A marajuana store opened next door and they have tons of<br>> problems with potheads - there is a law about minimum distance from<br>> child centered activities but the police won\'t enforce it.*<br><br>For this example, the police do not generally handle that situation.<br><br>If the store was approved by the zoning commission, this is the group<br>with which you must start your complaint. If the zoning commission<br>approved the store in violation of the law, you can then file with the<br>court for an injunction against the store, claiming that the zoning<br>commission unlawfully approved the location of the store.<br><br>It\'s possible that the zoning commission knew of the law and chose to<br>allow the store anyway. If they did not process a waiver for the store,<br>you can absolutely file for injunctive relief. If the zoning commission<br>did process a waiver, then the store is allowed despite the law.<br><br>The commission may have also evaluated the business next door and found<br>that it didn\'t meet the standard for a \"child-centered activity\" as<br>defined by the law.<br><br>Regardless, you have to start with the city zoning commission and find<br>out why they approved the store in that location.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
