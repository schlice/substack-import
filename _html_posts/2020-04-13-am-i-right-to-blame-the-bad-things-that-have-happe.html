<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Am I right to blame the bad things that have happened to me on God?<br><br>I dunno, let's see what you could actually be blaming God for, and<br>whether or not those arguments make sense.<br><br>I suppose you could make the argument that **since God created the<br>universe, he also created the conditions that allowed the bad things to<br>happen to you, so you could rightly blame God for creating a universe<br>which contains bad things.**<br><br>But what is good without bad? In order for something to be "good," it<br>needs to be better than something else, which you would objectively<br>quantify as "bad." It's really hard to have "good" when there is nothing<br>against which to compare it. Without bad, you don't have good.<br><br>Remember, God created a universe which allows you to exercise *free<br>will*. For example, how can you have real love without the possibility<br>of having evil? If God created love without evil, then you have no<br>choice in love. God knows that in a world where free will exists, there<br>will be evil. But that's also where you get real love. Real love<br>involves an active choice of love over evil. The same calculus is taken<br>when people ask the question, "why doesn't God just come down from<br>Heaven on a big cloud and make himself visible to everyone?" Well,<br>besides the fact that he already has done this in the person of Jesus,<br>if he were to make himself simply visible to everyone such that none<br>could deny his existence, anyone who did not follow him would simply be<br>stupid. I mean, *he's right there*. This, too, would virtually eliminate<br>free will. God wants you to *choose* to follow him, and in order to<br>*choose*, you have to have a choice between following him, or not.<br>Having him announce with neon signs his presence would eliminate not<br>following him as a viable choice, thus denying free will. Don't forget<br>the story of the disciple Thomas, who after the resurrection refused to<br>believe that Jesus was alive until he actually put his fingers through<br>the nail holes in his hands and put his hand into Jesus' side where the<br>centurion's sword pierced him. I know, a little morbid, but Thomas<br>required proof, just like those who believe that God should also remove<br>free will and get rid of anything bad in the world. Jesus obliged Thomas<br>(who did believe after he saw), but then he said, "blessed are those who<br>have not seen, and have believed." (John 20:29)<br><br>You could also blame God for **not preventing the bad things that happen<br>to you.** I mean, he is all powerful, right? Why didn't he walk along in<br>front of you with his great cosmic broom, sweeping away all of the bad<br>things that could possibly happen to you?<br><br>I answer that question with another question: *where in the world did<br>you get the idea that this is what God is supposed to do?* The Bible<br>doesn't say that Christians are guaranteed a carefree life. In fact, it<br>tells us exactly the opposite. "In this world, you will have trouble.<br>But take heart! I have overcome the world." (John 16:33)<br><br>While we don't have a handle on God's plan for us, or how our lives fit<br>God's plan for the world, we can rest assured that God keeps his<br>promises. The Bible is full of examples of God making promises and<br>fulfilling all of them. God has also promised us that if we love him and<br>follow him, he will raise us up on the last day and we will be with him<br>for all eternity. We have no reason to doubt that he will keep that<br>promise, either. He sent his son to die for our sins so that we have the<br>means to achieve that end. *That* is commitment to keeping your<br>promises, if you ask me.<br><br>So are you *right* to blame God for the bad things in your life? If you<br>are "blaming" God by saying that he created a universe which has bad in<br>it, go right ahead, blame him for that. That was his choice. The fact<br>that evil exists means that he gave you choices as well. If you're<br>blaming God for not *preventing* bad things from happening to you, I'd<br>say that's wrong. There is no basis for the belief that God would<br>prevent bad things from happening to you, so blaming him for not doing<br>something that no one ever said he would do just seems a little silly to<br>me.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
