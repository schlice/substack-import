Use the<br>resources at the top of the answer section to contact someone who you<br>can talk to.<br><br>Most folks mentioned that you should talk to your parents, or at lest<br>try to. The link that [[Gauri<br>K](https://www.quora.com/profile/Gauri-K-27)]{.qlink_container} posted<br>is an excellent resource about talking to your parents about depression.<br><br>If that doesn't work, try talking to a teacher you trust, or a coach, or<br>a school counselor. If you have any close friends, you could even try<br>talking to their parents.<br><br>The bottom line: try talking to your parents. Use the resources on that<br>page to help. If that doesn't work, find someone else you trust to talk<br>to, but *please* talk to someone.<br><br>Depression is a vicious circle. It feeds on itself and makes itself<br>worse. It is a cycle which is very difficult to get out of on your own.<br>Needing help for depression is not a bad thing, and it doesn't make you<br>a bad person. You are a better person than most in your situation<br>because you recognize that you need help, and that's the first step.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
