<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>False premise.<br><br>COVID-19 variants will not become *infinitely more infectious*. They<br>will, as all viruses do, become more *virulent* (which means they are<br>easier to pass on), but less *deadly* (which means...er...less deadly).<br><br>But there is always a physical limit. They still only survive outside<br>the body for a limited amount of time, so they still are only effective<br>as airborne viruses within close proximity to other people.<br><br>And there is a lot to be said for *viral load*, which determines whether<br>you received a large enough dose of the virus to actually induce an<br>infection.<br><br>So unless people are coming up yo your house and coughing on cracks in<br>your home, there's little chance that you aren't safe inside your home.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>With covid-19 variants becoming infinitely more infectious and<br>contagious will covid-19 eventually be able to seep in and out of<br>people\'s homes through open windows and cracks in people\'s homes? How<br>would this affect the efficacy of lockdowns?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
