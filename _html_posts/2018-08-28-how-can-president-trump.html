<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can President Trump\'s new proposal to limit legal immigrants from<br>becoming US citizens pass Congress or the Supreme Court?**<br><br>First of all, a rule change that the Executive makes to an Executive<br>program does not get reviewed by Congress. Congress is certainly free to<br>change the law that the Executive is implementing, and the President is<br>certainly free to veto the change to the law if he chooses.<br><br>In order for the Supreme Court to "review" a rule change (presumably on<br>Constitutional grounds), someone has to be affected by the rule change<br>and file a lawsuit which would have to be appealed to the Supreme Court.<br><br>I assume that you're asking about the expansion to the "public charge"<br>portion of immigration policy.<br><br>Previously, only the use of certain programs like Social Security<br>Insurance (SSI) have hindered immigrants from obtaining permanent<br>resident status. The new proposal would expand that list of programs to<br>include Obamacare, children\'s health insurance, food stamps and more<br>government benefit services.<br><br>From your link (emphasis mine):<br><br>> *Inadmissibility based on the public charge ground is determined by<br>> the totality of the circumstances. This means that the adjudicating<br>> officer must weigh both the positive and negative factors when<br>> determining the likelihood that someone might become a public charge.*<br>><br>> \...\<br>><br>> *In assessing the totality of the circumstances, including the<br>> statutory factors above, an officer may consider the individual's<br>> receipt of certain publicly funded benefits. Not all publicly funded<br>> benefits are relevant to deciding whether someone is likely to become<br>> a public charge. When determining whether someone is likely to become<br>> a public charge, USCIS will consider whether the individual is likely<br>> to become primarily dependent on the government for subsistence as<br>> demonstrated by* ***either the receipt of public cash assistance for<br>> income maintenance or institutionalization for long-term care at<br>> government expense.*** *Short-term institutionalization for<br>> rehabilitation is not subject to public charge consideration under<br>> existing field guidance.*<br><br>It is the section I bolded above which will be changing. Instead of just<br>the receipt of public cash assistance or "institutionalization for<br>long-term care at government expense" (which is SSI), this list of<br>government services considered will be expanded.<br><br>Remember: the whole point of this exercise is to determine whether or<br>not someone will become a "public charge," or "primarily dependent on<br>the government for subsistence." Since our list of government<br>subsistence programs is ever-expanding, it only makes sense to expand<br>the list of government programs we use to determine whether or not<br>someone will be primarily dependent on the government for subsistence.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
