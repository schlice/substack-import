<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are a million different things that can cause muscle weakness,<br>especially weakness that is concentrated in a certain part of your body<br>(i.e. your legs). We\'d probably run into some sort of Quora character<br>limit if we tried to review them all now.<br><br>If I were you, I would make an appointment with my primary care doctor<br>if this is something worrying to you. You and he can order some tests to<br>figure out what\'s going on, or at least point you in the right<br>direction.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
