<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**The more time you spend in the Word and in communion with Him, the<br>less likely you will be to sin.**<br><br>There really isn't a more complex way to put it. As you grow in your<br>faith, those desires for sinful acts will fade. It's not like a light<br>switch; they don't just turn off. But they do fade. The love of God<br>overpowers the lust for sin, every time. The process may be gradual, but<br>it is continuous. It's part of what we call *sanctification*, the<br>gradual process God uses to improve believers over time.<br><br>In other words, *Don't worry, it gets better.*<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>How does a person\'s spiritual health impact their tendency towards<br>certain sins?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
