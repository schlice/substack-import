<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If the easement is written into the Governing Documents of the HOA, the<br>HOA can enforce it.<br><br>I can probably safely assume that we're not talking about a utility<br>easement (because that's between the homeowner and the utility<br>provider), so we're either talking about a private easement or a<br>prescriptive easement. Since you said it's in the Governing Docs, it's<br>probably not an easement by necessity, so it is most likely a private<br>easement.<br><br>If it is a private easement imposed on each homeowner by the HOA, then<br>it's up to the HOA to enforce. So you can either sue the HOA to force<br>them to enforce the easement, or you can sue the neighbor to force her<br>to grant you access to the easement as listed in the Governing<br>Documents.<br><br>Alternatively, you can ignore the lot of them and continue to use the<br>easement, and then cite the easement if she files trespassing charges<br>against you.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**Can a Homeowners Association enforce an easement written on the HOA<br>CC&Rs? I\'m asking because HOA won\'t enforce the easement. I was told<br>it\'s a neighbor\'s issue and to take my neighbor to court since she<br>doesn\'t allow me entrance to the easement.**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
