<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It doesn\'t matter what I think. I don\'t live in Alabama.<br><br>The only people for whom Alabama\'s laws should matter are the people<br>who live in Alabama.<br><br>And clearly, the majority of people have voted for elected officials who<br>believe that no exceptions for rape or incest should be provided.<br><br>I\'m sure that not everyone in Alabama believes that there should not be<br>any exceptions for rape or incest. But enough people do believe it that<br>they were able to send officials to their state legislature who could<br>pass such laws.<br><br>Clearly, I think you can see that Alabama values life to such a degree<br>that they believe that the right to life of the baby trumps the right to<br>bodily autonomy of the mother.<br><br>I guess the women of Alabama who are raped will have to take advantage<br>of their Safe Haven laws. All 50 states have them. And, if you can\'t<br>have a baby, then clearly Alabama is the state to go, because they\'re<br>going to have lots of extra babies put up for adoption. That\'s good,<br>because the amount of people waiting to adopt a baby in the United<br>States outnumber the amount of babies available for adoption by a factor<br>of 24 to 1. So it looks like Alabama is going to provide a lot of<br>healthy babies to families that want to adopt.<br><br>I hope that Alabama strengthened their prenatal health care support at<br>the same time. If I were writing such a strict law, I would make sure<br>that all pregnant women have the ability to receive full prenatal health<br>care, at the expense of the state, for their entire pregnancy term. The<br>vast majority of medical conditions which threaten the life of a<br>pregnant woman can be mitigated with good prenatal health care.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
