<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>1.  Make sure you understand what you are doing. You are<br>    circumventing some of the security measures Samsung placed on the<br>    device to protect the operating system from malicious software or<br>    processes. Do not proceed unless you have a specific reason to do<br>    so. If you screw up the rooting process, you might be left with a<br>    phone which will not boot. That is called "bricking" your phone, as<br>    it becomes nothing more than a very expensive paper weight. Read<br>    through the instructions, understand them, and *then* begin the<br>    process.<br>2.  Rooting will void your warranty. There is a hardware "fuse" in<br>    the phone which is tripped when the phone is loaded with a<br>    non-standard kernel. You will see it listed on rooting websites as<br>    "tripping Knox" since it is the Samsung KNOX software which makes<br>    use of that fuse. Once that fuse is tripped, your warranty is void.<br>    You cannot return the handset for replacement under warranty. So if<br>    your 1-year manufacturer warranty has not yet expired, I would<br>    strongly suggest not rooting your phone.<br>3.  There are great tutorials on the Web for how to root your phone. The<br>    easiest way to root your phone is to use a utility by a developer<br>    called "Chainfire." He makes the most popular SU (superuser) binary<br>    for Android phones, SuperSU. He also produces a package called<br>    "CF-Auto-Root" which automates as much of the rooting process as you<br>    can. [[Here is one<br>    tutorial](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=acbb50&url=http://www.how2root.net/11/how-to-root-samsung-galaxy-j3-2016){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="how2root.net"}]{.qlink_container} you can follow to<br>    employ CF-Auto-Root to root your J3.
