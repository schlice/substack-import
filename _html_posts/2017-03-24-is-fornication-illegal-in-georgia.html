<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Fornication is not illegal anywhere in the United States.<br><br>There are laws surrounding certain categories of fornication, and those<br>laws pertain to the age of the participants. In most places in the<br>United States, the *age of consent* is 18. Having sex when one<br>participant is below the age of consent is a crime called **statutory<br>rape**.<br><br>Several states have conditions on their statutory rape laws called<br>close-in-age laws. These laws state that if the two participants are<br>"close in age" to each other, the statutory rape law does not apply. For<br>example, a 19 year old having sex with a 17 year old. The idea behind<br>these laws is that it is more abhorrent for a 40 year old to have sex<br>with a 17 year old than it is for a 19 year old to have sex with a 17<br>year old. This is not true in every state, and not all states have<br>close-in-age laws, so check your local laws if anyone might be under 18.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
