Good thing they won\'t have more money to spend.\<br>\<br>Look, I really don\'t have time to debate this with you today, but<br>you\'ve got such a terrible view of people and businesses that you\'d<br>throw away an opportunity to increase the flow of money to the<br>government because you need a more oppressive tax system because you<br>fear everything, from tax cheats to people no longer buying milk because<br>the price went up.\<br>\<br>This is exactly the reason that we can never make real progress in this<br>country.\<br>\<br>Sorry, it just saddens me.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-strongest-arguments-against-illegal-immigration-in-the-United-States/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
