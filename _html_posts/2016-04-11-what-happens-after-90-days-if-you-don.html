<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Simple: they will come by and pick up the item. What you already paid is<br>then applied to the item when you\'re ready to start paying again. So<br>there\'s really no reason to stop paying and not return the item, which<br>would clearly be a violation of the rental agreement. It\'s in their<br>[FAQs(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e1bf8e&url=https://www.rentacenter.com/how-rac-works/faqs){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="rentacenter.com"}]{.qlink_container}:<br><br>> **What if I need to return an item or I can no longer make my<br>> payments?**<br>><br>> Unforeseen things happen, and Rent-A-Center understands. At any time,<br>> you can return your product and simply freeze your payments. Then when<br>> you're ready, you have the freedom to come back and get the same or<br>> comparable item, and pick up your payments right where you left off.<br>> Every payment you make at Rent-A-Center is fully protected.<br><br>If you don\'t pay and you don\'t return the item, then the entire amount<br>of the item becomes due, and is sent to collections. To be honest, I\'m<br>not sure when exactly that occurs, but it will be in your rental<br>contract.<br><br>They have lots of different ways to buy, three, to be exact. You can buy<br>the item outright, you can do a 90-days-same-as-cash, or you can do a<br>rental agreement where you rent the item and return it at the end of the<br>rental period, or a rental agreement where you purchase the item at the<br>end of the rental period.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
