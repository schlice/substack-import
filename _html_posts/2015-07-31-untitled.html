<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [Here\'s one article that talks about the tort of **public<br>disclosure of private facts**. While not a cause of action in all<br>states, it definitely is in some.\<br>\<br>[[Publishing highly personal and embarrassing information about another,<br>even if completely<br>true](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=caee70&url=https://www.rcfp.org/browse-media-law-resources/digital-journalists-legal-guide/publishing-highly-personal-and-embarrassi){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="rcfp.org"}]{.qlink_container}\<br>\<br>And as I mentioned earlier, I\'m not referring to photos taken in an<br>ostensibly public place but where people have a reasonable expectation<br>of privacy. I gave the example of the public bathroom. The room is open<br>to the public, so it is a public space. But there is a reasonable<br>expectation of privacy in a bathroom, so you can\'t take pictures inside<br>a bathroom and publish them.\<br>\<br>Similarly, there is a reasonable expectation of privacy inside a public<br>AA meeting, and so you can\'t take pictures there<br>either.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-it-against-the-law-to-take-a-picture-of-a-female-butt-in-public-at-a-distance/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
