<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>An excellent question! Time for a history lesson.<br><br>So marriage has existed for a very, very long time. The first recorded<br>evidence of marriage ceremonies dates back to about 2350 B.C. in<br>Mesopotamia. Over the next several hundred years, marriage became a<br>widespread institution embraced by the ancient Hebrews, Greeks, and<br>Romans.<br><br>In other words, marriage started as a religious institution. As you<br>noted, "marriages" are performed by a religious figure in a religious<br>building as part of a religious ceremony. According to the Genesis<br>creation account, God instituted marriage after the creation of the<br>first woman, Eve, from Adam, the first man. The first marriage was based<br>on a covenant promise.<br><br>So why is the state involved?<br><br>In the United States, the federal government formally recognized<br>marriage in law for the first time with the passage of the Revenue Act<br>of 1913. In 1929, all states had laws regarding marriage licenses. In<br>1933, married women were granted the right to citizenship independent of<br>their husbands.<br><br>The state, in the early 1900s, started licensing and regulating<br>marriage. They also started performing "marriage" ceremonies of their<br>own, without a church involved.<br><br>So again, why does the state care what churches do? Why does the state<br>have to *sanction* a church function?<br><br>There is one overarching reason why states license marriage: **sex<br>between men and women regularly produces children.** The reason why<br>states care about marriage is because of its generativity. The state<br>licenses married couples because it provides an easy way to determine<br>who the parents of children are. The state has a compelling interest in<br>ensuring that children have well-known and easily recognized parents,<br>and even today, most children are born to people who are, indeed,<br>married.<br><br>Once a child is born, if the parents are married, the state *assumes*<br>that the married couple are the biological parents of that child. They<br>are called the "presumptive parents." The only way we can conclusively<br>determine who a parent is is for a person to claim that they are the<br>child's parent, or for one of the presumptive parents to claim that they<br>are not the child's parent, and then blood tests ensue. The paradigm of<br>presumptive parents eliminates the need to do blood tests every time a<br>child is born in order to establish parental identity. State-sanctioned<br>marriage provides this.<br><br>\<br><br>So now that we know why the state stuck its nose into, and co-opted, the<br>religious institution of marriage, we can look at your question.<br><br>You said "Since religion is the real source of marriage (a religious<br>person performs the ceremony in a religious place as part of a religious<br>ceremony), how do you get to say that homosexuals can't marry?" Well,<br>the answer is obvious. Since it's a religious ceremony, the church in<br>question gets to make its own rules. If that church says that<br>homosexuals cannot marry, then they can't. It's that simple.ยน<br><br>Maybe you were asking why *religious people* tell homosexuals that they<br>shouldn't get married *outside of a church*. In other words, maybe<br>you're saying that religious people will frequently say that marriage<br>doesn't make sense for homosexuals.<br><br>And if you look at the (very basic outlined) history of marriage I gave<br>above, you'd see that the state's interest in marriage has to do with<br>children being produced by sex between men and women.<br><br>***This is a very specific issue which is not something that homosexual<br>couples have to worry about.***<br><br>Therefore, marriage, in a civil sense, makes no sense to the homosexual<br>couple.<br><br>More importantly, allowing homosexuals to marry, when the institution of<br>marriage doesn't make sense for them, tells the world that marriage is<br>less about the needs of children and more about **the desires of<br>adults**.<br><br>Marriage isn't about recognizing loving relationships. The state has no<br>compelling interest in recognizing any relationship, let alone loving<br>ones. If this were the case, then there are plenty of relationships<br>which should also qualify for marriage that currently do not.<br><br>Marriage isn't even about raising children. Because if that's the case,<br>there are plenty of other family arrangements in which children are<br>being raised in which marriage should be applied, and it is not.<br><br>I will say that the states attached a lot of benefits to marriage in<br>order to encourage adults to structure their lives in such a way as to<br>benefit children (who, as we already said, they have an interest in<br>ensuring are cared for). To that end, marriage is an easy way for<br>homosexual couples to gain those benefits too, especially if they adopt<br>children.<br><br>Marriage is about generativity, when men and women have sex and create<br>children. The marriage helps the state presume who the parents of that<br>child are, and homosexuals never have that problem. Adopting a child<br>automatically indicates the "parents" of that child. But for born<br>children, marriage facilitates determining parental lineage.<br><br>\<br><br>ยน Some churches do allow homosexuals to marry. See the United Church of<br>Christ.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
