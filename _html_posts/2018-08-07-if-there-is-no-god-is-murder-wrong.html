<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If there is no God, is murder wrong?<br><br>This is an excellent question, as it raises the point about the source<br>of morality.<br><br>First of all, the existence of God does not change the laws of man, so<br>murder would still be illegal even if God did not exist. Therefore, if<br>you think it's wrong to break a law, then murder would be wrong because<br>it was illegal.<br><br>So let's move past the legal issues here.<br><br>We must be talking about morality, since if God doesn't exist, there is<br>no source of morality. **Without a morals-giver, morals are<br>self-referential.**<br><br>You could argue that people have evolved to have a moral code, but there<br>is no purpose for morals which aids my personal survival. Morals don't<br>help me survive. They don't get me food or shelter or drive my<br>reproductive urges. Therefore, the morals must come from somewhere.<br><br>But where do they come from?<br><br>That moral code did not come from the universe, since the Law of<br>Causation says that an effect must resemble its cause. How can a<br>purposeful, moral, full-of-meaning person come from a random, amoral and<br>meaningless universe?<br><br>That moral code did not come from a social contract; i.e. a group's<br>ideas about right and wrong. That presupposes that morals are not<br>universal, but decided by group ideas. What if a group thought that<br>murder was perfectly fine if it advanced your own personal survival?<br>What if, in order to survive, I needed your food, and I killed you to<br>get it, and there was a society that thought that this was okay? Would<br>murder be wrong then? To that society, it would not be wrong.<br><br>You could also argue, as<br>[User-11129036036781446904(https://www.quora.com/profile/User-11129036036781446904)]{.qlink_container}<br>does, that because murder causes suffering, that murder is inherently<br>wrong. If causing suffering is wrong, there has to be a reason. There<br>has to be a moral code which informs us that causing others to suffer is<br>wrong. But again, where does this moral code come from? Without a giver<br>of morality, we have no ideas about suffering or murder within us. We<br>have no inborn moral code. We don't all "just know" that murder is<br>wrong. Someone must "imprint" that moral code within us. That someone is<br>God.<br><br>Therefore, without God, there is no moral code imprinted in us before<br>we're born. There is no idea of good or evil. There is just existence.<br>Survival of the fittest. A prohibition on murder does not help me<br>survive if I need what you have, so it's no more wrong to murder a<br>person as it is to murder a cow in order to survive.<br><br>Therefore, if there is no God, murder is not wrong.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
