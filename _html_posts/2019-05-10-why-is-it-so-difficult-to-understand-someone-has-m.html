<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Why is it so difficult to understand someone has MS?<br><br>There are a few reasons for this.<br><br>MS is a very difficult disease to diagnose. We have really good<br>diagnostic tools today, but there is nothing specific in the disease<br>that conclusively says that you have MS. There's no biomarker in a blood<br>test that will positively show you have it. Diagnosing MS is as much an<br>art as it is a science.<br><br>Also, people with MS live with this awful dichotomy of how good you look<br>on the outside as opposed to how bad you feel on the inside. Unless<br>you're walking with assistance, or in a wheelchair (which is rare in<br>MS), it's virtually impossible to tell that someone has it without them<br>telling you. Or even better is someone who only knows of MS from famous<br>people who have died from its complications, like Richard Pryor, and<br>they say, "You have MS? *But you look so good!*" That one always strikes<br>me, because I'm never quite sure what they think someone with MS is<br>*supposed* to look like.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
