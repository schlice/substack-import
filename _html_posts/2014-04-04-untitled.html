<br/><br/>Answer Comment<br/><br/><br/>Content: [Sir, I do sometimes take a very reasoned and legalistic<br/>view of these questions. But in my heart, I absolutely and fully agree<br/>with you.\<br/>\<br/>In case you were unaware, you should know that people who are imprisoned<br/>for harming/killing children are the \"pond scum\" of the prison<br/>community. There is a hierarchy in prison, and child molesters/killers<br/>populate the very bottom of that structure. Even other prisoners despise<br/>them. I can understand how such a prisoner would fear for his life<br/>*more* *in* prison than he would *out of*<br/>prison.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Answer:<br/>https://www.quora.com/Should-those-imprisoned-for-murder-be-denied-the-right-to-take-legal-action-against-the-prison-service/answer/Bill-Stein<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
