<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Concrete evidence of a non-concrete God is kinda silly, wouldn't you<br>say? It's like using a metal detector to find a plastic cup.<br><br>It's not that religious folks *won't* provide you the concrete evidence<br>of God's existence that you want, no one can, because God is not<br>"concrete."<br><br>If God even exists, and if theists (religious folks) are correct that He<br>created the universe, He must exist outside of the universe, because you<br>must be outside of a thing in order to create the thing. Since all time,<br>all space, and all matter were created with the creation of the universe<br>at the Big Bang, God must be *outside* of all of those things. If He is<br>outside of time, then He has no beginning or no end (He is "timeless"),<br>and if He is outside of space and matter, then He is immaterial (He has<br>no form or matter). So if God actually created the universe, then He is<br>*necessarily* immaterial and eternal.<br><br>So you're never going to find concrete evidence of God's existence.<br>You're never going to discover one of God's hairs, or see one of God's<br>footprints. *But that doesn't mean you can't prove beyond a reasonable<br>doubt that God exists*. You just have to use different tools to do it.<br>Because we know that things exist which are not concrete, but we are all<br>rational to believe in. For example, you can't prove using science that<br>a sunset is beautiful or that the Nazis were evil. But we are all<br>rational to believe in beauty and morality, despite the fact that<br>science cannot prove them.<br><br>It's true that some theists don't know how to explain what they know in<br>their hearts. I think they should learn more, but they're not any less<br>theists for not understanding or being able to explain what they know to<br>be true.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
