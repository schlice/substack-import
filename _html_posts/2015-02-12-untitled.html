<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [The argument you\'re trying to make is that it\'s okay for<br>an ethically driven pharmacist to dispense Plan B because it\'s not an<br>abortifactent. So following that line of reasoning, it would be okay for<br>that pharmacist to dispense Plan B, but not RU-486, which there is no<br>controversy over; it is absolutely an abortifactent. And the science<br>still isn\'t settled about whether or not Plan B can prevent an egg from<br>implanting, so I think the religiously motivated pharmacist may still<br>have problems with Plan B.\<br>\<br>*Honestly, refusing to sell a product that you stock is completely<br>asinine*\<br>\<br>I already said that. Since pharmacists control their own inventories,<br>someone who stocks something he won\'t sell is an idiot. We ignore the<br>idiots in reasoned discussion.\<br>\<br>*and is entirely harmful in this case to the group you are preventing<br>access to. It\'s tantamount to theft combined with reckless<br>endangerment. Pregnancies are dangerous and risky.*\<br>\<br>I guarantee you that the VAST majority of people who want the pill want<br>it not because they are going to DIE, but because the DON\'T WANT A<br>BABY. And for those with high-risk pregnancies, they\'ll spend their<br>time in a hospital until their baby is born, or it will be medically<br>aborted for them, in an \"it\'s either you or the baby\" scenario, which<br>is not the type of elective abortion we are talking about. AND for those<br>who are prone to high-risk pregnancy, sex therefore constitutes a<br>high-risk activity, which they knowingly consent to. To do so without<br>proper birth control constitutes an even higher-risk activity.\<br>\<br>*They\'re expensive. Child rearing is as well. By preventing this access<br>the site and pharmacist should be responsible for damages.*\<br>\<br>No more so than the car dealer can be responsible for the car accident<br>in which you get yourself into. Good try, though.\<br>\<br>A child does not produce \"damages.\" You can\'t equate getting pregnant<br>to having a fire in your house; THAT is the truly asinine<br>point.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-is-one-serious-credible-reason-why-I-should-consider-a-belief-in-your-god-s/answer/Tracey-Brystan<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
