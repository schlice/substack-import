<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The most straightforward verse about predestination is Romans 8:29--30:<br><br>> For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the<br>> image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many<br>> brothers. And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom<br>> he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also<br>> glorified. \-- Romans 8:29--30 ESV<br><br>According to that passage, God predetermined that certain individuals<br>would be conformed to the likeness of His Son, be called, justified, and<br>glorified. Numerous scriptures refer to believers in Christ being<br>chosen:<br><br>> And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be<br>> saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. \--<br>> Matthew 24:22 ESV<br>><br>> And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they<br>> will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to<br>> the other. \-- Matthew 24:31 ESV<br>><br>> And if the Lord had not cut short the days, no human being would be<br>> saved. But for the sake of the elect, whom he chose, he shortened the<br>> days. \-- Mark 13:20<br>><br>> And then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the<br>> four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven. \-- Mark<br>> 13:27 ESV<br>><br>> Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who<br>> justifies. \-- Romans 8:33 ESV<br>><br>> though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or<br>> bad---in order that God's purpose of election might continue, not<br>> because of works but because of him who calls--- \-- Romans 9:11 ESV<br>><br>> So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace. But if<br>> it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace<br>> would no longer be grace. What then? Israel failed to obtain what it<br>> was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened, \--<br>> Romans 11:5-7 ESV<br>><br>> As regards the gospel, they are enemies for your sake. But as regards<br>> election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers. \--<br>> Romans 11:28 ESV<br>><br>> In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined<br>> according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the<br>> counsel of his will, \-- Ephesians 1:11 ESV<br>><br>> Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate<br>> hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, \-- Colossians<br>> 3:12 ESV<br>><br>> For we know, brothers loved by God, that he has chosen you, \-- 1<br>> Thessalonians 1:4 ESV<br>><br>> In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels I<br>> charge you to keep these rules without prejudging, doing nothing from<br>> partiality. \-- 1 Timothy 5:21 ESV<br>><br>> Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they<br>> also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal<br>> glory. \-- 2 Timothy 2:10 ESV<br>><br>> Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the sake of<br>> the faith of God's elect and their knowledge of the truth, which<br>> accords with godliness, \-- Titus 1:1 ESV<br>><br>> Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who are elect exiles of<br>> the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,<br>> according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the<br>> sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and for<br>> sprinkling with his blood: May grace and peace be multiplied to you.<br>> \-- 1 Peter 1:1-2 ESV<br>><br>> But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people<br>> for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him<br>> who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. \-- 1 Peter<br>> 2:9 ESV<br>><br>> Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm your calling<br>> and election, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall.<br>> \-- 2 Peter 1:10 ESV<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
