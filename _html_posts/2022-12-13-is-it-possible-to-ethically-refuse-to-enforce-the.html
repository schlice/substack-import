<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*(US Answer Only)*<br><br>Yes! As a police officer, you can absolutely refuse to enforce the law<br>because of ethical reasons.<br><br>Just don't expect to keep your badge for much longer once you do.<br><br>Police officers are charged with enforcing the law, even the laws with<br>which they personally disagree. If they have ethical convictions which<br>prevent them from doing so, they can really no longer be effective<br>police officers, and will likely be asked to turn in their equipment<br>before they are escorted out of the building.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
