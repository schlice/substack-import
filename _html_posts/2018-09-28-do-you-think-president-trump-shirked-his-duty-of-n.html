<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you think President Trump shirked his duty of not ordering an FBI<br>investigation because of his own problems of sexual accusations?**<br><br>No, of course not.<br><br>The FBI already investigated Judge Kavanaugh six times and this<br>never came up.<br><br>An FBI investigation would include going back to his home town and<br>talking to his neighbors and friends. If this drug-and-rape ring was so<br>pervasive, it's improbable (nay impossible) that the FBI wouldn't have<br>found some evidence that it existed, and that he was a part of it.<br><br>But they found nothing.<br><br>Why would a seventh investigation find something new, from an<br>uncorroborated, unverified single witness statement, where everyone<br>claimed to be involved vehemently denied that it even occurred, let<br>alone that anyone including Judge Kavanaugh was involved?<br><br>What's more, what would an FBI investigation find that we don't already<br>know? The FBI doesn't find guilt or innocence, nor do they investigate<br>the veracity of any claims. They simply aggregate all of the available<br>information and present it back to the requester.<br><br>We already know that everyone she claimed was there denied being there.<br>The FBI isn't going to tell us anything we don't already know.<br><br>Trump actually performed his duty well by not wasting Federal resources<br>on an investigation that we know will produce nothing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
