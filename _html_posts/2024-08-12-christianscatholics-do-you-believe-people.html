<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The talent itself is a gift from God. *Utilizing that talent, to the<br>best of your ability,* takes practice, dedication, and determination.<br>There is a difference between discovering you have a talent, and using<br>practice, dedication, and determination to make yourself *good at*<br>whatever your talent is.<br><br>My parents were a big part in cultivating my talent, because they were<br>the biggest part of my life at the time my talent began expressing<br>itself. When I was three, I had one of these children's play pianos<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-96b85d0439e9765e193f6f32f82c47cf){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-96b85d0439e9765e193f6f32f82c47cf" master_w="460"<br>master_h="338"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>very much like this one. I would watch *Sesame Street* on TV and play<br>the theme song on this piano, by ear. At this point in my life, the<br>talent was *raw*. It was *unrefined*. It was purely a gift from God.<br><br>But from then on, after *recognizing* the gift, my parents put me into<br>lessons. I spent the next thirteen years honing that talent. Today, I<br>use that talent to draw people closer to God and to lead them in worship<br>of Him. It's what I was meant to do with this gift. I have seen it touch<br>people's hearts. I have seen it draw people closer to Him. There is no<br>greater source of joy than to use a talent God has given you to give<br>back to Him in a tangible, measurable way. I am fortunate and blessed to<br>be able to share that with people.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
