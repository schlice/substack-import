<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think this is a really great question. It illuminates one of the major<br>misconceptions about Creationists vs Evolutionists: that Creationists<br>are "anti-science." The media perpetuates this myth, through tropes like<br>the ones immortalized in the book/movie *Inherit the Wind* which<br>fictionalized the 1925 Scopes "monkey trial." The trope goes like this:<br>here come those crazy Fundamentalist types imposing their religious<br>dogma and ignoring objective science.<br><br>Let's be clear about this: Creationists are not anti-science. This<br>debate is often couched as a *religion vs science* or *Bible vs science*<br>debate, when it is nothing of the sort. It is actually a *good science<br>versus bad science* debate. And Creationists certainly do not corner the<br>market on bad science.<br><br>Here's just one example of Evolutionist bad science: Science is a search<br>for causes. Logically, there can only be two types of causes:<br>intelligent or non-intelligent. When we look at the question of the<br>First Life, Evolutionists rule out the idea of an intelligent cause<br>before they even look at the evidence. Their conclusions are pre-loaded<br>into their assumptions. Spontaneous generation of life by natural<br>processes *must* be the cause of life because they don't consider any<br>other options. *This isn't an example of good science.*<br><br>Creationists do believe in good science.<br><br>Since we know that Creationists do believe in good science, there is no<br>reason to believe that Creationists would not get vaccinated. There is<br>nothing in the Creationist worldview which would argue against<br>vaccination. Believing that God controls all doesn't mean that we<br>shouldn't use our brains (also given to us by God) to impart a little<br>bit of protection to ourselves. That's simply being smart. Believing<br>that God has already pre-ordained an outcome doesn't mean that we<br>shouldn't take precautions. That's just fatalism, not good science.<br><br>Some people I know who refused the vaccine simply **don't believe that<br>the implementation of this vaccine qualifies as *good science*.**<br>They were worried about the lack of sufficient product testing as was<br>done with other vaccines in the past. They worried about the rushed<br>implementation. They worried about the unknown long-term effects of the<br>delivery method. But they don't avoid vaccination *because* they don't<br>believe in science. They simply said that they would risk it, and if<br>they contracted COVID, it would be God's will whether or not they lived.<br>And I know at least one person in my circle of acquaintances who *did*<br>die in exactly this way. But she died with her eyes wide open, making<br>her own choices in her own life.<br><br>I can tell you from personal experience that I (a Creationist) was fully<br>vaccinated. And I still got COVID anyway. I simply believe that this was<br>all part of God's plan for me. I don't blame the vaccines. I don't think<br>that the vaccines are fake. I don't think that it's some sort of massive<br>government conspiracy. I just believe that it was all part of the plan.<br>God has a plan for me, and it included contracting COVID at Christmas. I<br>don't know the details of his plan; God doesn't often reveal the<br>details. But I know he has a plan, because he has never failed to keep<br>any of his promises, and he promises us that he has a plan for us, a<br>plan of fullness, not of harm, to give us a future and a hope (Jeremiah<br>29:11).<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Do Creationists get vaccinated? If so, why?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
