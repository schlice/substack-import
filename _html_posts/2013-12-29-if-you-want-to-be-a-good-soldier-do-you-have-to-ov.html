<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [Mark Twain said, \"Courage is resistance to fear, mastery<br/>of fear, not absence of fear.\"\<br/>\<br/>No, you don\'t have to overcome your fear of death. Fear is good, it<br/>makes you sharp, it heightens your senses. You do have to learn to<br/>control your fear, use it to your advantage.\<br/>\<br/>Fear of death is controlled by coming to grips with the fact that you<br/>may have to give your life for your country. You prepare as best as you<br/>can; you make wills and continuity plans for what would happen to your<br/>family should you return from the war zone in a box rather than in a<br/>seat. You make peace with the fact that what you are doing is noble and<br/>just and it is worth dying for. There\'s no easy way to do that. It<br/>takes time and personal introspection, before you go to<br/>war.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
