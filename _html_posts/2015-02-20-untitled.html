<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [This is the sentiment we try to make clear to the anti-gun<br>crowd which equates \"no guns\" with \"no crime\". Britain\'s no-gun<br>policy hasn\'t helped to eliminate knife crimes, and if you can\'t own a<br>knife, someone will beat you with a baseball bat (er, a cricket bat),<br>and if you can\'t own that, they\'ll beat you with a frying pan, or a<br>rock, or a metal pipe.\<br>\<br>The point we\'re trying to make (and the one you are helping us to make)<br>is that the *tool* used to commit the crime is irrelevant; the crime<br>will still happen regardless of what tool is actually<br>used.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Should-people-on-college-campuses-be-allowed-to-have-guns/answer/Harman-Meyerhoff<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
