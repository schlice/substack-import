<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can you arrest a cop if he is no longer acting under the color of<br>law?**<br><br>You totally misunderstood what that phrase means.<br><br>"Color of law" refers to the appearance of the legal authority to take<br>an action. However, acting with the "color of law" says nothing about<br>the legality of the underlying action. In other words, police act with<br>"color of law" authority, when the underlying action may actually be<br>illegal.<br><br>For example, let's say the police act with "color of law" authority to<br>arrest someone. If, for example, the arrest was made without probable<br>cause, then the arrest, even though it was made with "color of law"<br>authority, would actually be illegal.<br><br>The problem is that you can't arrest a police officer for the<br>performance of his or her duties. Arguably, placing someone under arrest<br>is a police officer's duty, and doing so, he is acting "under color of<br>law." Whether or not the actual arrest (or whatever the officer did<br>under color of law) was lawful is a matter of law to be decided by a<br>jury. It's not something you can decide real-time.<br><br>Also, police can't "divest" themselves of the color of law. Police<br>officers are always police officers 24x7, even when they are off-duty.<br>Therefore, police officers always act with the "color of law," because<br>they always retain their police powers under the law. So technically, a<br>police officer can never act without the color of law.<br><br>Then, there is the functional aspect of trying to arrest an active<br>police officer. What's the reasonable amount of force you can use to<br>arrest a police officer? Good luck sorting through all the other cops<br>who will come racing to protect their brother/sister, whether or not you<br>think you're legally justified in making an arrest. At best, you'll be<br>arrested and found to be not guilty a few months later at trial. At<br>worst, the police will kill you after you assaulted a police officer<br>thinking that your cell phone is a gun, while the whole while you were<br>yelling something about "color of law."<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
