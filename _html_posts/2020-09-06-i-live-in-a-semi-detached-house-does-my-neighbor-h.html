Does my neighbor have rights to<br>replace part of my roof without my permission?**<br><br>The answer is dependent on who owns the house.<br><br>If you are co-owners with your neighbor, then the roofer will have to<br>determine which repairs belong to you, which repairs belong to your<br>neighbors, and which repairs are common. Then you pay for your repairs<br>and part of the common repairs, and your neighbor pays the same.<br><br>If you are not the owner, then it is the owner who determines what gets<br>repaired and when, and you have no say in the matter.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
