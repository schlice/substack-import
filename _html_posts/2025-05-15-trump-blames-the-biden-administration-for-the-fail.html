<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Even if they were to start today to source a whole new ATC system for<br>the entire country, it would take the better part of a decade to get it<br>in. Spend a little time in government contracting, and you'll find that<br>critical government systems cannot be wholesale swapped out. No "rip and<br>replace" here. The new system must be scoped, contracts written,<br>contractors bid, a prime contractor selected, then the new system has to<br>be built (and by this point the system is already a few years behind the<br>times), then the system must be installed *beside* the old system with<br>the old system as primary and the new system as backup. Then, when the<br>program guidelines are met, a cutover is planned and the new system<br>becomes primary with the old system as backup. The systems will run like<br>this until all reliability and usability standards are met (another<br>6--12 months), at which point we can decommission the old system.<br><br>This is a process which takes anywhere from six to ten years to<br>accomplish. If you push really hard, perhaps you can force it through in<br>like five years, but no one in the government will ever "rip and<br>replace" a system.<br><br>So Trump isn't right for blaming Biden for not fixing it. No one will<br>fix this system in two years.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
