<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**I have a Republican friend who is telling me that the \$1,400 stimulus<br>check is not coming and that it is only democratic propaganda. Is he<br>right, or has my friend lost his marbles?**<br><br>Your friend may have lost his marbles.<br><br>I'm not sure about that. What I am sure about is that the latest<br>stimulus has indeed been approved, and checks should start coming out<br>this next week. The income limits for those to receive the maximum<br>amount will remain the same as the last stimulus checks, and it is all<br>based off or your adjusted gross income, or AGI. Individuals who earn up<br>to \$75,000 in adjusted gross income, heads of household up to<br>\$112,500, and married filing jointly with AGI up to \$150,000 will get<br>the full \$1,400 per person.<br><br>This time, however, the amount gets reduced much quicker. Payments will<br>be capped at \$80,000 per individual, \$120,000 for heads of household<br>and \$160,000 for married couples. People at those adjusted gross income<br>levels and above will not get a check.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
