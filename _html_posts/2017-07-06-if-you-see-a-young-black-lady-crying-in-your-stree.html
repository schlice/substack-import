<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Calling the police is free and easy. It doesn't place me in danger. It<br>doesn't place me in any legally binding contract. It doesn't obligate me<br>to do anything else but push a few buttons on my mobile phone.<br><br>Of course I would help her.<br><br>What I would probably do is ask her why she needs the police (so I can<br>gauge the level of severity of the incident so I can determine which<br>number to call) and then I would take out my phone and dial the<br>appropriate number (either 911 for emergency or our local switchboard<br>number for non-emergency) and then hand her the phone. I would wait<br>while she spoke to the dispatcher, and then once she was done, I'd take<br>the phone. I might wait around for police to arrive, but if she's not<br>injured or in immediate danger, I'd probably not, especially if I had to<br>be somewhere.<br><br>Probably the easiest thing I did all day.<br><br>Your mom is concerned about you. She doesn't want you getting mixed up<br>in something that might hurt you. Could it be possible that the woman<br>was involved in some sort of scam? Or perhaps your calling would somehow<br>wrap you up in something that could get you in trouble. She's just<br>concerned for your welfare; she's not letting her fear dictate her life.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
