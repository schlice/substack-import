<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It doesn\'t matter what \"everyone else\" believes. It only matters what<br>you and your spouse believe. The rest of them can all go to hell.<br><br>Find someone who shares your beliefs, then marry them. Wait for that<br>person. Wait a long time if you have to. I\'d rather see you unmarried<br>because you are principled than to see you married and divorced because<br>you never found the right person.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
