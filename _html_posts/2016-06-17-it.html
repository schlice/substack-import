<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Interesting you should mention that.<br><br>I suspect at least some of the victims of the shooting did have<br>concealed carry permits. So why weren't they carrying? Orange County's<br>concealed carry ordinance states that nightclubs, as well as several<br>other named venues such as schools, are *gun-free zones*. Persons<br>with concealed carry permits are forbidden, by law, from carrying<br>their firearms into the nightclub.<br><br>Note that this provision in the law didn't seem to stop Mr. Mateen.<br><br>Isn't it sad that you realize how differently this scenario may have<br>played out had only one other person in the nightclub been armed...<br><br>More directly to your question, sheriffs across the country have been<br>appealing to their citizenry through the media to do just what you said.<br>They have been encouraging citizens to exercise their legal right to<br>carry a firearm.<br><br>[[Sheriffs issue a call to arms: 'Take advantage of your legal right to<br>carry a<br>firearm'](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b78afa&url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/01/18/u-s-sheriffs-call-to-arms-urge-citizens-to-help-protect/?utm_term%3D.337c651bce7b){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="washingtonpost.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>It's interesting that this story was posted January 18.
