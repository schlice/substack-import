<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If the unlikely (impossible) happens and Trump overturns the election<br>with help, how do you think the population will react?**<br><br>Trump cannot overturn the election. There is nothing he personally can<br>do to change the outcome of the election.<br><br>*However*, there is one more point in time where the results of the<br>election could, conceivably, change.<br><br>As the procedure goes, the new Congress will be sworn in on January 3.<br>The new Congress will meet in joint session on January 6 to count the<br>electoral votes. The President of the Senate (VP Pence) will preside<br>over the session. The electoral votes will be read and counted in<br>alphabetical order. Then they will give their tallies to Pence, who will<br>announce the results, and listen for objections.<br><br>It is at this point where objections to the electoral votes can<br>conceivably be made. If they are, the House and the Senate will consider<br>them separately to determine how best to count those votes, or if those<br>votes should be counted at all. There are 538 electoral votes. If no<br>candidate gets a majority (270) of electoral votes, then the House<br>decides the election in what the Constitution calls a "contingent<br>election" for President. There have been three other contingent<br>elections in history: the presidential elections of 1800 and 1824, and<br>the vice-presidential election of 1836.<br><br>*But wait*, I hear you saying, *Democrats control the House!* Yes this<br>is true, but that's not how a contingent election for President is<br>decided in the House. During a contingent election, each state gets one<br>vote. All House members from each state vote as one bloc. The candidate<br>who gets 26 votes is declared the winner of the election. Since Trump<br>won more states than Biden, Trump would be elected by the House.<br><br>In this case, this is highly unlikely, and even if there are some<br>objections to some electoral votes, it seems highly unlikely that there<br>would be enough objections to preclude either candidate from receiving<br>at least 270 electoral votes.<br><br>**But even if that happens, it's still not a case of Trump overturning<br>the election.**<br><br>How would the population react? The same way it did in 2000, when<br>Democrats thought that the Supreme Court stole the election from Al Gore<br>and gave it to George W. Bush. There will be cries of "not my president"<br>and any Congressional obstruction will be re-labeled as "resistance" to<br>a president who "stole the election." There may be riots in some cities.<br><br>But the sun will still come up. Life will go on, regardless of who sits<br>behind the Resolute Desk on January 21.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
