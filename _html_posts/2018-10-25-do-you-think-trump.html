<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you think Trump\'s continued, vitriolic attacks on his opponents<br>have helped incite the sending of suspect packages to many of them?**<br><br>I think I would be cautious in trying to assign blame for these packages<br>to anyone other than the person sending them.<br><br>That said, politics has definitely gotten more divisive in the past<br>decade, and both Republicans and Democrats have had a hand in creating<br>the political environment within which we all live today. No one person<br>or political party is "to blame" when it comes to creating the charged<br>political environment of today.<br><br>Trump is a "by-product" of today's environment. It is the political<br>landscape of today that allowed Trump to become president. He didn't<br>create the environment in which he is thriving; he simply is playing by<br>its rules.<br><br>Additionally, I'm pretty sure it's Democrats who have championed the<br>"#resist" movement ever since Trump was elected, and they are doing<br>everything in their power to not work together with Republicans, but<br>are instead resisting every Republican effort to do anything at all,<br>useful or otherwise. At least Republicans in the past offered concrete<br>solutions which were in opposition to what Democrats offered. Today's<br>Democrats spend more political capital #resisting than they do offering<br>concrete solutions that are different than what Republicans are<br>offering, let alone better. Is a pipe bomb "working together," "offering<br>a concrete solution different from what the other guy is offering," or<br>is it another example of "resisting?" I would posit that a pipe bomb is<br>closer to "resisting" than it is to "offering an opposing opinion."<br><br>Trump has not helped the political climate by simply being Trump. He's<br>also not done anything to change it, since he is keenly aware that the<br>#resistance movement is not going to change while he remains president,<br>so attempting to do anything to change it would be a waste of time.<br><br>So if you feel you must blame Trump for these pipe bombs, go for it. He<br>can handle it. But just know you're not adding any benefit to the<br>discussion; you're blaming a symptom of the problem, and not the<br>underlying problem itself. It's "iceberg theory," like blaming guns for<br>violence when we should be focusing on the causes of violence instead.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
