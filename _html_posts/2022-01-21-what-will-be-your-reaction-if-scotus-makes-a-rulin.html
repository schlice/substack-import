<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>They can overturn *Roe*, but "outlawing abortion at a national level?" I<br>would be absolutely horrified. Because that would mean that SCOTUS was<br>*writing new law* and that's not their job. Only Congress can "outlaw<br>abortion at a national level" by writing law. SCOTUS cannot do that.<br><br>*At best*, they can say that a particular law, as it is written, is<br>unconstitutional. So let's say that SCOTUS ruled that *Roe v. Wade*, as<br>written, is unconstitutional. That simply means that there is no longer<br>a Constitutional right to an abortion.<br><br>Does that automatically make all abortions illegal? No, not at all.<br><br>It simply means that there is no Constitutional protection for it. And<br>states can now make laws which make all abortions illegal, if they so<br>choose.<br><br>Most states won't do this. Most states will set a *limit* as to how long<br>into a baby's development an elective abortion will be allowed, and then<br>after that point, elective abortion will no longer be allowed and the<br>baby must be carried to term (with the exception of medical necessity of<br>course).<br><br>Some states will impose no restrictions on abortions at all (California,<br>New York, etc).<br><br>So instead of being a Constitutionally-protected right, it will fall to<br>the states to decide how they want it to go in their state.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What will be your reaction if SCOTUS makes a ruling that overturns Roe<br>vs Wade and outlaws abortion at a national level?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
