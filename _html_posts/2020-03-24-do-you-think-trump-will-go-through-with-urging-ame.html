<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you think Trump will go through with urging Americans to go back to<br>the office, restaurants, etc., even if health experts say that it\'s<br>premature?**<br><br>Yep.<br><br>Health experts are going to look only at health concerns. That's fine.<br><br>But health experts are unconcerned with the effects their methods have<br>on the economy.<br><br>Yes, it's true that if we self-isolate for the next 18 months, we can<br>completely eradicate airborne disease. But we'll also destroy the<br>economy.<br><br>If we all have to stay home, how will we earn the paychecks we need to<br>pay for those homes? How will we earn the paychecks we need to buy food?<br><br>Trump knows that there is a balancing point between what health experts<br>would like to see and what the economy needs.<br><br>You should be incredibly thankful that you have a businessman in the<br>White House right now and not a doctor. When the economy rebounds, you<br>will thank Trump for that.<br><br>Yes, some people will be stupid. Yes, some people will die. But that is<br>happening anyway, and the economy is virtually shut down right now.<br><br>Is it right to kill the economy to kill the virus?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
