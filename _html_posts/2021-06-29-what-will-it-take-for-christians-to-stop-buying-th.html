<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Proof. Overwhelming, convincing, literal proof in front of our eyes,<br>that we can see and touch. Literal proof right in front of us that there<br>is no God.<br><br>That's what we'd need to even consider abandoning faith.<br><br>There is precedent for those who needed proof. Thomas was one of Jesus'<br>disciples, and he refused to believe that Jesus was raised from the dead<br>until he had literal proof in front of his eyes, that he could see and<br>touch. The Bible recorded what happened next. The disciples had gathered<br>as they did every week, in a locked upper room (as they were being<br>hunted by the authorities at the time). Jesus had appeared to them<br>before, but Thomas was not with them. We pick up the story from there:<br><br>> Now Thomas (also known as Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with<br>> the disciples when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, "We<br>> have seen the Lord!"<br>><br>> But he said to them, "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put<br>> my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will<br>> not believe."<br>><br>> A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was<br>> with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among<br>> them and said, "Peace be with you!" Then he said to Thomas, "Put your<br>> finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my<br>> side. Stop doubting and believe."<br>><br>> Thomas said to him, "My Lord and my God!"<br>><br>> Then Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed;<br>> blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed." --- John<br>> 20:24--29 NIV<br><br>(By the way, the phrase "doubting Thomas" came from here)<br><br>Thomas needed to see Jesus to believe. And while that was fine for<br>Jesus, he also says, "blessed are those who have not seen, and yet have<br>believed." Jesus acknowledges that we will not be able to touch the nail<br>holes in his hand, or put our hand in his side where he was pierced by<br>the centurion's spear. But how wonderful is it for us, who didn't have<br>the luxury of those things, to still believe that he was raised from the<br>dead and takes away the sins of those who believe in him?<br><br>Since the only "proof" so far that god does not exist is being promised<br>by atheism, and atheism makes the claim that there is no god, let's turn<br>the question on them:<br><br>**When will atheism be able to present the proof that Christians need in<br>order for them to believe there is no god?**<br><br>They can't. Atheism is based on faith that their presumption about<br>science is correct. Atheism says that because you can't see God in a<br>microscope or a telescope means that he doesn't exist, and faith is<br>silly at best. Of course, they fail to see that the scientific method<br>simply isn't able to answer metaphysical questions very well.<br>Nevertheless, atheism is indeed a religious worldview. Just because it<br>doesn't have a higher power doesn't make it any less of a religion. The<br>theist looks at the totality of the circumstances and says, "there is a<br>god" while the atheist does the same and states, with exactly the same<br>level of conviction, "there is no god." They both operate from a primary<br>belief (and faith) that results in their own particular worldview.<br><br>But you can't prove a negative.<br><br>As legal scholar and philosopher Mortimer Adler says, "An affirmative<br>existential proposition can be proved, but a negative existential<br>proposition---one that denies the existence of something---cannot be<br>proved."<br><br>So atheism makes a claim that it can never prove. Therefore, Christians<br>will continue to believe that God exists, and atheists will slide into<br>eternity with their fingers crossed, hoping that they don't find out the<br>unpleasant truth that eternity does indeed exist, and it's an awfully<br>long time to be wrong. Adler continues on to say, "More consequences for<br>life and action follow from the affirmation or denial of God than from<br>any other basic question."<br><br>And there's no penalty in life to living in Christian faith. There's<br>nothing I can't do in this life that I could do if I were an atheist. I<br>haven't lost anything by being a Christian. At worst, the time I've<br>spent in fellowship has made me a better person, and that is certainly a<br>laudable goal, if nothing else. Basically, I look at it using the old<br>comparison: if I'm wrong, and there is no god, I've lost nothing. But if<br>you're wrong, and there is a god, you've lost *everything*.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>What will it take for Christians to stop buying the nonsense that<br>Christianity preaches?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
