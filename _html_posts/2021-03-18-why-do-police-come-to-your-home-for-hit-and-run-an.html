<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why do police come to your home for hit and run and arrest you, and if<br>you do not pay your traffic ticket issued by police then police arrest<br>you on your next traffic stop in the USA?**<br><br>I'll discuss these two cases separately, and I'll give you the example<br>of the state of Florida because that's where I live, but laws vary from<br>state to state.<br><br>In the case of a hit and run, you have graduated from a traffic<br>infraction to a crime, so they come to your house and arrest you. If you<br>leave the scene of an accident in which there were no injuries, this is<br>a second degree misdemeanor and carries a sentence of up to six months<br>in jail and a fine up to \$500. If you leave the scene of an accident in<br>which someone was injured, this is a third degree felony, and you could<br>face up to five years in prison and a fine of up to \$5,000. If you<br>leave the scene of an accident in which someone died, this is a first<br>degree felony, and you could be facing up to 30 years in prison, and up<br>to a \$10,000 fine.<br><br>Not paying traffic tickets gets you to arrest in a different way. When<br>you get a traffic ticket, you have two choices: you can pay the fine, or<br>you can appear in court to fight the ticket. You must do one: pay the<br>fine, or appear in court. If you fail to pay the fine, and you fail to<br>appear (FTA) in court to fight the ticket, the judge can issue a "bench<br>warrant" to bring you into court to explain yourself. Generally, the<br>bench warrant isn't enforced right away. If you are stopped again, the<br>bench warrant will appear, and you will be arrested because there is a<br>warrant out for your arrest. You will then appear before the judge and<br>not only answer for why you failed to pay your ticket, but why you<br>failed to appear in court.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice.
