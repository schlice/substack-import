<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>US presidents have never worn military uniforms. You may be confusing<br>several presidents who were military officers before becoming president.<br>While some may have worn their retired uniforms to certain commemorative<br>functions, they did not have active military rank while retired.<br><br>Commander-in-Chief is not a rank. The CinC is not the highest ranking<br>member of the military. He is not *in* the military. He is *above* the<br>military. Our military is 100% controlled by civilians.<br><br>This is why presidents do not wear military uniforms.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
