<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the proper procedure to find out if someone is a confidential<br>informant before dealing with them?**<br><br>So perhaps I'm confused. You're wanting to know how you find out if<br>someone is a CI for a Federal or State law enforcement entity before you<br>"deal with them?"<br><br>If I'm reading that correctly, the short answer is *you can't*.<br><br>CI's are protected informants. Only the CI and the "handler" know that<br>they are participating in the program. Not only does no one else know,<br>even if they did, they would never reveal that information as it is<br>protected as part of an ongoing investigation. The only time anyone<br>outside of those two will find out is when the CI takes the stand in a<br>courtroom.<br><br>Otherwise, *you will never know.*<br><br>The moral of the story: this is one of the risks when "dealing" with<br>other people. Perhaps you should ensure that your "dealings" are<br>above-board. So long as what you're doing is legal, whether or not the<br>person you are dealing with is a CI will make no difference whatsoever.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
