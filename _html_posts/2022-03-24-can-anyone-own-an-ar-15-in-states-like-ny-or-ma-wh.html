<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You've already heard that there are no special exemptions for former<br>military members when it comes to state laws regarding firearms<br>ownership.<br><br>NY and MA have some of the strictest firearms laws of any of the states.<br>While you *can* own an AR-15 in those places, there are indeed state<br>laws which limit your ability to own certain cosmetic features on the<br>firearm, and there are many, many hoops to jump through in order to be<br>able to legally acquire, store, transport, and use these firearms in<br>those states.<br><br>None of us are going to even attempt to list the applicable laws<br>(although<br>[Wikipedia(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=091c70&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_the_United_States_by_state){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} does an admirable job).<br>You should always check with a gun shop in your local area or a law<br>enforcement officer to find out what the current laws are regarding any<br>particular weapon you wish to purchase where you live.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can anyone own an AR-15 in states like NY or MA?
