<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What\'s the best way to deter package thieves?<br><br>While I absolutely love [[Mark<br>Rober](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c06bdb&url=https://www.youtube.com/user/onemeeeliondollars){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="youtube.com"}]{.qlink_container} and have watched his videos<br>for years, and I totally love the glitter bomb, it's just not practical<br>for us. Plus, *we actually have to get packages and stuff.*<br><br>So there are a few ways to deter package thieves.<br><br>1.  Neighbors<br>2.  Sign for your packages<br>3.  A service which acts as a drop-off location<br>4.  Direct the delivery company to deliver your package when you'll be<br>    home<br>5.  A package locker on your porch.<br><br>Neighbors. If you have neighbors who will be home during the day,<br>work out an agreement with them that packages be delivered to them.<br>Sometimes, delivery services won't drop off packages to others,<br>especially if you have to sign for them, but in many cases, you can<br>leave specific delivery instructions on the carrier's website and they<br>will honor them. Alternatively, your neighbors can simply keep an eye<br>out for packages delivered outside your door and grab them up to deliver<br>to you when you're home. I work from home, so I actually have this<br>agreement with my neighbors.<br><br>Sign for your packages. In many cases, you can elect to sign for<br>your packages. If you're not home to sign, the carrier will hold your<br>package for you and attempt re-delivery. You can also go to the local<br>distribution center and manually retrieve your package. It's a hassle,<br>but you won't lose your packages to porch pirates.<br><br>A service which acts as a drop-off location. If you rent a PO box<br>from a location like [[Postal<br>Annex](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=64a074&url=https://www.postalannex.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="postalannex.com"}]{.qlink_container}, [[The UPS<br>Store](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d2b497&url=https://www.theupsstore.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="theupsstore.com"}]{.qlink_container}, or a similar location<br>near you, they will receive any packages you send to your PO box, sign<br>for them, and hold them for you to pick up. It may be more convenient<br>than driving to the distribution center to retrieve your packages, but<br>there is a mailbox rental fee.<br><br>**Direct the delivery company to deliver your package when you'll be<br>home.** You can also pay a little extra with UPS, for example, and tell<br>them when during the day you want your package delivered. In that way,<br>you can ensure that you'll be home when your package is delivered.<br><br>A package locker on your porch. This one costs a little bit up<br>front, but it might work just as well. You'll want to buy a locking bin.<br>Something that looks nice but fits on your porch, such as the outdoor<br>storage bins you can buy from the big box home improvement stores, or on<br>Amazon. Something like this:<br><br>[[Keter 233705 55 Gallon Outdoor Rattan Style Storage<br>Cube](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1ec654&url=https://www.amazon.com/Keter-233705-Gallon-Outdoor-Storage/dp/B06VV9LVNL){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>This one is a little smaller and doesn't have a locking mechanism, so<br>you'd have to add a *hasp* and a padlock. This is an example of a hasp:<br><br>[[Alise MS99-B Padlock Hasp Door Clasp Hasp Latch<br>Lock](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=81aa91&url=https://www.amazon.com/Alise-MS99-B-Padlock-Clasp-Stainless/dp/B075TV4H98){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>There are some other, larger patio storage boxes which have built-in<br>hasps.<br><br>To use this method:<br><br>- Place the box on your porch. Optionally, use a cable lock to secure<br>  the box to your house. If the box is big enough though, it will<br>  naturally deter porch pirates.<br>- Leave an open padlock inside the box, and leave the box open.<br>- Instruct your carrier to drop your parcel in the box and lock it. You<br>  can do this with a note on your door, but it is preferred that you do<br>  this in the carrier's system. UPS and FedEx both allow you to edit<br>  your delivery and add delivery instructions.<br><br>\<br><br>(EDIT) Amazon has some unique ways to stop porch pirates:<br><br>Amazon Lockers. These lockers are available in most cities around<br>the country. When you place your order, you can direct Amazon to deliver<br>it to an Amazon Locker location near you. When your item is delivered,<br>you will receive notification of the delivery. You then visit the<br>locker, use your phone to generate a code, enter the code on the keypad,<br>and the locker with your package pops open for you to pick up.<br><br>Amazon Key. This is a bit more of a high-tech solution, but it<br>actually works (I've used it). It requires a garage with an<br>Internet-connected smart hub (such as Chamberlain's MyQ system), and an<br>Internet-accessible camera in your garage (many brands are supported---I<br>use Amazon's Blink cameras in my garage). Once you've enabled the system<br>in your Amazon profile, you can elect to have your item delivered by Key<br>Delivery. When the driver arrives at your house, he clicks a button on<br>his phone which sends a signal to your garage hub to open the door. The<br>driver places your item in your garage, and then clicks another button<br>on his phone to close your garage door. You can watch the entire process<br>on your camera.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
