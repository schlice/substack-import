After the death<br>of Freddie Gray on April 12, 2015, Mosby took a *miraculous* four hours<br>to determine that murder charges were warranted against the six police<br>officers who were involved in his arrest. No grand jury, no<br>investigation, just a glimpse at the coroner's preliminary report was<br>enough to meet her evidentiary requirement for murder charges. To<br>compare, Michael Brown's grand jury (which she didn't even bother to<br>empanel) took three months to investigate Brown's death before finding<br>that there was not enough evidence to charge the officer with criminal<br>charges.<br><br>In actuality, her press conference told the real story. She stated, in<br>public, that she was filing murder charges *to appease the rioting<br>crowds*, which vowed to intensify their rioting if the officers were not<br>charged. "I heard your call for 'No justice, no peace.' Your peace is<br>sincerely needed as I work to deliver justice on behalf of this young<br>man," Mosby said in May of 2015.<br><br>This is called mob rule, and is not how a working system of justice<br>functions, and it is certainly not how our system of justice is designed<br>to work.<br><br>Because she rushed to charge these officers without a proper<br>investigation, one of the cases ended in mistrial, three were found not<br>guilty, and the charges were dropped against the remaining two. She<br>literally went 0 for 6. And what did she get for her troubles?<br>Disbarment proceedings for incompetence and ethical "recklessness" and<br>five of the six officers have filed malicious prosecution lawsuits<br>against her, along with defamation and invasion of privacy.<br><br>We do not charge people with murder because a crowd threatens violence.<br>This is not how our justice system works.<br><br>Similarly, we do not write legislation because people threaten to hurt<br>themselves. This is not how our system of legislation works.<br><br>Feel free to protest all day long. You have a right to speak. You don't<br>have a right to get everything you ask for.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
