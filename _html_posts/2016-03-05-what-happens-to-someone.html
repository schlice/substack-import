<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is a very dedicated team who works at the jail in an area known as<br>\"Intake and Release.\" This is the place where new inmates are<br>processed in when they arrive, and where they are processed out when<br>they depart. They are very good at their jobs. I have tremendous<br>respect for the I&R team.<br><br>During the intake portion of the incarceration, the inmate will be asked<br>to empty his or her pockets completely and remove all jewelry and<br>accouterments that can physically come off. Some prisons make the inmate<br>flip his/her pockets inside out. They will normally dump all personal<br>effects into a plastic bin. This includes all money, wallets, purses,<br>pocket knives, mobile phones, rings, earrings, necklaces, etc. The<br>inmate will then change out of his/her street clothes (the clothing they<br>were wearing at the time of intake) into a prison uniform. The I&R staff<br>will catalog all of these items and they will be stored in separate<br>pouches (clothing and personal effects). These items are then placed in<br>one larger bag or box, depending on the particular prison. The box is<br>sealed and is placed into secure storage. The box/bag is only unsealed<br>for one of two reasons:<br><br>1.  The inmate is being released.<br>2.  The contents of the box are needed for a legal discovery proceeding<br>    or a warrant.<br><br>The inmate will review the contents listed on the form, and will sign<br>acknowledging that he/she reviewed the inventory of the box when it was<br>sealed. Chain of custody is maintained, so if the DA\'s office needs the<br>contents of the inmate\'s personal effects, they must sign them out.<br><br>When the inmate is released, the form is brought out, and the box/bag is<br>unsealed. Each item on the list is checked and returned to the inmate.<br>The inmate signs the form acknowledging receipt of his personal effects.<br><br>(Question details added) As for the person\'s affairs at home, hopefully<br>the new inmate has a friend or family member who can gather up his stuff<br>and move it into storage. And feed his fish. The police are not<br>responsible for your personal affairs while you are in prison.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
