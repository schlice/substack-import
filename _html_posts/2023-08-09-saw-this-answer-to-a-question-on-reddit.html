We think of God<br>as nothing more than an old man with a white beard in a white robe. And<br>that *limits* God in our mind.<br><br>This is a practice known as *anthropomorphism,* or the attribution of<br>human characteristics to God. However, God is not limited by a human<br>body. So if, when we worship God, we think of this, we too<br>subconsciously limit ourselves, and limit our understanding of God.<br><br>I wouldn't not paint a painting of God because it might limit someone<br>else's worship. Let each person worship in the manner in which they see<br>fit. What people do with your art is not your concern, unless you are<br>intentionally trying to lead them astray.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
