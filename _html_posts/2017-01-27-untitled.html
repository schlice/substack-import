<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Actually, there were two crimes.<br><br>- First, there was a sexual assault.<br>- This was immediately followed by a physical assault, which could<br>  easily be considered "self defense," which is an affirmative defense.<br><br>So could the police charge her? Yes, but it would be ridiculous to do<br>so, since it is extremely likely she'd get off (no innuendo intended)<br>with a self-defense claim, and the DA complaining, "why are you bringing<br>me these crap cases? I can't make this case!" Besides, while what she<br>did was technically a crime, it was in self-defense, and it's generally<br>bad public policy to charge victims. Local newspapers like that kind of<br>thing because the incredulousness of the action makes money for them,<br>but it's not something that could or should rightly be done.<br><br>Even without her being criminally charged, he could try to sue her for<br>assault and battery, and while his payout would most definitely be<br>limited by his criminal conduct which incited the assault and battery,<br>he might get enough money out of her to get his dry cleaning paid for.<br>Emphasis on might, depending on the judge.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-rudest-thing-that-a-customer-said-while-you-were-serving-them/answer/Kittie-Rayborn<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
