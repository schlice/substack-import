<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Should society tell police to never go \"hands on\" with a suspect as<br>the monetary cost could be too high if they (the cop) were hurt?**<br><br>So let me see if I understand this question. You're saying that police<br>should never use force with a suspect because the medical costs would be<br>too high if the officer is injured?<br><br>Placing a person under arrest always involves application of some level<br>of force. Applying handcuffs is "restraining" a citizen, which is a<br>forceful activity.<br><br>Unless you never want the police to arrest anyone, you can't tell the<br>police to never use any level of force against a suspect.<br><br>Therefore, any injuries must be expected, and paid for.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
