<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Here\'s a little background regarding the common thinking at the time<br>the Amendments were drafted:<br><br>> Modern debates about the Second Amendment have focused on whether it<br>> protects a private right of individuals to keep and bear arms, or a<br>> right that can be exercised only through militia organizations like<br>> the National Guard. This question, however, was not even raised until<br>> long after the Bill of Rights was adopted.<br>><br>> Many in the Founding generation believed that governments are prone to<br>> use soldiers to oppress the people. English history suggested that<br>> this risk could be controlled by permitting the government to raise<br>> armies (consisting of full-time paid troops) only when needed to fight<br>> foreign adversaries. For other purposes, such as responding to sudden<br>> invasions or other emergencies, the government could rely on a militia<br>> that consisted of ordinary civilians who supplied their own weapons<br>> and received some part-time, unpaid military training.<br>><br>> The onset of war does not always allow time to raise and train an<br>> army, and the Revolutionary War showed that militia forces could not<br>> be relied on for national defense. The Constitutional Convention<br>> therefore decided that the federal government should have almost<br>> unfettered authority to establish peacetime standing armies and to<br>> regulate the militia.<br>><br>> This massive shift of power from the states to the federal government<br>> generated one of the chief objections to the proposed Constitution.<br>> Anti-Federalists argued that the proposed Constitution would take from<br>> the states their principal means of defense against federal<br>> usurpation. The Federalists responded that fears of federal oppression<br>> were overblown, in part because the American people were armed and<br>> would be almost impossible to subdue through military force.<br>><br>> Implicit in the debate between Federalists and Anti-Federalists were<br>> two shared assumptions. First, that the proposed new Constitution gave<br>> the federal government almost total legal authority over the army and<br>> militia. Second, that the federal government should not have any<br>> authority at all to disarm the citizenry. They disagreed only about<br>> whether an armed populace could adequately deter federal oppression.<br>><br>> The Second Amendment conceded nothing to the Anti-Federalists' desire<br>> to sharply curtail the military power of the federal government, which<br>> would have required substantial changes in the original Constitution.<br>> Yet the Amendment was easily accepted because of widespread agreement<br>> that the federal government should not have the power to infringe the<br>> right of the people to keep and bear arms, any more than it should<br>> have the power to abridge the freedom of speech or prohibit the free<br>> exercise of religion.<br>><br>> Much has changed since 1791. The traditional militia fell into<br>> desuetude, and state-based militia organizations were eventually<br>> incorporated into the federal military structure. The nation's<br>> military establishment has become enormously more powerful than<br>> eighteenth century armies. We still hear political rhetoric about<br>> federal tyranny, but most Americans do not fear the nation's armed<br>> forces and virtually no one thinks that an armed populace could defeat<br>> those forces in battle. Furthermore, eighteenth century civilians<br>> routinely kept at home the very same weapons they would need if called<br>> to serve in the militia, while modern soldiers are equipped with<br>> weapons that differ significantly from those generally thought<br>> appropriate for civilian uses. Civilians no longer expect to use their<br>> household weapons for militia duty, although they still keep and bear<br>> arms to defend against common criminals (as well as for hunting and<br>> other forms of recreation).<br>><br>> The law has also changed. While states in the Founding era regulated<br>> guns---blacks were often prohibited from possessing firearms and<br>> militia weapons were frequently registered on government rolls---gun<br>> laws today are more extensive and controversial. Another important<br>> legal development was the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. The<br>> Second Amendment originally applied only to the federal government,<br>> leaving the states to regulate weapons as they saw fit. Although there<br>> is substantial evidence that the Privileges or Immunities Clause of<br>> the Fourteenth Amendment was meant to protect the right of individuals<br>> to keep and bear arms from infringement by the states, the Supreme<br>> Court rejected this interpretation in [[*United States v.<br>> Cruikshank*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a442d8&url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/92/542/case.html){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="justia.com"}]{.qlink_container} (1876).<br>><br>> Until recently, the judiciary treated the Second Amendment almost as a<br>> dead letter. In [[*District of Columbia v.<br>> Heller*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d59d32&url=http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2007/2007_07_290){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="oyez.org"}]{.qlink_container} (2008), however, the Supreme<br>> Court invalidated a federal law that forbade nearly all civilians from<br>> possessing handguns in the nation's capital. A 5--4 majority ruled<br>> that the language and history of the Second Amendment showed that it<br>> protects a private right of individuals to have arms for their own<br>> defense, not a right of the states to maintain a militia.<br>><br>> The dissenters disagreed. They concluded that the Second Amendment<br>> protects a nominally individual right, though one that protects only<br>> "the right of the people of each of the several States to maintain a<br>> well-regulated militia." They also argued that even if the Second<br>> Amendment did protect an individual right to have arms for<br>> self-defense, it should be interpreted to allow the government to ban<br>> handguns in high-crime urban areas.<br>><br>> Two years later, in [[*McDonald v. City of<br>> Chicago*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=01847d&url=http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2009/2009_08_1521){.external_link<br>> rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>> onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>> qt-tooltip="oyez.org"}]{.qlink_container} (2010), the Court struck<br>> down a similar handgun ban at the state level, again by a 5--4 vote.<br>> Four Justices relied on judicial precedents under the Fourteenth<br>> Amendment's Due Process Clause. Justice Thomas rejected those<br>> precedents in favor of reliance on the Privileges or Immunities<br>> Clause, but all five members of the majority concluded that the<br>> Fourteenth Amendment protects against state infringement the same<br>> individual right that is protected from federal infringement by the<br>> Second Amendment.<br>><br>> Notwithstanding the lengthy opinions in *Heller* and *McDonald*, they<br>> technically ruled only that government may not ban the possession of<br>> handguns by civilians in their homes. *Heller* tentatively suggested a<br>> list of "presumptively lawful" regulations, including bans on the<br>> possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, bans on<br>> carrying firearms in "sensitive places" such as schools and government<br>> buildings, laws restricting the commercial sale of arms, bans on the<br>> concealed carry of firearms, and bans on weapons "not typically<br>> possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes." Many issues<br>> remain open, and the lower courts have disagreed with one another<br>> about some of them, including important questions involving<br>> restrictions on carrying weapons in public. \1\<br><br>\1\ [[National Constitution Center - 2nd<br>Amendment](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=db657f&url=http://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-ii/the-second-amendment-and-the-right-to-arms-nelson-lund-adam-winkler/interp/2){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="constitutioncenter.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
