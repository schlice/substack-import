A pedestrian, walking a dog,<br>crossed in front of me and intentionaly \sic\ kicked my bumper. Do I<br>have any recourse?**<br><br>Don't stop over the line.<br><br>Legally, your tire has to cross the stop line before you are "blocking<br>the crosswalk." So as far as the law is concerned, you probably weren't<br>even legally considered to be blocking the crosswalk.<br><br>Do you have any legal recourse regarding someone kicking your car?<br>Probably not. It's probably likely that the person did not damage your<br>car by kicking the bumper. On the off-chance that they did, you would<br>have needed to call the police and report the destruction of property,<br>but again, this would only be true if there was actual damage to the<br>bumper.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
