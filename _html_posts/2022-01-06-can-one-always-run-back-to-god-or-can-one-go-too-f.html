Turns out, there is nowhere<br>you can run that God cannot find you and bring you back.<br><br>Also, nothing can separate you from the love of God:<br><br>> For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor<br>> demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither<br>> height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to<br>> separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. ---<br>> Romans 8:38--39 NIV<br><br>Anyone who repents of their sin and turns to Christ will be saved. **No<br>one is beyond salvation.**<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can one always run back to God?
