<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes. But there are different ways you "hold them accountable" in your<br>two scenarios:<br><br>- Breaking laws: Contact an attorney in your area to help, full<br>  stop. If you find the HOA breaking the law, your very next stop is a<br>  lawyer. You also may have a process in your Declarations which allows<br>  you to *recall* a Board member; you might look into that as well.<br>- Making bad decisions: Elections are the answer. People are elected<br>  to office, but there is no requirement to *do well* in that position.<br>  The correct method to handle an HOA that makes bad decisions is to<br>  elect people who will make *better* decisions.\<br>  \<br>  The problem, of course, is that very few people actually step up to<br>  run the HOA. So you end up with people who are there for the wrong<br>  reasons.\<br>  \<br>  Some people are there because they are retired and have nothing else<br>  to do. They tend to micromanage their positions and place too great an<br>  emphasis on the importance of them, simply because the HOA becomes<br>  their "only job." Some people are there because they think they can<br>  run an HOA better than anyone else, and they try to be everyone's<br>  friend. They'll often work outside of official channels, try to use<br>  the "good ol' boy" system, and try to generally be as congenial as<br>  possible. This can backfire when corrections need to take place.\<br>  \<br>  Regardless, the way to fix someone making bad decisions is to get<br>  someone else in there who will make *better* decisions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
