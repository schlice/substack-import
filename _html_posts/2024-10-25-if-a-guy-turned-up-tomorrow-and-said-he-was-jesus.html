<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sure, some would. But Christians would not. Why? **Because he didn't<br>show up the way Jesus is going to show up.**<br><br>How is Jesus going to show up? Check the Spark Notes (or if you're a<br>Gen-X'er, the Cliff Notes). We Christians call them "the Bible," but I'm<br>trying to be inclusive here...<br><br>> *And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men<br>> stood by them in white robes, and said, "Men of Galilee, why do you<br>> stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into<br>> heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven." \--<br>> Acts 1:10--11 ESV*<br><br>This was the scene right after Jesus was assumed bodily into Heaven. So<br>the Bible is clear that when Jesus returns, He will descend from Heaven<br>in exactly the same way as the disciples saw Him assumed into Heaven.<br><br>The Bible also tells us about all the events that will take place<br>*before* Jesus comes back, and if those things didn't happen in the<br>world, then it's unlikely that the person standing there is actually<br>Jesus.<br><br>Finally, when Jesus comes back, *a whole lotta stuff is going to start<br>happening*, and you won't need this guy telling you he's Jesus in order<br>to know that he's Jesus. Like, this stuff will pretty much dwarf any of<br>us. Cataclysmic type events across the globe.<br><br>You'll know. He won't even have to say it.<br><br>In fact, *everyone in the world will know it.* Again, to reference<br>the Spark Notes:<br><br>> *so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on<br>> earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ<br>> is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. \-- Phillipians 2:10--11 ESV*<br><br>When He comes back, *every* knee will bow, and *every* tongue<br>will confess that Jesus is Lord, whether they do so willingly or<br>unwillingly. And you can guess what the Spark Notes say about those who<br>are not willing to bend the knee, but are *made* to bend the knee.<br><br>I don't really have to say it, do I? Oh, very well...<br><br>> *And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous<br>> into eternal life." \-- Matthew 25:46 ESV*<br><br>Always check the Spark Notes...<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
