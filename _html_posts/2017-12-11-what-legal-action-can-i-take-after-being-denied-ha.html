<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What legal action can I take after being denied having a \"CO\" on<br>scene and stating I was being illegally detained?**<br><br>You do what everyone does: hire a lawyer and take it up in court.<br><br>You can state all day, till you're blue in the face, that you want a CO<br>on scene.\<br>You can state all day, till you're blue in the face, that you believe<br>your detention is illegal.\<br>*None* of that changes the detention.<br><br>Remember the old axiom: you may be able to beat the rap, but you can't<br>beat the ride.<br><br>That means that you may be able to successfully defend yourself in court<br>(by proving that your rights were violated by not being allowed to have<br>a CO on scene, or even prove that your detention was illegal), but<br>you're still going to be arrested and booked. You'll still have to cool<br>your heels in jail until your arraignment, and you may have to continue<br>to cool your heels in jail until you are bailed or until your trial.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
