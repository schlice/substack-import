<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I missed the part in the police officer\'s job description<br>that says \"Gets killed when necessary.\" Police are there to stop<br>threats before they happen, not wait for them to happen and then try to<br>stop them.\<br>\<br>Sadly, a jurisdiction implemented a rule like this less than a month<br>ago. When a criminal is using a deadly weapon (a car), police officers<br>are not allowed to shoot at it. So criminals, take note: if you want<br>to kill a cop in Denver, use a car. They won\'t shoot at you if they\'re<br>following policy.\<br>\<br>*(NOTE: that last sentence was facetious and only meant as an<br>illustrative example; I am not advocating for anyone killing anyone.)*\<br>\<br>The thought behind the policy change is that they want officers to \"get<br>out of the way\" instead of shooting. And it was made after Denver<br>police killed a teenage car thief who was driving her car down an alley<br>(where they would not have been able to get out of the way) at the<br>officers. No charges were filed against the officers, who were (rightly)<br>in fear for their lives as a deadly weapon was being aimed at them.\<br>\<br>So let\'s think about this. Vehicle: routinely moves at 50 mph. Person:<br>routinely moves at 8 mph. Vehicle: around 3,000 lbs. Person: around 200<br>lbs. Any thoughts on which one will win?\<br>\<br>This policy change only happened last month, and thankfully no officers<br>have yet been killed because of it, but I sadly predict that day<br>coming.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
