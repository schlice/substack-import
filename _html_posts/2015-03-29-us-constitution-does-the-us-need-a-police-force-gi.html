<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Question Details:*<br>><br>> *Reading some of the questions and answers to whether there should be<br>> gun free zones in schools on Quora; there seemed to be the suggestion<br>> that these stopped people defending themselves and this they were<br>> helpless. This totally ignored the existence of the police. So are<br>> they necessary? Could we really be safer if everyone bore arms?*<br><br>You are presuming that the police are there to protect you, and this is<br>a common misconception that causes much confusion.<br><br>There is a phrase we often quote when people assume that the police are<br>there to protect them: \"When seconds count, the police are only minutes<br>away.\"<br><br>There simply aren\'t enough police officers to be able to effectively<br>*defend you* against crime. It\'s not their charter, and they are<br>not required to defend you from crime. For example, if you fall victim<br>to a crime, can you sue the police for failing to defend you? People<br>have tried, and the Supreme Court, on numerous occasions, has determined<br>that the police do not have a specific duty to defend you from crime.<br>They have a general duty to keep the public at large safe, but they have<br>no special duty to defend any one person (with some limited exceptions).<br><br>The police perform a function that is separate from your right to<br>self-defense, since the police are not charged with protecting you or<br>keeping you safe. They certainly can, and will, if they are there, but<br>that\'s not their actual job. The police apprehend and prosecute<br>perpetrators of crime. This is a consequent function; this occurs after<br>the crime has taken place. Your right to self-defense occurs during the<br>commission of the crime. They are two totally separate functions.<br><br>The police have (supposedly) been vetted and are given special training<br>and privilege (thus wearing a \"badge of office\" or just \"a badge\")<br>allowing them to act as agents of the state to apprehend people and<br>charge them with violating the law. It is the exclusive function of the<br>Executive branch of government as afforded in the Constitution. This<br>authority has been given to the Executive branch by the people. The<br>people appoint the police to act as agents of the state to apprehend<br>criminals. While police departments use pithy catch-phrases like \"to<br>protect and serve,\" that\'s not their actual job function.<br><br>So yes, if we re-write the Constitution, we can remove the police as the<br>law enforcement branch of the government and appoint all citizens to<br>police themselves.<br><br>But I bet that wouldn\'t go too well. What if someone chose not to<br>police himself/herself? What if someone chose to not follow the law,<br>but instead to use their gun to break the law? It happens all the<br>time; whether or not all people are charged with the duty to enforce the<br>laws to which they are bound. How would you feel if every one of your<br>neighbors was constantly watching you, making sure you didn\'t break the<br>law? Doesn\'t sound like a very fun place to live. This is why people<br>are wary of cops. Cops are watching you to make sure you are following<br>the law, and if you\'re not, you can be very inconvenienced by them.<br>And since ignorance of the law is no excuse, if you were violating a law<br>that you didn\'t know was a law, you\'re still just as screwed as if you<br>were knowingly violating the law. So it\'s understandable that people<br>would be wary of the police. So the police willingly wear that stigma<br>(everyone is wary and suspicious of them) to keep their communities as<br>safe as they can and do get the bad guys.<br><br>How safe you are and whether or not police exist are two totally<br>different things. Your safety is your responsibility; the police cannot<br>keep you safe. Even from the very beginnings of government, we recognize<br>that people have a \"natural right\" to self defense. The framers<br>codified this in the Bill of Rights by stating that your right to keep<br>and bear arms shall not be infringed. Whether or not you choose to keep<br>and bear arms is your business, but that doesn\'t change the fact that<br>your defense is up to you. Defending those who cannot defend themselves<br>(i.e. children) is also part of your obligation when living in a civil<br>society.<br><br>Creating \"gun-free zones\" (i.e. in schools) simply creates \"unarmed<br>victim zones\" where criminals (who generally fail to follow the law<br>anyway) can run rampant and kill as many people as they choose without<br>fear of immediate, high-velocity reprisals.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
