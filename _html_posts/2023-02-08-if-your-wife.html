<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, if anyone attacks you and you are in fear for your life,<br>you can use whatever means at your disposal to defend yourself. Some<br>restrictions apply in some states, your mileage may vary, check your<br>local laws first, etc.<br><br>States do have laws regarding involuntary commitment, but those states<br>usually require that the person be "dangerous," and usually that means<br>that the person is "imminently dangerous." So if he's not actually<br>caught in the act of being dangerous by police, usually nothing will<br>happen.<br><br>Unfortunately, there is nothing you can do. Just know that if you do<br>kill your BIL, you will cause a tremendous rift in your family, even if<br>you were fully justified in doing so. Killing him should be the *last*<br>resort, not your go-to action.<br><br>You know that in most states, Tasers are actually legal to own and<br>carry? Perhaps you can stop him without killing him. It's a risk to<br>everyone, but it might assist in getting him help.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
