If it's an asset you own,<br>and it's likely that the asset would be taken without your permission,<br>you can also absolutely track it, regardless of what it is. You can<br>track your children if they are under 18.<br><br>It is generally illegal to track people who are over 18 without their<br>consent, and it is generally illegal to track vehicles which you do not<br>own.<br><br>The state may not track you without a warrant.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
