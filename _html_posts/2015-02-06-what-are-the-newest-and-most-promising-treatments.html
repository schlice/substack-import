<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Thanks for the A2A.\<br>\<br>As [[Tom<br>Buczkowski](https://www.quora.com/profile/Tom-Buczkowski)]{.qlink_container}<br>alluded to, there are new drugs constantly in the works. They may have<br>different methods of action, but ultimately all the drugs do the same<br>thing: reduce the severity and duration of relapses, and slow down the<br>disease progression.\<br>\<br>Tysabri works by preventing lymphocytes from crossing the blood-brain<br>barrier by actively attaching to the lymphocytes. Interestingly, the<br>theory about \"leaky gut\" is also predicated on lymphocytes crossing<br>the peritoneum, and Tysabri also prevents this as well. So Tysabri is<br>used to treat Crohn\'s Disease as well as MS. Tysabri is delivered by<br>monthly infusion.\<br>\<br>Gilenya works by preventing lymphocytes from leaving the lymph nodes in<br>the first place. This has the added side effect of potentially<br>decreasing the body\'s ability to fight infections (in some patients it<br>does), but Gilenya has been very effective at slowing disease<br>progression as well. Gilenya is an oral medication.\<br>\<br>Beyond new medications, scientists continue to work on discovering the<br>potential causes of MS, and while that work is ongoing, there haven\'t<br>been any breakthroughs yet. Tom also alluded to the work being done to<br>restore the myelin that was damaged by MS. There is lots of promising<br>research being done there as well.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
