<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can doctors run red lights and break other traffic laws if they need<br>to get to the hospital due to a emergency?**<br><br>There is no provision in any state traffic laws that I'm aware of that<br>allow doctors to violate traffic laws in the case of emergency. It would<br>be a mitigating circumstance in a defense of such a ticket, but it's not<br>codified in law.<br><br>That said, some states do have provisions for emergency medial<br>responders to have colored flashing lights in their cars designating<br>them as such. These, however, are generally reserved for volunteer<br>ambulance crews in places where volunteer ambulance crews exist. In law,<br>these lights are not supposed to be used to evade traffic laws, but so<br>other drivers could provide courtesy to these drivers (i.e. moving<br>over). In practice, they do use them to kinda bend traffic laws a<br>little.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
