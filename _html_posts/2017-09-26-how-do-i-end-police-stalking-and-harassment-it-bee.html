<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Your easiest option is to talk to a lawyer. If you can substantiate<br>stalking and harassment over a three year period, your lawyer can help<br>you file a lawsuit against the department. At the very least, they can<br>bring the matter to the attention of the department and the district<br>attorney in such a way that if they happened to be unaware of it, they'd<br>certainly be aware now, and it should stop either way.<br><br>Another option would be to contact the nearest branch of the ACLU<br>(American Civil Liberties Union) for assistance. I know, also lawyers,<br>but since it's a little different, I added it separately.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
