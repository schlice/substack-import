<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As with all legal answers, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>Even in Colorado, where you can legally walk around topless (women),<br>public indecency includes "knowingly exposing one\'s genitals to another<br>person in a way likely to alarm or offend the person." The higher level<br>charge of indecent exposure is triggered when there is intent:<br>"knowingly exposing one\'s genitals in view of another in a way likely<br>to cause alarm or offend *with the intent to arouse or to satisfy the<br>sexual desires of anyone*".<br><br>So this would be very specific to the situation. I think much would<br>depend on intent.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
