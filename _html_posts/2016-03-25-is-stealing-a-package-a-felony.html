<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>In almost every state I know, theft of property is classified based on<br>the value of the property stolen and the circumstances of the crime.<br>Since I have Colorado Revised Statutes readily available, here\'s our<br>example:<br><br>Class 2 Misdemeanor Theft. When the value of the property stolen is<br>less than \$500, Colorado law classifies the theft as a class 2<br>misdemeanor (CRS §18-4-401(2)(b)), also known as \"petty theft.\"<br>Punishment for a class 2 misdemeanor is a minimum sentence of three<br>months and a \$250 fine, and a maximum sentence of 12 months and a<br>\$1,000 fine. (§ 18-1.3-501(1)(a)).<br><br>Class 1 Misdemeanor Theft. When the value of the property stolen is<br>\$500 or more but less than \$1,000, the theft is a class 1 misdemeanor<br>(§18-4-401(2)(b.5). Punishment is a minimum sentence of six months and a<br>\$500 fine, up to a maximum sentence of 18 months and a \$5,000 fine<br>(§18-1.3-501(1)(a)).<br><br>Class 5 Felony Theft. If property is taken from the person of<br>another, without force or intimidation (otherwise the offense could be<br>bumped up to robbery \theft through force\) or extortion (theft<br>through intimidation) (§18-4-401(5)), the theft constitutes a class 5<br>felony theft. It carries a sentence of one to three years imprisonment,<br>including at least two years of parole (remember that in Colorado,<br>parole is an additional punishment on top of jail time)<br>(§18-1.3-401(V)(A)).<br><br>Class 4 Felony Theft. If the value of the property stolen is \$1,000<br>or more but less than \$20,000, the theft is a class 4 felony<br>(§18-4-401(2)(c)). The sentence is a minimum of two years with a maximum<br>of six years imprisonment, with parole for a minimum of three years,<br>plus a fine of \$2,000 to \$500,000 (§18-1.3-401(V)(A)).<br><br>Class 3 Felony Theft. If the value of the property stolen is<br>\$20,000 or more, it is a class 3 felony (§18-4-401(2)(d). A class 3<br>felony carries a sentence of a minimum of four years and a maximum of 12<br>years imprisonment, with at least five years of parole, plus a fine of<br>\$3,000 to \$750,000. (§18-1.3-401(V)(A)).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
