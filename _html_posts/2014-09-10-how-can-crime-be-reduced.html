<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Question Details:*<br>><br>> *I just read that the crime rate in the Netherlands is falling at such<br>> a high rate that they announced in 2013 they were closing 19 jails and<br>> in 2014 announced they are renting out space in their jails to Norway<br>> to house Norwegian criminals. What is the secret of Dutch society that<br>> has led to this situation? Can it be applied to other countries with<br>> similar results?*<br><br>I don\'t think that the Netherlands is unique in this regard. Crime has<br>been falling steadily since the 90s all across the world. Here in the<br>US, violent crime rates have fallen almost every year since the 80s.<br>Policing has gotten better and more sophisticated. Crime has become less<br>profitable than it used to be, so crime goes down (which is the only way<br>to reduce real crime: make it less profitable).<br><br>The United States, however, while seeing the same downward trend of<br>crime, has not seen the same downward population change in our prisons.<br>Why? What\'s the largest population of our jails? The answer is that the<br>largest population of America\'s prisons are not criminals. The<br>largest population of America\'s jails are *drug addicts.*<br><br>So is the answer to make all drugs legal? Not at all; some drugs [[can<br>and should be made<br>legal](https://www.quora.com/What-do-police-officers-think-about-legalizing-drugs-Would-it-make-their-jobs-harder-or-easier)]{.qlink_container},<br>because the decision to make them illegal was a poor one (case in point:<br>marijuana). Other drugs are the scourge of the earth and should be<br>obliterated by any means available (cases in point: meth and alcohol).<br>But drug addicts are in jail because of one reason: the medical<br>community.<br><br>Despite overwhelming evidence in recent years detailing new discoveries<br>about the brain showing that addiction is a disease of the system that<br>handles choice, the medical community has not yet declared that drug<br>addiction is a disease and that addicts should be patients. Instead,<br>they still hold the opinion that drug addiction is a choice and that<br>addicts are simply bad actors. This leaves the problem of drug addicts<br>to the criminal justice system and the courts, when it should be handled<br>by doctors and hospitals. Thus, the overcrowding and unnecessary<br>incarceration of drug addicts.<br><br>If we can get on the medical community and get them to recognize that<br>drug addicts should be patients and not inmates, we will instantly<br>reduce the prison population by half, and we too will have the problem<br>of too many jails and not enough inmates.<br><br>That\'s a great problem to have, by the way.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
