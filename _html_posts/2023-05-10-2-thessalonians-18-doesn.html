<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Oh I disagree. Let's break this down:<br><br>> in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know God, and on<br>> those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ --- 2<br>> Thessalonians 1:8 NKJV<br><br>So now let's review, phrase by phrase:<br><br>in flaming fire\<br>Paul talks about the eternal judgement of those who are without Christ<br>as "in a fire of flame."<br><br>taking vengeance\<br>Vengeance in the Bible punishes people based on *what they rightly<br>deserve.* God delivers justice to Christians by punishing their enemies.<br>It's not retribution or retaliation, it's justice.<br><br>on those who do not know God\<br>God takes vengeance on two different groups. This is the first: those<br>who do not know Him. There is no excuse to not know Him, as He has<br>revealed Himself to them<br><br>and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ\<br>This is the other group: those who do not obey the gospel. This group is<br>arguably worse than the first group, as they have already heard the good<br>news and have chosen to reject it. There are many people who call<br>themselves Christian who have done this.<br><br>\<br><br>So what do we take from all of this?<br><br>1.  God takes vengeance through justice.<br>2.  For people who call themselves Christian yet don't obey the gospel,<br>    they won't be able to rationalize that away.<br><br>> For it is time for judgment to begin with God's household; and if it<br>> begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the<br>> gospel of God? --- 1 Peter 4:17 NIV<br><br>But there is hope for them:<br><br>> But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you<br>> have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now<br>> claimed your allegiance. --- Romans 6:17 NIV<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
