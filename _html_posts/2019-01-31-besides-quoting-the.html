<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Besides quoting the \"You shouldn\'t have signed the contract if you<br>don\'t like it\" argument, what is your view on HOA\'s fining residents<br>monthly, for having round trash cans instead of the square ones they<br>recently commanded you must buy?**<br><br>Unless the HOA is receiving kick-backs from trash can companies for<br>forcing you to buy certain cans, there must be a reason why that rule<br>was implemented.<br><br>If I had to guess, I'd say it has something to do with your trash<br>collection. Many locations have trash companies which utilize<br>specialized trucks which grab cans and lift them up, dumping the trash.<br>When a non-standard can is present, the worker must exit the truck, dump<br>the can, and get back in, which makes trash collection less efficient,<br>and makes the driver later finishing his route, which may cause more<br>problems downstream.<br><br>If the trash company contract requires a certain geometry of can, they<br>may eventually start fining the HOA for every incorrectly-shaped can<br>they have to stop and collect.<br><br>So your round can may be costing the HOA (and by extension, you) more<br>money.<br><br>Let me give you a real life forinstance. In my neighborhood, we have<br>single-stream recycling. Some residents were bagging their recycling<br>before putting it in the collection bin. The trash company was finding<br>that plastic bags were gumming up the sorting machines, so they told us<br>absolutely no plastic bags in recycling. The problem got so bad (and<br>they had to stop production lines so many times) that they told us they<br>would fine the HOA for every plastic bag they found in our recycling.<br><br>So we have a rule: no plastic bags in recycling. We can cite homeowners<br>and fine them if they continually place plastic bags in recycling.<br><br>Seems silly, doesn't it? Getting a fine for having a plastic bag in your<br>recycling?<br><br>But there is a reason.<br><br>I'm certain that your HOA has a reason for mandating a certain shape of<br>can.<br><br>You should ask them why.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
