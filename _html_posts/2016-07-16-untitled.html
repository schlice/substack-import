<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Eventually, enough infractions and you'll lose your license. Each<br>jurisdiction is slightly different on that, but when the court sees<br>you're a willful violator, they will eventually revoke your license,<br>first for a period of time (i.e. one year) and then eventually<br>permanently.

Then you can use that copious money to hire a good attorney.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Why-arent-traffic-fines-scaled-according-to-the-income-of-the-driver/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
