<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So let me see if I understand what you are saying.<br><br>You "feel like you were cheated." Does that mean you were actually<br>cheated? Was a provision of your agreement not fulfilled as written? Or<br>are you saying that you were not represented as vigorously as you<br>believe you should have been?<br><br>If a provision of your agreement was not fulfilled as written, go<br>directly to the attorney and ensure they fulfill it.<br><br>If you simply feel you didn\'t get your attorney\'s best effort, you<br>don\'t have many options. You can leave a bad review on your favorite<br>review site like Yelp or Google. Make sure you are truthful and explain<br>that it is all about your feelings and not actual, articulable facts.<br>You don\'t want to end up on the wrong end of a libel lawsuit. You could<br>also seek a second opinion. You could have another attorney look over<br>there whole case and see if they agree that you got the best possible<br>outcome.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
