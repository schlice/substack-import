The question, of<br>course, is how likely you will be to prevail.<br><br>There are four key elements to a defamation claim that must be met:<br><br>- The actual defamatory statement which claims that it is factual<br>- Publication (libel) or communication (slander) of that statement to a<br>  third party<br>- Fault amounting to at least negligence, and<br>- Damages, or some harm caused to the reputation of the person against<br>  whom the statement was made.<br><br>Fault amounting to at least negligence must be shown; in other words,<br>you have to prove that the speaker or author was at least negligent in<br>not properly determining the truth before making the defamatory<br>statement.<br><br>As always, truth is considered to be an absolute defense to defamation<br>charges.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
