<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The United States government cannot endorse any religion, because of the<br>First Amendment to the Constitution. Therefore, requiring a religion in<br>order to serve in the military would be unconstitutional. The religion<br>question really only pertains to last rites or military hospital stays.<br>Also these days, it pertains to when you expect to be able to have time<br>to worship.<br><br>Your religious preference gets stamped on your dog tags, so that they<br>know which chaplain to call if you're dying.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-a9b28487bbdec45951cce77a779398a9){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-a9b28487bbdec45951cce77a779398a9"<br>master_w="2999" master_h="4000"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(My dog tags, Social Security Number removed from the photo. I was a<br>practicing Catholic at the time of my military service)*<br><br>From the US Army website:<br><br>> During World War II there were only three religious categories that<br>> could be put on dog tags: P for Protestant, C for Catholic and H for<br>> Hebrew (Jewish). Obviously, that proved to be too limiting. \"No<br>> Religious Preference\" and \"None\" were eventually added; today many<br>> faith groups and broad denominations are available, reflecting the<br>> diversity of the armed forces. Service members can generally put<br>> whatever religious preference they want on their tags, including<br>> \"Atheist\" or \"Agnostic.\" Some even ask for \"Jedi\" or \"Druid.\"<br>> There is no list of official or approved religions\--after all, that<br>> would constitute government endorsement of a particular religion.<br>> \[1\](#SvwQx){#cite-SvwQx .citation_link}<br><br>So if you are atheist, you can definitely have "ATHEIST" added to your<br>dog tags, and no chaplain will be called to administer you last rites if<br>you're dying. You also won't be expected to ask for time to worship<br>during Basic Training. You'll simply have an appropriately-sized period<br>of "unstructured time" to yourself.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-SvwQx){.citation_index} [[What\'s on your dog<br>tag?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d8b5a3&url=https://www.army.mil/article/123034/whats_on_your_dog_tag){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="army.mil"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
