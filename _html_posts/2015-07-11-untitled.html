<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [1. There is no right in the Constitution to own a car.<br>There is a right in the Constitution to own a gun. Big difference. You<br>drive at the pleasure of the State. Your driving privileges can be<br>revoked. Under normal circumstances (i.e. unless you\'re a felon or<br>seriously mentally ill), you can\'t lose your right to own a gun.\<br>\<br>2. If I have the need and the legal authority to take someone\'s life,<br>I\'m going to do it in the most efficient way possible, with the least<br>potential for injury to myself and others. The gun provides me with the<br>means to do just that. And what if my opponent is twice my size? I\'ll<br>admit, I\'m no Hulk. The gun is my equalizer. Finally, you have no right<br>to tell me what form of self-defense I can use if I am justified in<br>taking a life. I\'m defending myself; this has nothing to do with you.\<br>\<br>3. \"Most killing is done because someone is pissed and has a gun.\"\<br>\<br>Statistics don\'t support that assertion. Can you show me the statistics<br>that show that most murders (which are done with malice and<br>forethought) are actually impulse decisions with no forethought<br>involved? I\'m surprised we can convict *anyone* of murder if, as you<br>say, there is no forethought involved in most unlawful<br>killings.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/If-guns-arent-the-problem-in-the-United-States-why-are-they-the-solution/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
