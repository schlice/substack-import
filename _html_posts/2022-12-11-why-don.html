<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ah, faith. Let's discuss faith, shall we?<br><br>But first, let's look at evidence, since faith is what lies between your<br>evidence and your belief. If we're being brutally honest here (and I<br>have spent a great deal of time debating with non-theists on this site),<br>the problem is not with the evidence. The problem is *what evidence will<br>you find acceptable?*<br><br>God (if he exists) exists outside of time and space. This, of course, is<br>necessary if he were to have created all these things, because you<br>cannot exist inside your own creation unless you first existed outside<br>of your own creation. This means he is immaterial and timeless. So he<br>cannot be measured with a sensor. You'll never be able to see him with<br>your eyes, or touch him with your hands.<br><br>But there is more evidence that a creator god exists than there is<br>evidence that a creator god does not exist. So let's take a look at some<br>examples, as well as how much faith is required to believe each view in<br>light of the evidence:<br><br>1.  The scientific evidence overwhelmingly shows that the universe<br>    exploded into existence out of nothing. Either someone created<br>    something out of nothing (the theistic view) or no one created<br>    something out of nothing (the atheistic view). Which view is more<br>    reasonable? The theistic view. Which view requires more faith? The<br>    atheistic view.<br>2.  The simplest life form contains the informational equivalent of 1000<br>    encyclopedias in its DNA. Theists believe that only an intelligent<br>    being can create a life form containing the equivalent of 1000<br>    encyclopedias. Atheists believe that random chance and natural<br>    forces created that life. Theists have evidence to support their<br>    conclusion. Since atheists don't have any such evidence, their<br>    belief requires more faith.<br>3.  Hundreds of years before it happened, ancient writings told of a man<br>    who would actually be God. This God-man would be conceived in a<br>    specific way, born in a specific place to a specific lineage, suffer<br>    and die in a specific way, and then rise from the dead to atone for<br>    the sins of the world. Immediately after the predicted time,<br>    hundreds of people exclaimed and then recorded the fact that these<br>    events happened as they were predicted. These people gained nothing<br>    from their exclamations but persecution and death, which they could<br>    have saved themselves if they had just kept quiet. Thousands of<br>    people were converted when they heard this message, and this belief<br>    spread quickly throughout the known world. Ancient historians and<br>    writers confirm these events, and archaeological finds corroborate<br>    them. Having seen the evidence from bullet 1 above, theists believe<br>    that these multiple lines of evidence show beyond a reasonable doubt<br>    that a creator god had a hand in all of these events. Atheists need<br>    a lot more faith to explain away the predictions, the eyewitness<br>    testimony, the willingness of the eyewitnesses to suffer and die,<br>    and the corroborating testimony of the other ancient writers and the<br>    archaeological evidence.<br><br>Faith, as we mentioned earlier, is what covers a gap in knowledge. The<br>less evidence you have for your position, the more faith you need to<br>believe it. And as it turns out, atheists have bigger gaps in their<br>knowledge because they have far less evidence for their beliefs than<br>theists have for theirs.<br><br>In other words, the empirical, forensic, and philosophical<br>evidence strongly supports conclusions consistent with theism and<br>inconsistent with atheism.<br><br>So the real question is: *why don't atheists realize that they need a<br>lot more faith to be atheists than theists need to be theists?*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
