<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**This video depicts a state trooper arresting a local cop after<br>stopping him for doing 120 mph. How often does something like this<br>happen?**<br><br>Not very often<br><br>Florida statutes, as most state statutes, provide that emergency<br>vehicles are exempt from traffic regulations.<br><br>But they add two very unique provisions that allowed for this encounter<br>to be legal (emphasis mine):<br><br>> (b) The driver of a vehicle specified in paragraph (a), except when<br>> otherwise directed by a police officer, may:<br>><br>> 1. Park or stand, irrespective of the provisions of this chapter;<br>><br>> 2. Proceed past a red or stop signal or stop sign, but only after<br>> slowing down as may be necessary for safe operation;<br>><br>> 3. Exceed the maximum speed limits **so long as the driver does not<br>> endanger life or property;**<br>><br>> 4. Disregard regulations governing direction or movement or turning in<br>> specified directions, so long as the driver does not endanger life or<br>> property.<br>><br>> (c) T**he foregoing provisions shall not relieve the driver of a<br>> vehicle specified in paragraph (a) from the duty to drive with due<br>> regard for the safety of all persons,** nor shall such provisions<br>> protect the driver from the consequences of his or her reckless<br>> disregard for the safety of others.\[1\](#ovgnJ){#cite-ovgnJ<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>Note that the vehicle specified in paragraph (a) of the statute is an<br>authorized emergency vehicle.<br><br>Therefore, she wasn't stopping him because he was speeding. She stopped<br>him because his driving endangered life or property, and he was not<br>driving with due regard for the safety of all persons.<br><br>The fact that she arrested him for this was indeed unusual. Normally,<br>her dashcam video would have been submitted to her chain of command and<br>reported back to his department for disciplinary action. The arrest was<br>a bit much. Professional courtesy clearly does not exist in Florida.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-ovgnJ){.citation_index} [[2018 Florida<br>Statutes](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=7ce5cd&url=http://m.flsenate.gov/Statutes/316.072){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="flsenate.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
