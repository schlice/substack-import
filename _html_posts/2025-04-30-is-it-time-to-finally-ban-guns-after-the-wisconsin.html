<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I love these questions. It's as if we've been trying endlessly to just<br>ban those darn guns, but that pesky Second Amendment is always in the<br>way.<br><br>But maybe this time will be different. Maybe this school shooting will<br>be the one which pushes those crazy MAGA Republicans over the edge and<br>they finally say "enough is enough, this is one child too many" and we<br>just seize all the guns and we're just done with it.<br><br>And if this is how you think, I've got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you.<br><br>We've answered this question a million times on this platform<br>(incidentally, this same question pops up after every school shooting),<br>the answer remains the same.<br><br>*THE TOOL IS NOT THE PROBLEM. THE SHOOTER IS THE PROBLEM.*<br><br>More teens die in teen-related car accidents than in school shootings,<br>but we don't call for bans on teen driving.<br><br>Terrorists used a pressure cooker to create a bomb and kill people at<br>the Boston Marathon, but you don't see any calls to regulate pressure<br>cookers.<br><br>Terrorists used rental trucks to mow down large crowds of people, but<br>you don't see any calls to limit civilian usage of rental trucks.<br><br>It is a given that Constitutionally protected, easy access to<br>firearms will allow someone to use that tool to commit murder, just as<br>easy access to rental trucks allows terrorists to rent one and mow down<br>a crowd of pedestrians, or easy access to pressure cookers allows<br>terrorists to get one and build a bomb. If a tool exists, people will<br>use that tool for good or for evil. That's not the fault of the tool.<br>It's the fault of the person using the tool.<br><br>The common thread is murder. The tool is ancillary. Firearms are the<br>easy target because they are designed to kill. That's not bad or good;<br>badness or goodness are determined by the circumstances of their use;<br>not that they actually cause death.<br><br>So **yes, the fact that we have relatively easy access to firearms means<br>that murderers can use those tools to commit murders. *Taking the<br>tool away will not stop the murder. It will just modify the choice of<br>tool.***<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
