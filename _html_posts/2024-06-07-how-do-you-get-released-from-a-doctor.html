<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I'll assume you're in the United States.<br><br>You don't "get released from a doctor's care." If you can no longer pay,<br>you stop going.<br><br>However, if you still need to go and you can't afford insurance, you<br>find some programs which can help you. There are numerous Federal and<br>State assistance programs for those who don't have the money to afford<br>insurance. Medicaid, Medicare, the ACA Healthcare Marketplace, etc. all<br>have options for people who cannot afford insurance.<br><br>Alternatively, there may be some facilities which take charity patients.<br>You would have to work that out with the facility themselves. Some<br>publicly-funded institutions must take a certain amount of charity<br>patients, and they usually do that by writing off the debts of those who<br>cannot pay and who don't qualify for government assistance. So you may<br>still be able to get the care you need, even if you can't afford to pay.<br>Talk to your physical therapist about treatment options for those who<br>are uninsured.<br><br>They may even be able to give you some simple strengthening exercises<br>that you can do on your own once you leave their care.<br><br>Hope is never lost. It's only hopeless when we give up.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
