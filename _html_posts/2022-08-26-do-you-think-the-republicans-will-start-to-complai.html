<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, the PP loan forgiveness you're talking about is actually<br>the "PPP" or the "Paycheck Protection Program" which happened early on<br>in the COVID pandemic. It was intended to help small businesses to be<br>able to stay afloat and continue to pay their employees.<br><br>The White House isn't calling it out because it was a loan forgiveness<br>program, because clearly they are different (one is to businesses to try<br>to keep them in business and paying employees during COVID, the other is<br>a naked vote-buying gift program to college students who were<br>irresponsible and bit off more than they could chew). The White House is<br>calling it out because *some Republican lawmakers are also small<br>business owners, and benefited from the PPP program.*<br><br>In other words, the White House is doing the ol' "I'm rubber, you're<br>glue" thing and trying to reflect the criticism back on Republicans when<br>they criticize Biden's "payment for future Democrat votes", er, "early<br>Christmas present for the lazy", er, loan payment on behalf of<br>taxpayers.<br><br>This isn't a comparison between Democrat and Republican loan forgiveness<br>programs. This is a bald-faced *ad hominem* attack on Republicans who<br>own small businesses.<br><br>If you really think you can compare the two, I've got a bridge in<br>Brooklyn to sell you.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Do you think the Republicans will start to complain about the public<br>exposure of their own PP loan forgiveness when they ranted about the<br>Biden's student loan program?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
