<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If God doesn't exist, then objective morality doesn't exist either.<br>Therefore, anything is okay. Marriage is unnecessary. Abortion is okay.<br>Sex is okay. Murder is okay. Violating dignity is okay.<br><br>Remember, we're talking *morally* here. People are free to *legally*<br>come together and collectively decide that they don't want murder, or<br>abortion, or sex outside of marriage, if they choose.<br><br>But if God doesn't exist, then morally, anything is acceptable.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
