<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I love your story, but if I were to boil it down, I think the question<br>you're trying to ask is how do I know if it is God speaking to me?<br><br>There are so many voices that come at us on a daily basis, it's hard to<br>pick out God's voice over the din. So how do we do it?<br><br>- Practice listening to him. We do this by spending time with Him.<br>  You know when someone calls you (presume it's a time before Caller ID<br>  --- I know, shocker) and you don't even have to ask who it is because<br>  you know their voice so well that you automatically know it's them?<br>  You can get to the same place with God. The more time you spend in<br>  communion with Him, the easier it will become to pick out His voice.<br>  But you have to listen to *only* His voice, and that means freeing<br>  your heart and your mind of the distractions of this world, and<br>  Satan's accompanying voices. Spending time in quiet isolation and<br>  prayer, free of worldly distractions, will help you to hear His voice.<br>- Test His words against the Bible. Now, I know what you're<br>  thinking. Jesus said, "Do not put the Lord your God to the test." But<br>  the Bereans tested everything that Paul and Silas said against the<br>  Bible: "Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in<br>  Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and<br>  examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true."<br>  (Acts 17:11 NIV) You can always trust that the Bible contains the word<br>  of God, and you can rest assured that whatever you hear from God will<br>  never contradict what is written in the Bible. This is one way God<br>  trains us to recognize His voice: we compare what He says against the<br>  Bible. Satan will try to slip his voice in there too. The Bible says<br>  he "masquerades as an angel of light" (2 Corinthians 11:14). But you<br>  can stand firm in the truth, because what God says will always match<br>  the Bible.<br>- See how His word makes you feel. When God speaks to you, His words<br>  will never tear you down or condemn you. His correction is so loving,<br>  you'll feel conviction and want to change, but you won't feel shame.<br>  If you do, you can be sure that it is Satan at work. That's how he<br>  gets you to defy God; he makes you feel shame (a powerful emotion).<br><br>If you practice this regularly, and you use it to test what you are<br>being told and you find it trustworthy, bring this to your parents in<br>boldness, knowing that you are indeed hearing from God.<br><br>Remember that they may not believe you. Listen to them until you are old<br>enough to make your own decisions, they are your parents and they<br>deserve your respect. But once you can decide for yourself, pray about<br>it, practice it, and then do it.<br><br>Good luck and be blessed!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
