<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can I be compelled to sue my husband against my will due to unpaid<br>wages his entity owes me due to the negligence of my co-employer<br>refusing to reimburse him for my wages?**<br><br>***You cannot be compelled to sue anyone against your will. Whether or<br>not you ever file a lawsuit is entirely your decision.***<br><br>No one can compel you to file any lawsuit unless you choose to do so.<br>You simply may not get your wages back, but no one can compel you to<br>file a lawsuit, ever.<br><br>There's not enough detail to really understand exactly what is going on<br>between the three parties (you, your husband, and the co-employer). Is<br>your husband in a business partnership with the co-employer? Do they<br>have a legal business entity (i.e. an LLC) under which they conduct<br>business? Are you an "on-the-books" employee of the LLC? Or do you<br>sideline for your husband? There are too many variables which are<br>missing from your question to be able to really give you a solid answer.<br><br>I'd suggest talking to an attorney in your area who specializes in<br>employment law.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
