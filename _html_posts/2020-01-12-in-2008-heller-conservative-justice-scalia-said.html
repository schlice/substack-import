<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In 2008 Heller, Conservative Justice Scalia said " the Second<br>Amendment right is not unlimited." What limitations do you find<br>reasonable and acceptable, and why?**<br><br>I think the ones we have are pretty good. Those judged by a court to be<br>mentally defective may not own guns. Those convicted of felonies may not<br>own guns (although if I had my way, I would limit this to violent<br>felonies).<br><br>Criminals, of course, care nothing about the law, so violent felons will<br>possess guns if they choose anyway. The mentally defective must be<br>protected from themselves, so that is a different story altogether.<br><br>So is there a way to make criminals care more about the law?<br><br>Sure. *Start enforcing it consistently.*<br><br>Criminals know they will likely never be charged for a gun crime.<br>Prosecutors frequently plea bargain the gun charge away to convict on a<br>"bigger" crime. Criminals use the gun charge as leverage to get a<br>reduced sentence in plea deals.<br><br>This practice must stop if we hope to reduce crime committed with guns.<br>If we do not, criminals will continue to use guns to commit crime,<br>unafraid of any consequence, because there truly is none.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
