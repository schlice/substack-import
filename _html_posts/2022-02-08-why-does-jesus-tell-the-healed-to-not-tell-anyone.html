<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Jesus didn't want news of his miracles to distract people from his<br>message or disrupt his mission. However, like was recorded in Mark<br>1:41--42, when he healed the man of leprosy and told that man to keep<br>quiet, the man did not obey. Subsequently, Jesus had to move his<br>ministry outside of the city, and into the desert areas.<br><br>> As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed<br>> outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to Him from<br>> everywhere --- Mark 1:45<br><br>Ultimately, Jesus didn't want people to focus on the healing. He wanted<br>them to focus on the message.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why does Jesus tell the healed to not tell anyone?
