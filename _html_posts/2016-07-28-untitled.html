<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Boberg utilizes both the rotating barrel and the bullpup-style<br>rearward magazine feed. The main spring on the Boberg is really small,<br>such that you are surprised that it's actually the main spring. It has a<br>very light slide action. Boberg claims that this gun is favored by those<br>with limited upper body strength because it is just so easy to rack.<br><br>I've noticed a common complaint among reviewers of the Boberg: if you<br>don't fully rack the slide when reloading, the round can get jammed on<br>the ramp and it's a pig to clear. It's a different sort of muscle memory<br>mechanism than simply releasing the slide to reload and it will take<br>practice, but the fact that it has a longer barrel in a smaller package<br>is simply awesome. I personally love the design; this would make a<br>fantastic back up gun or concealed pistol, since you're really not too<br>worried about reloading your backup gun.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-interesting-current-handgun-under-1500/answer/Mike-S-1686<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
