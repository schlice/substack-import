<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Hi<br>[Emily(https://www.quora.com/profile/Emily-Gleave)]{.qlink_container},<br>thanks for the A2A.<br><br>However, I don't have anything more to add other than what [[David<br>Saylock](https://www.quora.com/profile/David-Saylock)]{.qlink_container}<br>already said.<br><br>How much time you spend in the air depends entirely on your AFSC. This<br>is true for officers as well as enlisted personnel. However, even some<br>AFSCs that wouldn't normally be considered flying AFSCs can have some<br>airborne components. For example, as a Communications officer, most of<br>my assignments would be in a ground station, but some jobs could be as<br>part of an aircrew (such as on an airborne command center or on an<br>airborne electronic warfare or surveillance platform).<br><br>The majority of jobs in the Air Force are *support* jobs. They support<br>the Air Force mission: Fly, Fight, and Win.<br><br>Unless you're specifically in an aircrew, or in an airborne assignment,<br>your time will be on the ground (unless you're travelling someplace).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
