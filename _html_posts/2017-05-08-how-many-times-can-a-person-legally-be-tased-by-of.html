<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer to both questions is "it depends."<br><br>> *How many times can a person legally be tased by officers?*<br><br>As far as I know, there isn't any legal limit to how many times a person<br>can be hit with a Taser. Clearly, there is no Federal statute that<br>mandates any limit; there may be state laws which apply. Mostly, this<br>will be covered by department policy, since a Taser is a<br>"less-than-lethal" device. How many times the Taser is activated will be<br>a matter of the department's "use of force" policy. Therefore, in almost<br>all departments, every Taser deployment, including how many times the<br>Taser was activated, will be reviewed by that department's internal<br>review team during a Use of Force (UOF) Review. These reviews are<br>conducted periodically or as-needed to review every use of force by an<br>officer. A use of force is anything from applying hands all the way up<br>the force continuum to application of deadly force.<br><br>> *How much training is required to actually operate one?*<br><br>Again, there is no Federal standard. States determine levels of training<br>required of officers who are certified peace officers in that state. A<br>state level department called POST (Peace Officer Standardization and<br>Training) reviews all training classes and certifies all officers<br>trained under those classes as peace officers.<br><br>In the vast majority of states, officers will take a training class<br>learning the functions of the device, how it works, and will have the<br>opportunity to deploy it. Additionally, in almost all states that I know<br>of (almost; I know of at least one state that does not require this), an<br>officer will be hit with a Taser. However, for sake of expediency,<br>officers are not hit with barbs; a training Taser with<br>permanently-attached wires and alligator clips is used.<br><br>In our department (though not true in every department), every item on<br>the duty belt will be approved by the department and the officer must<br>have been certified on the use of that item before it can be worn as<br>part of the uniform. The Taser is included in that requirement.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
