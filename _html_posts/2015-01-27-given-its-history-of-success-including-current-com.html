<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [NOTE: I don\'t believe the A-10 should be mothballed. I<br>think the Army should fly it. But that\'s my personal opinion and my<br>\"if I were king for a day\" wish.\<br>\<br>The Air Force position:\<br>]<br><br>- There are other aircraft in the inventory that can effectively perform<br>  the Close-Air Support (CAS) role, like the F-15E, the F-16 and the<br>  F-22. The A-10 is a single-mission aircraft.\<br>- The money is needed for the F-35A, which will be operational in 2016.<br>- The face of warfare is changing. Improved anti-aircraft capabilities<br>  and laser guided munitions threaten the stagnant design of the A-10.<br><br>Dissenters believe that the A-10 is the most capable CAS aircraft we<br>have (which it is) and that cutting it will put ground troops at risk.<br>Air Force senior staff notes that, along with the points listed above,<br>field commanders continually cite surveillance, reconnaissance, and<br>intelligence as the largest shortfalls we face in the field. CAS is a<br>lower priority in terms of combat operation \"pain points.\"\<br>\<br>General Mark A. Welsh, current Chief of Staff of the Air Force, himself<br>a former A-10 pilot, says \"We used the standard DoD planning scenarios.<br>The results very clearly showed that cutting the A-10 fleet was the<br>lowest-risk option, from an operational perspective, of a bunch of bad<br>options. While no one is happy, from a military perspective, it\'s the<br>right decision, and it\'s representative of the extremely difficult<br>choices that we\'re facing in the budget today.\" (*Checkpoints,* Dec,<br>2014, p. 16)<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
