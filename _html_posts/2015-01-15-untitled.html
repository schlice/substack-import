<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [In my opinion, the \"average\" gun rights enthusiast has<br>been to the range at least once in his life and has a fair idea how well<br>he is able to aim and fire and make the lead go where you tell it to<br>go.\<br>\<br>As far as what you will do when the pressure is on, no one can really<br>know exactly how they will respond until the pressure is really on. He<br>may be BMOC (big man on campus) now, but when the bad guys actually<br>brandish weapons, he may turn into a blubbering gelatinous mass of<br>quivering weakness. You can train all you want, but until the fit hits<br>the shan for real, you never know how someone will actually<br>respond.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/How-realistic-is-the-average-gun-rights-enthusiast-about-their-ability-to-use-their-firearm-for-self-defense-home-protection-without-being-a-danger-to-themselves-or-bystanders/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
