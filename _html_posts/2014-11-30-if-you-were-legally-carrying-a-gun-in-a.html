<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [If you are knowingly violating policy and concealing a<br>handgun in a place where you are forbidden by policy to do so, you<br>probably have the conviction of morals to violate the policy you know to<br>be wrong to safeguard your own life, or someone else\'s life.\<br>\<br>That being the case, you are already willing to face the consequences of<br>violating policy.\<br>\<br>So of course you would act, and then use the subsequent dust-up to point<br>out the absurdity of the policy (i.e. if I was following policy, person<br>X would be dead, and I would probably be dead too).\<br>\<br>Could you be fired? Certainly. Absurd or not, the business has the right<br>to set policy. If there is a sufficient dust-up though, I suspect that<br>the business would not fire you, because it would look bad for<br>them.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
