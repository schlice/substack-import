<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>- Something with an extended magazine. More bullets are better in this<br>  case.\<br>- Something reasonably low-caliber. It\'s more accurate, and if you\'re<br>  hit in the head by a .22, you\'ll be just as dead as if you\'re hit in<br>  the head by a .50. Some may argue 9mm at this point, but I want the<br>  accuracy over the stopping power. Personal preference, I guess.\<br>- Something I can fairly accurately hip-fire. I need to kill the main<br>  shooter quickly, so that will be a hip shot. Then I can move to cover<br>  and take out the rest.\<br><br>So I might take a Ruger with an extended mag. And a whole bunch of extra<br>mags too.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
