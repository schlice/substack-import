<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We're going to have to be very careful to parse our words succinctly in<br>order to properly answer your question.<br><br>Most religions already do coexist harmoniously. With the exception of<br>one major world religion's radical arm, I don't really see any religions<br>waging holy war anymore. They kinda got over that a few hundred years<br>ago.<br><br>Now here's where we have to be cautious with our words.<br><br>*You will never get different religions to believe the same thing.*<br><br>Every religion which makes truth claims will claim that their religion<br>is "right," and logically, by extension, all other religions which do<br>not believe as they do are "wrong." This is true for all religions.<br><br>Yes, some religions say that all religions are right and they all<br>believe the same thing, but that's very disingenuous. Not all religions<br>believe the same thing. Just as an example, Christianity says that Jesus<br>rose from the dead; Islam says that Jesus never died. Christianity says<br>that Jesus is God; Judaism says that He is not. Clearly, they do not<br>believe the same things.<br><br>\<br><br>So here's the takeaway: Religions understand each other. We tolerate<br>other believers who wish to believe in whatever they want.<br><br>But different religions all believe differently. That's why there are<br>different religions. If they all believed the same thing, there'd be<br>only one religion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
