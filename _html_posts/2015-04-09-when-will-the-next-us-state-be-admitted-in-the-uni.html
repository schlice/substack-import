<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [DC will never become a state. Period.\<br>\<br>Puerto Rico will become a state once we get a majority in Congress<br>(Democrat) and the White House that will support it. I don\'t see it<br>happening before 2025.\<br>\<br>Nevertheless, Puerto Rico has finally agreed to petition the United<br>States for statehood. It was only just a few years ago that they<br>requested statehood.\<br>\<br>But they might want to think again. According to [[a new GAO<br>report](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=4ada07&url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14-31){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="gao.gov"}]{.qlink_container}, statehood would be very costly<br>for Puerto Rico\'s economy:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>> \A\s a result of statehood, changes to Puerto Rico government<br>> spending and revenue could ultimately affect the government\'s efforts<br>> to maintain a balanced budged\... statehood could result in reduced<br>> Puerto Rico tax revenue. If Puerto Rico\'s government wished to<br>> maintain pre-statehood tax burdens for individual and corporations, it<br>> would need to lower its tax rates, which could reduce tax revenues.<br><br>\<br>Statehood would mean that every day Puerto Ricans would be saddled with<br>\$2.3 billion in new federal taxes that they do not pay today. This<br>would essentially cut in half the revenue the territory currently<br>receives, which would be disastrous for the island\'s economy.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
