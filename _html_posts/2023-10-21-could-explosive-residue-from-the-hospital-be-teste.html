<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sure, it could.<br><br>But to what end? Who would do the testing? Why would we do such a thing?<br><br>We already have copious amounts of evidence to show that Hamas does this<br>regularly (attack their own compatriots in order to blame Israel) and<br>Israel never does this (indiscriminately bomb civilian facilities, even<br>when they know that they are being used to wage war).<br><br>The effort isn't worth the information it would yield.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
