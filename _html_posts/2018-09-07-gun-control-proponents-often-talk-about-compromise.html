<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Gun control proponents often talk about compromise. What proposals<br>have been made to give in exchange for what they would like to take?**<br><br>Usually, their answer to that question is, "Well, you still get to keep<br>*some* types of guns, but you know, those scary assault-type weapons, no<br>one should have those."<br><br>That's the compromise. You still get to keep some types of guns.<br><br>You and I both know that this is not the actual definition of<br>"compromise." That's because gun grabbers aren't really after compromise<br>when they talk about compromise. They're actually after complete and<br>total disarmament of the population. They can't admit to that because it<br>would totally destroy their platform. But it's true.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
