<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br>this day, to keep alive a numerous people (Genesis 50:20) speak to the<br>gospel-good news?]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>So it's easier for us to understand in a more modern translation. So<br>let's look at the passage in ESV:<br><br>> As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to<br>> bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are<br>> today.<br><br>This verse is at the end of the story of Joseph, when he revealed<br>himself to his brothers at the Pharaoh's temple. After his brothers sold<br>him into slavery, and after a very long and tumultuous journey up the<br>proverbial chain of command, Joseph had been appointed the Pharaoh's<br>viceroy, readying the nation for the upcoming famine. Joseph's brothers<br>travelled from Canaan to see the viceroy to get some grain, not<br>realizing that Joseph (whom they had sold into slavery years before) was<br>actually the viceroy in question.<br><br>Just the verse before, Joseph told them that he was not going to seek<br>any revenge on them for selling him into slavery, and that he had turned<br>all vengeance over to God. He then speaks the target verse, proclaiming<br>that even what they meant for evil, God had turned to good. He doesn't<br>discount what they did, and that in fact, they meant it for evil. But as<br>he already said in Genesis 45:5--7, Joseph insists that God's ability to<br>turn any situation for His good is more powerful than any scheme that<br>any evil can devise, or any evil that man can foist upon man.<br><br>What does this mean for us today? God asks Christians to view our lives<br>this way.<br><br>> And we know that for those who love God all things work together for<br>> good, for those who are called according to his purpose. --- Romans<br>> 8:28 ESV<br><br>Those "all thing" include those things which were meant for evil against<br>us. God still uses them for good. Now, God does not promise that evil<br>will never happen to us. But He does promise that He will always care<br>for us (cf Romans 8:31) and that nothing can ever separate us from His<br>love (cf Romans 8:34--38).<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
