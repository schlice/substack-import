<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If someone breaks the law in a US national park, how are they<br>prosecuted (by the federal government, state government, etc)?**<br><br>As with all legal questions, the answer is "it depends."<br><br>Law enforcement in national parks is a function governed by several<br>pieces of legislation, and how the National Park Service (NPS) enforces<br>laws depends on the law broken and the jurisdiction.<br><br>Laws covered in National Parks. Law in national parks is generally<br>covered by Title 36, Code of Federal Regulations. The NPS also enforces<br>United States Code. Title 16, Title 18 and Title 21 of the United States<br>Code are enforced most frequently.<br><br>Additionally, NPS generally also has the authority to enforce any state<br>law not covered already by federal laws under the Assimilative Crimes<br>Act, 18 U.S.C. ยง 13. However, by policy the NPS cannot charge violators<br>with a state offense that has a harsher penalty than an equivalent<br>federal law already on the books. To that end, if a crime is covered by<br>a state law and a federal law, NPS will enforce the statute with the<br>lesser penalty.<br><br>Jurisdiction. There are several types of National Park Service<br>jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is set by the enabling legislation for each<br>individual unit of the NPS and is considered part of the Special<br>Maritime and Territorial Jurisdiction of the United States. Law<br>enforcement on NPS lands with exclusive jurisdiction is solely conducted<br>by NPS Law Enforcement Rangers (field officers) or the US Park Police.<br>Many NPS units have *concurrent jurisdiction* and share law enforcement<br>authority with their state and/or local county law enforcement agencies.<br>Some National Park Service units have *proprietary* or *partial<br>jurisdiction* where law enforcement authority for certain serious<br>incidents lies with the state or county. Most NPS units have memorandums<br>of understanding with outside law enforcement agencies, so that policies<br>are in place when and if outside agency assistance is needed.<br><br>Therefore, depending on which law was violated, which law will be<br>charged, and which agencies have jurisdiction, either NPS will charge<br>and prosecute through the nearest US Attorney's office, or NPS will turn<br>the offender over to state or local authorities who will prosecute using<br>NPS' evidence through their own District Attorney's<br>office.\[1\](#gFkPd){#cite-gFkPd .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-gFkPd){.citation_index} [[National Park Service -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=69ffd4&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park_Service%23Law_enforcement){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
