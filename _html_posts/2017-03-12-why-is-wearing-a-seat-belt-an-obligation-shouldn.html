<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The driver should be obligated to wear a seat belt. Just read all<br>the answers to this question to find out why. Primarily it is to keep<br>the driver in a position in the car so they can keep control of the<br>vehicle.<br><br>Passengers under 18 should be obligated to wear seat belts anywhere<br>in the car, front or back. People are stupid, and parents are even more<br>so. Don't kill kids through parental stupidity. Sometimes we have to<br>mandate things to get past stupid parents.<br><br>But beyond those two restrictions, no one else should have to wear seat<br>belts. For everyone except the driver, it should be your choice as to<br>whether or not you choose to wear a seat belt. They force the front-seat<br>passenger to wear a seat belt in my state, but they don't force<br>motorcycle riders to wear helmets. I can't understand the lack of logic<br>in that. The only thing I can figure is that the front seat passenger<br>might fly around the interior of the vehicle in a crash and somehow<br>interfere with the driver maintaining control of the vehicle, but even<br>that's a stretch. They mandated front seat passengers wear seat belts<br>after that location in the car became known as the "death seat" because<br>so many front seat passengers were killed in auto accidents, and<br>legislators had to "do something" about that.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
