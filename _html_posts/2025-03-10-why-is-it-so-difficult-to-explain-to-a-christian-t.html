<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Well,<br>[Vlad(https://www.quora.com/profile/Vlad-2082)]{.qlink_container},<br>most Christians haven't really thought about it much. As [[David<br>LaRocca](https://www.quora.com/profile/David-LaRocca-6)]{.qlink_container}<br>said in his excellent answer, most Christians don't require objective<br>evidence because they believe by faith.<br><br>Among those who *have* thought about it, there are two explanations why<br>it is difficult to explain it to them.<br><br>1.  They already know that the Bible isn't "objective" evidence, so they<br>    see the "objective" evidence in other areas of God's creation, such<br>    as the information resident in DNA, the creation of the first life,<br>    and anthropic fine-tuning.<br>2.  They're using your own standards of objectivity against you. Since<br>    you can claim (without any concrete evidence) that the first life<br>    spontaneously self-generated from non-living random chemicals, and<br>    you can claim (again with zero evidence) that macroevolution (where<br>    one kind of species evolves into another kind of species) occurred<br>    and is the most likely cause for our existence, then they can claim<br>    without objective evidence that the Bible was inspired by God. The<br>    amounts of "objective" evidence in all of those claims are equal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
