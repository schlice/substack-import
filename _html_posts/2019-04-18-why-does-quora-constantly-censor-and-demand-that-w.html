<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why does Quora constantly censor and demand that we waive our rights<br>under the 1st and 4th Amendment?**<br><br>Quora is a private organization and is not subject to the 1st or 4th<br>Amendments. Those amendments prevent the government from taking<br>actions that violate your rights. Private businesses can conduct their<br>private business in whatever way they choose; you don't have a right to<br>free speech on someone else's platform.<br><br>Additionally, you agreed to the user policy and the community rules when<br>you joined Quora. It's a little hard to argue that their policies are<br>unfair after you agreed to follow them.<br><br>**Libel isn\'t protected even on the internet, but our right to privacy<br>is and an opposing answer with facts isn\'t libel nor violates it.**<br><br>Something else you clearly don't understand about Quora: **The community<br>owns questions. The answerer owns his or her own answer.**<br><br>This is why you can freely edit any question (since the community owns<br>it once it is asked), but the answerer owns his or her own answer, along<br>with any comments he or she may or may not permit to his answer. On<br>Quora, you can answer a question, and you don't even have to allow<br>comments to your answer. There is no right to be able to post comments.<br><br>However, libel is lying about someone or something which causes<br>demonstrable harm. You can actually commit libel in an answer, if the<br>victim can prove that your lie harmed them in some way. I can't comment<br>about whether or not this could happen with something you posted, but<br>libel is always a potential issue in any forum or any medium in which<br>you can print things about someone else. Libel is a separate legal issue<br>which is really outside of Quora's purview. However, if they are<br>informed of a libelous post of any kind, they have the right to take it<br>down and retain it for appropriate legal action.<br><br>Again, it's their forum, you're just a willing participant.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
