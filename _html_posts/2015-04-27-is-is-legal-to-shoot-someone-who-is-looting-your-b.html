<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In general, it is not legal to defend your business<br>using deadly force, regardless of whether or not there is a state of<br>emergency in effect, and whether or not you see a visible police<br>presence. You can only defend your person using deadly force, not<br>your possessions. You cannot defend your business using deadly<br>force.\<br>\<br>If you post armed guards outside your store, these brave (and slightly<br>off-center) people are putting their physical bodies in the way of<br>looters. They can then use a self-defense justification if they must<br>open fire on a looter. But that\'s not a job I\'d wish on anyone.\<br>\<br>To defend your business, you should do the following:\<br>]<br><br>1.  Add gates or rollup doors. You can make it very difficult for<br>    someone to actually get into your store. Some gates can lock from<br>    the inside as well, making it next to impossible to get in from the<br>    outside. Looters will move on to softer targets.\<br>2.  Add security cameras. Looters like to loot, but they don\'t like to<br>    let anyone know that they loot. Threaten to post video of anyone<br>    looting your store online.\<br>3.  Call the police. I know you are thinking that this is silly during a<br>    riot, but you should be on record that looters were attacking your<br>    store. Helps with the insurance claim.\<br><br>You should not:\<br><br>- set up booby traps (this is universally illegal)\<br>- fire warning shots (depending on the circumstances, this can be seen<br>  as a threat, which may be a felony)<br><br>I should also mention that while this is illegal in Baltimore, in Texas<br>you can defend your store using deadly force if you can show that using<br>non-deadly force would put your own life or the lives of others at risk.<br>It\'s a narrow exception.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
