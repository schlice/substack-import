<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [You go to jail for assault (or assault and battery,<br>depending on the state), he becomes the victim and you become the<br>aggressor. Besides giving you a criminal record, it also taints future<br>possibilities of prosecution for him because he \"looks like\" the good<br>guy and you look like the bad guy. You should be able to explain that to<br>a jury, but why take that risk?\<br>\<br>Three years is well within the statute of limitations of nearly all<br>states for the crime of rape. It\'s usually 10-20 years, so he can still<br>be held accountable for his crime. I know you don\'t have money to<br>retain an attorney, but a consultation is normally free, and you never<br>know, if a lawyer feels particularly passionate about it, he/she may<br>feel inclined to take the case *pro bono* so that you can get some<br>justice, especially if they feel like they can win.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
