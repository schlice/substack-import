<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>We cannot answer this question. If there are restrictions in your<br>Governing Documents (the CC&Rs, the Bylaws, or your Rules), then perhaps<br>you have a complaint.<br><br>And if there is nothing in your Governing Documents, and nothing in<br>local or state law laying down any requirements, then it's likely that<br>the Board has no obligation to do what you're asking.<br><br>You might find it helpful before you vote on the special assessment to<br>have them, but if it's not in your Governing Documents, you may not be<br>able to force them to do so.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
