<br/><br/>Answer Comment<br/><br/><br/>Content: [I disagree with the statement that someone not reporting a<br/>crime they witness is an accessory after the fact. Simple failing to<br/>report does not make one an accessory, since in general, an accessory<br/>actively has knowledge of the crime and the actors and intentionally<br/>fails to report (conceals) in order to aid and abet the perpetrator. The<br/>salient statement:\<br/>\<br/>Whoever, knowing that an offense against the United States has been<br/>committed, receives, relieves, comforts or assists the offender ***in<br/>order to hinder or prevent his apprehension, trial or punishment***, is<br/>an accessory after the fact.\<br/>\<br/>Someone who simply chooses not to report a crime because \"they don\'t<br/>want to\" is not doing so in order to hinder or prevent apprehension,<br/>trial, or punishment. Although their inaction certainly may hinder or<br/>prevent apprehension, that is not his intention. While we do judge<br/>action and not intention in the law, in practice, the<br/>accessory-after-the-fact law has not historically been used in this<br/>way.\<br/>\<br/>I must also say the same about misprision of felony. The impetus, as I<br/>read it, is that in order for the statute to apply, the person must be<br/>willful in his attempt to conceal the crime by falsifying records,<br/>willfully concealing evidence, or willfully attempting to obstruct an<br/>investigation.\<br/>\<br/>The OP stated that if you simply witness a crime and fail to report it<br/>and it is later discovered that you were a witness, what could happen. I<br/>would think that the prosecutor would have to make that link between the<br/>observer and the failure to report; they would have to show that the<br/>observer failed to report specifically in order to obstruct the<br/>investigation. I would think that simple failure to act would not be<br/>recognized under this statute.\<br/>\<br/>Do you have some relevant case law I can review?]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Answer:<br/>https://www.quora.com/If-you-witness-a-crime-in-the-U-S-and-dont-report-it-and-it-is-later-discovered-that-you-knew-about-it-what-are-the-potential-penalties/answer/Dan-Robb-2<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
