<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why are people so die hard over the second amendment? We don't stand a<br>chance against the government by simply having the right to own<br>firearms! Maybe if the ball and musket was still around things would be<br>even.**<br><br>1.  Read up on [[asymmetric<br>    warfare](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=3c3bcc&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_warfare){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. Tell the goat<br>    herders in Afghanistan that they don't stand a chance against the US<br>    military, while they're systematically killing our troops with<br>    nothing more than old unexploded ordnance and a burner cell phone.<br>2.  We may not *win* against the US military...wait, I need to re-think<br>    this. We have somewhere north of 100 million gun owners in the<br>    United States. Our military [[stands<br>    at](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=84ccf5&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces%23Personnel){.external_link<br>    rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>    onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>    qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} approximately 1.3<br>    million, with another 800,000 in reserves, bringing the total to<br>    just about 2 million. Therefore, as a fighting force, we outnumber<br>    the US military 50 to 1. And there's a good chance that a majority<br>    of those military members will never turn their backs on the<br>    Constitution and will never turn their guns on US citizens.<br>3.  If you're reading bullet 2 and thinking, "Yeah, but the US military<br>    is the best in the world, and we're just a bunch of rank amateurs,"<br>    you should read up on another war where a bunch of rank amateurs<br>    defeated the best military in the world. The Revolutionary War. We<br>    did it once...<br>4.  But even if we didn't "win," that win would be very costly for<br>    the US military, in terms of dollars and lives, rivaling the last<br>    Civil War. There won't be much of a country to lord over once this<br>    war is done.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
