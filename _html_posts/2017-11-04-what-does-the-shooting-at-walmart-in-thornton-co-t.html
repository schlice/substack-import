<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>From the news coverage I've looked at, it appears that the police were<br>"hampered" in their review of CCTV footage because they saw people with<br>guns and focused on them. Then, they figured out that the people they<br>were looking at were not actually shooting, so they had to rewind and<br>start all over.<br><br>No offense, Thornton PD, but that's a fairly inefficient way to weed out<br>who the shooter is, unless you have multiple people reviewing footage<br>looking at every person with a gun until you find the shooter.<br><br>Besides, every one of those people has the right in this country to<br>defend themselves, so *what does it say about "good guns?"*<br>*Absolutely nothing**,* other than the police focus on the wrong<br>things when they review surveillance footage, and it causes them to<br>waste time. It's certainly not an indictment of the people who used<br>their Second Amendment rights to defend themselves.<br><br>I know "across the pond" you're probably looking at this going, "well,<br>if those people simply hadn't drawn their guns (or better yet, didn't<br>have them at all), the CCTV footage would have been scanned faster, the<br>actual shooter found faster, and caught faster."<br><br>Except the people would be unable to defend themselves. And in the<br>United States, the people have the right (and the responsibility) to<br>defend themselves, as it is no one else's responsibility to do it for<br>them.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
