<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a house has a sliding wall down the middle of a large room, two<br>closets and 2 windows, can this space be considered 2 bedrooms? Would a<br>building inspector or lender have any problems with it?**<br><br>It should be fine to call it two bedrooms. However, as you know, all<br>states are different, and each state can define a bedroom differently.<br><br>Some states may consider the sliding wall as a "door" and therefore<br>classify the space as one room. Others may consider the sliding wall as<br>a wall, and the two individual spaces, both meeting the requirements of<br>a bedroom, can be considered individual rooms.<br><br>In general, most states follow the [[International Residential<br>Code](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=451cae&url=https://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c%3Dbldrs_lenders_raters.nh_IRC){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="energystar.gov"}]{.qlink_container} which states, among<br>other things, that the rooms must be a minimum of 7 feet in any<br>horizontal direction. On the height issue, at least 50% of the room must<br>have 7 foot ceilings, even though the rest of the room can be smaller.<br>The room can be no smaller than 70 sq ft. (so your 2′x35′ room won't<br>work, even though it's 70 sq ft).<br><br>Additionally, each "room" must have two egresses. Generally one of these<br>is an entrance from the house, and another one is usually the window or<br>another door.<br><br>A bedroom must have a window to the outside. The window can be<br>between 24 and 44 inches from the floor. It needs at least 5.7 square<br>feet for the opening, and it must measure no less than 24 inches high<br>and 20 inches wide.<br><br>A bedroom also needs installed heating ducts, and a separate light.<br><br>While it's nice that both rooms have a closet, **the closet is actually<br>not a legal requirement to make a bedroom.**<br><br>I would think that if you wanted to call them two bedrooms, both spaces<br>would have to meet the minimum definition of a bedroom with the wall<br>closed. In other words, with the wall closed, both rooms need two<br>egresses not counting the wall, both need appropriate windows, and both<br>must be 70 sq ft and have no horizontal area smaller than 7 feet.<br><br>If your second "bedroom" is using the sliding wall as an "egress," I<br>think a real estate agent or a home inspector would have a hard time<br>classifying it as a "wall" instead of a "door," which would also mean<br>that you can't call one of the partitioned spaces a separate "room." You<br>can call it a "retreat" from the main room, but if it doesn't meet all<br>of the definitions of a bedroom, it can't be listed as a bedroom.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
