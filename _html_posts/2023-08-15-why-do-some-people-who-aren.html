<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because some people who aren't even conservative in America recognize<br>that at some point (which they are still undecided about, which is why<br>you get a range between 12 and 30 weeks), that "clump of cells" becomes<br>"a baby" and makes the magical leap from "something which can be excised<br>like a tumor" to "a living human being with a right to exist in just the<br>same way that you and I do."<br><br>So at a certain point, it's not about the woman's body *exclusively* any<br>more to these people. It's about the woman's body *and* the baby's body,<br>and after that point, they believe that the baby has as much right to<br>live as the mother does.<br><br>\<br><br>WARNING: I'm getting on my soapbox.<br><br>So it's important to note that I'm not one of those people who aren't<br>even conservative. I am a religious conservative. I am one of those<br>"forced birthers," as I'm derisively called (among other things which I<br>shall not repeat in polite company). I believe the baby has equal rights<br>to every other living human being, because I believe the baby is indeed<br>a human being (albeit at a very early stage of development) and deserves<br>the same equal right to life as all of us do.<br><br>At this point, the pro-choicers will often trot out the same old tired<br>arguments, most of them pointing to the extreme to justify the middle,<br>things like problem pregnancies, or rape, or "it's my body," or the<br>latest bit of logical gymnastics, "I can consent to sex without<br>consenting to pregnancy."<br><br>*None of that matters.*<br><br>Let's discuss what does matter, and how we move the discussion forward.<br><br>Pro-lifers like myself need to recognize that pregnancy is hard.<br>Pregnancy is probably one of the hardest things a woman will ever have<br>to go through, physically, in her entire life. And it is only 40 weeks<br>out of the \~4030 weeks that an average woman lives in the United<br>States. We need to respect and be sensitive to that fact, as we think<br>about legally restricting the ability of a woman to terminate a<br>pregnancy.<br><br>Pro-choicers need to recognize that biologically, the thing growing in<br>the mother's uterus (the place designed precisely for this activity) is<br>absolutely a human being, a member of *Homo Sapiens.* Pro-choicers need<br>to admit that abortion kills a human being. Not a clump of cells,<br>not a fetus (which is just Latin for "baby"), but a human being. And it<br>is alive. And you are killing it.<br><br>This can actually be appropriate, if the people decide that we are<br>not going to respect the baby's right to life before a certain time<br>period. But we need to be honest about what we're doing. If you<br>can't even admit to yourself what you're doing, then you really need to<br>stop and reflect on what it is that you are actually advocating for. You<br>are indeed advocating for the destruction of a human life, full stop.<br>*We may, as a society, permit this destruction*, as we do with convicted<br>murderers on Death Row. We may, as a society, decide that the baby<br>(before 12--30 weeks, as above) does not have the right to life. That's<br>something we can decide.<br><br>Today, we decide that at a state level. Some states have that line<br>somewhere in that range. Some have it earlier. Some have it *way*<br>earlier (I'm looking at you, Florida), and some have *no line at all*<br>(I'm looking at you, Texas and California). This is as it should be, as<br>it is up to the people in each state to decide for themselves what<br>their laws should be.<br><br>But it is not up to anyone to decide for ***anyone else in any other<br>state* what their laws *must* be.**<br><br>In the vast majority of cases, you can travel to another state to kill<br>your baby (remember, we have to admit to ourselves that this is what we<br>are doing), because the majority of the people in your state do not<br>approve of this action. Again, this is as it should be. You have the<br>freedom to relocate to another state if you don't like the policies in<br>your state. You may not have the financial means to do so, but you<br>always have the *freedom* to do so. And there are support organizations<br>on both sides of the issue which can help you carry out your wishes.<br><br>Cue nasty comments in 3...2...1...<br><br>\<br><br>*NOTE: My delete button works very well. Any unhelpful comments about me<br>will be deleted. Anything that violates BNBR will be deleted, and you<br>will be blocked and reported.*<br><br>*If you want to discuss, let's have a civil, polite discussion. Do your<br>best to leave your emotion at the door (as difficult as it may be with<br>this topic).*<br><br>*Thank you.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
