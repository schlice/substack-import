<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Remember that all of this is absent exigent circumstances (i.e. an<br>appropriate-gender officer is not available or there is a time<br>criticality involved). Most departments these days will attempt to be<br>sensitive to the perceived gender of the suspect. If the suspect claims<br>to be LGBTQ, in general we will follow the perceived gender identity and<br>proceed accordingly. For example, if the suspect identifies as female,<br>we will attempt to have a female officer conduct the search.<br><br>Absent that, or when exigent circumstances are present, we will conduct<br>the search with whatever officer is available, and use the back of the<br>hand in the genitals and under and around breasts (it's difficult to<br>claim that the officer was "groping" you with the back of his hand, and<br>it's sensitive enough to feel a weapon stuffed into undergarments)<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
