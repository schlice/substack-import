As you mentioned, some<br>people do very well with mild symptoms and some people "go downhill<br>rapidly."<br><br>However, it is also true that the vast majority of people with MS will<br>never be confined to a wheelchair. Most people with MS will have mild or<br>moderately-disruptive symptoms, treatable with medications or therapy,<br>and will generally live mostly-normal lives.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
