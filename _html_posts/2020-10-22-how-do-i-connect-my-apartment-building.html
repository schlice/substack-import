<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How do I connect my apartment building\'s front door buzzer to my cell<br>phone?**<br><br>Let me see if I can provide you with an actual answer for your question.<br><br>It sounds like you're a tenant in an apartment building, and you have a<br>locked common front door with a buzzer system. If your buzzer/intercom<br>system in your apartment building is capable of dialing out to a cell<br>phone, just give your cell phone number to your landlord, and they will<br>attach your cell phone to your apartment's buzzer, so if someone buzzes<br>your apartment you can talk to them and optionally let them in. This may<br>not have been done because their system is not capable of dialing out to<br>a mobile phone. If you're not into tinkering with your apartment's<br>intercom (or you're afraid you'll break it and then be liable for the<br>repair), you may be out of luck at this point.<br><br>If your complex can dial out to a cell phone, there is a service<br>available called<br>[Ringo(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=c1274d&url=https://www.useringo.com/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="useringo.com"}]{.qlink_container} which will provide you<br>with a special Ringo phone number to give to your apartment building.<br>This will allow you to add up to five access codes for people like<br>cleaners, dog sitters, etc, so they can let themselves in. If someone<br>buzzes you and they don't have an access code, it will forward on to you<br>or up to three cell phones, so you and your roommates can all be<br>notified. But that's some more advanced stuff and may be more than what<br>you need.<br><br>Another service,<br>[Buzzly(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5ba97e&url=https://www.buzzly.co/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="buzzly.co"}]{.qlink_container}, provides even more<br>flexibility with virtual "key fobs," scheduled entry, and more. It is<br>slightly more expensive monthly, but the amount of flexibility and<br>customizability is immense.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
