<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Thank you for giving me the opportunity to finally debunk some of the<br>myths about "the Trump Bible" that have been circulating around the<br>Internet for a while now.<br><br>Let me just start by saying I take issue with the "God Bless the USA<br>Bible," also known as the "Trump Bible" because it was endorsed by<br>President Trump along with Lee Greenwood (who wrote the song "God Bless<br>The USA"). For brevity's sake (and because I'm lazy and don't want to<br>type out its proper name every time) we'll just call it "The Trump<br>Bible."<br><br>The Trump Bible is a leather-bound Bible with an embossed American flag<br>on the front, and it contains the King James Version of the Bible, along<br>with the Founding Documents (the Declaration of Independence, the<br>Constitution, the Pledge of Allegiance) and the lyrics to the song "God<br>Bless The USA" in Lee Greenwood's own handwriting. It was supposed to<br>contain the New International Version of the Bible, but Zondervan (the<br>publisher of the NIV) withdrew their version of the Bible after public<br>criticism. Instead, the KJV was included because it is already part of<br>the Public Domain and is not under copyright restrictions.<br><br>I take issue with the Bible being lumped together with our nation's<br>founding documents. Doing so tends to equate (at some level) our<br>founding documents with the Bible. While our nation was indeed founded<br>on a Judeo-Christian heritage, that does not put our founding documents<br>on par with the Bible. They are certainly great documents, *but they<br>don't hold a candle to the Bible.* Putting them together in a single<br>book tends to both improperly elevate our founding documents, and water<br>down the Bible. The Bible should stand *alone* as the inspired Word of<br>God, as the founding documents, while pretty great in their own right,<br>are not the inspired word of God.<br><br>- The Trump Bible was commissioned by the False Prophet.<br><br>First of all, there is no one "false prophet." There have been many<br>false prophets even before Jesus, and there have been many since. And if<br>you're talking about *THE* False Prophet, as far as we know, he<br>hasn't come yet.<br><br>- It was made in China<br><br>So? A lot of stuff is made in China. I bet some of the hard copy<br>printings of the Bible were printed in China. And it's not like they<br>altered the Bible: the content of the King James Version was not<br>altered, and we have enough copies of the King James Version to be able<br>to tell pretty quickly if something was altered.<br><br>- and sold for profit<br><br>Again, so what? The book actually costs money to make, so sometimes you<br>have to sell the book at a profit to pay for all of the costs in<br>manufacturing the book. If you don't want to pay for the Bible, you have<br>the Internet. Granted, the price was a little high for what you got, but<br>some people like that kind of stuff.<br><br>But you never need to pay to read the Bible. If you're reading this, you<br>clearly have internet access, so you can click this link to go to<br>[bible.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=9cd4c8&url=https://www.bible.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bible.com"}]{.qlink_container} and read every modern<br>translation of the Bible for free. You can check the Bible out of your<br>local library for free if you don't have Internet access, but if you<br>want to buy a hard copy from a bookstore, expect to pay real money for<br>it.<br><br>- It is Satan\'s tool to defile God\'s word using MAGAs praying to Trump<br>  instead of God and worship him as a living idol, the greatest<br>  heresies.<br><br>C'mon now, really? It's the King James Version of the Bible. No one is<br>praying to Trump unless they're idiots. No one worships Trump as a god.<br>Sure, plenty of people like him because he gives them a voice when they<br>never had one. But a god? I'm sure there are a few whack jobs out there<br>who think that Trump was ordained by God, but for the ***vast<br>majority*** of people, Trump is just a guy, and a flawed one at that.<br><br>So maybe tone down the rhetoric a little.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
