<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Health insurance, as an industry, will become a thing of<br>the past. People employed with the health insurance industry will have<br>to find more meaningful employment in some other industry. Perhaps they<br>could remain in insurance, but move to other companies like Allstate<br>that provide other types of insurance like home or auto.\<br>\<br>Part of the reason that this has not yet happened in the US is because<br>health insurance is big business, and health insurance lobbies in<br>Congress are very powerful. They understand that single payer will kill<br>their industry.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
