<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If you were able to legally purchase a fully automatic weapon such as<br>an M16 or submachine gun, would you, and why?**<br><br>Able by law or able by finances?<br><br>Because there answer to the first question is that everyone is able to<br>buy a fully automatic weapon. Some states have restrictions, and there<br>are additional licensing steps you need to go through, but they are<br>legal to own. The National Firearms Act limits fully automatic firearms<br>for sale to the general public. No fully automatic weapon manufactured<br>after May 19, 1986 can be registered to a civilian.<br><br>To that end, the answer to the second question: finances. All fully<br>automatic firearms made before May 19, 1986 have pretty much been<br>registered by this point, and the market has been artificially limited.<br>So let's go back to Supply and Demand 101: when demand goes up but<br>supply is constant, price goes up. To that end, prices for transferable<br>automatic weapons are very high. Where a new fully automatic M-16 might<br>cost a police department about \$500, the limited supply makes the price<br>for a transferable one well over \$10,000, and that doesn't count the<br>licensing fees and the costs for the background investigations in order<br>to be able to be licensed to own one.<br><br>So to answer your full question (now that you know the background): if I<br>had a spare \$10K, no I would not be spending it on a fully automatic<br>firearm. I'm not a collector, and I have no desire to put myself through<br>the nonsense licensing and registering that is required to own one. I am<br>quite happy with my semi-auto rifles.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
