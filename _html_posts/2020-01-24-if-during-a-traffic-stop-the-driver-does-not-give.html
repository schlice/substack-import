<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If during a traffic stop the driver does not give consent to search<br>the vehicle, how long can you legally detain the driver to allow a K9 to<br>arrive?**<br><br>First of all, if the police already have probable cause to search the<br>vehicle, they don't need your permission. In such a case, you can say as<br>many times as you want that you don't consent to a search, but it<br>doesn't matter. The issue (which you are highlighting by saying that<br>you'll have to wait for a K9) is when they don't have probable cause.<br><br>The Supreme Court ruled in *Rodriguez v. United States* that the police<br>cannot hold a driver "beyond the time reasonably required to address the<br>traffic violation." In other words, the police cannot unnecessarily<br>delay the stop to wait for a K9 to sniff the vehicle.<br><br>Also, delaying actually issuing the citation doesn't count as<br>"reasonable" in whether or not an officer "reasonably" addressed the<br>violation. It pertains to the amount of time the police should<br>reasonably take in order to complete all of the required functions in<br>the traffic stop itself.<br><br>This doesn't mean the department cannot use K9s to sniff the outside of<br>a vehicle. It simply means that they can't prolong the traffic stop to<br>wait for one to show up. If the officer has completed all of his<br>requirements for the traffic stop, he must let you go, or there's a good<br>chance that the delay is in violation of *Rodriguez*. Butt they<br>certainly can have a dog sniffing the car while another officer is at<br>the window writing you a ticket.<br><br>So what do you do? *Always comply with the officer on the scene, even if<br>he is violating your rights.* We've said this a bzillion times on Quora<br>(yes, that's a real number, it was in *Toy Story*), but I'll say it<br>again: you will never win an argument at the side of the road.<br>Period, full stop. If you want to argue the Constitutionality of a<br>police action, you do it with your lawyer later on. You don't do it at<br>the side of the road. Comply with the police. And yes, if they arrest<br>you, comply with your arresting officer. *THEN* tell your lawyer all<br>about what happened, and let him fight it. Yes, it sucks, but it will<br>suck way worse if you fight a cop, because all you're doing is adding<br>charges. You also don't need to say, "you're violating my rights" in<br>order for a violation of rights to be challenged later on. And in some<br>cases, drivers who frequently point out to the arresting officer that<br>their rights are being violated may appear to that officer as<br>uncooperative, so in some cases, it's best to just keep your mouth shut<br>and focus on remembering what happened.<br><br>You may *know* that the police are in violation of *Rodriguez*, but save<br>your outrage for the courtroom.<br><br>What you can do is to remember as many details as you can, or write them<br>down if you have an opportunity.<br><br>> It may be difficult in the moment, but there are several factors you<br>> should try to focus on, particularly the time. When did you get<br>> stopped? How long did it take them to write the ticket? When did the<br>> stop end? How long did you have to wait when they were bringing the<br>> dog? \[1\](#YfCOG){#cite-YfCOG .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-YfCOG){.citation_index} [[What to do if police violate<br>your rights with a drug-sniffing<br>dog](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8134db&url=https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/police-drug-sniffing-dog-violates-your-rights/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="dailydot.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
