<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I have an amazing reference website for you:<br><br>[http://bibleref.com(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1c5eac&url=http://bibleref.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>If you enter almost any verse in there, it will give you information<br>about that verse. Entering Mark 1:37 in there reveals the following<br>information:<br><br>> Within the span of half a day, Simon Peter goes from humble fisherman<br>> to the host of the most famous person in Capernaum. After Jesus healed<br>> a demon-possessed man and a woman with a fever, \"the whole city\"<br>> comes to Simon Peter\'s door to see if Jesus can heal them, as well<br>> (Mark 1:32--33). The next morning, the crowd presumably returns,<br>> asking for Jesus and disrupting Simon Peter\'s household. His response<br>> is to gather a small group, probably including his brother, Andrew,<br>> and Jesus\' other two disciples, James and John, and search for Jesus.<br>> They are not the only ones curious; \"everyone\" is looking for Jesus<br>> at this moment.<br>><br>> It\'s unclear what Simon Peter expects, here. He has, at least<br>> temporarily, left his fishing business to follow and learn from Jesus<br>> (Mark 1:16--18). Now a crowd grows outside his front door. In Luke<br>> 11:9, Jesus teaches that those who seek for God\'s blessings will find<br>> them. James 1:5 says \"If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God,<br>> who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given<br>> him.\" Simon Peter realizes, while he does not know what to do next,<br>> Jesus does, so he searches for Jesus and finds Him. Jesus\' solution<br>> to the gathering crowd is perhaps not what Peter expected: leave<br>> Capernaum and spend three years preaching all over Israel, but Peter<br>> follows.<br>><br>> This event is told from the perspective of Simon Peter, further making<br>> the case that Mark\'s Gospel is based on his eyewitness account (Mark<br>> 1:36).\[1\](#txWJu){#cite-txWJu .citation_link}<br><br>This is a fascinating exchange which marks the beginning of Jesus'<br>official ministry on earth. In other words, no one really knew the<br>gravity of that statement, "everyone is looking for you," and how true<br>it really was, until a few years later.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-txWJu){.citation_index} [[What does Mark 1:37<br>mean?](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=621b0b&url=https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/1/Mark-1-37.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="bibleref.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
