<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The [[Real ID<br>Act](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=789bf1&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_ID_Act){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} is far from new. The<br>provisions which affect the states were originally supposed to go into<br>effect in 2008, but it was postponed for five years to get more<br>buy-in from the states.<br><br>The Act only affects the states insofar as the Federal government has<br>set minimum standards that states must follow in order for their state<br>identifications to be accepted by the Federal government for official<br>purposes.<br><br>Official purposes include things like boarding commercial aircraft, and<br>gaining access to nuclear power plants and Federal buildings.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
