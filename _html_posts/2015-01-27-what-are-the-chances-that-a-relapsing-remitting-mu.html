<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Solumedrol is the brand name for methylprednisone, a<br>corticosteroid. Corticosteroids do not treat MS. They help to reduce the<br>severity of the symptoms that an MS patient experiences during a<br>\"relapse\" (the \"relapse\" portion of the \"relapsing-remitting\"<br>version of MS). There is some evidence to suggest that corticosteroids<br>lose their effectiveness over time, but most patients still experience<br>some faster symptom relief when they are used.\<br>\<br>Left untreated with one of the approved MS therapies, RRMS will progress<br>to SPMS (Secondary Progressive MS) in about 10 years, on average. The<br>speed of progression in SPMS as well as the degree of disability<br>experienced is different in every patient. Better than two-thirds of<br>SPMS patients retain the ability to walk, although they may need an<br>ambulation aid such as a cane or walker in order to do it. Some may<br>choose to use a wheelchair or motorized scooter to conserve energy,<br>others may need to use a wheelchair full-time (*statistics courtesy of*<br>[[*National MS<br>Society*](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=89dc6e&url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/Types-of-MS/Secondary-progressive-MS/Frequently-Asked-Questions-about-SPMS){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="nationalmssociety.org"}]{.qlink_container}*).*]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
