<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The reason they don't allow medical tourists from the US is because<br>their healthcare is paid for out of their taxes. Since "medical<br>tourists" don't pay their taxes, they have no method by which to extract<br>payment for medical procedures.<br><br>We allow medical tourists because our healthcare is not paid by our<br>taxes, it is paid individually either by the individual directly, or<br>through medical insurance. Therefore, anyone, even someone without US<br>medical insurance, can enter a doctor's office and receive treatment,<br>and be billed for their procedures.<br><br>Medical tourism does not create "higher prices."<br><br>If medical tourism creates "longer wait times," then the market should<br>respond by increasing the number of doctors.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Should the US stop allowing medical tourists to enter from countries<br>with universal healthcare that don\'t allow medical tourists from the<br>US? All we get out of the deal is higher prices and longer wait times.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
