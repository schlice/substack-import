<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are the statute of limitations on the emergency room medical bill<br>in Colorado?**<br><br>Since the "emergency room medical bill" is not a crime that you might<br>charge someone else with, a medical bill does not have a statute of<br>limitations.<br><br>You will be billed for your stay in the emergency room. They will check<br>to see if you have insurance and if you do, they will bill your<br>insurance. Anything not paid by your insurance (or covered in the<br>insurance agreement) becomes your responsibility.<br><br>If you don't have insurance (or for the remainder of the costs after<br>insurance), you will be billed directly. The hospital may see if you are<br>eligible for federal or state assistance (like Medicare) and if you are,<br>they will put you in for that coverage and attempt to extract payment in<br>that way. If you don't pay, your bill goes to a collections agency, and<br>your credit will receive a negative mark for a delinquent bill.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
