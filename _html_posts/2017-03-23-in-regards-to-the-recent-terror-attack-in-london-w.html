<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The short answer is we cannot say.<br><br>Is it possible that the outcome may have been different were the officer<br>armed? Yes, it is possible. It's also just as likely that the officer<br>may not have had the opportunity to draw and fire before being stabbed<br>anyway. Knives are terribly efficient close-quarter weapons. If you're<br>not totally on your game, you can get stabbed very easily.<br><br>Whatever the case, the UK has chosen to leave most of their officers<br>unarmed (with armed officers on-call), and they are perfectly fine with<br>that. So because of the greater belief that the public and the police<br>should work together to further a more civil society, the police are<br>mostly unarmed. And it also appears that terrorists did not get the<br>message that they should also remain unarmed. This terrorist was armed<br>with a 2,000 lb battering ram (also known as a car), and a knife.<br><br>\<soapbox\>\<br>This will be hard to hear, but the truth is the truth. This also means,<br>by extension, that the UK as a whole (not as individuals) believes the<br>deaths of PCs at the hands of armed assailants is an **acceptable<br>loss**, because they *intentionally* did not equip them with the tools<br>necessary to ensure they had an opportunity to counter the threat<br>presented to them. Any discussion to the contrary is vapid dialogue.<br>Either equip them to appropriately counter the threat, or their deaths<br>in scenarios like these are acceptable losses. There is no middle ground<br>in that discussion. If you do not give your officers the tools they need<br>to counter threats presented to them, you proclaim their deaths<br>acceptable casualties of the job. I hope their job descriptions say<br>something along the lines of "Gets killed when necessary." I fail to see<br>how the response of the armed officers was "sufficient," because it cost<br>an unarmed officer his life. The UK as a whole must come to grips with<br>this reality: criminals didn't get the message that they should remain<br>unarmed. Leaving the majority of your officers without the means to<br>defend themselves essentially condemns them to death.<br><br>Note that I did not say that Palmer's death *itself* was acceptable; we<br>mourn for the loss, and we grieve with you. However, that does not<br>change the fact that sending officers into the field ill-equipped to<br>defend against armed assailants is an imbalanced force equation, one in<br>which the unarmed person loses. Every. Single. Time.\<br>\</soapbox\><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
