Cognition<br>> refers to a range of high-level brain functions, including the ability<br>> to learn and remember information; organize, plan and problem-solve;<br>> focus, maintain and shift attention as necessary; understand and use<br>> language; accurately perceive the environment; and perform<br>> calculations. In MS, certain functions are more likely to be affected<br>> than others:<br>><br>> - Memory (acquiring, retaining and retrieving new information)<br>> - Attention and concentration (particularly divided attention)<br>> - Information processing (dealing with information gathered by the<br>>   five senses)<br>> - Executive functions (planning and prioritizing)<br>> - Visuospatial functions (visual perception and constructional<br>>   abilities)<br>> - Verbal fluency (word-finding)<br>><br>> Certain functions are likely to remain intact:<br>><br>> - General intellect<br>> - Long-term (remote) memory<br>> - Conversational skill<br>> - Reading comprehension<br>><br>> A person may experience difficulties in only one or two areas of<br>> cognitive functioning or in several. Only 5-10 percent of people with<br>> MS develop problems severe enough to interfere significantly with<br>> everyday activities. In very rare instances, cognitive dysfunction may<br>> become so severe that the person can no longer be cared for at home.<br><br>Further,<br><br>> Cognitive problems are only weakly related to other disease<br>> characteristics --- meaning that a person with almost no physical<br>> limitations can have significant cognitive impairment, while a person<br>> who is quite disabled physically can be unaffected cognitively.<br>><br>> - Changes can occur at any time --- even as a first symptom of MS ---<br>>   but are more common later in the disease.<br>> - Cognitive function correlates with number of lesions and lesion area<br>>   on MRI, as well as brain atrophy.<br>> - Cognitive dysfunction can occur with any disease course, but is<br>>   slightly more likely in progressive MS.<br>> - Being in an exacerbation is a risk factor for cognitive dysfunction.<br>> - Cognitive changes generally progress slowly but are unlikely to<br>>   improve dramatically once they have begun.<br><br>IQ tests are designed to test \"intelligence.\" Since \"intelligence\"<br>is defined as \"one\'s capacity for logic, abstract thought,<br>understanding, self-awareness, communication, learning, emotional<br>knowledge, memory, planning, and problem<br>solving\"\[1\](#fBDQr){#cite-fBDQr .citation_link}, and MS can affect<br>all of those, by extension, MS can alter IQ.<br><br>So would a neurologist be interested in IQ? If they can show that IQ has<br>changed over the course of the disease, they may investigate what<br>changes in the brain may have caused that.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-fBDQr){.citation_index} [[Intelligence -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f27487&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
