<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>When we interpret the Bible, we do not "pick and choose" methodology to<br>do so. Interpretation is the same for Colossians as it is for Leviticus<br>as it is for Revelation.<br><br>We use exegesis to understand the Bible. In other words, the Bible<br>explains the Bible.<br><br>We always seek to understand the context of a passage. **For text,<br>without context, is just pretext.** We do this by examining the larger<br>verse, then the chapter, then the book, and then in context with the<br>entire Old or New Testament.<br><br>We always remember that we are reading a *transliteration*, and to get a<br>full understanding, we need to understand what the passage said in its<br>original language, and we need to know how a native speaker of that<br>language would have understood the passage at the time it was to be<br>read.<br><br>\<br><br>With that in mind, let's look at Colossians 3.<br><br>This is part of Paul's letter to the believers in Colossae. It was<br>probably written while Paul was in prison in Rome, in about 62 AD. There<br>were some dangerous teachings circulating around at that time, so Paul<br>was writing to support and reaffirm the teachings of Christ to the<br>nascent church there. Paul wrote to caution against this false doctrine<br>and to support believers in their development into fully devoted<br>Christians. He highlights Christ\'s supremacy over all demonic forces.<br>Christians share in the power and authority of the risen Christ because<br>they are adopted by Him. Paul also exhorts these Christians to resist<br>sin, seek holiness, and live as clearly Christian families.<br><br>Colossians 3 is one part of the letter where Paul talks about how to<br>live as Christian families. He gives instructions for everyone in the<br>family:<br><br>> Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.<br>><br>> Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.<br>><br>> Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.<br>><br>> Fathers, do not embitter your children, or they will become<br>> discouraged.<br>><br>> Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only<br>> when their eye is on you and to curry their favor, but with sincerity<br>> of heart and reverence for the Lord. Whatever you do, work at it with<br>> all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since<br>> you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a<br>> reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving. Anyone who does wrong<br>> will be repaid for their wrongs, and there is no favoritism. ---<br>> Colossians 3:18--25 NIV<br><br>The wife\'s responsibility in a marriage is to support her husband in a<br>way that honors God.<br><br>Other verses also outline the proper behavior for wives toward their<br>husbands in the eyes of the Lord. Peter advises that the wife should set<br>a good example of virtue for her husband to follow. In addition, he<br>exhorts them to refrain from corrective language (1 Peter 3:1--4). This<br>is probably due to the relational shyness of men, who interpret<br>criticism from their wives as rejection. According to Peter (1 Peter<br>3:1--6), males are more inclined to imitate women\'s behavior when they<br>employ words of encouragement and respect in addition to setting a godly<br>example. This authority must be administered \"in the name of the<br>Lord,\" and for their husband\'s advantage. They are assisting God by<br>doing this.<br><br>This tells us that *the wife\'s devotion to her spouse is going to look<br>different than accepted social norms.* She has the incredible<br>opportunity to carry it out \"in the name of the Lord Jesus\"<br>(Colossians 3:17). It is appropriate or proper for wives to serve their<br>husbands as is fitting in the Lord (occasionally the word meaning<br>fitting can be rendered as \"convenient\"). It is an act of devotion to<br>God and of love. Paul exhorts wives to serve their husbands in love,<br>something they have total power over. A wife is free to treat her<br>husband with the same devotion that she does to the Lord.<br><br>Now that we understand the context, we can address the next section (the<br>one you asked about), where Paul discusses husbands.<br><br>The husbands are commanded by Paul to love their wives and not harbor<br>resentment toward them. Here, the term meaning love is translated from<br>the Greek word \"agapeo.\" God demonstrated His love for us by sending<br>Jesus to the cross to die in our place. The husband must put the needs<br>of the wife first out of \"agape\" love: to serve while leading, giving<br>and empowering. Again, as in the case of the wife, *this goes against<br>social standards.* The husband\'s love for the wife is to be performed<br>as an act of service to the Lord.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
