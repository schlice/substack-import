<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Can a background check legally ask for all my bank accounts and<br>brokerage information?**<br><br>A background check can legally ask for anything you give them permission<br>to ask for. That's what makes it *legal*. When you apply for the job,<br>you sign a form which allows them to do a background check. That form<br>will list the information they will search. You sign the form, giving<br>them permission to get that information. This is why it is legal.<br><br>What specifically they ask for, however, is more determined by the<br>employment opportunity for which a background check is needed.<br>Therefore, whether or not such a request is *appropriate* is determined<br>by the job.<br><br>For example, if you're applying to be a greeter at Walmart and they want<br>to do a background check and they want to have access to all of your<br>bank accounts and brokerage accounts, I would be highly suspect of such<br>a check.<br><br>However, if you were applying to be a *police officer* and they want to<br>do a background check and they want to have access to all of your bank<br>accounts and brokerage accounts, I would be suspicious if they *did not*<br>perform such a check.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
