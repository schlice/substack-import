<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**In the recent decades of US, what publications were listed as illegal<br>despite the First Amendment?**<br><br>The last time the United States listed a book as illegal was in 1963. It<br>was [[Fanny<br>Hill](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1f0488&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanny_Hill){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}, and it was banned due to<br>its graphic sexual content. School libraries still routinely ban this<br>book, mostly because of its graphic depictions of sex as well as the<br>images in the book, which could rightly be categorized as pornography.<br><br>As our definitions of the First Amendment have matured, we have stopped<br>making books *illegal*. Instead, school districts and libraries have<br>decided to not carry these books because the themes they discuss are<br>"too controversial" or in more recent days, use "hate speech" which many<br>have decided is not free speech.<br><br>To be clear, in the United States, these bans are wrong. The First<br>Amendment exists to protect speech like this, speech that some may find<br>objectionable. In essence, hate speech *is* free speech. We<br>consider this to be *censorship* and we actively work to educate school<br>districts and libraries when they attempt to ban literature.<br><br>The American Library Association keeps [[a list of banned<br>books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=e43a60&url=http://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ala.org"}]{.qlink_container} from around the country.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
