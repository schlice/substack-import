<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There are no actual, physical copies of *anything* from that time. Those<br>originals are gone, as they don't last that long.<br><br>But books, even then, were *duplicated*. We didn't have copy machines or<br>printing presses, so books were duplicated by hand.<br><br>These duplications are called *manuscripts*.<br><br>All significant literature from the ancient world is reconstructed into<br>its original form by comparing the manuscripts that survive. To<br>reconstruct the original, it helps to have a large number of manuscripts<br>that are written not long after the original. More manuscripts and<br>earlier manuscripts usually provide more trustworthy testimony and<br>enable a more accurate reconstruction.<br><br>How do the New Testament documents fare in this regard? Extremely well,<br>and far better than anything else from the ancient world. In fact, the<br>New Testament documents have more manuscripts, earlier manuscripts, and<br>more abundantly supported manuscripts **than the best ten pieces of<br>classical literature *combined.*** Here's what we mean:<br><br>More Manuscripts---At last count, there are nearly 5,700 handwritten<br>Greek manuscripts of the New Testament. In addition, there are more than<br>9,000 manuscripts in other languages (e.g., Syriac, Coptic, Latin,<br>Arabic). Some of these nearly 15,000 manuscripts are complete Bibles,<br>others are books or pages, and a few are just fragments. There is<br>nothing from the ancient world that even comes close in terms of<br>manuscript support. The next closest work is the *Iliad* by Homer, with<br>643 manuscripts. Most other ancient works survive on fewer than a dozen<br>manuscripts, yet few historians question the historicity of the events<br>those works describe.<br><br>Earlier Manuscripts---Not only does the New Testament enjoy abundant<br>manuscript support, but it also has manuscripts that were written soon<br>after the originals. The earliest undisputed manuscript is a segment of<br>John 18:31-33, 37-38 known as the John Rylands fragment (because it's<br>housed in the John Rylands Library in Manchester, England). Scholars<br>date it between A.D. 117--138, but some say it is even earlier. It was<br>found in Egypt---across the Mediterranean from its probable place of<br>composition in Asia Minor---demonstrating that John's Gospel was copied<br>and had spread quite some distance by the early second century.<br><br>Even earlier than the John Rylands fragment are nine *disputed*<br>fragments that date from A.D. 50 to 70, found with the Dead Sea Scrolls.<br>Some scholars believe these fragments are parts of six New Testament<br>books including Mark, Acts, Romans, 1 Timothy, 2 Peter, and James. While<br>other scholars resist this conclusion (perhaps because its admission<br>would undermine their liberal leanings that the New Testament was<br>written later), they have not found any other non--New Testament texts<br>that these fragments could be.<br><br>The fragments were found in a cave that had previously been identified<br>as containing material from 50 B.C. to A.D. 50. The scholar who first<br>identified these early fragments as New Testament books was Jose<br>O'Callahan, a noted Spanish paleographer. The New York Times recognized<br>the implications of O'Callahan's theory by admitting that if it is true<br>"it would prove at least one of the Gospels---that of St. Mark---was<br>written only a few years after the death of Jesus."<br><br>But even if they are not true New Testament fragments and the John<br>Rylands fragment really is the earliest, the time gap between the<br>original and the first surviving copy is still vastly shorter than<br>anything else from the ancient world. The *Iliad* has the next shortest<br>gap at about 500 years; most other ancient works are 1,000 years or more<br>from the original. The New Testament gap is about 25 years and may be<br>less.<br><br>*NOTE: This does not mean there were no other manuscripts between the<br>original and the first copy; there most certainly were. It simply means<br>that those manuscripts have decayed, have been destroyed, or are still<br>undiscovered.*<br><br>How old are the oldest surviving manuscripts of complete New Testament<br>books? Manuscripts that are complete New Testament books survive from<br>about A.D. 200. How about the oldest manuscripts of the entire New<br>Testament? Most of the New Testament, including all of the Gospels,<br>survives from 250, and a manuscript of the entire New Testament<br>(including a Greek Old Testament) called *Codex Vaticanus* survives from<br>about 325. Several other complete manuscripts survive from that century.<br>And those manuscripts have spelling and punctuation characteristics that<br>suggest that they are in a family of manuscripts that can be traced back<br>to A.D. 100--150.<br><br>If these numerous and early manuscripts were all scholars had, they<br>could reconstruct the original New Testament with great accuracy. But<br>they also have abundant supporting evidence from the ancient world that<br>makes New Testament reconstruction even more certain.<br><br>More Abundantly Supported Manuscripts---Beginning in February of<br>A.D. 303, the Roman emperor Diocletian ordered three edicts of<br>persecution upon Christians because he believed that the existence of<br>Christianity was breaking the covenant between Rome and her gods. The<br>edicts called for the destruction of churches, manuscripts, and books<br>and the killing of Christians.<br><br>Hundreds if not thousands of manuscripts were destroyed across the Roman<br>Empire during this persecution, which lasted until A.D. 311. But even if<br>Diocletian had succeeded in wiping every biblical manuscript off the<br>face of the earth, he could not have destroyed our ability to<br>reconstruct the New Testament. Why? Because the early church<br>fathers---men of the second and third centuries such as Justin Martyr,<br>Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Tertullian, and others---quoted<br>the New Testament so much (36,289 times, to be exact) that *all but<br>eleven verses of the New Testament can be reconstructed just from their<br>quotations*.<br><br>In other words, you could Google the works of the early church fathers,<br>and read nearly the entire New Testament just from their quotations of<br>it! So we not only have thousands of manuscripts but thousands of<br>quotations from those manuscripts. This makes reconstruction of the<br>original text virtually certain.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
