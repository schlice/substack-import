<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes.<br><br>But since we're being sensitive to the trans community, let's make sure<br>we are similarly sensitive to the "non-trans" community (the word they<br>invented for it is *cisgendered*, but this word was invented to<br>categorize and delineate normal human behavior, in order to make it<br>similar to the categorization and delineation of trans behavior).<br><br>When it comes to bathrooms and private spaces, people who practice<br>normal human behavior, in line with biology, have valid concerns. They<br>are, rightly, concerned with people who possess opposite genitalia in<br>their private spaces (locker rooms, showers, bathrooms, etc). These<br>spaces were set up specifically for biological women to be separated<br>from *exactly that*: people with opposite genitalia.<br><br>So how can we be sensitive to the trans community in not forcing them<br>into a facility that doesn't align with their perceived gender identity,<br>while similarly being sensitive to the non-trans community in not<br>allowing people with opposite genitalia into their private spaces?<br>Provide separate spaces for everyone. It's not *ideal* for anyone, but<br>it is *acceptable* for everyone. It's something that the trans community<br>really doesn't appear to be very interested in: compromise.<br><br>When it comes to dating services, the trans community must understand<br>that if they are permitted to have their sexual preferences and it is<br>not bigoted to have them, then non-trans people are also permitted to<br>have their sexual preferences and they too are not bigoted by having<br>them. Non-trans people *actually want people with opposite genitalia*.<br>Genitalia is fairly important when non-trans people date. A penis does<br>not become a vagina because you said so. Therefore, when using dating<br>services, separating people by their genitalia preference in a partner<br>is both natural and expeditious: it would be a colossal waste of time to<br>date someone only to find out that they do not possess the genitalia<br>that their partner thought they did, when they have a preference for a<br>specific set of genitalia.<br><br>TL;DR: If we are going to be sensitive to the desires of the trans<br>community, we must similarly be sensitive to the needs of the non-trans<br>community. You cannot *dismiss* the needs of one group to satisfy the<br>desires of another. You must find a way to "split the baby" and give<br>everyone a workable solution, not necessarily everything they want.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
