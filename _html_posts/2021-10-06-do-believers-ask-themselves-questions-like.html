<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You could always start with Pascal's Wager:<br><br>> If I'm wrong and there is no God, I've lost nothing. But if you're<br>> wrong and there is a God, then you've lost everything.<br><br>In other words, it costs you nothing to believe in God. At best, I would<br>have to rein in my sexual proclivities, but I would say that given the<br>amount of STIs floating about out there, I think it would be prudent to<br>do so anyway. But failing to believe in God could have some pretty<br>drastic and eternal consequences, and eternity is an awfully long time<br>to be wrong.<br><br>Thoughtful believers will indeed question themselves and their beliefs,<br>some even continuously, and there is nothing wrong with doing so. The<br>study of apologetics is exactly the study you're looking for. It's not a<br>study of "what do I believe" but a study of "why do I believe what I<br>believe" and "how do I justify how I believe what I believe?" There's<br>nothing inherently evil about justifying your belief. In fact, it's part<br>of the Great Commandment (emphasis mine):<br><br>> "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?"<br>><br>> Jesus replied: "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with<br>> all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and<br>> greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor<br>> as yourself.' All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two<br>> commandments." --- Matthew 22:36--40 NIV<br><br>How do you love God with your mind? Do you think about love? I know how<br>I can love God with all my heart and all my soul, but how do I love God<br>with all my mind?<br><br>I *use* my mind for the purpose for which it was intended. I study the<br>word of God, I think about everything I believe, and I ***ground my<br>theology*. I ask myself not only "what do I believe" but why**. When<br>I hear something that I believe, I always ask myself why. What is<br>the basis for that belief? Apologetics is the study of why we believe<br>what we believe. It's not about proving someone else wrong. It's about<br>continually proving yourself and your beliefs *right* and knowing and<br>understanding the foundations of your belief.<br><br>Faith is not blind, despite what atheists will try to tell you. They'll<br>tell you that your faith fills in the gaps of the unknown, so it could<br>literally be anything else that fills that gap, not necessarily God. But<br>faith is not blind. Faith is knowing what you believe, and being able to<br>support it. Faith is being able to stand firm in your belief, because it<br>is well-supported. It's not some blind allegiance to an idea which has<br>no support. It's full-throated support of a belief which is rational and<br>reasonable.<br><br>Know what you believe, and know why you believe it.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Do believers ask themselves questions like \"what if I\'m wrong?\"<br>\"Could it be that all my beliefs are false?\" and \"What if atheists<br>are right?\"?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
