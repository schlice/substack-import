<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Yes, of course they will! Because they've shown in the past just how<br>objective and clear-thinking they are...<br><br>/s<br><br>They will absolutely downplay the documents (EDIT: [[they<br>did](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=59c8e5&url=https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/10/politics/classified-documents-joe-biden/index.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cnn.com"}]{.qlink_container}), but the explanation for why<br>Biden had classified documents in his private office at the University<br>of Pennsylvania is ***entirely different from why Trump had classified<br>documents at Mar-a-Lago.***<br><br>Normally, when a President (or Vice President) leaves office, a third<br>party contractor packs up all of their documents and delivers them to<br>the person's personal residence. The documents are then hand-sorted by<br>the person's representative and a representative from the National<br>Archives, and they collectively determine, for each document, whether it<br>goes to the person's private collection (or into their Presidential<br>Library), or is relinquished to the government to be filed at the<br>National Archives. While this isn't how it's supposed to happen under<br>the rules in the Presidential Records Act, this is how it has actually<br>happened for every single president since the law was passed, and the<br>system seems to work acceptably.<br><br>That document haul has routinely included classified documents, which<br>are simply reverted back to the government. This is how Trump ended up<br>with classified documents in his possession.<br><br>But the possession of documents in Biden's personal office at the<br>University of Pennsylvania is, as of yet, unexplained. Biden used that<br>office while he was an honorary professor at the University from 2017 to<br>2019.<br><br>Of course, as was already mentioned, the White House is downplaying<br>these documents, classifying them as "fewer than a dozen files," none of<br>which are "particularly sensitive" and "not of high interest to the<br>intelligence community." However, this is different in a number of very<br>key ways:<br><br>- This is "fewer than a dozen files" which means it's unlikely to be a<br>  bunch of useless documents just shuffled someplace in a massive<br>  document dump. They're more likely to be specifically taken to that<br>  location by the principal (in this case, Biden). So he can't claim<br>  innocence; he can't claim he didn't know they were there (even though<br>  he already has). The small number of files indicates that they were<br>  likely deliberately brought there.<br>- These files were TS/SCI (Top Secret, Sensitive Compartmentalized<br>  Information) sensitivity, the release of which could cause<br>  "*exceptionally grave damage to the United States or her allies*."<br>  Files which are "not particularly sensitive" are never labeled as<br>  TS/SCI.<br>- And I really don't care what the intelligence community finds<br>  interesting, because whether or not something is interesting to some<br>  rando intelligence analysts does not determine its classification<br>  level.<br><br>Sorry White House, I'm not buying your downplay. Why were those<br>documents unsecured in that office? At least documents in Mar-a-Lago are<br>in an area protected by Secret Service and only accessible by authorized<br>and cleared people. But an office at UPenn? Not highly secured.<br><br>This is a bigger story than anyone is talking about, and in true<br>government/media collaboration, this story will be summarily buried.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
