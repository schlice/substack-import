<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there any data on people who are admitted to US service academies<br>but never graduate?**<br><br>Each individual service academy keeps that information themselves, and<br>it is sorted by class year. You would have to approach each service<br>academy separately to retrieve this information. As far as I know, there<br>is no global repository for this data from all service academies.<br><br>The number of people who are admitted and leave before graduation is<br>sorted based on reason for leaving. Some leave because they become<br>medically disqualified for military service while they are there. Some<br>withdraw by choice. Some are ejected due to some policy or rule<br>violation. Some academically fail out.<br><br>You'll note, however, that those who do not meet athletic standards can<br>still graduate and receive their Bachelor's degree, but cannot be<br>commissioned as officers. They are required to repay their service<br>commitment in the enlisted ranks. I had at least one classmate who fell<br>into this category.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
