<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What would you put in a roommate agreement with an illegal sublet?<br>(Yes it's not ideal, but there are extenuating circumstances on both<br>sides).**<br><br>Subletting your apartment when your lease agreement does not permit<br>subletting, or violating the city's rules regardless of what the lease<br>says, leaves you in trouble with the landlord, not your tenant, so<br>your roommate agreement is useless because you'll both be on the street.<br><br>Best advice: try to work with your landlord to either allow the sublet,<br>or add the roommate to the lease.<br><br>If you have further questions, you should try to find a tenant advocacy<br>group in your area and consult them for legal help, or consult a real<br>estate attorney.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice.
