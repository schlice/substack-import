<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the actual process I need to follow if I\'m involved in a<br>non-injury auto accident? If my vehicle is drive-able, do I have to wait<br>for police? Do most insurance companies require a police report?**<br><br>The answer, as with all legal answers, is "it depends."<br><br>The rules vary by state.<br><br>The *easiest* way to determine what you have to do in a non-injury<br>accident:<br><br>1.  DO THIS FIRST, WHILE STILL AT THE SCENE: *Call your local<br>    non-emergency number (not 911)*, and follow their directions. Tell<br>    them no one is injured and the vehicles are driveable. The<br>    dispatchers will be more than happy to direct you on what to do,<br>    plus the call (and the fact that you did call) is recorded. If the<br>    vehicles are driveable, they will likely tell you to move out of<br>    traffic. If the police are required to be dispatched to your<br>    location, the dispatcher will handle that as well.\<br>    \<br>    Stay on the phone with your local dispatcher until they tell you<br>    that you can hang up.<br>2.  Once you hang up with the dispatcher, *call your insurance company.*<br>    Many insurance companies offer an app which will step you through<br>    what is required, what information to provide to the other driver,<br>    when you can leave, etc. The app will usually allow you to take<br>    photos of the damage as well, which also helps begin the claims<br>    process.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
