<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**It\'s said that a sitting president can\'t be indicted since it would<br>disrupt the Executive branch. WHY? S/he has a vice-president who was<br>chosen to take over presidential duties. And there\'s a hand-picked<br>cabinet, all representing his/her views.**<br><br>There are several theories about why this is. Note that these are all<br>theories; while Nixon was going to possibly be indicted, he resigned<br>before that happened. No one has ever attempted to indict a sitting<br>President.<br><br>First, the Constitution vests executive power *solely* in the President<br>himself. Prosecuting crimes is an executive power. All other executive<br>offices (such as the Department of Justice) are empowered to indict<br>people only by delegation of authority from the President.<br>Therefore, unless the President *consents to be* indicted, he can't be,<br>because no person or agency may exercise the President's Constitutional<br>power in a manner to which he would not consent. If the President does<br>not consent to be indicted, then his authority is not delegated, and he<br>may not be indicted.<br><br>Second, the Constitution already has a remedy for elected officials who<br>commit "high crimes and misdemeanors": *impeachment*. The correct<br>Constitutional procedure is for the President to be impeached by the<br>House, removed from office by the Senate, and *then*, only after he<br>is out of office, can he be indicted.<br><br>Finally, ***especially if he is not impeached, or even if he is<br>impeached and not removed from office***, the statute of limitations<br>would most likely be tolled (paused) until he does leave office, so once<br>he leaves office at the natural conclusion of his term, he can then be<br>indicted.<br><br>By the way, once he is removed from office following the<br>Constitutionally-approved method, one of his successors takes over<br>according to the Presidential Succession Act.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
