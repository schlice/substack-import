<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As most of the people who have answered here have told you, it's a good<br>idea to tell the person you lied to the truth.<br><br>But let's talk about repentance for a second. ***Is it required to<br>confess to the person you lied to in order for it to be a "valid"<br>repentance?***<br><br>And that answer is no.<br><br>Biblical repentance is between you and God. You did not sin<br>against the person you lied to; you sinned against God. It's God's law<br>you violated, not man's. To that end, It is from God that you seek<br>repentance, not from man.<br><br>That said, it is good to make peace with the person you harmed. It is<br>right and beneficial to your relationship. In fact, the Bible tells us<br>that **we cannot continue to worship God if we have not made peace with<br>the brother we have sinned against:**<br><br>> *So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that<br>> your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before<br>> the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come<br>> and offer your gift. \-- Matthew 5:23--24 ESV*<br><br>So the Bible is saying here that before you can offer your gifts to God,<br>you need to make your heart right. You need to be in the correct frame<br>of mind and heart to worship a holy God.<br><br>So you'll need to do both: repent to God and reconcile with the person<br>you lied to.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
