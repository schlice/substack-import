They *want*<br>Palestinians there. They don't want them to leave. They also don't want<br>"unconditional peace" with Israel. **They want "unconditional<br>destruction" of Israel.**<br><br>Those Arabs in Palestine are a *wedge*. As long as they stay, Arabs have<br>a foothold in Israel. Arab nations can use the Palestinians as a foil to<br>foment international outrage against "Israeli atrocities" done against<br>the Palestinians, while summarily ignoring the horrors Hamas inflicts<br>against its own people.<br><br>Arab nations *support* Hamas, even if they publicly make statements<br>against terror activities.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
