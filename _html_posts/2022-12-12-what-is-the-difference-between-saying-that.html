<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ah, this is the difference between pantheism and panentheism.<br>Look carefully, those are not spelling errors.<br><br>Pantheism is the belief that the material and the divine are one. A<br>pantheist would say "God is everything." God is the tree. God is the<br>air. God is the rock. To a pantheist, God is in all things because God<br>*is* all things.<br><br>Panentheism is the belief that the divine permeates every part of<br>the material world but is not any of those things. They believe the<br>divine is the "spirit of the universe," but the universe is not the<br>divine, even though it is dependent on the universe. To a panentheist,<br>God cannot exist apart from a material universe. So panentheism would<br>also say that God is in all things, even though God *is not* all things.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
