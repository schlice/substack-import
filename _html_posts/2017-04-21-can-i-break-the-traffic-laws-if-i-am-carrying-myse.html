<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You can break the traffic laws at any time regardless of how many people<br>are in your car or what their medical conditions are.<br><br>The questions are:<br><br>- Should you break the traffic law to transport a sick/injured person to<br>  the hospital?<br>- Is it *legal* to break the traffic law when someone is sick/injured so<br>  you can get to the emergency room?<br><br>Should you break the traffic law to transport a sick/injured person to<br>the hospital? The short answer is no. You are far better off waiting<br>for an ambulance to arrive. The ambulance can get to you faster than you<br>can get to the hospital. Under normal circumstances, the ambulance is<br>not at the hospital, so it's not like it would take the same amount of<br>time for them to get to you as for you to get to the hospital. Plus,<br>they are equipped with lights and sirens, so they can safely and legally<br>break traffic laws to get to you. Finally, they have advanced life<br>support equipment on board the ambulance, so once they get to you, they<br>can start helping to stabilize the patient immediately, while you're in<br>transit.<br><br>As you may have gathered, it is most certainly not legal to break the<br>traffic laws at any time. Your transporting of a sick person would be a<br>defense to the charges you would be facing if you did this, and there is<br>no guarantee that you would be relieved of responsibility when you have<br>your day in court. Clearly, it is much safer and better for your patient<br>to wait for the ambulance than to try to get there yourself.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
