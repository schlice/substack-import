<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer, as with all legal answers in the US, is "it depends."<br><br>What it depends on is<br><br>- what state you're in<br>- what you are doing<br><br>For example, if you are driving a car and you are asked to show your<br>driver's license, you must do so. Failing to do so will lead to some<br>pretty serious consequences.<br><br>But if you're just walking down the street, minding your own business,<br>and a police officer walks up to you out of the blue and says, "Hey you!<br>Show me some ID!" you probably don't need to. You're not engaged in an<br>activity that requires ID, so you probably don't have to present any.<br><br>I said "probably" in that last paragraph because if you were stopped<br>*because the police suspect you of committing a crime*, you are required<br>under some states' laws to positively identify yourself, and even though<br>you're not driving a car or doing anything that requires a license,<br>"positive identification" may include some form of state-issued ID if<br>you have one. So before you decide whether or not you're going to<br>present ID to identify yourself, you'll probably want to find out why<br>the officer is asking.<br><br>\<br><br>*This answer is not professional legal advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional legal advice, or a solicitation to offer professional<br>legal advice.
