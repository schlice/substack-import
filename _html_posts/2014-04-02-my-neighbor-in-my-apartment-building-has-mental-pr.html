<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [It\'s been answered already, but let me re-iterate your<br/>best plan of action.\<br/>\<br/>1. Certified letter to the landlord indicating that there is a health<br/>issue in the apartment and it is causing uninhabitable conditions in<br/>your apartment. Tell them that you are taking action to involve state<br/>and local agencies of the potential hazard to you and to the health of<br/>the tenant in question because they have failed to act.\<br/>\<br/>2. Notify state and/or local agencies of the issue. APS is the best<br/>route to go. You can also contact the police and tell them you think<br/>there is a dead body in there because of the smell, but please save that<br/>as a last resort. Please try state health agencies first. They can<br/>compel the landlord to act better than you can.\<br/>\<br/>3. If no action has been taken in 30 days, certified cure-or-quit notice<br/>to the landlord indicating that they have violated the terms of your<br/>lease by not providing habitable conditions to you. Provide them with a<br/>dated copy of the first letter. You give your landlord 14 days from the<br/>date they receive the letter to \"cure\" the condition causing default<br/>or you will \"quit\" (terminate) your lease because they have violated<br/>the leasing terms. Consult with a lawyer before moving out to make sure<br/>you have your legal bases covered, but if you\'ve already done 1 and 2<br/>above, you should have enough collateral to prove your case.\<br/>\<br/>4. If you still get no response from the landlord, filing a complaint<br/>with the local BBB is a good one. Also, join Angie\'s List. It\'s<br/>inexpensive, and business owners do not like negative reviews there. And<br/>then keep to your promise and move out.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
