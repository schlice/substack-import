<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It wouldn't happen because Kinder Eggs are marketed to children, and<br>handguns are illegal to be sold to children for a reason, so it would<br>shock the conscience, so it would never be approved.<br><br>But simply in terms of legality, if you could legally import the<br>Kinder Egg (or maybe do the assembly of the eggs in the US), and if<br>you had a FFL dealer selling the eggs and performing background<br>checks on everyone who buys the eggs, it *might* be legal.<br><br>But the mere fact of Kinder Egg (i.e. marketing to kids) blows the whole<br>thing out of the water, even if you could make it legal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
