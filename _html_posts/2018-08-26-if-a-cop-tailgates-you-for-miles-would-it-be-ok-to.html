<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a cop tailgates you for miles, would it be OK to slam on your<br>brakes?**<br><br>Better idea: *do the speed limit, or even five to ten miles an hour<br>below the speed limit.*<br><br>You probably know that when most people drive, they drive five to ten<br>miles an hours above the posted speed limit. For various reasons, you<br>probably won't be stopped if you do five over, so most people do.<br><br>The proper procedure in the US when someone is tailgating you is to put<br>additional space between you and the car in front of you. This allows<br>you extra reaction time to slow down gradually.<br><br>However, what if, instead of just leaving more space in front of you,<br>you instead drove the speed limit? Or drove five to ten miles an hour<br>below the speed limit? The person behind you would be so annoyed that<br>they'd probably go around you. They'd probably get so pissed that they'd<br>find any way they could to go around you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
