<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Why do many states not allow open carry of firearms? Wouldn\'t it be<br>better for police to see when someone is armed from a distance so they<br>won\'t be surprised, in addition to deterring anyone about to commit a<br>crime?**<br><br>Your assertion is incorrect. "Many" states do allow open carry of<br>firearms. "Many" is generally accepted to mean "at least half," and<br>that's not even true.<br><br>> Thirty-one states allow the open carrying of a handgun without any<br>> license or permit, although in some cases the gun must be unloaded.<br>> Fifteen states require some form of license or permit in order to<br>> openly carry a handgun.\[1\](#AAwJR){#cite-AAwJR .citation_link}<br><br>So by this count, there are at least 46 states that allow open carry in<br>some form or another.<br><br>However, there are *many* cities within those states which restrict open<br>carry, as they are permitted to do. *Why* they do this is entirely up to<br>them. The mayors of these cities have determined, for better or worse,<br>that their city would be a better place if no one was allowed to openly<br>carry firearms. [[Cities have done this since the beginning of the<br>nation](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=65700c&url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/gun-control-old-west-180968013/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="smithsonianmag.com"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br>Is it a good idea to open carry? This question has been asked several<br>times before on Quora:<br><br>[[Is open carrying more risky than concealed carrying, or would open<br>carrying be more likely to deter<br>crime?](https://www.quora.com/Is-open-carrying-more-risky-than-concealed-carrying-or-would-open-carrying-be-more-likely-to-deter-crime)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>[[Doesn\'t openly carrying a gun make you more likely to become a victim<br>of robbery?
