<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Sin is sin. All of us are sinners. We have all sinned and have fallen<br>short of the glory of God. We must all repent of our sins and turn<br>towards the grace of a loving God.<br><br>On the last day, when we all stand and face the throne of judgement, God<br>will judge us all the same way, regardless of our sin:<br><br>- Did we acknowledge our sin? Did we acknowledge what we did was wrong?<br>- Did we humbly ask God for forgiveness?<br>- Did we turn away from our sin?<br>- Did we accept Christ as our Lord and Savior?<br><br>That's it. If we've done those things, then Christ's sacrifice on the<br>cross redeems us. His sacrifice covers our sins. He took the punishment<br>we deserve so that we can be reunited with God. Christ redeems us.<br><br>So if you haven't repented of your sin, what are you waiting for? You<br>don't know when your last day will be. Only He knows. The time to look<br>inside and search your heart for the sin that convicts us is now.<br><br>And if you *don't know* the sin that is separating you from Him,<br>*ask Him to show you.* Don't be surprised if you're confronted with the<br>most awful movie you've ever seen, starring you (by the way, I did this,<br>and I already don't like scary movies, but this one was *awful*, because<br>I was the star. This was what separated me from God, and I did this and<br>God saved me). Yes it's awful, but watch it. Once you do it, you can<br>tell God you're sorry for all of that and you can humbly ask Him for<br>forgiveness.<br><br>What you must know is that *if you do this, with a contrite heart,*<br>*the answer to that prayer will NEVER be* *no**.* God is infinitely<br>loving and is infinitely forgiving when you ask.<br><br>But it requires you to take the first step and ask for forgiveness.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
