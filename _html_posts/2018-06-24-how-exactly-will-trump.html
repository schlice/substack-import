<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How exactly will Trump\'s executive order prevent children of illegal<br>immigrants from being separated from their families? How does it jibe<br>with existing law? Why wasn\'t this done before? What is the background?<br>What are the implications?**<br><br>I will be quite honest: Trumps EO is *patently illegal.*<br><br>The law (which is a combination of ICE policy and case law) says, quite<br>specifically, that children shall not be incarcerated for more than 20<br>days. The 9th Circus upheld this rule, clarifying that both<br>*accompanied* and *unaccompanied* children are all covered by this rule.<br>20 days, no more. See the *Flores* decision for more information.<br><br>After 20 days, the children must leave incarceration.<br><br>Beginning in the Bush Administration, and continuing into the Obama<br>Administration, when an illegal immigrant entered with a child in tow<br>and claimed asylum (which forced a hearing with an immigration judge),<br>the parent and child would be incarcerated together. However, if they<br>were unable to get in to see an immigration judge within 20 days, the<br>policy was to give them a court date, and release them *together* into<br>the United States. This policy was known as "catch and release." Most of<br>the time, the illegal would make it back for their court date. Some<br>unscrupulous illegals would take advantage of this, and not return for<br>their hearing, being loose in the United States as an illegal alien.<br>They would bring children *who were not theirs* across the border with<br>them so that they would be treated as parent and child. They'd pay for<br>children to pretend that they were actually their children so that they<br>would get out of incarceration because of the way the law was being<br>implemented. Basically, the United States was encouraging lawlessness<br>and child slavery purchases to enable unscrupulous illegals to enter the<br>country as "parent and child." This is a perfect example of a<br>well-intentioned policy with disastrous unintended consequences. Yes, it<br>worked some of the time, but not always. Just ask Angel Moms how well<br>this policy worked.<br><br>Trump's policy change was the implementation of a "zero tolerance"<br>policy when it comes to adherence to the law, which said that we would<br>end the practice of "catch and release." To that end, if the above<br>scenario happened and we got to 20 days without a hearing, the illegal<br>would not be released into the country. However, the child would have to<br>be removed from incarceration because of the law barring children from<br>remaining in incarceration for more than 20 days. Nothing changing the<br>law happened with Trump, only how the law was enforced. Trump did not<br>make the policy. He simply enforced it.<br><br>Democratic lawmakers attempted to capitalize on this for political<br>points, insisting that the President should change the policy by<br>Executive Order. They knew full well that the problem was theirs to<br>fix, but they were banking on stupid voters to believe that this was all<br>Trump's doing. Trump was ripping families apart for his own amusement,<br>they said. It fits their "Trump is a monster" narrative, so it works, so<br>long as you can suspend your understanding of the situation and the law.<br><br>Under growing pressure, Trump issued an EO which said that children<br>would not be removed from incarceration despite passing the 20 day mark.<br>The law has not changed. Therefore, this is indeed, illegal. What he<br>*also* did was to have the Justice Department petition the 9th Circuit<br>for a change in the case law. This might allow his EO to be legal, if<br>it's done soon enough. We'll have to wait and see how that works out.<br><br>For now, parents and children get to stay together, which is what<br>everyone wanted. Interesting that Democrats were not satisfied, because<br>ultimately they wanted a return to "catch and release." They were not<br>really concerned about the welfare of children, or they'd be satisfied<br>that children are not being ripped for their mommy's arms, so to speak.<br>Trump is not going to re-implement catch and release.<br><br>Trump was in a bad situation here, and to be fair, his administration<br>did not handle this incident in the most stellar way, when you have<br>senior administration officials saying that the policy was intended to<br>"send a message." What they meant to say was that the change in policy<br>was to close the loophole we mentioned above regarding illegals buying<br>children to use as their own so that they'd be released from custody in<br>20 days; essentially, a "free pass" into the country. That's the message<br>they wanted to send. However, it came out totally wrong, and they made<br>it sound like Trump was ripping children from parents as a deterrent.<br>Terribly poor handling all around. Trump needs a communications director<br>who will actually set communication policy for the administration, and<br>hold administration officials' feet to the fire on it. Alas, they all<br>run their mouths and they have inconsistent messaging.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
