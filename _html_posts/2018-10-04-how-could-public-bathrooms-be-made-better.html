<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>How could public bathrooms be made better?<br><br>Since most folks have talked about cleaning them more, or better, let's<br>instead talk about design features which could improve usability and<br>sanitation.<br><br>1.  More hands-free devices. The less you have to touch in a public<br>    bathroom, the better. Hands-free sinks and hands-free soap<br>    dispensers are a great start.<br>2.  Get rid of air dryers. This is a less popular design choice, since<br>    using air dryers reduces trash which must be collected. However, it<br>    is well known that air dryers actually make bathrooms *less*<br>    sanitary by spreading germs all over the walls and floor, rather<br>    than capturing them in paper. Hands-free dispensers and plentiful<br>    trash cans are helpful.<br>3.  Doors should swing *outward*. Bathroom doors should swing outward<br>    rather than inward. Once you've washed your hands, touching a door<br>    to open it is another contact point where germs can transfer, and<br>    while I wash my hands well, we all have seen *that guy* or *that<br>    girl* who does their business and walks out without washing. I don't<br>    want to touch the door handle after them. Therefore, bathroom doors<br>    should swing outward, and should not have handles which require<br>    turning or unlatching in order to get out of the bathroom.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
