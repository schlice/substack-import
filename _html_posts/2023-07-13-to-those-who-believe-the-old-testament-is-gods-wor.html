<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>"Did God act morally."<br><br>What an interesting question.<br><br>If God can act *immorally*, then there must be a standard of morals that<br>transcends God. If you can name that standard which is *higher* than the<br>*highest creature ever,* greater than the **all-powerful Creator of the<br>Universe**, then perhaps we can judge God by that standard.<br><br>But I have a feeling that you do not know the source of the morality by<br>which you hope to judge God.<br><br>Therefore, in order to answer your question, I must ask you to **ground<br>your morality**. You must tell me the source of the morality by which<br>you can judge God, and it must be a standard of morality outside of God,<br>to which God is subject.<br><br>If we can agree on that standard of morality, we can judge God.<br><br>\<br><br>And what my "gut" says is wholly irrelevant. That's you asking me to use<br>"my gut" (or my feelings, essentially) to be the yardstick by which I<br>judge the morality of God.<br><br>What difference does it make if I don't like God's decisions? In the<br>grand scheme of things, I am nothing and He is everything. I am the<br>clay, He is the potter. He is wholly within His rights to smash me down<br>to nothing and rebuild me, or simply throw me into the discard pile.<br>Does the clay have a right to complain to the potter about how it has<br>been formed? Does the clay have a right to object to how the potter<br>treats the rest of the clay?<br><br>I'm not seeing where "my gut" holds any sway over the Almighty Creator<br>of the Universeâ„¢.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
