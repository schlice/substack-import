<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'m really torn, because even the biggest guys (MMA and<br>military training) can get knocked down by OC. The military doesn\'t<br>teach you how to fight through the pain of OC spray. The spray will<br>cause swelling of mucous membranes and distinct physical symptoms (like<br>pain\--and lots of it) that will bring big bad boys to their knees and<br>keep them there.\<br>\<br>[[What is the Best Pepper Spray You Can Buy in 2015?

Adam is<br>no small fry, and he cries like a baby for \~20 minutes from being<br>sprayed.\<br>\<br>OC spray is extremely effective on almost anyone. It\'s really only<br>somewhat ineffective on people high on certain drugs which mask pain. In<br>such an instance, you might think about having a Taser handy. Yes, in<br>most states, the Taser is legal for civilians to carry, concealed,<br>without a permit. Check your local laws before you throw down a few<br>hundred on one of these, but if it\'s good enough for the cops, it\'s<br>certainly good enough for you.\<br>\<br>[[TASER Personal Defense<br>Products](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=a40d65&url=https://buy.taser.com/?utm_source%3Dhp%26utm_medium%3Dbanner%26utm_campaign%3DLE-Feature){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="taser.com"}]{.qlink_container}]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
