<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: [We had a traveling groomer who worked out of an RV. He had<br>a gas that he would use for my troublemaker cat. When that cat was<br>breathing that gas, he\'d sleep. We could trim his nails and brush the<br>knots out of his fur which he wouldn\'t let us do when he was awake.<br>He\'d wake up, be more mad with us than usual, and go on about his<br>life.\<br>\<br>This cat got groomed more than my dog.\<br>\<br>But it\'s what we had to do.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/When-is-a-cat-too-old-to-declaw/answer/Diane-Burrell-1<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
