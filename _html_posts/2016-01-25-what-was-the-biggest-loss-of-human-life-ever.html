<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The answer depends on whether or not the event was man-made or natural,<br>and whether or not you mean \"all at once\" or \"over a period of<br>quantifiable time.\" I\'m assuming you meant over a period of time.<br><br>Man-Made: The largest known man-made loss of human life ever was the<br>European colonization of the Americas from 1492 to 1691. This 200 year<br>period saw the loss of an estimated 8.4 to 138 million people. The death<br>toll varies widely because the actual number of Native Americans<br>pre-Columbus is not known, and will likely never be known.<br><br>Natural: The floods in China in 1931 claimed an estimated 1 to 4<br>million lives.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
