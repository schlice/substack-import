<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Now that Giuliani has publicly declared that he has no intention to<br>respond to a congressional subpoena, do you think he should be arrested<br>immediately?**<br><br>Certainly not.<br><br>Remember that we have three co-equal branches of government. Two of<br>them are asserting privileges that they believe they legally have:<br>Congress is claiming they need information (testimony or documentation)<br>to conduct their Constitutionally-mandated oversight mission, and the<br>White House is claiming that it has Executive Privilege to guard certain<br>key information from release.<br><br>*Neither of these privileges takes precedence over the other*, as both<br>branches are equal in their authority over each other.<br><br>It would be up to Congress to bring their "subpoena" to a Federal court<br>in order to enforce it. The subject of the subpoena would then have the<br>opportunity to present their case to show why the information needs to<br>be protected, and it would be up to a judge to decide.<br><br>*If* a judge decides that the subpoena can be enforced, *and* the White<br>House continues to fail to comply, *then* the Congress can move the<br>subpoena to the US Attorney's office in DC, which will petition a judge<br>to issue arrest warrants for the subpoenaed individuals. The judge will<br>engage US Marshalls to enforce compliance.<br><br>(EDIT) My comments section just got spammed with people who seem to<br>believe that because Rudy Giuliani is not a Federal employee, that<br>somehow executive privilege does not apply.<br><br>This belief is incorrect.<br><br>Executive privilege is not about ***people*. Executive privilege is<br>about *information*.**<br><br>It does not matter who holds that information. It's only been Federal<br>employees in the past because under normal circumstances, only Federal<br>employees have been privvy to the information which needs to be<br>protected.<br><br>But anyone who is in possession of information which the Executive deems<br>privileged can be ordered to not release that information. Even if they<br>are civilian attorneys.<br><br>The question then becomes what can the Executive do if the non-Federal<br>employee fails to comply with the Executive's demand to suppress the<br>information. That would be an interesting turn of events.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
