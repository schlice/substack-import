<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Let's take the question a piece at a time:<br><br>**If the President were to order military action against North Korea,<br>would the military be obliged to carry it out**<br><br>Yes. Full stop. The President is the Commander-in-Chief. If the<br>President gives an order, you go. Period. Failure to do so is considered<br>insubordination and is prosecutable by court-martial and Article 15.<br>You'll be out on your ear, and so much for your pension.<br><br>if there were no attacks or other hostile actions<br><br>There are no rules that say what has to happen before the President may<br>order military action.<br><br>with no resolution by an international body<br><br>Thankfully, "international bodies" do not have sovereignty over a<br>sovereign nation. They can "resolve," they can "advise" and even<br>"denounce" actions, but they have no authority over what a sovereign<br>nation does in its own self-interest. Only the United States has<br>authority over what the United States does. International bodies can<br>"strongly disagree," but they don't determine when a sovereign nation<br>does things.<br><br>and no declaration of war by Congress<br><br>This one is covered under US law. The War Powers Act gives a president<br>90 days after he commits troops to a conflict to get an *AUMF* (an<br>Authorization for the Use of Military Force), or a declaration of war,<br>from Congress. If he fails to get such an authorization, the troops must<br>be withdrawn. Note that Congress does not need to declare war. Congress<br>needs only authorize the use of military force, which is basically a<br>recognition that while short of declaring war, the President has at<br>least justified what he did.<br><br>The conflict here is that according to the Constitution, Congress has<br>the power to declare war (Article I Section 8), but the President is the<br>Commander-in-Chief (Article II Section 2). This is where the War Powers<br>Act tries (unsuccessfully, but at least tries) to fill the void between<br>the two Constitutional directives.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
