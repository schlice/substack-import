<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I saw a survey by Barna, their 2025 "[[State of the<br>Church](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d281c2&url=https://www.barna.com/research/belief-in-jesus-rises/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="barna.com"}]{.qlink_container}" survey, earlier this month.<br>The survey revealed that more and more young people are choosing to<br>believe in Jesus. This is very good news. According to Barna's survey<br>data, the percentage of U.S. adults who say "I have made a personal<br>commitment to follow Jesus that is still important to my life today" hit<br>a 21st-century low in 2021 at 54%. Since then, the percentage has jumped<br>a full 12 points to 66%. It means that more millennial and Gen Z adults<br>are curious about or are committing to a relationship with Jesus. In a<br>world which was previously categorized by those same people *walking<br>away* from their faith, this is something to celebrate.<br><br>Yet, according to Barna's survey, many people who are interested in<br>following (or already do say they follow) Jesus are less interested in<br>engaging with the church. The survey found that a significant percentage<br>(27%) of individuals who say they've made a commitment to Jesus *don't<br>identify as Christians*. This means that while people are indeed finding<br>Jesus and the truth of the Gospel (which is great), they're not wanting<br>to be associated with the church (which is problematic).<br><br>This matches what you've identified: people want Jesus as *savior*, but<br>they don't want to pattern their lives after His; they don't want Him to<br>be *Lord*. This may be because they've been turned off by differences in<br>denominations as well as controversies in the church and how those play<br>on social media.<br><br>But these nascent Christians will still need other mature Christians who<br>love Jesus to come alongside them and teach them what following Jesus<br>looks like in a modern age. In short, they will need Christians to<br>disciple them. They'll need the church.<br><br>So millennials and Gen Z'ers are trying to split the baby. They're<br>trying to have their cake and eat it too. Pick your metaphor, but<br>they're trying to parse the difference between being a believer in<br>Christ yet ignoring the parts of Christianity they consider to be<br>tasteless: being a member of a church and living life as a committed<br>Christian.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
