<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>No, it's not appropriate, because they truly do believe in it.<br><br>It's more appropriate to point out that they have *much more faith than<br>you do*, because the gap between the facts and their belief (which is<br>bridged by faith) is much wider for them than it is for you. Therefore,<br>they must have more faith to believe in something which is supported by<br>fewer facts.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-751b230ea612134b164f342ac7d224f2){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-751b230ea612134b164f342ac7d224f2"<br>master_w="1097" master_h="485"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>*(As you can see, when you have fewer facts, you need more faith to<br>reach your belief)*<br><br>For example, all of the best information we have tells us that the<br>universe exploded into being out of nothing. The Law of Causality tells<br>us that nothing begins to exist without a cause. Therefore, either<br>someone caused something to come into existence out of nothing, or<br>no one caused something to come into existence out of nothing. Which<br>view is more reasonable? The view that someone created something out<br>of nothing. Which view requires more faith to believe? The view that<br>no one created something out of nothing.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
