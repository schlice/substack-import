<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As always, the answer is in the details.<br><br>The admonition about telling the truth exists whether you are giving an<br>expository answer (during direct questioning), or when you are only<br>allowed to answer with a simple yes or no (as when being<br>cross-examined). Anything you say "under oath" must be the truth, the<br>whole truth, and nothing but the truth. But there is a great difference<br>between what happens during direct examination and<br>cross-examination, and why you can only give certain types of<br>answers during each phase.<br><br>Direct examination presents the witness' version of events, and<br>establishes facts favorable to the side calling the witness. To that<br>end, lengthy, detailed answers are permitted. The questions asked must<br>be "non-leading," which means that the witness is answering of his or<br>her own volition and not being "led" or coached.<br><br>On cross-examination, however, the exact opposite happens.<br>Cross-examination seeks to undermine the credibility of the witness in<br>the eyes of the jury. The witness is asked leading questions about his<br>specific statements he gave during direct examination. The witness is<br>limited to only yes or no answers to ensure that the witness only<br>specifically addresses what they said during direct examination, and is<br>questioned regarding those statements. In other words, to ensure that<br>the witness cannot introduce new testimony during cross-examination, his<br>answers are limited to simple yes or no answers. The questions during<br>cross-examination are specifically leading questions, leading the<br>witness to answer either yes or no.<br><br>Like his prose during direct exam, his yes or no answers must also be<br>truthful. But it makes no sense for him to lie during cross-examination,<br>because doing so would contradict the statements he made during direct<br>examination, accomplishing exactly what opposing counsel is trying to<br>do: discredit the witness.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
