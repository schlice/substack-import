<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you think the NRA is worried that if Trump is able to declare a<br>\"national emergency\" over a border wall that a future president might<br>declare a national emergency over gun violence?**<br><br>No, and it's clear from your question that you don't understand what a<br>national emergency is, what it does, and what it does not do.<br><br>A national emergency doesn't allow the President to do whatever he<br>wants. What the President can do is defined by the [[National<br>Emergencies<br>Act](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eaf2df&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Emergencies_Act){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}. There are about 136<br>distinct statutory emergency powers the President can enact by declaring<br>a national emergency. He can't just go off the rails and do anything he<br>likes. For example, in this particular national emergency, he can enact<br>the emergency provisions of 10 USC § 2808(a) and authorize military<br>construction projects. What Federal law would they enact to do something<br>about gun violence? The one in bold below is likely to be the one Trump<br>is enacting using this current national emergency:<br><br>> Emergency presidential powers are dramatic, and range from suspending<br>> all laws regulating chemical and biological weapons, including the ban<br>> on human testing (50 U.S.C. § 1515, passed 1969); to suspending any<br>> Clean Air Act implementation plan or excess emissions penalty upon<br>> petition of a state governor (42 U.S.C. (f) § 7410 (f), passed 1977);<br>> **to authorizing and constructing military construction projects (10<br>> U.S.C. (a) § 2808 (a), passed 1982) using any existing defense<br>> appropriations for such military constructions (\$10.4 billion in<br>> FY2018);** to drafting any retired Coast Guard officers (14 U.S.C. §<br>> 331, passed 1963) or enlisted members (14 U.S.C. § 359, passed 1949)<br>> into active duty.\[1\](#cNlSO){#cite-cNlSO .citation_link}<br><br>So I don't think that there is any Federal law which a President could<br>enact using a national emergency that would have any appreciable effect<br>on gun violence.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-cNlSO){.citation_index} [[National Emergencies Act -<br>Wikipedia](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=eaf2df&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Emergencies_Act){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
