<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**How can one keep masked trespassers off their property in the day and<br>I don\'t mean raccoons?**<br><br>Let's start with the easiest one:<br><br>[[Amazon.com : Orbit 62100 Yard Enforcer Motion-Activated Sprinkler with<br>Day & Night Detection Modes : Lawn And Garden Sprinklers : Garden &<br>Outdoor](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f22507&url=https://www.amazon.com/Orbit-62100-Activated-Sprinkler-Detection/dp/B009F1R0GC){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>This is a link to a *motion-activated sprinkler*. This thing is<br>designed to keep deer and other animals off of your lawn. It has a<br>motion sensor and a standard lawn sprinkler. When it detects motion, it<br>kicks on the sprinkler.<br><br>Then, if they bypass the sprinkler, when they get closer to the house,<br>this one will pick them up:<br><br>[[Amazon.com: Ring Floodlight Camera Motion-Activated HD Security Cam<br>Two-Way Talk and Siren Alarm, White: Amazon<br>Devices](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=2525ad&url=https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Floodlight-Camera-Motion-Activated-Security/dp/B0727XJQLD){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>This one is a little more technological (and a little more expensive),<br>but it will notify you when it detects motion, the floodlights kick on<br>and you are notified on your phone. You can initiate 2--way conversation<br>with them, and activate a 110-decibel siren. Crooks don't like loud<br>noises or bright lights.<br><br>Finally, you can simply pick up your phone and dial 911. Tell the<br>operator there are masked men on your lawn and you think you saw a gun.<br>You'll get response as fast as your department can send it.<br><br>Now, use defense in depth. Make sure you have a dog (or something that<br>sounds like a dog - Alexa has a program that sounds exactly like a guard<br>dog). Make sure you have a panic room you can go to. And finally (if you<br>are prepared for the responsibility), be armed in your panic room and if<br>the door opens and it's not a police officer, be prepared to defend your<br>life and the lives of anyone in the panic room with you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
