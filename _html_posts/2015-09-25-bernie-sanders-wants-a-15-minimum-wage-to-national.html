<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Mike Rowe (the comedic host of *Dirty Jobs*) discusses<br>this in depth as he<br>[lobbies(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=382d4f&url=https://www.facebook.com/TheRealMikeRowe/posts/938382126171931:0){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="facebook.com"}]{.qlink_container} for people to fill the<br>millions (currently around three million) of currently unfilled basic<br>skilled labor jobs in this country. In a nutshell, he says that rather<br>than paying more for *unskilled* labor, put that money towards<br>vocational training, get some *skill*, and make yourself worth more.<br>Entry-level jobs are just that: entry level. Once you have some<br>experience, you\'re expected to *move on.* Entry level jobs were never<br>expected to sustain you, or a family. He says, \"Very few of those jobs<br>require a four-year degree, but nearly all require specific training.<br>And all pay more than the current minimum wage. If we want a skilled<br>workforce, (and believe me, we do,) should we really be demanding \$20<br>an hour for unskilled labor?\"\<br>\<br>Nationalizing the oil and gas industry would only serve to remove the<br>profit. But profits aren\'t what drive cost at the pump; it\'s the cost<br>of the raw fuel:\<br>\<br>]<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-61d2a3bb6bfd53da77a397ac13ad52c1){.portrait .qtext_image<br>.zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-61d2a3bb6bfd53da77a397ac13ad52c1"<br>master_w="2550" master_h="3300"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>\<br>As you can see in this graphic from Michigan (where gas is probably some<br>the most expensive in the country), the vast majority of the cost of<br>gasoline is the actual cost of fuel. Nationalizing will only affect the<br>2.8% of the cost which is taken by fuel stations (since they will now be<br>government operations). Some have said that nearly 40% of the wholesale<br>cost of gasoline, but [[this<br>table](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=77a513&url=http://energyalmanac.ca.gov/gasoline/margins/){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="ca.gov"}]{.qlink_container} from California (I know,<br>Michigan vs California, but it\'s close, gimme a break) shows that when<br>gas was \$3.89 (per gallon) in California, \"Distribution cost,<br>Marketing costs, and profits\" were only \$0.39 per gallon. The actual<br>crude oil cost \$1.31, refinery costs and their profit (which are mostly<br>outside the United States since environmental regulations are so heavy<br>on stateside refining) are \$1.60, and taxes were about \$0.50. We\'d be<br>able to eliminate the taxes and the profit, which would cut the cost<br>down to closer to \$3/gal. Not a significant benefit when you consider<br>the massive tax increases and government expansion that will be required<br>to sustain the new governmental oil and gas system. And you can bet that<br>any refining companies which currently reside in the United States will<br>pick up and leave should the oil and gas industry be nationalized. Their<br>rates will go up, and with no chance of a President Sanders removing any<br>environmental regulations to increase refining in the United States,<br>fuel costs (the majority of which is refining cost) will go up. So<br>ultimately, you\'ll see some volatility, but nothing will really change<br>at the pump.\<br>\<br>Why a 90% top-tier tax rate? What is that expected to accomplish? Are<br>you trying to pay off the national debt? You could make the top *three*<br>tax tiers 100% and you still wouldn\'t pay off the national debt any<br>time soon. I would much rather see us control runaway entitlement<br>spending rather than simply increasing taxes, even if it is on \"those<br>dirty stinking rich.\"\<br>\<br>Expanding Medicaid is what Obamacare did. We\'re going to expand it<br>*more*? Who else is it going to cover that it didn\'t cover before?\<br>\<br>I agree that healthcare insurance is driving up the cost of medical<br>care, but I don\'t think single payer is the answer. I think removing<br>the health insurance industry will significantly reduce costs. I think<br>instituting tiered healthcare will further allow all people access to<br>basic healthcare. Heck, doctors go overseas and do it for *free* these<br>days; why aren\'t they doing it here? Yes, specialty healthcare will<br>still need some form of payment, as doctors still need to make a living,<br>and they did attend years of schooling and have advanced knowledge that<br>the average parent doesn\'t have. They do deserve to be paid fairly for<br>their work. And specialists even more so.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
