<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Natural explanations which follow the scientific method cannot explain<br>the supernatural. That's why they are called "supernatural", or "beyond<br>the natural." Indeed, the most supernatural of events---the creation of<br>the entire universe and everything in it out of nothing---has already<br>occurred, and science cannot explain that. If you can believe that a<br>supernatural being can create the universe and everything in it out of<br>nothing, then believing the other miracles documented in the Bible<br>should be easy to do.<br><br>But to explain why YEC (young earth creationism) could actually have<br>merit, let's look at some other supernatural events documented in the<br>Bible.<br><br>The Bible says that Adam was created on the sixth day. So logically, on<br>the seventh day, he would have been one day old, right?<br><br>But he was not. He was a fully-formed human, equivalent to a born child<br>who lived for over 20 years.<br><br>In other words, **God pre-baked Adam's age into him when He created<br>him.**<br><br>*Just like He did with the earth.*<br><br>See, this isn't hard to parse. If you can believe in miracles (like the<br>creation of the earth out of nothing), then you can believe in YEC.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
