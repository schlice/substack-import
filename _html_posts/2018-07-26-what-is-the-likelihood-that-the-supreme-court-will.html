<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What is the likelihood that the Supreme Court will grant certiorari<br>and then uphold Indiana\'s ultrasound abortion law, overturning the<br>lower courts\' decision?**<br><br>Unlikely, even with a majority textualist SCOTUS. The Indiana law places<br>an undue burden on women seeking an abortion. The courts recognize this,<br>and correctly block the law.<br><br>That's the only thing at issue. It's not a pro-life vs. pro-choice issue<br>at all. It's purely an undue burden issue, which could block some women<br>from being legally able to get an abortion when abortion would otherwise<br>be legal. If a woman couldn't afford a trip to the nearest OB-GYN which<br>could provide the procedure, or afford the procedure on top of the<br>abortion, it could be a barrier to abortion, which would currently be<br>unconstitutional.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
