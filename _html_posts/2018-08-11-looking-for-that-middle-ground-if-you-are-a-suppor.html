If you do not<br>endorse President Trump, what is one thing he has done that you<br>support?**<br><br>I love the President because he has done exactly what he said he was<br>going to do. He did exactly what he was elected to do, and it's working.<br><br>*I seriously wish he would stop using Twitter unsupervised.*<br><br>I mean, I get it. He's from New York, so I understand the attitude. I<br>get it. I'm from New York too.<br><br>But for God's sake, please stop with the Twitter.<br><br>He doesn't need to be a better, more eloquent speaker. He just needs to<br>speak *less*. Let actions speak where words fail.<br><br>\<br><br>*If you're interested in discussing Trump's Twitter usage, feel free to<br>comment. But I'm not debating you on anything else. I'm not going to<br>debate whether or not you think Trump has done anything good (or<br>anything useful at all) during his presidency to date. Start telling me<br>how he hasn't really done anything, or trying to make me prove what he's<br>done, and your comment gets deleted. I'm totally not interested in<br>arguing about what you think he's done right or wrong, unless you have a<br>comment about Trump's Twitter usage.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
