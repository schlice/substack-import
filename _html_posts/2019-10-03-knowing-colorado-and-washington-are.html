<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Knowing Colorado and Washington are \"Right to Die\" states in which<br>doctor assisted suicide is legal, will this evolve to a criminal<br>circumstance where a person convicted and sentenced to die be given an<br>option to commit suicide?**<br><br>No.<br><br>The "right to die" legislation is narrowly tailored for someone who has<br>been diagnosed with a terminal illness and has less than six months to<br>live. They are already suffering in their last days; they simply want to<br>end their suffering.<br><br>Death row inmates are appreciably not suffering in the same way that<br>terminally ill patients are. Death row inmates already die peacefully<br>(or at least, that's how the lethal injection medicine is designed to<br>work). They do not suffer.<br><br>There is no need to extend the existing "right to die" statute to<br>include those on death row, as the circumstances surrounding their<br>deaths are totally different.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
