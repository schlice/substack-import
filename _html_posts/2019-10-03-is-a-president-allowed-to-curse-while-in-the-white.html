<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Is a president allowed to curse while in the White House?<br><br>Of course he is. The 1st Amendment says (emphasis mine):<br><br>> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of<br>> religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or **abridging the<br>> freedom of speech**, or of the press; or the right of the people<br>> peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of<br>> grievances.<br><br>It probably doesn't comport with the decorum due to a place like the<br>White House, but it's certainly not illegal.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
