<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Here's a few definitions you might find useful:<br><br>Copay: A fixed amount that an insured person pays at the time of<br>service. For example, your doctor's visits may include a \$30 copay. You<br>would pay this at the doctor's office<br><br>Coinsurance: This is a "shared cost" model of insurance. When you<br>have coinsurance, your plan will pay a certain percentage of the cost of<br>a covered service, and you will pay the remainder. For example, let's<br>say you had a 70% coinsurance. For a \$150 procedure, the plan would pay<br>\$105, and you would pay \$45. Coinsurance is normally billed to you.<br><br>Deductible: The amount you pay for services before insurance starts<br>to pay. For example, let's say your plan had a \$1500 deductible. This<br>means you pay the full amount of your health care costs until you have<br>paid the amount of your deductible. So looking at the coinsurance<br>example above, if you have not paid \$1500 of charges during that<br>calendar year, you would pay the full \$150 for the procedure. Once you<br>have met your deductible amount, then the coinsurance would kick in.<br><br>Some other important tidbits about health insurance:<br><br>- Choose your plans based on how frequently you think you'll be visiting<br>  the doctor or using healthcare. For example, if you visit the doctor<br>  often, choose a plan with a lower copay or coinsurance.<br>- However, you should also note that plans with lower copays and lower<br>  coinsurance will usually cost you more in monthly premiums.<br><br>Now that that's all out of the way, let's look at your example. "100%<br>coinsurance" is sort of a silly way to describe a policy, because there<br>are no "co" payments going on. The insurance company is paying 0% of the<br>bill, and you pay 100%. Similarly, no deductible means that you don't<br>have to pay any deductibles before insurance begins paying, but it's<br>moot since insurance isn't paying anyway.<br><br>In case it's still not clear, *that's not a really good plan.*<br><br>Your monthly premiums will probably be fairly low to purchase such a<br>plan, but you will pay the full cost of any procedures you undergo.<br><br>With MS, your procedures can be fairly expensive (i.e. regular MRIs of<br>the brain, expensive medications, etc). Medications alone can cost<br>\$10,000 per month retail. I don't know what your out-of-pocket cost<br>would be, but if medications are part of this plan, you will pay the<br>full out-of-pocket cost for them as well.<br><br>If you didn't have a condition which required regular treatments, this<br>might be a good plan. But in your case, this is not an ideal plan.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
