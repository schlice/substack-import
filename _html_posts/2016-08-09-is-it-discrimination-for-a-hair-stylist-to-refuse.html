<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> The salon I go to has a policy of not doing small kid's cuts. They<br>> will accept kid's appointments, but if the child screams, cries,<br>> kicks, runs away, etc, the appointment is cancelled with no refund. A<br>> lady apparently is trying to sue them because her kid made a fuss and<br>> this policy was exercised.<br><br>First of all, I don't know of any place where you pre-pay for your<br>appointment. Usually you pay for your haircut after they're done, not<br>before. This gives the salon the opportunity for what they call<br>*upsell.* They try to sell you more services, styling products, etc.<br>Forcing you to pre-pay for your haircut minimizes the opportunity for<br>upsell. So I'm not sure what "cancelling an appointment with no refund"<br>means, since you rarely pre-pay for your haircut.<br><br>Nevertheless, it is not discriminatory to require your haircut clients<br>to be compliant. Children have to be old enough to sit still in the<br>chair while the stylist does his or her work. Having a child kicking,<br>screaming (disturbing the other stylists and/or guests), or getting out<br>of the chair is not only disruptive, it elongates the amount of time<br>needed to complete a haircut which ruins efficiency for the salon, and<br>could be dangerous for the child (kicking children and scissors don't<br>mix). And if they start to have appointments backing up, they start to<br>lose clients to the competition, which means they lose money.<br><br>Unless there is a state law which requires salons to accept clients of<br>any age, salons can determine the minimum client age they take on their<br>own. It's not discriminatory to say that you don't do kid's cuts, or<br>that your clients must stay in their seats for the duration of the cut,<br>or that clients cannot disrupt other stylists or patrons. So long as<br>they apply those policies to every client, regardless of age, I find it<br>hard to believe that a discrimination lawsuit would prevail.<br><br>And even so, you would only be able to recover actual damages, and what<br>damage was done by this particular salon refusing to cut a child's hair?<br>I don't think you could recover much.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
