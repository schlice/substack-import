<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Are electronics that have been jailbroken easily traced?<br><br>Not necessarily, but they can be.<br><br>The security that has been established by the manufacturer prevents<br>malicious software from running and gaining higher-level access to the<br>hardware, such that it will not open up security holes which may make it<br>more easily traced, or more easily hacked. If a third-party software is<br>lax with security, the protections in the un-jailbroken software will<br>prevent the third-party software from inadvertently opening up security<br>holes.<br><br>When we jailbreak a device, we remove the protections that are inbuilt<br>by the manufacturer, which allows us to install software which can<br>bypass those protections. While this is not inherently dangerous, it can<br>be, because it places the onus of security on the individual developer<br>rather than centralizing that protection in the operating system. If<br>they do it correctly, security will not be compromised. However, if that<br>software is lax with security, or is reckless with its security, it can<br>easily open up a security hole which hackers can use to break in to the<br>hardware.<br><br>So in general, a jailbroken device, by itself, is no more or less secure<br>than one which is not. However, the software you install *after* a<br>device is jailbroken can potentially open up security holes which can be<br>used by malicious actors to hack the hardware.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
