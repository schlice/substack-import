<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Even though Trump doesn\'t like to exercise should he be forced to for<br>the sake of our nation?**<br><br>Short answer: no.<br><br>Longer answer: There is no Constitutional requirement that the president<br>remain healthy, or alive. In fact, the Constitution specifies that a<br>plan for succession needs to be in place. It says so in numerous<br>locations: Article II, Section 1, Clause 6, as well as the 12th<br>Amendment, 20th Amendment, and 25th Amendment. Congress passed the<br>Presidential Succession Act in 1947, and last revised it in 2006.<br><br>That plan of succession says who becomes president in the event the<br>president dies or is incapacitated and can no longer perform his duties.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
