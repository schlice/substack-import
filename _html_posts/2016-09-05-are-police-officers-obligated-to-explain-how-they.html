<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Since the only agency with the statutory authority to determine whether<br>or not an officer's conduct is lawful is the court, arguing your case to<br>the police officer is potentially entertaining, but mostly useless.<br><br>Officers are not obligated to tell you at the scene what law they are<br>following, what evidence they have, or how their actions are lawful.<br>They are required to document all of that on your arrest report, and<br>they are required to answer to a judge, and all of the items in your<br>question are fair game for a judge to ask.<br><br>So where does that leave you, hapless motorist, being placed under<br>arrest? Again, only the court has the authority to determine if an<br>officer is acting lawfully, so arguing with that officer is pointless.<br>Comply with the officer's orders, and argue in court where it will<br>actually do some good.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
