  neither violent nor illegal, or that their protests are violent and illegal, but
  justifiably so, because their cause is righteous and they occupy the moral high
  ground?"'

<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Most people who attend these protests are, in fact, non-violent. But<br>their protests are being *hijacked*. There are two different<br>groups hijacking these peaceful protests.<br><br>The first group of hijackers is *violent agitators* who are<br>well-funded by far-left progressive wealthy groups. These people<br>communicate on decentralized encrypted communications apps like Signal<br>and Telegram. They coordinate their efforts. They know how to create<br>gaps in police lines. They know the most effective strategies for<br>causing mass mayhem. They slip in, they change clothes, they keep in<br>contact, they cause their mayhem, and they slip out, leaving the<br>non-violent protesters to take the rap for their violent conduct.<br><br>There is also another group of agitators: *paid protesters*. Yes,<br>there are people who are being paid by the Democrats (over 70 different<br>Democrat-aligned groups have been identified so far) to *travel* to<br>these protests to make it seem like they are organic, grassroots efforts<br>when they are not that at all. Those protesters are paid to be there.<br>They were paid to travel to these cities and participate in these<br>protests. In some cities, it was estimated that over half of the<br>protesters were paid protesters who were brought in to protest.<br><br>So the truth is that many anti-deportation, anti-ICE Trump haters are<br>nonviolent. They do not intend violence. They merely intend to make<br>their presence known and to peacefully protest. But their efforts are<br>being intentionally hijacked by those who want to sow chaos and turmoil,<br>and by those who are paid protesters trying to bolster something which<br>initially started as a grassroots effort and became a full-fledged<br>Democrat lobbying platform.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
