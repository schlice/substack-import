<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [*Having* cancer makes you unlucky, or a patient, or as you<br>said, unfortunate.\<br>\<br>*Living with* cancer, and how you choose to live your life, can make you<br>brave, or a hero, or a warrior.\<br>\<br>The fact that your body develops in a certain way does not make you<br>brave. It makes you unique. How we react to our bodies and how we choose<br>to pattern our lives makes our lives characteristic. Depending on the<br>character of that life, words like brave or hero or warrior could be<br>appropriate characterizations.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
