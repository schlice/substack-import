<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>A Qi-capable device (Qi is pronounced \"chee\") is a device that<br>supports \"wireless charging.\" Wireless charging uses a theory of<br>magnetism called \"induction\" whereby a current is \"induced\" in an<br>electrical wire by a magnetic field nearby.<br><br>If you have an electric toothbrush, it uses inductive charging when you<br>set it on its base. No contacts are exposed because of the waterproof<br>housing, but the battery is charged anyway.<br><br>In mobile phones, the standard is called \"Qi.\"<br><br>Generally, a mobile phone is not designed to be both a Qi-capable<br>receiver and separately a Qi-capable charger. No phone that I know<br>of has a charging circuit that can provide a charge to another device.<br>It adds too much bulk to the phone in a period of time when<br>manufacturers are striving to make phones slimmer and lighter.<br><br>(EDIT) Now, devices can both charge themselves wirelessly, and use their<br>batteries to charge other wireless devices wirelessly as well. Samsung's<br>version of this is called "Wireless Power Sharing." I use it on trips to<br>charge my watch while I charge my phone with a cable. I only need one<br>cable and I can charge my phone and my watch at the same time.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
