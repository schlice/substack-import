<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I am happily married, and have been for approaching 30 years. I wasn't<br>blissfully happy every second of every day of my marriage; it ebbs and<br>flows, but it's always there.<br><br>That fact does not "switch off" biology. It does not "switch off"<br>temptation.<br><br>Biology is normal. Temptation is normal. For those of you who are<br>religious (and know of Jesus), even he was tempted; it's documented in<br>the Bible.<br><br>But while temptation is normal and expected, **acting on<br>temptation** is abnormal and is unexpected.<br><br>As a married man, you must recognize that biology will cause attractions<br>to happen naturally. You must consciously resist those attractions.<br>The attraction should be a *trigger* to you to be on your guard for<br>situations which may devolve into action which you may desire initially,<br>but is undesirable in the long term. And if you just happen to be in one<br>of those "ebbs" in the cycle of your marriage, and you hit one of these<br>attractions, it just makes it that much harder to resist.<br><br>We learned when we were toddlers that we don't get everything that we<br>want. We may want to eat ice cream and cookies for every meal of the<br>day, but we don't, because doing so (even though you may desire it<br>initially) is undesirable in the long term.<br><br>You may *want* to continue talking to that attractive woman who seems to<br>be into you, but the results of doing so will be undesirable in the long<br>term. It may seem exciting that "you still got it," and that another<br>woman besides your wife might actually consider you attractive and may<br>want to talk to you. Good for you, cowboy. You're not a stinking pile of<br>turd. Congratulations for that.<br><br>And that's exactly where that road of discovery should end. It requires<br>*conscious thought* and *deliberate action* to cut off that conversation<br>and move on. And take it from the fellas who have been doing this whole<br>marriage thing for a while now: if it hasn't happened yet, it will. And<br>if you think it's easy, you haven't experienced it yet. And if you<br>think, "Meh, I can keep talking to her, because *I* would never<br>actually physically do something," you're probably wrong. You'll think<br>you can keep walking that line until you wake up in a hotel room bed<br>with a massive hangover next to a woman who is not your wife, and at<br>that point it's too late. You can\'t un-ring that bell.<br><br>You thought you were a strong man before? Try denying your biology. Try<br>telling your mind and your body to go do something else when every nerve<br>in your...well...everywhere is screaming to stay and get closer. If you<br>can do that, then you can consider yourself a strong man. I don't<br>care how many cast iron plates you can lift off the ground; if you can<br>do this, that's when I consider you strong.<br><br>And don't forget: *YOU MADE A VOW!* (In modern-speak, that's a<br>really sincere promise, in front of other people who saw you make that<br>promise). Now tell me: *how much is your word worth?* And more<br>importantly, *how much should* *others* *value your word?* In other<br>words, if you can break your promises whenever you feel like it, how<br>much stock should anyone place in anything you promise to do? If you<br>don't care to keep your promises, how much should *anyone* value your<br>reputation?<br><br>(Don't misunderstand here: as I mentioned, this is not easy; people fail<br>all the time at this. Just look at how high the divorce rate is. This<br>doesn't mean that you can't come back from a divorce and be a good and<br>faithful husband. What it *does* mean is that it's much harder to<br>repair a broken reputation than it is to never break your reputation in<br>the first place.)<br><br>Remember the upshot of all of this: temptation is normal and<br>expected, acting on temptation is abnormal and is unexpected.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
