<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Since you didn\'t specify in your answer, I will provide<br>you with a few different perspectives.\<br>\<br>Overall, the answer is \"it depends.\"\<br>\<br>Is it legally right to kill a person to save 10 people? *Probably,<br>but varies depending on where you are.* If you are in an area where<br>legal guns are prohibited, and you kill someone, using a gun, to save<br>ten others, you have still broken the law to do so. So whether or not it<br>is legally right to kill a person in order to save 10 people is<br>dependent on where you are at that moment. Additionally, are you killing<br>one person who is directly threatening 10 people, or are you killing<br>one person (such as a political leader) because someone else is holding<br>the lives of 10 people ransom? This action would definitely not be<br>legal, because the definition of defense of others only includes using<br>force to defend others who are directly being threatened.\<br>\<br>Is it morally right to kill a person to save 10 people? It depends<br>on your view of morality. What is one life worth? Does a person lose<br>worth if they threaten the lives of 10 people? Should that person have<br>the right to continue living if they threaten the lives of others? What<br>if you feel that it is immoral to take anyone\'s life, ever, regardless<br>of what actions they are taking? In that case, you would feel that it is<br>better to let 10 people die than for you to take a<br>life.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
