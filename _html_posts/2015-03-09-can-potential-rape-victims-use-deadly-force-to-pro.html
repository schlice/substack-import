<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>> *Typically deadly force is used to combat an equal threat of force. In<br>> the case of an attempted rape, is the victim legally allowed to use<br>> deadly force (let\'s say they have a gun) to stop the attack, or are<br>> they required to use other means? I\'ve found very little research on<br>> the subject.*<br><br>You are right, current laws don\'t adequately lay out the basis for the<br>use of deadly force against an attacker who doesn\'t present a<br>life-threatening position, but only presents a position of forcible or<br>unwanted sexual intercourse. But I think you can make the case for the<br>use of deadly force to stop a rape.<br><br>In order to be legally justified to kill an attacker, a victim has to be<br>in fear for her life. In a rape, a victim has to reasonably believe that<br>a rapist intends to kill or grievously injure her in order to use deadly<br>force against him.<br><br>(EDIT) As my commenters always helpfully remind me when I make a<br>mistake, I forgot to make abundantly clear that in most states, the<br>legal standard to use deadly force is "imminent threat of death **or<br>great bodily harm**." It is pretty clear that a forcible rape would<br>squarely fall into the second category.<br><br>There are lots of things to consider that may happen during rapes. Rapes<br>often end in murder or in serious physical injury, so a victim can<br>reasonably assume that her life and health would be in serious danger.<br>Additionally, rapes often include physical trauma, unwanted pregnancy,<br>and other possible side effects (mental instability, STDs, etc). Under<br>objective review, rape can universally be considered a grievous physical<br>and psychological attack.<br><br>Using that standard, a victim can resist a rape using any force at her<br>disposal, up to and including deadly force.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
