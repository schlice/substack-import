Am I pregnant<br>even though I have not ejaculated anything inside of me?**<br><br>First of all, no one on the Internet can tell you if you're pregnant. Go<br>down to the local Walmart or your local drugstore and buy an early<br>pregnancy test.<br><br>Now, you should know this stuff before you have sex, but what's done is<br>done. You can learn it now. When the male begins intercourse, there is a<br>small amount of semen on the tip of the penis. It is called<br>*pre-ejaculate,* or *precum*. The fluid is produced by a pair of<br>pea-sized glands called the Cowper's glands, located near the urethra,<br>the tube in the penis with a dual purpose: allowing urine and semen to<br>exit the body. Pre-ejaculate fluid neutralizes any acidity left by urine<br>in the urethra, protecting sperm that flows through.<br><br>But here's the kicker: *precum can also contain sperm.*<br><br>So it is entirely possible to get pregnant without him ejaculating. It's<br>not likely, but it's possible.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
