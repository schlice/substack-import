<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>"C2--3" refers to your spinal cord, and "C2" and "C3â€³ are vertebrae in<br>your spine, just under your skull in your cervical spine (thus the C).<br>The vertebrae in your back are in the "thoracic spine" and are indicated<br>using T# designations. The lower spine is called the "lumbar spine" and<br>is indicated using L# designations. Using the identifiers helps doctors<br>quickly understand where the lesions are on your spine.<br><br>[https://www.spine-health.com/con\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=80ed17&url=https://www.spine-health.com/conditions/spine-anatomy/all-about-c2-c5-spinal-motion-segments){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="spine-health.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>In general, lesions on your spine cause similar symptoms as lesions in<br>other areas of your brain and spine: numbness, tingling, weakness, and<br>balance issues.<br><br>In addition, cervical spine lesions can cause loss of sensation in the<br>shoulders and arms.<br><br>Don't forget though, symptoms are unique to each person; not everyone<br>experiences MS in the same way. Even if you and someone else have<br>exactly the same lesions, you may still experience different symptoms.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice, nor is it a substitute<br>for professional medical advice.
