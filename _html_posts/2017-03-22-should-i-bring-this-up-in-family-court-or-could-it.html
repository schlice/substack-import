<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The judge needs to understand her frame of mind. He needs to see that<br>she is more apt to argue about the details of the custody order than to<br>take care of the children.<br><br>And whatever you do, *document, document, document.* Photo storage on<br>Google Photos is free and unlimited, so take pictures of everything. For<br>example, taking photos of the outfit you sent your child to her mom<br>wearing, and a photo of the outfit in which she returned. Documentation<br>helps to keep everyone focused on the issue rather than the emotion.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
