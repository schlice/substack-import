<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I think you don't know the difference between responsibility and<br>accountability. Responsibility is about the actions of a person<br>or group, while accountability is about being answerable for the<br>results of those actions.<br><br>So to that end, is Trump *responsible* for those deaths? Clearly,<br>no. Trump does not control the weather (crazy conspiracy theories<br>notwithstanding). Therefore, Trump did not make it flood. He is no more<br>*responsible* for the deaths in the flooding than I am. Full stop.<br><br>\<br><br>Now, is Trump *accountable* for those deaths? That's a much more<br>nuanced question.<br><br>First, most disaster preparedness is controlled by the state, not<br>the feds. The feds are there as backup, and the feds can release<br>emergency aid money to the state if their finances get overwhelmed. But<br>by and large, disaster preparedness (and subsequent recovery) is the<br>responsibility of the state emergency management office and the governor<br>(they're the ones who take the action). The feds don't step in unless<br>they're called.<br><br>So the first line of *accountability* (the ones answerable for the<br>result of those actions) belongs with the Director of the Texas Division<br>of Emergency Management. I'd be reviewing that office to ensure that all<br>possible avenues of prevention were being exercised. Did the disaster<br>plan get activated? Did it include contact to all the residents? Were<br>those contact attempts ignored?<br><br>*(EDIT) It appears that all relevant warnings and emergency<br>notifications were, in fact, distributed. Some of the accountability<br>will have to fall on the people who ignored those warnings and did not<br>evacuate as appropriate. That's a hard truth, because it always comes<br>across as "victim blaming," but the truth doesn't care about how it<br>comes across.*<br><br>Then next, clearly, would be the governor of Texas. Did he ensure that<br>TDEM had all the funding and support it needed? Was he in constant<br>communication with the TDEM director? Was the National Guard spun up and<br>ready to go if they were needed? Did he appeal in a timely manner to<br>FEMA as required, if it was needed?<br><br>Then, after all other accountability has been distributed, whatever<br>is left falls on Trump, as the Chief Executive for the country. Did FEMA<br>respond appropriately? Were emergency funds released as appropriate?<br>Whatever accountability remained would be on Trump, as "the buck stops<br>here" on the President's desk.<br><br>\<br><br>TL;DR: Trump may, at some level, own some small accountability for the<br>deaths, but he does not own the vast majority of the accountability, and<br>was most certainly not responsible.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
