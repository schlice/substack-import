<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Because the vaccines don't prevent infection. They also don't prevent<br>you from spreading the virus to others.<br><br>> Most people who get COVID-19 are unvaccinated. **However, since<br>> vaccines are not 100% effective at preventing infection, some people<br>> who are fully vaccinated will still get COVID-19.** An infection of a<br>> fully vaccinated person is referred to as a "breakthrough<br>> infection."\[1\](#LeJXC){#cite-LeJXC .citation_link}<br><br>Breakthrough infections are most generally mild. Some who get infected<br>after vaccination don't even know they are infected.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Why do so many vaccinated people get infected, even several times?<br><br>\<br><br>*Feel free to comment, but if you think you're going to come into my<br>comments on my answers, pop off, and then block me, don't expect me to<br>keep your conversation around very long.*<br><br>*If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough shit. If my answer is<br>grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion masquerading as fact,<br>downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your own answer. But Quora<br>is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site. If you are simply<br>commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\" don\'t be surprised<br>if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything vaguely harassing in<br>there, and your deletion will be followed by a block/mute, and a BNBR<br>report. I will do this immediately and with no compunction.*<br><br>*You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-LeJXC){.citation_index} [[COVID-19<br>Vaccination](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=983422&url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/why-measure-effectiveness/breakthrough-cases.html){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="cdc.gov"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
