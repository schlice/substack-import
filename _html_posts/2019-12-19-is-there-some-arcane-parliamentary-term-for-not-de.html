<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is there some arcane parliamentary term for not delivering the<br>impeachment charges to the Senate?**<br><br>No, there is not. This is unprecedented in the history of the United<br>States.<br><br>A House drafting and passing Articles of Impeachment, yet failing to<br>deliver them to the Senate? Unheard of.<br><br>This essay discusses impeachment and the duties of the two houses. Note<br>that when they say "republican form of government" they are referring to<br>the fact that we are a representative republic, not a democracy.<br><br>> There is no doubt that the Framers saw impeachment as a part of the<br>> system of checks and balances to maintain the separation of powers and<br>> the republican form of government. The implication is that when the<br>> President (or other impeachable official) has committed an impeachable<br>> offense, the Members of the House, bound by the oaths they take to<br>> uphold the Constitution, are under a particular obligation to deal<br>> with the miscreant\'s offenses, irrespective of whether their bill of<br>> impeachment may or may not lead to a conviction in the<br>> Senate.\[1\](#UVVHg){#cite-UVVHg .citation_link}<br><br>In fact, Pelosi discussed this, as did Nadler and Schiff, as this<br>process was ongoing. They mentioned several times that it had no bearing<br>on them whether or not the Senate would convict, considering that it was<br>virtually assured that they would not. They felt it was their duty to<br>proceed with "deal\ing\ with the miscreant's offenses, irrespective of<br>whether their bill of impeachment may or may not lead to a conviction in<br>the Senate."<br><br>That's why this new development is so unusual. They all said that it<br>matters not whether or not the Senate will convict, it's their<br>responsibility to pass articles.<br><br>How is it not their responsibility to let the Senate do its job too?<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-UVVHg){.citation_index} [[Guide to the<br>Constitution](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=6115e7&url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/%23!/articles/1/essays/11/impeachment){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="heritage.org"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
