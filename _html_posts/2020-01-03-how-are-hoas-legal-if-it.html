If it's my property, what gives nosy neighbors the<br>right to tell me what I can do with my property?**<br><br>Besides all of the great and correct answers here (the HOA is a contract<br>you signed when you bought your house, and you absolutely have the right<br>to live in a neighborhood that is not controlled by an HOA), we should<br>review the purpose of an HOA.<br><br>HOAs exist to keep your home value as high as possible. They do this<br>*not* by telling you what you can do with your home, but by telling<br>*your neighbors* what they can do with *their* home. When you list your<br>house for sale, prospective buyers evaluate the neighborhood and<br>determine whether or not they want to buy your house (which is your<br>responsibility) in this neighborhood (which is your neighbors'<br>responsibility).<br><br>You can control what happens to your house; you own it. But you alone<br>can't make your neighbors keep their lawns cut. You can't make them keep<br>junk cars out of their driveways. You can't prevent them from painting<br>their house hot pink if they choose. You may be able to spend years in<br>court and spend thousands of dollars to try to litigate them into<br>compliance, but that is a massive hassle, makes for terrible neighbor<br>relations, and most importantly, creates a neighborhood where no one<br>wants to live.<br><br>The HOA exists in such a way that all homeowners are bound by the same<br>rules, and so that all homeowners must live by those rules or face<br>fines, and possible liens against their homes for failure to pay those<br>fines. This way, if your neighbor is not keeping up his end of the<br>bargain, the HOA has the power to fine them.<br><br>Of course, this implies that *you are a neighbor to someone else*, but<br>it's not about controlling you for the sake of controlling you. It's<br>about regulating what you do with the visible exterior areas of your<br>house for the benefit of the entire neighborhood.<br><br>Just remember *High School Musical*: We're all in this together.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
