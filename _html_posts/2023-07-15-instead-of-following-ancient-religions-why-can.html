<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>You certainly can do that. Nothing is stopping you. You can believe in<br>anything you like, or nothing at all. In fact, if you're truly motivated<br>enough, you can even start your own religion!<br><br>[https://www.wikihow.com/Start-a-\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=f2fe90&url=https://www.wikihow.com/Start-a-Religion){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikihow.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>Organized religions happen because *more than one person believes<br>similarly*. Christianity has [[more<br>followers](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=8d8bba&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religious_populations){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container} than any other world<br>religion at 2.382 billion followers worldwide (31.11% of the world's<br>population), based on the 2020 projection using 2010 numbers. That's a<br>lot of people who believe similarly.<br><br>But hey, if you are dissatisfied with all of the world's existing<br>religions, you can just abandon them all and come up with your own<br>"religion" which dictates how you should live your own life.<br><br>Most people just call it "atheism." (Cue the atheists in the comments<br>who will be quick to tell me that atheism is not a religion. Before you<br>do, though, I suggest you read through the WikiHow identifying the<br>elements of a religion).<br><br>Anyway, here's my advice to you: don't bother with all that religion<br>stuff. Just live your life in the best way you know how. Call it a<br>religion if you want others to believe as you do, otherwise just call it<br>"how I live." If you're just not interested in answers to questions like<br>*why am I here*, or *is there anything more to this life*, then don't<br>bother with religion.<br><br>Because just building something to believe in, that will help you live<br>this life, will not answer those deep, nagging questions, especially<br>that one little voice in the back of your head, when you survey the<br>splendor of this world, that whispers "*This is amazing, but why? There<br>must be a greater purpose to this life than* *just this**."*<br><br>It is only religion that can answer such questions.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
