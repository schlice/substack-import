<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [There was a study done that showed that people with MS had<br>lower levels of copper (and zinc) in their system. They even came up<br>with a hypothesis for how the lower levels of metals could relate to MS.<br>They hypothesized that because copper has an ameliorative effect against<br>demyelination (copper helps to prevent fat cell damage, and myelin is a<br>fatty acid), a lower level of the mineral in the bloodstream could lead<br>to more damage of myelin during disease activity. Therefore,<br>malabsorption of metals like copper and zinc could have a contributory<br>effect on MS.\<br>\<br>There are no studies that I am aware of that have otherwise reviewed<br>copper\'s relationship to MS.\<br>\<br>There are no studies that I am aware of that have focused specifically<br>on Cu77 and its relationship to MS.\<br>\<br>Remember though that correlation does not equal causation. Just because<br>a correlation was discovered between MS patients and lower levels of<br>heavy metals does not mean that lower levels of heavy metals causes<br>MS.]<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not professional medical advice**, nor is it a<br>substitute for professional medical advice.
