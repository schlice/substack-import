<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>As a student of history, I can tell you that war criminals are only<br>found on the *losing* side.<br><br>So in order to "round up the Israeli war criminals," Israel has to<br>*lose*.<br><br>Do you seriously think that the Palestinian Authority can *win*? Even<br>the Palestinian Authority knows they can't beat Israel. They're hoping<br>to win a *propaganda war*, not a physical war. They need to provoke<br>*just enough Israeli* *retaliation* that their propaganda machine<br>can re-package and disseminate to gullible patsies like yourself as<br>"Israeli war crimes."<br><br>So ultimately, the only war criminals who will be rounded up will be<br>Arab, not Israeli.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
