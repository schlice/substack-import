<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>St. Augustine said, "Pray not for a lighter load, but for stronger<br>shoulders.\" This quote was echoed by Reverend Phillips Brooks (and<br>later by President John F. Kennedy, immortalized in the video game *Call<br>of Duty: Zombies*) (IYKYK\*) when he said, \"Do not pray for easy lives.<br>Pray to be stronger men! Do not pray for tasks equal to your powers.<br>Pray for powers equal to your tasks.\"<br><br>Life doesn't become easy whether you trust God or not. Life will be hard<br>even if you don't trust God.<br><br>At least God is honest with you about the fact that life is hard, and<br>believing in Him won't make it easy.<br><br>> *I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In<br>> the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome<br>> the world." \-- John 16:33 ESV*<br><br>Here, Jesus very clearly says that life will be hard. But the point of<br>religion isn't to give you an easy life. It's to give you a ***glorious<br>eternity.***<br><br>Secondly, trust doesn't require work. Learning requires work. Trust<br>requires a choice. Putting your faith (or you can call it "trust") in<br>God is nothing more than a choice. You choose to put your faith in God.<br><br>But God is easy to trust, because **He has a history of keeping His<br>promises.** He has never lied. He has never failed to be trustworthy. He<br>has been faithful since the beginning.<br><br>The hard part about trusting God is *letting go of your own control*.<br>None of us likes to give up control. It's human nature. It's hard to let<br>go and let God do the driving in your life. But He promises that if you<br>let Him, it may not be the path you expected, but it will get you to<br>somewhere wonderful, and you will be fulfilling your life's purpose.<br><br>Letting God take control of your life is the hard part. That's the scary<br>part. But you can do it. Billions around the world have done it already.<br>And the rewards *far exceed* the effort.<br><br>We'll be praying for you.<br><br>\* If you know, you know...<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
