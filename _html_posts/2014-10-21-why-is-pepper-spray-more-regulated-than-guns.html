<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Are you kidding???\<br>\<br>There are hardly any regulations on pepper spray. As a matter of fact,<br>pepper spray is legal to carry in all 50 states.\<br>\<br>There are some restrictions on where pepper spray can be shipped by<br>sellers to independent buyers, but for the most part if you buy pepper<br>spray in a store you can carry it out. No background check, no license,<br>no training, nothing. It\'s no more complicated than buying a bottle of<br>water.\<br>\<br>I think there is at least one more regulation than that when buying a<br>gun.\<br>\<br>One or two.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
