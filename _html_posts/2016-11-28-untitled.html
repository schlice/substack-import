<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>It\'s a judgment call. Cops make those judgment calls all the time. Most<br>times they make them correctly, but sometimes they don\'t get them<br>right. Most times they do get them right.<br><br>If there were no witnesses and no video, it\'s his word against yours<br>anyway, so it comes down to whose story is more plausible, who has a<br>cleaner record, who has a better lawyer, etc. You may both get arrested<br>at that point, and the cops just say let the lawyers sort it out.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/If-I-pepper-spray-someone-who-I-thought-was-going-to-attack-me-will-I-get-arrested/answer/Bill-Stein<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
