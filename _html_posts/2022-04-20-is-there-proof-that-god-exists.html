<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Of course there is. Ample evidence of God's existence is available to<br>anyone *willing to believe.*  But God has left just enough ambiguity<br>so as to not compel the *unwilling*.<br><br>This is for a very important reason: God has given you *free will*.<br>You're not really acting under your free will if God compels you to<br>believe. This, by the way, is why God might not reveal himself as<br>overtly as some might like. I read a Quoran say that he wants God to<br>just please write on the clouds, "I exist, ffs". But God's not going to<br>do that.<br><br>> The beauty of God's plan for creation is that if you're not willing to<br>> accept it, you are free to reject it. The freedom to make<br>> choices---even the freedom to reject truth---is what makes us moral<br>> creatures and enables us to choose our own destiny.<br>><br>> God has provided each of us with the opportunity to make an eternal<br>> choice to accept or reject him. But in order to ensure that our choice<br>> is *truly free*, he puts us in an environment which is *filled*<br>> with evidence of his existence, *but without his direct presence*,<br>> which would be so awesome and overwhelming as to overpower our ability<br>> to make a free decision, and compel us to accept him.<br>><br>> In this way, God gives us the opportunity to accept or reject his love<br>> without violating our freedom. That's the purpose of this life: to<br>> make that choice freely, without coercion. For love must be freely<br>> given, it can never be coerced.\[1\](#JYINw){#cite-JYINw<br>> .citation_link}<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-JYINw){.citation_index} [[I Don\'t Have Enough Faith to Be<br>an Atheist: Geisler, Norman L., Turek, Frank, Limbaugh, David:<br>9781433580758: Amazon.com:<br>Books](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=770f5b&url=https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Have-Enough-Faith-Atheist/dp/1433580756){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
