<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [As far as the police are concerned, the paper registration<br>copy is indeed a holdover from times when officers did not have<br>immediate in-car access to the DMV\'s entire database. However, as with<br>most things, the law hasn\'t caught up with the technology, and the law<br>in almost all states still requires that drivers carry their<br>state-issued registration paperwork in the car.\<br>\<br>However, to expound a little bit, there are still organizations that may<br>need to see your registration that don\'t have access to DMV systems.<br>For example, if you want to get a visitor\'s pass to a military base,<br>they don\'t have access to DMV records like police do. So there are<br>still other organizations who may need to see your registration and<br>don\'t have access to it. State law can still mandate your possession of<br>it in the car.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
