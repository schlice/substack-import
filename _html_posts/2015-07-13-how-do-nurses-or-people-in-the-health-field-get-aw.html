<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Basically, you don\'t \"get away with it.\" Because<br>cannabis is still illegal under Federal law, you are SOL. If your<br>employer says you can\'t use it because they follow Federal law, you<br>can\'t use it, especially recreationally. If you are a medical user, you<br>have two options.\<br>\<br>1. Try to get a medical waiver from your employer. You will have to make<br>the case that medical cannabis is legal where you live and you have met<br>all of the state requirements for it. Your employer can still refuse to<br>exempt you if they choose it\'s too big of a legal risk for them to<br>take, but you won\'t know until you try. I have heard of medical<br>cannabis users getting waivers from their companies. It\'s a mixed bag:<br>employers are under no obligation to grant you a waiver.\<br>\<br>And if that fails, or your second option:\<br>\<br>2. Don\'t work for that provider. An employer can always claim that<br>cannabis is still illegal under Federal law and they can still refuse to<br>hire you, or they can fire you after you\'ve been hired, if you test<br>positive during random drug testing. Making the claim that it is legal<br>at a state level doesn\'t hold water because the drug is still illegal<br>at the Federal level.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
