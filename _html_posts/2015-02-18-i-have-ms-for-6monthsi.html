<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br>(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d977d5&url=http://inf.As){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="inf.as"}]{.qlink_container} such apart from tingling I<br>experience no other symptom. As a guy I wanted to ask clearly, will I<br>suffer from impotency? I mean I love her extremely but avoid due to fear<br>and at times, feel to do as later I may or maybe not able to<br>[do.help(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0d7f11&url=http://do.help){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="do.help"}]{.qlink_container} me with this.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [First, for the specifics, read my previous answer on<br>this:\<br>\<br>[[Bill Stein\'s answer to Can a man with multiple sclerosis have a<br>normal sex<br>life?](https://www.quora.com/Can-a-man-with-multiple-sclerosis-have-a-normal-sex-life/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}\<br>\<br>Next, don\'t avoid sex just because you have MS. First of all, you\'ll<br>never know whether or not you actually are having an issue with sexual<br>dysfunction if you avoid sex.\<br>\<br>Second, it\'s not something to fear; it\'s something to work around.<br>There are drugs readily available to help with sexual dysfunction<br>(Viagra, Cialis, etc), so don\'t worry, even if you do start to have<br>sexual dysfunction caused by MS, you can work around it.\<br>\<br>Also, you don\'t want this to become psychosomatic; i.e. you get so<br>worried about not being able to perform that you actually start to<br>perform poorly because of your fear. In other words, your fear of<br>performing poorly actually causes you to perform poorly, not any disease<br>activity.\<br>\<br>Finally, don\'t forget to talk to your doctor about any symptoms you are<br>experiencing, regardless of whether or not you may be embarrassed<br>because of them. If you are not open and honest with your doctor, you<br>won\'t be getting the best care you possibly can.\<br>\<br>Good luck, hang in there!
