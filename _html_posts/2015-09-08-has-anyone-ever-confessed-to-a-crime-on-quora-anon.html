<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [In order to have your anonymity removed, the court has to<br>know who it is issuing its subpoena for. Therefore, the subpoena can\'t<br>be for \"that anonymous user\" because it has to be written against an<br>individual.\<br>\<br>That said, the court has issued \"[[Doe<br>subpoena](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=b1870b&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doe_subpoena){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org"}]{.qlink_container}s\" in order to determine<br>the identity of anonymous posters. Quora will reveal your identity to<br>law enforcement should it be requested through a Doe subpoena.\<br>\<br>Try it. Make an anonymous post and click Submit. The pop-up that comes<br>up explains that while your anonymity is protected, Quora can figure out<br>who you are. Therefore, if they are technically able, and they comply<br>with court-ordered disclosure, they will do so if they are ordered to.\<br>\<br>If the service does not know who you are (i.e. an anonymous blog<br>comment), the Doe subpoena can get your IP address which can then be<br>resolved to a user through the ISP. The Doe subpoena can allow the<br>disclosure of this information.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
