<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Does multiple sclerosis cause bloodshot eyes?<br><br>Multiple Sclerosis is an autoimmune neurodegenerative disease in which<br>nerve cells are attacked by the immune system. It is generally not<br>characterized by bloodshot eyes.<br><br>However, occasionally MS users will use cannabis (marijuana) to relieve<br>neurological pain (as opposed to physical pain which is effectively<br>treated with current pain meds). Marijuana does cause bloodshot eyes.<br><br>So if the MS patient is treating their MS symptoms with cannabis, then<br>bloodshot eyes may be a result.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
