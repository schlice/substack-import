<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>There is a *thousandfold* difference in risk between a child getting<br>COVID and an older person getting COVID.<br><br>There are also some not-trivial risks to children taking the<br>vaccine.<br><br>Calling these parents "murderous" is simply false. Calling them<br>"irresponsible" is an opinion. But considering the risk/benefit<br>calculation is exactly what a parent is supposed to do for their<br>children, I can't see how that action is "irresponsible." This may seem<br>to be an innumerate calculation to you, but you're not the parent.<br><br>*Neither moniker is worthy of removing the children from the parent's<br>custody.* This is a very disruptive action which can cause<br>tremendous psychological harm to a child. You must be very sure<br>that the child is actually in grave physical danger to do this, and a<br>parent choosing which vaccines they wish to give their children does not<br>rise to that level of danger.<br><br>TL;DR: No, I do not agree.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>I believe that parents who refuse to vaccinate their children should be<br>removed from their children\'s custody as murderous and irresponsible.<br>Do you agree?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
