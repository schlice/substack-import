<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**My neighbor has hidden cameras pointed at my bedroom windows and<br>backyard and front yard. I can't see them but I feel I am being watched.<br>What can I do? I feel violated. What legal actions can I take?**<br><br>I'm going to sidestep the paranoia angle. I agree, I just feel like<br>everyone else has covered it.<br><br>But hey, it's not my place to fail to answer your question simply<br>because you asked it out of paranoia.<br><br>Here's the best thing you can do to stop them: install one of these bad<br>boys in your bedroom window.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-094f72996c6bc1ba9571e020788a43b0){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-094f72996c6bc1ba9571e020788a43b0" master_w="845"<br>master_h="666"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>[https://www.amazon.com/Tendelux-\...(https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1b9f57&url=https://www.amazon.com/Tendelux-Illuminator-BI18-Outdoor-Security/dp/B0771HSGH4){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>*(Note that this is just an option of an IR floodlight that I found on<br>Amazon for a reasonable price; you can use any IR floodlight to solve<br>the problem)*<br><br>This floodlight does not produce visible light. It produces *infrared*<br>illumination. So for a solid 200 feet around this unit, the dark of<br>night will look like daylight to a camera.<br><br>And for any cameras pointed *at this unit*, it will look like they are<br>staring into the sun.<br><br>Complete privacy, no visible light. Congratulations, you've just<br>defeated the most common types of cameras which might be used to look in<br>to that window.<br><br>\<br><br>*Disclaimer:*<br><br>*This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice or a<br>solicitation to offer legal advice regarding specific facts.
