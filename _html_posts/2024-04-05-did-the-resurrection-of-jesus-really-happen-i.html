<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This is such a good question. I mean, if the resurrection didn't happen,<br>then the rest of Christianity falls like a house of cards.<br><br>The Bible tells us that Jesus was crucified, His body was taken down,<br>and it was placed in a tomb. Let's take a quick look at the type of tomb<br>we're talking about here. This was a tomb that only rich men could<br>afford (the tomb belonged to Joseph of Arimathea, who was admittedly a<br>rich man). This tomb, hewn into the side of a mountain, was closed with<br>a round stone which was rolled down a channel and settled into a<br>V-shaped groove (also cut into the stone) in front of the entrance. The<br>stone weighed about two tons (4000 pounds). It took about 16--20 men<br>along with ropes and poles (used as levers) to move the stone, either<br>into or out of position.<br><br>The Sanhedrin was still not satisfied that the disciples wouldn't try to<br>steal Jesus' body and make it look like a resurrection, so they<br>(primarily Annas and Caiaphas) went to Pontius Pilate and requested that<br>the tomb be sealed and that guards be placed outside of the tomb to<br>prevent anyone messing with it over the prophesied "three days" window.<br>Pilate agreed to this request. He sent at least one squad of soldiers,<br>but it was likely at least four squads (16 soldiers). Some accounts say<br>that there were as many as 30 or 40. Why so many? It was the Passover.<br>There were hundreds of thousands of pilgrims in town. Many of these were<br>fans of Jesus. The Romans and the chief priests would have been aware of<br>this, and they would have posted a quantity of guards proportional to<br>the perceived threat.<br><br>The guards were led by a man named Petronius, who was a Temple Guard,<br>and upheld the highest standards of Roman soldiers. He knew what<br>happened to Roman soldiers who fell asleep at their posts. For example,<br>Temple Guards who were caught sleeping were flogged and their clothes<br>were set on fire...while they were in them. These troops were<br>specialized, especially in night watch. They had it down to a science,<br>with rotating shifts and random patrols to ensure no one was asleep on<br>the job (upon pain of death).<br><br>Additionally, the tomb was *sealed*. This means that, much in the same<br>way that a scroll was sealed with a wax seal, a very large wax seal was<br>placed on the tomb, and was imprinted with the seal of the Procurator<br>himself. Defacing one of these seals was a high crime, and the<br>punishment was (yes, you guessed it) death. And this was a *Roman*<br>crime, not a Jewish crime.<br><br>\<br><br>So that's the background around how Jesus' tomb was closed, sealed, and<br>guarded. With that understanding, do you think it is possible that 11<br>men could have snuck in past *all those Roman guards* (who would have<br>needed to all be asleep at the same time) and, without making enough<br>noise to wake up the sleeping guards, roll a 4000 pound capstone uphill,<br>let alone halfway up the mountainside where they found it?<br><br>The Bible records that the Roman guards all watched in awe as an angel<br>unsealed the tomb and casually threw the two-ton stone halfway up the<br>mountainside. They literally froze in fear (the Bible says they became<br>"like dead men").<br><br>So what were they to do? Do they say someone broke the seal? If they<br>don't identify who broke the seal, *they* take the punishment (which is<br>death). Do they say *they* broke the seal (a crime punishable by death)?<br>Do they say they all simultaneously fell asleep (also, a crime<br>punishable by death)? In a panic, and faced with a litany of bad<br>options, they do the smartest thing they can possibly do and rush to the<br>chief priests in the Sanhedrin and tell them everything.<br><br>The chief priests gave them large sums of money and told them to make up<br>a story, to say that the disciples broke into the tomb and stole the<br>body. Incidentally, "bearing false witness" was also a crime punishable<br>by death. Nevertheless, faced with a list of bad scenarios which would<br>only lead to a bad outcome, the Roman guards took the money and spread<br>the story that the disciples broke into the tomb and stole the body.<br><br>\<br><br>To make matters worse, Jesus appeared to over 500 people in the thirty<br>days He walked the earth following His resurrection. These people<br>testified to seeing Jesus alive. They were executed for their testimony,<br>and they continued to claim, up until the moment they were executed,<br>that they actually saw Jesus alive. Now, while people may die for a lie<br>they *think* is the truth, no one in their right mind would die for what<br>they *know* is a lie, let alone over 500 people. So it's unlikely that<br>these people would have made up the story of Jesus' resurrection, only<br>to be killed for it, when all they would have to do would be to renounce<br>the story, and they would live. Instead, they proclaimed that Jesus was<br>alive until they were executed.<br><br>If the apostles were lying, why didn't the chief priests just produce<br>the body and shut the whole thing down right then and there? But no one<br>could ever find the body. All the Romans would have to do to completely<br>eradicate Christianity in its nascent tracks would be to find the body<br>and parade it around the streets of Jerusalem to prove that Jesus was<br>still dead. But they never did.<br><br>And if the apostles were making up the story, why would they start<br>proclaiming Jesus' resurrection *in Jerusalem*, where it would be the<br>easiest to disprove the story, where everyone knew what happened? Why<br>wouldn't they go far away to tell their tale, where it couldn't be so<br>easily disproven?<br><br>While they were loudly proclaiming what they saw, all of Jesus'<br>opposition, all the Sanhedrin, just stood there and didn't dispute any<br>of it. Why? Why were they so silent in the face of this testimony of the<br>risen Christ? The fact that they never tried to disprove what the<br>apostles were saying speaks to the truth that they probably could not.<br><br>\<br><br>Given everything we have reviewed, the most likely scenario is that<br>Jesus actually rose from the dead. Of course, this is only looking at<br>the time of Jesus' death and resurrection. The entire Bible points to<br>this one moment with foreshadowings and prophesies which prove what<br>Jesus was claiming. But we're just looking at this one incident and how<br>likely it is that it happened in the way that the disciples and<br>eyewitnesses claimed it happened.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
