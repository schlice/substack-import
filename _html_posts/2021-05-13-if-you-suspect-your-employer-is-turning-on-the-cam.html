<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Lots of great answers here but many are missing the mark.<br><br>While many people have discussed the fact that, in most cases, your<br>employer has the right to view your camera at any time, **doing so is<br>legally perilous for them.**<br><br>Why?<br><br>Because *it's a laptop and it doesn't stay in the office*.<br><br>It's like the old adage: just because you *can* **doesn't mean<br>you *should*.**<br><br>What, precisely, would they hope to see by turning on your camera?<br><br>The whole purpose of being able to monitor the use of their equipment is<br>to ensure that it is being used in accordance with the reasons you have<br>it. In other words, monitoring work equipment is to ensure that it is<br>being used for work. It's far more beneficial to monitor your network<br>traffic than to view your webcam if that is their true goal.<br><br>Anyway, viewing a webcam is perilous for several reasons:<br><br>1.  Viewing a webcam is a really poor way to accomplish their goal<br>    (monitoring the equipment to ensure it is being used for company use<br>    only). You can't see how the PC is being used; you can only see the<br>    person using it.<br>2.  Being a laptop, it is far more likely that the camera will view<br>    things and locations which are *legally protected* (i.e. the camera<br>    may see people, places, or activities which are wholly unrelated to<br>    the purpose of the monitoring), unless there is a business policy<br>    which dictates when and where the laptop can be used. But even so,<br>    the camera is far more likely to capture something that it is not<br>    supposed to capture than to capture something useful to IT.<br><br>So to answer the question, if you feel that your employer may be turning<br>on the webcam on your laptop without your knowledge, put a piece of tape<br>over the camera. Simple, cheap fix. You can also stick on one of these<br>privacy shutters to make the solution less kludge-y and more permanent:<br><br>[Amazon.com: CloudValley Webcam Cover Slide\[2-Pack\, 0.023 Inch<br>Ultra-Thin Metal Web Camera Cover for MacBook Pro, iMac, Laptop, PC,<br>iPad Pro, iPhone 8/7/6 Plus, Protect Your Visual Prvacy \Black\:<br>Computers &<br>Accessories](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=d24895&url=https://www.amazon.com/Laptop-CloudValley-Ultra-Thin-MacBook-Protect/dp/B079MCPJGH){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="amazon.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br>*(not a sponsored product, just happened to be the first link that came<br>up in a search of web camera cover for laptop cameras)*<br><br>Using one of these covers allows you to use the camera when you need it,<br>and then block it when you don't.<br><br>In fact, most modern laptops have these manual privacy shutters built-in<br>to the housing of the camera.<br><br>If your employer balks at the cover, you'll know that they want to view<br>the camera any time you are using the system. Legally, it's their gear,<br>and they can probably make the case for turning on the camera to monitor<br>the gear, so you'll have to be hyper-vigilant when you use the laptop,<br>and just know they are watching you any time the lid is open, and be<br>prepared for that.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>**If you suspect your employer is turning on the camera to your work<br>laptop without you knowing, what legal recourse do you have?**<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
