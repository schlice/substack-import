<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>What's wrong with getting baptized without believing in God?<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>There is absolutely nothing wrong with being baptized without believing<br>in God.<br><br>And if you think there is something wrong with it, you don't understand<br>what baptism is.<br><br>More importantly though, if you don't believe in God but you still want<br>to be baptized, **then it is you who does not understand what baptism<br>is.**<br><br>\<br><br>First of all, let's talk about what baptism is. Baptism, or water<br>immersion, is an outward sign of an inward faith. Baptism doesn't do<br>anything magical for you. In other words, **baptism doesn't save you;<br>baptism is what saved people do.**<br><br>Once you are saved, *then* you make the choice to be baptized, *to show<br>everyone else that you are obedient to God.*<br><br>Does it hurt you to dunk under the water and come back up? No, not at<br>all. Most of us have taken a bath or went swimming at least once in our<br>lives, and we probably have performed that one maneuver countless times.<br><br>But baptism, which is essentially taking a dunk under the water, is<br>different. But it's different not because of the action of dunking under<br>the water; that's commonplace. It's why we do it and what we believe<br>about it that makes baptism special.<br><br>Baptism is an outward display to everyone else that you believe Christ<br>died for your sins, and that He is your Lord and Savior. Partaking in<br>baptism means that you believe these things, too. So you are declaring,<br>to this group of people that you believe are healthy and you want to be<br>friends with, that you too believe as they do. Could you *lie* and say<br>you believe those things in order to be baptized? Sure. In fact, I'd<br>posit that it happens more often than we think. But again, baptism<br>doesn't do anything for you. It doesn't gain you anything. It is<br>commanded of believers, so we do it.<br><br>If the only reason you want to be baptized is to be "part of the crowd,"<br>you've got it backwards. Be part of the crowd by standing out from the<br>crowd. Believe and be saved first, and then we'll talk about doing the<br>things that saved people do. Maybe you want to be part of the crowd so<br>badly that you're willing to lie to do it. But why? If you don't believe<br>what they believe, why do you want to be part of their group so badly? I<br>wouldn't want to spend my time with people who do not believe as I do.<br><br>Maybe instead of wanting to do the things they do, you should instead be<br>asking them to explain why they believe what they believe, and then if<br>you believe those things, you can do the things they do.<br><br>\<br><br>Next, I want to address your studying of the Bible as a JW. You were, no<br>doubt, studying the New World Translation, the only version of the Bible<br>specifically edited and modified in order to fit the beliefs of a<br>specific faith. So you may have been studying a version of the Bible,<br>but you must understand that it is not the whole truth. It was edited to<br>fit the beliefs of JWs. Rather than conforming their faith to the Bible,<br>JWs decided to write a Bible which fit their faith. That's kinda not how<br>faith works.<br><br>Maybe if you want to fit in with the group of friends who appear to be<br>healthy, you should find out what exactly they believe, and you can<br>start by reading a translation of the Bible which was not specifically<br>edited to deliver a unique, man-made message. Perhaps you should read<br>*literally any other translation* of the Bible, but I'd suggest reading<br>the English Standard Version (as it's easier to read), or the New<br>International Version (because it's a much closer word-for-word<br>translation).<br><br>Good luck to you, and I pray for all the best for you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
