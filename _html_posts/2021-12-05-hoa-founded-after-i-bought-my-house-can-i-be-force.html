<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Generally, in order for an HOA to be mandatory, it must exist prior to<br>homes being built on that property. It must be put in place by the<br>builder and included as part of the master agreement for using that<br>land.<br><br>Once the first house is sold without that agreement, in order to make a<br>mandatory HOA, you must have the agreement of a supermajority of the<br>homeowners. The builder can represent the interests of the unsold<br>properties, but in order to create a mandatory HOA when the builder does<br>not own all the property, you must have the approval of a supermajority<br>of the homeowners. If you only have a small number of homes sold, this<br>may not be difficult. But if you have many homes sold already, you may<br>not be able to create a mandatory HOA.<br><br>There have been instances in the past where one homeowner out of<br>hundreds who didn't want to be part of the HOA was excluded from its<br>provisions and remained outside of the HOA's control. But this is the<br>exception rather than the rule.<br><br>TL;DR: In other words, if the builder didn't set it up before he<br>started selling homes, in most cases he cannot force you to join. He can<br>create an *optional* HOA, but he cannot create a *mandatory* HOA.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>HOA founded after I bought my house.
