<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Follow all of the basic rules for dealing with police<br>officers in general. These rules will also protect you against the<br>corrupt cops.\<br>]<br><br>- Start by following the law. If an officer, corrupt or not, has no<br>  reason to make contact with you, he won\'t waste his time.<br>- If you do get stopped, comply with all directives of the police at the<br>  scene. Note that I said \"directives,\" not \"requests.\" Unless an<br>  officer has probable cause or a search warrant, he can\'t search your<br>  car. That would be a request. \"*Will you consent to a search of your<br>  car?*\" That\'s a request. The correct answer is \"*Not without<br>  probable cause or a warrant.*\" \"Will you consent\" means \"will you<br>  give up your right to privacy voluntarily\". \"*Move over to the curb<br>  and give me your driver\'s license*\" is a directive. If you were the<br>  driver, you\'re required to have a license. Give it to him.<br>- Do not argue at the scene. Save your arguments for later. As many of<br>  us have said on Quora for a very long time, you have many avenues for<br>  redress of your complaints. NONE of those avenues take place at the<br>  scene. Arguing with the officer at the scene, even if you are right,<br>  will probably just cause more headache for you in the long run.\<br>- Do not answer questions without a lawyer.<br>- If you are not arrested and you are free to leave, write down<br>  everything that happened, to the best of your ability.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
