<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The world has *always* turned away from God, ever since Eve was tricked<br>in the Garden.<br><br>It does *seem like* the world is turning further away from God than it<br>ever has, but that's not unexpected. The world is going to get ***much,<br>much worse*** before it gets better.<br><br>You can't do anything to change that. Only God can change the course<br>of the world.<br><br>The best you can do is to work on *people*, not the *world*.<br><br>Make sure that everyone you meet knows the love of Christ in their<br>lives. Make sure everyone you meet has the opportunity to hear the Good<br>News. Make sure everyone gets to use their free will to its fullest<br>extent.<br><br>You only get one shot at this life. Make it a good one.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
