<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I can\'t answer your question because I don\'t know the<br>policy at your school. If your school violated the policy, you could sue<br>them in small claims court for the cost of the phone.\<br>\<br>Also, you\'re asking a specific legal question, which we cannot answer<br>on Quora. You would need to consult with an attorney in your<br>area.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
