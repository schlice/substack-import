<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>If it is, it is the largest mass delusion ever recorded, with over 3<br>billion people globally currently experiencing exactly the same<br>delusion, and hundreds of billions more historically.<br><br>Additionally, if it is a delusion, then everyone in history who ever had<br>a spiritual experience was delusional. While this is possible, given the<br>vast number of spiritual experiences, it does not seem likely. It is<br>difficult to believe that every great spiritual leader and thinker in<br>the history of humanity, including some of the most rational,<br>scientific, and critical minds ever, have all been completely wrong<br>about their spiritual experiences. This includes people like Abraham,<br>Moses, Isaiah, Kepler, Newton, Pascal, and Jesus Christ himself. *If<br>just one spiritual experience in the entire history of the world is<br>true, then believe in God cannot be a delusion.*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
