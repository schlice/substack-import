<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**If a policeman mistreats me physically and he/she is not authorized by<br>law, do I have the right to defend myself and neutralize him (or her)<br>temporarily?**<br><br>The big problem in your scenario is this:<br><br>and he/she is not authorized by law<br><br>If an officer is on duty, in uniform, and is arresting you, *you have no<br>way of knowing whether or not the arrest is authorized by law.*<br><br>Why? In the United States, ***the only agency authorized to determine<br>whether or not an arrest was lawful is a court***. Not you, not the<br>officer, not his supervisors, not your lawyer, but a judge in a court.<br>You should also note that this legal review of an arrest happens *long<br>after* the actual arrest takes place.<br><br>What makes an arrest lawful? A police officer has probable cause to<br>believe that you either committed a crime, or that you were about to<br>commit a crime. That's it. It's a much lower standard than a judge<br>determining whether or not you are guilty. You may be completely<br>innocent, but if the officer has probable cause to believe you may have<br>committed a crime, or you were about to commit a crime, then the arrest<br>is lawful. An officer can make a lawful arrest of an innocent person if<br>the probable cause is there.<br><br>But let's be honest. Is an officer going to have probable cause to<br>believe that an innocent person committed a crime? In most cases,<br>probably not. But it is conceivable that it would happen. You would<br>assume that the court system would validate that said innocent person<br>did not commit a crime, and that person would be released. But the court<br>system must be allowed to do its job; you cannot prevent the arrest from<br>taking place.<br><br>*"You may be able to beat the rap, but you can't beat the ride."*<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
