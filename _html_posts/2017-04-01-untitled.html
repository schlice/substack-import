<br><br><h2>Answer Comment</h2><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Despite your misgivings about what is "wrong" or not, the bottom line is<br>that we are a nation of laws. We are literally the only country in the<br>world whose government is entirely founded on a piece of paper. No<br>juntas, no oligarchs (despite the Leftists' claims), no religious<br>leaders, no kings. Just a piece of paper and elections. As a nation, we<br>live and die by those laws.<br><br>If you don't like the laws, as Paul mentioned, you elect leaders who<br>will change them. You lobby your elected leaders to get them to change<br>them. But our nation of laws also has a law that says that the laws are<br>applied to all people equally (see the 14th Amendment). So whether you<br>think it's "fair" or not, if we have a law, it applies equally to<br>everyone. It's not about being "fair," it's about being "just." Those<br>are two totally separate concepts.<br><br>Part of the problem you are citing is not necessarily a problem with the<br>legal system, it's a problem with Congress. Congress has abrogated much<br>of its responsibility under the Constitution by creating *bureaucracy*.<br>So while we may not be a monarchy or an oligarchy, we are creating<br>*bureaucratic despotism* in the United States. The EPA, for example, is<br>an organization filled with civil servants. Unelected, unaccountable (to<br>us) civil servants who create regulation which carries the force of law.<br>We can be punished for violating EPA regulations. That means those<br>regulations are just like laws passed by our Congresspeople. This is in<br>violation of the Constitution, which clearly states in Article I that<br>all laws are to be created by Congress, not by bureaucracy. But Congress<br>has allowed this to happen. Not only did they allow it to happen, but<br>they created the bureaucracy in the first place.<br><br>If you really want to learn more about this, you should take Hillsdale<br>College's free online course, [[**The Progressive Rejection of the<br>Founding and the Rise of Bureaucratic<br>Despotism**](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=02cabd&url=https://online.hillsdale.edu/page.aspx?pid%3D1185){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="hillsdale.edu"}]{.qlink_container}.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Answer:<br>https://www.quora.com/Is-the-American-prison-system-more-about-punishment-or-more-about-rehabilitation/answer/Paul-Harding-14<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
