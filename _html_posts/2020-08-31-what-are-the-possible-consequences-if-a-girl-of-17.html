<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**What are the possible consequences if a girl of 17 leaves her home in<br>PA without her mother's consent, sneaks on to a military base in New<br>York in order to have sex with a man who is 24 years old and enlisted in<br>the military?**<br><br>There is a whole litany of things that are wrong with this scenario, and<br>sneaking on to a military base is literally the least of anyone's<br>worries. In fact, it's the only crime the girl can be accused of in this<br>scenario. 18 U.S.C. ยง 1382 prohibits any person from entering any<br>military installation for any purpose prohibited by law, and last I<br>checked, statutory rape is in fact prohibited by law. The girl faces a<br>fine and imprisonment of not more than six months<br><br>Now, to the guy. Let's start with the elephant in the room, and that's<br>the aforementioned statutory rape. The age of consent in New York is 18<br>years old. Having sex with a minor is called statutory rape. That he did<br>it on a military base simply means that he'll be sent to Leavenworth to<br>spend a few years turning big rocks into little rocks before he gets a<br>dishonorable discharge.<br><br>If he talked to you before you got there, he is guilty of a Federal<br>crime for soliciting sex with a minor across state lines. Under 18<br>U.S.C. ยง 2422 and Section 2423, if he is convicted of using mail,<br>Internet, or other forms of interstate or international communication to<br>solicit or attempt to solicit a minor with the intent to engage in<br>unlawful sexual activity or are convicted of successfully transporting a<br>minor for this illegal purpose, he faces a minimum of 10 years (as a<br>misdemeanor) and a maximum of life (as a felony) in federal prison and a<br>fine of up to \$250,000, and that's AFTER he gets out of Leavenworth.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
