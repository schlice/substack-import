<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Do you think the new allegations against Brett Kavanaugh in the book,<br>\"The Education of Brett Kavanaugh\" are true?**<br><br>Do you remember Christine Blasey Ford's testimony? Did you think that<br>was true?<br><br>This claim has *even less* evidence to support it. In fact, there are a<br>few glaring problems with this "new" claim.<br><br>1.  The woman who Max Stier claims was assaulted by Kavanaugh and crew<br>    denies any memory of the attack. You would think that would be<br>    important, but the New York Times felt it was such a minor detail<br>    that they left it out of their paper's coverage of the book. They<br>    had to correct it later on. Meh, so what that she says it never<br>    happened. Evidence, shmevidence.<br>2.  Speaking of evidence shmevidence, the FBI did look at the claim<br>    during the time of the hearings and declined to investigate further<br>    because the evidence was simply too flimsy to support further<br>    investigation.<br>3.  Max Stier himself won't come out and publicly stand behind his<br>    claim. Not to worry though, the intrepid reporters at the New York<br>    Times have "confirmed the account with two officials who have<br>    communicated with him." Ooo, officials. Good thing they are<br>    officials, right? That makes it all better. So we have hearsay of<br>    hearsay. Super-reliable evidence-gathering there. But again, who<br>    needs evidence when you have a claim?<br>4.  Isn't that the same Max Stier who was a defense attorney for the<br>    Clintons? Yeah you're right, that doesn't sound fishy at all.<br><br>If you seriously believe any of this stinking pile of feces, I have a<br>bridge in Brooklyn to sell you.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
