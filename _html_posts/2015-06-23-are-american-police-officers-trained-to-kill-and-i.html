<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [To answer your specific question, police officers are not<br>trained on how to kill.\<br>\<br>Police officers are trained in the use of firearms. They can do so<br>quickly and efficiently. Police officers will \"shoot to stop the act.\"<br>That means they will keep firing at center mass until the act is<br>stopped. This often results in death. Firearms are deadly force, and<br>their employment will often result in the target being killed.\<br>\<br>However, it\'s a false equivalency to say that police officers are<br>trained to kill because they use firearms.\<br>\<br>To illustrate, if a police officer shoots someone and they live (which<br>happens more often than not), have they failed at their task? Clearly,<br>the answer is no, which means that the end result of the shooting is not<br>intended to be death.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
