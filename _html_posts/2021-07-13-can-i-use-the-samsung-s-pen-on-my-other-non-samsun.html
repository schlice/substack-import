<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Just as we already answered regarding using the S pen on any tablet...<br><br>[[Bill Stein\'s answer to Is the Samsung S Pen compatible with any<br>tablet?](/Is-the-Samsung-S-Pen-compatible-with-any-tablet/answer/Bill-Stein)]{.qlink_container}<br><br>The Samsung S Pen is an *inductive* stylus. It communicates with the<br>Samsung Note phone when the device is brought close to the screen. The<br>Note series (and the S21 series of phones) contain an extra Wacom layer<br>which supports the inductive stylus. The electromagnetic Wacom layer in<br>the screen *induces* a current in the S Pen, and they begin to<br>communicate. This is why the stylus works without it touching the<br>screen. It knows where the tip of the stylus is, even when you hover it<br>over the screen and don't touch it.<br><br>Other non-Samsung Android phones use *capacitive touch* screens only<br>(Note phones also use capacitive touch, but the stylus uses inductive<br>communications). In a capacitive touch setup, the screen is given an<br>electrostatic charge. Your finger (or the stylus) changes the<br>electrostatic field in the screen when you touch it, and the device<br>registers that change as a touch, or a swipe.<br><br>TL:DR: No. The S Pen only works on S Pen-enabled devices. You need a<br>capacitive stylus to work on capacitive touch screens.<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>Can I use the Samsung S Pen on my other non-Samsung Android phone?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
