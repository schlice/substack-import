<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>"My body, my choice" is still the law of the land. Remember *Roe v.<br>Wade?* Remember *Griswold v. Connecticut?*<br><br>Like it or not, the Supreme Court has found that the Constitution<br>contains a right to privacy, and that extends to what I do with my body.<br><br>So no, hospitals cannot turn away people who are unvaccinated. They<br>would be violating those peoples' Constitutional rights.<br><br>Hospitals will have to implement their emergency plans and expand their<br>Emergency Rooms. States and cities have had emergency plans in place for<br>overcrowding in hospitals since the beginning of the pandemic, and the<br>hospital will have to go to the local or state government to implement<br>those emergency plans.<br><br>What changed? Last year, we were doing everything in our power to help<br>hospitals have all the resources they needed to handle the pandemic.<br>Except for all of a sudden, it appears to be "distasteful" today to tell<br>a hospital to implement its emergency plans.<br><br>So what changed? The new variable is the existence of a vaccine.<br><br>Some people don't like the fact that some other people have chosen to<br>not get vaccinated. However, if I have the right to privacy, and if that<br>right to privacy extends to my body, then I have the right to remain<br>unvaccinated. You do not have the right to deny me care at a hospital.<br><br>Maybe you want to make sure that no public money is spent on someone who<br>chooses to remain unvaccinated, and that's fine, the legislature can<br>vote to make sure that no assistance funds go to their care. If they<br>want to remain unvaccinated, make them *pay for* their own care.<br><br>But you can't *deny them space in the hospital* because they made a<br>perfectly legal choice with which you don't agree. It is ethically<br>untenable to turn anyone away from care. Not even doctors are demanding<br>what you are asking. Is it also okay to turn away a needle-based drug<br>user who now has AIDS? Is it okay to turn away a morbidly obese person<br>who doesn't have a thyroid issue?<br><br>Determining who gets treatment based on a values judgement has never<br>been acceptable, and it won't become acceptable now.<br><br>\<br><br>*For the time being, I have re-enabled comments on selected answers.<br>Some people like to comment. Some people like to engage with me in a<br>civil manner, and I did kinda miss that\...a little. But do not<br>misunderstand, I take this step very cautiously, and I have no tolerance<br>for harassing or inane behavior. If you don\'t like what I wrote, tough<br>shit. If my answer is grammatically low-quality or is un-cited opinion<br>masquerading as fact, downvote it. If you think I\'m wrong, write your<br>own answer. But Quora is a question-and-answer site, not a debate site.<br>If you are simply commenting to tell me \"ackshually, you\'re wrong,\"<br>don\'t be surprised if I quietly delete your comment. Put anything<br>vaguely harassing in there, and your deletion will be followed by a<br>block/mute, and a BNBR report. I will do this immediately and with no<br>compunction. You have been warned. Be nice.*<br><br>\<br><br>Original question:<br><br>A Purple Heart decorated veteran in Texas just died from gallstones<br>because unvaccinated COVID-19 cases are filling all of the hospitals.<br>Can\'t the hospitals reserve some space for emergencies and turn away<br>some that chose not to protect themselves?<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
