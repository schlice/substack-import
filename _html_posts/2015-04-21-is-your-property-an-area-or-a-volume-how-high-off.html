<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Your property is most definitely an area under the law.<br>You have few rights related to the \"airspace\" over your property.\<br>\<br>When it comes to privacy, current law relates to a person on the ground.<br>So if you have a 6 foot privacy fence around your yard, that would<br>constitute a reasonable expectation of privacy for your property.\<br>\<br>As you can infer, privacy laws are sketchy on the air over your house;<br>in most cases, anyone flying over your house can view your yard. This is<br>changing; drones are driving that argument. So laws related to that are<br>varied across the country.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
