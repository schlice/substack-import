<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>This doesn't need a complex answer.<br><br>As a philosophy, postmodernism rejects concepts of rationality,<br>objectivity, and universal truth. In other words, postmodernism says<br>"there is no universal (absolute) truth."<br><br>Except that the postmodernist makes one absolute truth statement:<br>postmodernism is true.<br><br>So if postmodernists, who believe that there is no absolute truth, must<br>resort to an absolute truth statement (postmodernism is true), then they<br>are hypocrites. But if you are skeptical about postmodernism, you are<br>self-defeating: **the more skeptical you are about the skepticism of<br>postmodernism, the more certain you become that absolute truth exists,<br>and postmodernism is false.**<br><br>So by both examples, either postmodernism is fatally flawed out the<br>gate, or postmodernists actually do believe in absolute truth. Either<br>way, the postmodernist idea that there is no universal truth is<br>analytically false.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
