<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [I\'m a little late to the party, but since I got the A2A,<br>I don\'t see how you can justify breaking your non-compete.\<br>\<br>First of all, the company just got acquired.\<br>\<br>Second, just because the company was hired by a company with a Colorado<br>headquarters says absolutely nothing about their legal ability to<br>maintain a drug-free workforce. Since the statute says that an<br>interstate company must be compliant with both Federal and state laws,<br>companies that do business in Colorado can still legally enforce a<br>drug-free workplace. Whether or not they do is also their business.\<br>\<br>However, whether or not they do has no bearing on the enforceability of<br>a non-compete clause. The two are completely separate provisions of<br>employment.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
