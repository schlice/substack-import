<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Trump says you have to take the children away.<br><br>Trump doesn't say this, the law does. The law says that you cannot<br>incarcerate a child (accompanied or unaccompanied) for more than 20<br>days. Congress can re-write this law if they choose, but the courts have<br>upheld the law. Trump is merely enforcing the law as it is written,<br>which is exactly what he was elected to do.<br><br>**In what other laws has the President not historically followed the<br>letter of the law?**<br><br>President Obama was famous for not following the letter of the law. He<br>used Executive Orders to direct Federal agencies to specifically *not*<br>follow the law. He called it many things, such as *prosecutorial<br>discretion*, which lawlessness is most certainly not prosecutorial<br>discretion. Discretion in enforcing laws does not mean writing<br>policy to selectively ignore enforcement. This is a terribly<br>disingenuous reading of the law, one which does not jibe with how law<br>should be enforced.<br><br>What President Trump is doing is both legal and correct. The Executive<br>merely enforces the laws given to it by Congress. The blame here lies<br>squarely on the shoulders of Congress. If they don't like the law as it<br>is written, they are perfectly free to re-write that law.<br><br>And as I understand it, an effort is currently underway in Congress to<br>do just that. But I'm going to predict something: Democrats will oppose<br>the change to the law! Yes, I know, the hypocrisy of it all. The very<br>same people who are railing against the fact that children are separated<br>from their parents will refuse to vote for the very law which would fix<br>the problem.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Because they care more about beating up the president than they do about<br>keeping illegal alien children with their parents. They'd rather<br>continue to use pictures of crying children to beat on the president<br>because they think it will gain them political points in the upcoming<br>elections.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
