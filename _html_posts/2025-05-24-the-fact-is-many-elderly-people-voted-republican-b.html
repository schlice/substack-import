<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>Ha! Those stupid elderly people fell for the scam! We're going to cut<br>ALL social programs and we're going to find the richest people in the<br>country, you know, all the big Republican fat cats and we're going to<br>give them *BEEEEEEELIONZ* of dollars of YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY while<br>you waste away to nothing because you don't have Social Security or<br>Medicare! You're going to die penniless and alone! *(with deep echo)*<br>*MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!*<br><br>So if you couldn't tell that was sarcasm, I've got a bridge in Brooklyn<br>to sell you.<br><br>Of course, the reality is that we're not eliminating either Social<br>Security or Medicare. The President ha publicly committed to keeping<br>both programs intact for those who need it. The White House has also<br>stated that they will not be raising the retirement age.<br><br>What they *will* be doing is *fixing* the programs, because<br>currently they are spending more than they are taking in. And you don't<br>need to be a math major to realize that if you spend more than you earn,<br>you're going to run out of money. And both Social Security and Medicare<br>are actually projected to run out of money, very soon. So those<br>programs must be fixed.<br><br>How?<br><br>- Social Security:<br>  - The focus has been placed on addressing waste and fraud within the<br>    program. Billions are estimated to be lost annually to fraud. A<br>    proposal to eliminate federal taxes on benefits for retirees was<br>    made. Some experts caution this could negatively impact the<br>    program\'s solvency.<br>  - Concerns exist about potential cuts to the Social Security<br>    Administration\'s workforce and office closures, which could affect<br>    access to benefits.<br>- Medicare:<br>  - Trump has stated he will protect Medicare and ensure seniors receive<br>    care without excessive costs.<br>  - Budgetary measures have been proposed to reduce the cost of<br>    Medicare but not benefits.<br>  - Some Republicans have supported Medicare Advantage, a private<br>    alternative.<br><br>While some unscrupulous sources link Trump to Project 2025, which<br>includes Medicare reforms, Trump and his campaign have publicly<br>denounced the program.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
