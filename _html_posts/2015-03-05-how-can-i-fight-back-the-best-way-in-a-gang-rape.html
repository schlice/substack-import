<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Keep fighting, never give up. Bite, kick, scream, spit,<br>pee (well, that one may not work entirely; people have odd fetishes) but<br>whatever you do, keep fighting. I like [[Jack<br>Elphinstone](https://www.quora.com/profile/Jack-Elphinstone)]{.qlink_container}\'s<br>suggestion of attacking the ringleader, but ultimately just keep<br>fighting; make it unpleasant for them to do what they are desiring to<br>do.\<br>\<br>Remember, it only takes seven pounds of pressure to remove the outer ear<br>from the head; rip it off from the top down really hard like you\'re<br>ripping a paper towel sheet off of the roll. Imagine what it would feel<br>like if you handed someone his ear. With a thumb appropriately<br>positioned at the inner corner of the eye, press in like you are digging<br>for the brain. Then bend your thumb. The eye will pop out and hang there<br>off the optic nerve. Tends to make people focus less on gang rape and<br>more on the fact that one of their eyes has popped out of its socket.\<br>\<br>But whatever you do, never stop saying no, and never stop<br>fighting]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
