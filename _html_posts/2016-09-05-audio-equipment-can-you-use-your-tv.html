<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>DVI is video only. Your TV has to have an audio input that matches (in<br>protocol) with an output on the laptop. So what you use is dependent on<br>what your laptop can send audio with.<br><br>Most laptops have a 3.5″ headphone jack. TVs usually accept 3.5″ in when<br>used in conjunction with a VGA port, the pair usually labeled<br>"Computer\" or similar.<br><br>If you hook up the DVI cable to the TV (if you have a DVI in), there<br>should be a similar digital audio input to match the digital video. You<br>may have an optical audio port input, but whether or not your laptop<br>provides an optical audio out is a toss-up.<br><br>If your laptop has an HDMI port, that would be easiest, as HDMI is a<br>single cable which passes digital audio and video.<br><br>Basically, it's an exercise in matching up laptop outputs with TV inputs<br>and seeing what will work.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
