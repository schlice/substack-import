<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>[[Paul<br>Mulwitz](https://www.quora.com/profile/Paul-Mulwitz)]{.qlink_container}<br>has it spot on. You\'re going to contact a local *recruiter* if you plan<br>on skipping college and enlisting. You\'re going to contact an *Air<br>Force ROTC admissions representative* if you plan on joining ROTC at<br>college and graduating as an officer. These are two separate career<br>routes. The first (talking to the local recruiter) will send you down<br>the enlisted career path. The second (joining ROTC in college) will send<br>you down the officer career path.<br><br>If you truly are looking at Air Force ROTC (by the way, great choice),<br>you should start by looking closely at [[the Air Force ROTC Official<br>Website](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=5abb82&url=http://www.afrotc.com){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="afrotc.com"}]{.qlink_container}. You will find all of the<br>information you will need, including the list of over 1100 colleges<br>which offer Air Force ROTC, scholarship information for an ROTC<br>scholarship, listings of ROTC admissions representatives who can help<br>you with all phases of your application process, and frequently asked<br>questions about everything from college life as an ROTC cadet to the<br>kinds of careers you can look forward to as an Air Force officer.<br><br>I would definitely start now (it\'s never too early to start) by<br>contacting your local ROTC admissions representative, whose contact<br>information you can find on the ROTC website.<br><br>For right now, get the best grades you can get, make sure you are<br>participating in a team sport (ideally, since that\'s the best way to<br>meet your fitness goals) or be following a well-documented workout<br>regimen, and be participating in extracurricular activities both in your<br>school and in your community. This will put you in the best position to<br>be ready to enter college and be successful as an Air Force ROTC cadet<br>and future Air Force officer.<br><br>Keep asking questions, and good luck!<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
