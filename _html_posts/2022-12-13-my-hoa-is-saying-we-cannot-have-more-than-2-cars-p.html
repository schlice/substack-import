<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>First of all, the answer is in your Governing Documents.<br><br>Secondly, the HOA cannot tell you how many cars you can *own*. But they<br>can tell you how many cars you can *park in the neighborhood*. Perhaps<br>you have small streets with little on-street parking. Whatever the<br>reason, if your Governing Documents allow the HOA to control how many<br>cars each household can park in the neighborhood, then it's legal.<br><br>Again, for reference, they are not telling you how many cars you can<br>*own*. They're simply telling you how many cars you can *park in the<br>neighborhood*.<br><br>Note that they usually do this by telling you how many cars can be<br>parked in your driveway, and that in order to fill your driveway with<br>cars, you must first fill your garage with cars. Note that it's not<br>telling you that you must *only* put cars in your garage. It's just<br>that if you're going to complain that there isn't enough room in your<br>driveway for all your cars, your garage must be full of cars before you<br>can make that claim.<br><br>\<br><br>And finally, as part of a very controversial topic, yes, the HOA can<br>tell you where and whether you can park your cars, even on a public<br>street. Now I know you may believe that the HOA cannot issue you a fine<br>for parking on a public street. If you're going to bounce into the<br>comments and yell at me and tell me that there is no way the HOA can<br>issue you a fine for parking on a public street, read this first.<br><br>- First, *all states and all HOAs are different.* Some states do not<br>  permit HOAs to fine homeowners for parking on pubic streets. ***BUT<br>  MOST DO***. And I can assure you, from personal experience as a Board<br>  member in two states: courts routinely rule these fines are valid.<br>- Second, ***the HOA is not giving you a state, county, city, or town<br>  parking ticket*. The HOA is giving you *a fine for violating HOA<br>  rules.* You can violate HOA rules anywhere** within the purview of<br>  the HOA: on a private driveway, in a designated parking space at the<br>  clubhouse, on private property or on HOA-owned property, and even on a<br>  public street inside the HOA. The HOA has broad statutory authority to<br>  enforce its rules within its *entire area of purview.* Clearly,<br>  this fine would not be reflected on your state driving record, because<br>  it's not a government parking violation. It's a violation of HOA rules<br>  only.<br><br>You are welcome to believe that the HOA does not have this authority.<br>You are, of course, welcome to test this theory at any time. Here's how<br>you must do it:<br><br>1.  Live in a community with an HOA whose Governing Documents contain a<br>    "no street parking" rule.<br>2.  Violate this rule. The only way you can challenge the legality of<br>    the rule is to become a victim of it. It's called *standing.*<br>3.  When you are fined, sue the HOA and make your claim that the rule in<br>    question violates state law because the HOA cannot fine you for<br>    parking on a public street.<br>4.  *Be prepared to lose.* I'm not saying you will lose, but you must be<br>    prepared to lose. That means you have to be prepared for what will<br>    happen if you do lose: you will owe not only your HOA fine (and any<br>    late fees), but you'll also owe attorney's fees and court costs.<br>    Depending on your state, you may also have to pay *the HOA's court<br>    fees and attorney's fees as well.*<br><br>I'm certain that some of you still want to go to the comments and tell<br>me that the HOA simply doesn't have that authority. Unless you are in a<br>position to test this theory yourself, please save it. None of us can<br>tell whether or not any particular Governing Documents in any particular<br>state has unlawful rules in them. The only way to determine if any<br>particular rule is lawful is to violate it and then challenge its<br>legality. I will delete any further comments regarding legality of<br>parking.<br><br>Let me give you an example. Let's say the HOA has a rule that you have<br>to bring your trash cans in within one day after trash is collected. But<br>your trash can is sitting near the curb on a public street. Can the HOA<br>fine you for having your can *in a public street?* Yes, of course they<br>can. *But it's not an HOA trash can, it's a city trash can, on a<br>city-owned street! The HOA can't fine me for leaving it on a city<br>street!* Well, yes they can, because you violated the HOA's rule.<br><br>Where and when the HOA tells you that you can have your cars is exactly<br>similar. Just because the city allows you to park on the street does not<br>mean that the HOA cannot be *more* restrictive.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
