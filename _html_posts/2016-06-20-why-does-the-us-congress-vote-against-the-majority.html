<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>*A majority (57%) want more strict gun laws. A large majority (89%) want<br>background checks on all gun purchases. A majority (57%) wants a ban on<br>assault weapons.*<br><br>Let's dissect these poll numbers, shall we?<br><br>Universal Background Checks<br><br>If you buy a gun from a gun dealer in the United States (a "gun dealer"<br>is someone who makes a living buying and selling guns), you are required<br>to get a background check. When the National Firearms Act was passed,<br>Congress wanted to make sure that the regulations were not overly<br>onerous on the general population. For example, if I own a gun and I<br>want to gift it to my grandson, would he need a background check? If I<br>own a gun and I want to sell it to my friend, would we need background<br>checks? To cover these scenarios, personal sales or transfers of<br>firearms were exempted from the requirement for background checks. After<br>all, only dealers have access to the NICS background check system. The<br>system is not designed to handle the volume of transactions that public<br>access would bring.<br><br>Therefore, to implement universal background checks, the ***entire NICS<br>system*** would have to be overhauled. You would have to allow<br>unfettered full access to NICS for anyone. You would have to build a<br>frontend web-based user interface that allowed you to query a Social<br>Security Number and generate a certificate that can be printed and<br>included with a firearms transfer. This would be a very costly change,<br>but could be made if there was enough political capital behind it.<br><br>But there simply isn't. Why? *With one exception, every mass shooter in<br>the United States over the last twenty years passed every background<br>check and purchased their firearms legally. Increasing background checks<br>would not have stopped any one.*<br><br>**TL;DR: Universal background checks wouldn't have prevented a single<br>mass shooting over the last 20 years.**<br><br>Assault Weapons<br><br>What is an "assault weapon?" Can you go into a gun store and go over to<br>the "assault weapons" section and browse their offerings? The short<br>answer is no, because "assault weapon" is a term largely created by the<br>media. The National Firearms Act does have a definition for "assault<br>weapon" though, and it is basically a weapon that fires more than one<br>round with one trigger pull. We also call them "automatic weapons." The<br>National Firearms Act has essentially banned public access to automatic<br>weapons.<br><br>Then why is there so much of a kerfuffle about "assault weapons?" To be<br>honest, I don't know.<br><br>Let me give you an example.<br><br>:::: ui_qtext_image_outer<br>::: qtext_image_wrapper<br>!(images/qimg-331a6e2fda8c22eca4296ec56abf0d05){.landscape<br>.qtext_image .zoomable_in_feed<br>master_src="images/qimg-331a6e2fda8c22eca4296ec56abf0d05" master_w="434"<br>master_h="262"}<br>:::<br>::::<br><br>Which one of these weapons is an assault weapon? If you answered B,<br>you just proved the point.<br><br>In actuality, *both of these weapons are identical.* They are both a<br>Ruger 10/22. They both fire .22 LR ammunition, and they both have a<br>10-round magazine capacity. The bullet moves at exactly the same speed.<br>The bottom rifle has a suppressor (which actually is already a regulated<br>item), a foregrip, a shrouded barrel, a collapsible stock, and a pistol<br>grip. According to legislation about "assault weapons," these are the<br>items which are restricted. **They are nothing more than "cosmetic"<br>items**. They don't affect the accuracy or the lethality of the bullet.<br><br>**TL;DR: When people in a survey want a ban on "assault weapons," they<br>simply don't know what they are asking for.**<br><br>So now to answer your question.<br><br>*If the majority want this, why isn't Congress listening to them?*<br><br>The majority could also want Congress to mandate laser-beam eyes in all<br>children born starting next year, and retrofitting all Americans within<br>10 years. That doesn't mean it's going to happen. Just asking people if<br>they want background checks in a survey isn't going to help anyone drive<br>public policy.<br><br>Americans want *something* to be done. The problem is that no one knows<br>what that something should be.<br><br>Intelligent Americans know that we need to address the problem, not the<br>symptom. The gun is a symptom. It is true that many killers will default<br>to a gun because they are easy to acquire, and since many of these<br>killers have "hidden" mental issues, they blend in to society and appear<br>like normal citizens. Omar Mateen had a government firearms license and<br>regularly worked with a firearm. He was a trustworthy person who, from<br>all appearances, finally just "snapped."<br><br>*How do you legislate that?*<br><br>The bottom line is: you can't. Congress knows this. They also know<br>that the gun owners of America are a very powerful voting bloc and they<br>are fully aware that taking away rights as enumerated in the Bill of<br>Rights does not sit well with Americans. No other country has a Bill of<br>Rights protecting rights guaranteed to all citizens of the country. This<br>is why people from outside of America find it so confusing that Congress<br>can't just "pass a law" and "make gun control." In Colorado, a magazine<br>restriction limiting capacity to 10 rounds caused the two state<br>representatives who wrote the bill to be recalled from office. When gun<br>owners get behind an issue, they can be a very powerful force.<br><br>The bottom line is that while polls may reflect feelings, the results of<br>polls cannot be directly translated into legislation.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
