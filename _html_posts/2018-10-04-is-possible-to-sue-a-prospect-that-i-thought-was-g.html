<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is possible to sue a prospect that I thought was going to be a client?<br>We\'d converse with email or phone they\'d ask questions and red lines<br>to my contract, stringing me along. The client took my free advice and<br>pursued the negotiations on their own.**<br><br>Unless you have a written contract with the prospect, there is no<br>expectation that they are going to become a client, and there's no<br>requirement that they keep any advice to themselves.<br><br>Maybe you should give out less free advice, and wait until they become a<br>client.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
