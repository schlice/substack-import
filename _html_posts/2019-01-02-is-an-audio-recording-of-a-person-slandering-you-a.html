<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>**Is an audio recording of a person slandering you admissible in a court<br>of law if you decide to sue them?**<br><br>The answer is "it depends."<br><br>It depends on how you got the recording, and in which state the<br>recording was made. In all states, at least one party to the<br>conversation needs to have known that the conversation was being<br>recorded. In some states, both parties to the conversation need to have<br>known that the conversation was being recorded (these are called<br>"two-party consent states"). So depending on how the recording was made<br>and whether or not your state is a two party consent state will<br>determine whether or not the recording can be introduced as evidence in<br>a civil proceeding.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
