<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>I can answer half of your question: I don't know enough about land use<br>theory and its application to rural and suburban crime, but I know about<br>the broken windows theory. This theory spawned the "Compstat" initiative<br>in New York City, and when it spread across the nation, resulted in the<br>longest and largest decline in felony crime in this nation's history ---<br>well over two decades of decline.<br><br>Brittanica has this definition of "broken windows theory" which was<br>originally written by James Q. Wilson and George Kelling in 1982. They<br>start by examining traditional crime prevention methods, which focus the<br>most resources on the most serious crimes.<br><br>> Wilson and Kelling took a different view. They saw serious crime as<br>> the final result of a lengthier chain of events, theorizing that crime<br>> emanated from disorder and that if disorder were eliminated, then<br>> serious crimes would not occur.<br>><br>> Their theory further posits that the prevalence of disorder creates<br>> fear in the minds of citizens who are convinced that the area is<br>> unsafe. This withdrawal from the community weakens social controls<br>> that previously kept criminals in check. Once this process begins, it<br>> feeds itself. Disorder causes crime, and crime causes further disorder<br>> and crime.\[1\](#PqaNF){#cite-PqaNF .citation_link}<br><br>The "broken windows theory" was directly tested in an urban setting by<br>Police Commissioner William Bratton in the 90's in New York City.<br><br>Between 1990 and 1992, when Bratton was chief of the New York City<br>Transit Police, he implemented "broken windows theory" policing in the<br>city subways. He stationed plainclothes transit officers at turnstiles<br>to catch turnstile jumpers. As arrests for misdemeanors went up, subway<br>crimes of all kinds decreased dramatically.<br><br>In 1994, Bratton was promoted to Police Commissioner, and applied the<br>same theory which worked so well in the subway to the entire department,<br>calling it the "quality of life initiative." He began cracking down on<br>panhandling, unsolicited windshield washing, D&D (drunk and disorderly),<br>and prostitution. When he retired in 1996, homicide was down 50%, and<br>felonies in general were down almost 40%.<br><br>Bratton's system, which tracks smaller crimes to reduce bigger ones, is<br>called "Computer Statistics," or "Compstat." Compstat was so successful<br>in New York City that it has been exported and employed in police<br>departments across the country, and has resulted in the longest and<br>largest decline of serious crime in this nation's history. Before<br>Bratton started his program in 1993, there were 1946 murders in New York<br>City. In 2015, there were 352.<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>\[1\](#cite-PqaNF){.citation_index} [[broken windows theory \|<br>academic<br>theory](https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=ac8865&url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/broken-windows-theory){.external_link<br>rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"<br>onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);"<br>qt-tooltip="britannica.com"}]{.qlink_container}<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
