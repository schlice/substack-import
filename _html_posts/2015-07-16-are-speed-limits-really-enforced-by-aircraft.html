<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [As someone who received a ticket by one of these methods<br>in 1993, I can tell you that they actually do clock cars using propeller<br>planes. You pass a line of patrol vehicles on the side of the road (not<br>running radar), and the first one in line peels off and stops you. They<br>inform you the speed that the aircraft timed you at, and issue you a<br>ticket.\<br>\<br>There are two indicator lines painted at a specific distance (i.e.<br>1/10th of a mile, or 528 feet) between them, on the side of the highway.<br>The officer in the airplane watches you cross each line and times you as<br>you cross. He then calculates your speed and relays it down to the<br>officer on the road.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
