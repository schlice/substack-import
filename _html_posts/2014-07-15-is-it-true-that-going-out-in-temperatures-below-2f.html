<br/><br/>Answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content: [The thymus gland is not in the throat. It is in the chest<br/>cavity. While it is possible for an enlarged thymus to cause breathing<br/>problems, it is highly unlikely that the people in the \"medical news\"<br/>articles from 1926 actually died from acute thymus swelling. They most<br/>likely died from something else that was unknown to medical science at<br/>the time.]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Content language: English<br/><br/><br/>
