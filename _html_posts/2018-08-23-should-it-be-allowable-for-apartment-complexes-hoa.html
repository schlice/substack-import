HOAs have broad control over how they run the areas within<br>their purview.<br><br>If there is a valid reason which furthers the goal of an HOA (to<br>safeguard all residents and keep home values as high as possible), then<br>they should absolutely be allowed to control the breeds and sizes of<br>dogs which live in the community, along with total numbers of dogs you<br>should be allowed to keep on your property.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
