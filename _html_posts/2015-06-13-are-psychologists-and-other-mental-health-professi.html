<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: [Yes, communications between all healthcare professionals<br>and their patients are covered by \"doctor-patient privilege.\"\<br>\<br>The point at which that privilege no longer applies is when the<br>professional learns that the patient may be a danger to himself or to<br>others. At this point, the exact opposite becomes the case: the<br>professional now has a *professional obligation* to contact law<br>enforcement and/or ensure the patient is delivered safely to a hospital<br>inpatient setting for emergency mental health<br>intervention.]<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
