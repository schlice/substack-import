<br><br><h2>Answer</h2><br><div><br><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content: <br><br>The Bill of Rights only limits the government. It does not limit the<br>people. The Bill of Rights tells government what actions it is not able<br>to take. It doesn't affect people's rights.<br><br>It also doesn't grant (or limit) rights. It only indicates rights people<br>already had which government cannot limit.<br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br><br></div><br><br><div><br><br>Content language: English<br><br></div><br>
